Father, I need to use the restroom.

3
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,370
I'm...

4
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,079
moving to Seoul...

5
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,040
with Hwang Hee Tae.

6
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,879
I heard.

7
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:26,750
You're smiling?

8
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:29,060
Kim Myeong Hee.

9
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,319
How can you...

10
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,560
smile at me right now?

11
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,659
Soo Ryeon.

12
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,540
You must have a lot on your mind...

13
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,379
now that you're actually leaving.

14
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,980
No.

15
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,790
Soo Ryeon,
you remind me of myself...

16
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,090
when I was young.

17
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,629
If you let fear rule your life,

18
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,900
you'll be daunted
by more and more things...

19
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,400
to the point
that you can't do anything.

20
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,139
And if that happens,
you'll become even more fearful.

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,139
don't get dragged into trouble.
Go straight home.

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,469
Okay.

25
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,780
You must've been uncomfortable
because of me.

26
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,449
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,449
No, not at all.

28
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,780
Take good care of Soo Ryeon.

29
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,650
I will.

30
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,859
Goodness. I'm not on the verge
of dying or something.

31
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,860
What's with the faces?

32
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,629
Soo Ryeon.

33
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,460
Are you sure you'll be okay?

34
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,500
Yes, of course!

35
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,900
Your troublemaker daughter
won't be around anymore,

36
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,469
so take care of your health, Father.

37
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,060
Well...

38
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:48,360
I don't want to make you cringe,
so let's skip the hug.

39
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,900
I'll get going now.

40
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,669

41
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:00,939

Hee Tae!

46
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,989
He had to go back to Seoul
because he lives there.

47
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,930
Did you think
he'd live here forever?

48
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:00,300
Good grief. You're being ridiculous.

49
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,670
Are you sure
you don't want to head out with me?

50
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,769
I told you I'm not in the mood
to go anywhere!

51
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,079
What do you mean?
Get ready for school!

52
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,909
You're not even in your uniform yet!

53
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,879
- No!
- Get moving!

54
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,720
You probably won't cry like that
when I die!

55
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,529
Oh, dear. She's crying
as if we lost our country again.

56
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,629
Myeong Hee, are you...

57
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,410
Hey, Myeong Hee. What are you doing?

58
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,009
Why are you washing the sheets
first thing in the morning?

59
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:46,578
What's up?

60
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,148
Oh, I have to visit my hometown
for a few days...

61
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,419
to take care of something.

62
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,789
Then leave your sheets out.
I'll wash them for you.

63
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,959
What? Oh, okay. Thanks.

64
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,528

while I'm gone...

Did you clean this whole room

you can order.

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,620
I'm not sure about that either.

168
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,229
May I ask who you are?

169
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,710
What's your relationship
with Hee Tae?

170
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,629
I'm not sure.

171
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:55,169
I'll call back next time.

172
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,620
Where have you been all day,
you slacker?

173
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,750
Something came up at home.

174
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,360
Your family seems awfully busy
all the time.

175
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:15,289
The National Sports Festival
is less than a month away.

176
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,600
My brother went to Seoul today.

177
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Hee Tae?

178
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,309
With my sister?

179
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,309
No. With his fiancee.

180
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,210
Then...

181
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,919
what about my sister?

182
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,419
He won't come to Gwangju anymore.

183
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,529
So they really did fight.

184
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,879
Gosh, you made this on your own?

185
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:07,850
You should've woke me up.

186
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:10,320
I can do the dishes.

187
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,080
It's okay, I'll do it.

188
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,889
I have some business outside.
What about you?

189
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,230
Me?

190
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,490
I don't know.

191
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,139
I'll try to come back
as soon as possible.

192
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,399
You should do...

193
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,840
what you have to do too.

194
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,840
Okay, I will.

195
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,850
Let's eat.

196
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,980
There's nothing left to do.

197
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,909
I'll call you later. Okay.

198
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,678
Send this
to the judicial scrivener...

199
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,319
and this to the accountant.

200
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,449
What about the papers
from the Medicines Agency?

201
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,960
Oh, here.

202
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,219
By the way,
the site manager asked...

203
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,029
if you can visit the site today.

204
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,330
I need to go to the office today.

205
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,929
Then tell him I'll drop by
sometime tomorrow morning...

206
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,929
I thought I made it clear...

207
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,029
that I refuse to accept
a joint management.

208
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,529
I'm just trying to help.

209
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,139
The situation has changed
since last time.

210
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,798
Will you be able to handle
Changhwa Pharmaceuticals...

211
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,139
on top of Changhwa Industrial...

212
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,509
on your own?

213
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,580
If I need your help,

214
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,179
I'll ask you myself.

215
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,580
Must I make you ask for my help?

216
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,059
What about the favor
Soo Ryeon asked of you?

217
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,629
Oh, that.

218
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,070
Do you mean
her friend going abroad to study?

219
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,440
I don't think it's time for you
to be concerned about a girl.

220
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,340
How can I trust and follow you...

221
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,850
if you can't keep a promise
about one girl?

222
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,479
Well, the thing is,

223
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,288
it's actually not
such a simple matter.

224
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,490
Then is a joint management
a simple matter?

225
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,400
Trust is developed...

226
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,970
only when both sides
can put their faith in each other.

227
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,599
But it seems to me...

228
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,480
you're just trying
to force me to put my faith in you.

229
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,250
Gosh, I'm starving to death.

230
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,690
Look at how skinny my tummy looks.

231
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:41,329
I hope we can eat meat today.

232
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,130
My gosh.

233
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,930
Why are you looking at my tummy
and mentioning meat?

234
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:47,700
Myeong Soo!

235
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,740
What? Myeong Hee!

236
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,539
Ta-da.

237
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,719
Here. Take some to your coach first.

238
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,890
You go. My sister brought it.

239
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,589
Little bear.

240
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,959
Hurry up and eat some
before Myeong Soo comes back.

241
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

242
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,109
Here, Jung Tae. Go ahead and dig in.

243
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,549
You should eat a lot
if you want to grow taller.

244
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,119
Come on.

245
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,699
Come on.
How could you start without me?

246
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,769
Too bad. Come here and dig in.

247
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,269
Gosh, this is so good.

248
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,009
You didn't have to see me out.
You should get ready for training.

249
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,150
You brought fried chicken
as you promised.

250
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,410
This is the least I can do.

251
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,619
Goodness.

252
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,160
My gosh, little bear.
Look at all this oil on your mouth.

253
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,599
Why did you and Hee Tae break up?

254
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,369
What are you talking about?

255
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,470
How could we break up
when we're just friends?

256
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,410
Come on. I even brought you chicken.
What are you pouting for?

257
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,980
I was hoping
you and Hee Tae would get married.

258
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,788
What? Get married?

259
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,160
Marriage is stronger
than engagement.

260
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:53,859
Plus, if you got married,
you wouldn't go abroad.

261
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:04,640
All right.

262
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,700
Maybe I should give up on it,
after all.

263
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,640
Give up on what?

264
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,940
Studying abroad.

265
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,249
Since my little bear
hates the idea so much,

266
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,048
I should probably forget about it.

267
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,019
You're teasing me, right?

268
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,319
I'm serious.

269
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,118
Maybe I should just
go and watch you compete...

270
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,890
in the Sports Festival.

271
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,960
When is it again?

272
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,159
Are you sure
you're not fooling with me?

273
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,859
Are you really not going
to study abroad?

274
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,299
Seriously?

275
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:33,700
Goodness.

276
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,439
"Consequently, the student council
held an emergency meeting,"

277
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,608
"where they had a heated discussion
for an hour and a half..."

278
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,289
"before coming to the decision
to disband."

279
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,348
"They also persuaded
the student demonstrators..."

280
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,680
"around Seoul Station to disperse
and go back to school."

281
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,920
Gosh, those darn cowards in Seoul.

282
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,818
What a way to lose momentum.

283
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:58,618
If they've backed down in Seoul,

284
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,829
will all our efforts go up in smoke?

285
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,759
Nothing's changed in Gwangju.

286
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,400
Kwan Hyun...

287
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,339
finished talking to
the police commissioner.

288
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,410
The police will cooperate...

289
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,210
with today's torch protest.

290
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,719
I'm sure more citizens
will be participating today.

291
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,149
Let's hurry up and get prepared.

292
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,519
- Yes.
- Yes.

293
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,189
(Guarantee workers' rights!)

294
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,559
(Release all prisoners
of conscience!)

295
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,788
(End the martial law!)

296
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:36,089
Goodness gracious.

297
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,529
Just smash it all, why don't you?

298
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,140
What is it?
Are you angry about Seoul?

299
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,410
Do you know that
Lee Soo Ryeon is in Seoul now?

300
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,440
She's in Seoul?

301
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,650
Did she protest
at Seoul Station yesterday?

302
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,078
It's not to protest,

303
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,650
but to get married to your friend,
Hwang Hee Tae.

304
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,319
What? Who said that?

305
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,930
There are no secrets
in this small town.

306
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,829
So she didn't even tell you?

307
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,440
What about Myeong Hee?

308
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,608
After being so harsh to Myeong Hee
and taking Soo Ryeon's side,

309
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,480
are you worried about her now?

310
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,680
I don't know. I can't reach her.

311
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,250
I'm sure she's pretending
to be fine somewhere.

312
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,499
I'm sorry, Myeong Hee.
Have you been waiting long?

313
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,240
Not at all. I just got here.

314
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,808
I'm the one who asked to meet,

315
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,539
but I couldn't get here on time
because something came up.

316
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,839
I'll have the same as her.

317
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,609
My gosh,
why are you in such a hurry?

318
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,619
- Catch your breath first.
- Thanks.

319
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:17,099
So? Why did you want to see me?

320
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,058
Myeong Hee,

321
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:21,499
your passport application
is being processed again.

322
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,670
My friend at Foreign Affairs
just confirmed it.

323
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,809
You don't have to worry
about my departure anymore.

324
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,808
I won't be able to leave
this year anyway.

325
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,680
Actually, I asked around a bit.

326
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,518
There are other ways besides
the Catholic Foundation scholarship.

327
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,449
These are not
the only options either.

328
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,890
It's fine.

329
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,518
Even if I get a passport,
I still have to wait for my visa.

330
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,219
If you don't want to go abroad,
you could study in Korea.

331
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,889
I'll support you.

332
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,058
Starting with preparations
for the exam...

333
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:51,660
Soo Chan.

334
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,329
I'm really fine.

335
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,069
I'm not.

336
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,650
I was being nosy and...

337
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,720
Because of me, you...

338
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,429
Come on.
How many times must I tell you?

339
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,629
It's not your fault.

340
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,099
If you keep trying to help me,
I'll only feel worse.

341
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:31,799
Myeong Hee.

342
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,140
Can't you just...

343
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,579
let me help you?

344
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:47,990
I can't stand this.

345
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,859
I'm doing this for my own good.

346
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,759
So can't you please let me help you?

347
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,710
You've already given me enough.

348
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,609
Even if you give me more,
my hands are already full.

349
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,119
Trust me, I'm really fine.

350
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,150
Don't worry about me.

351
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,259
We're good to go!

352
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,449
To Hyehwa-dong, please.

353
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,420
- It's a warm, sunny May day.
- Sure.

354
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,818
As we get started,

355
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:30,720
here is a song
you might want to share...

356
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,529
with someone as sweet as sunshine.

357
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,180
Wait. I requested this song.

358
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,650
I have no regrets.

359
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:57,619
But it's not like there's no pain
just because we don't regret things.

360
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:02,220
Even if we don't seem strong
or happy,

361
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:05,289
I hope
we can show each other everything.

362
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,598
I can sing for you sometime.

363
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,240
Can we meet again
before the flowers wither?

364
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,769
Then I'd love to.

365
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:23,680
Myeong Hee.

366
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,609
Do you want to go out with me
just until the end of May?

367
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,990
I'm not okay.

368
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,599
I don't want this May
to pass by without you.

369
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,940
Welcome.

370
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:43,119
("Troubling Political Situations
Due to Protests")

371
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,499
More than 100,000
took to the streets.

372
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,129
How could they tell us
to go back to school?

373
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,470
What is the council even thinking?

374
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,709
They don't want to give
the government an excuse.

375
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,640
They actually brought armored cars.

376
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,039
Weren't you scared?

377
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,480
To be honest, I was relieved
when we were told to disperse.

378
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,420
I didn't say I wasn't scared.

379
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,649
But no matter how scared we are,
there are things to get done.

380
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,588
- They must get done.
- Right?

381
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:16,720
Don't you agree?

382
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,059
Guys.

383
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,299
Hold on. Lee Soo Ryeon?
Soo Ryeon, is that you?

384
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,309
Sang Min?

385
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,509
My gosh, it really is you.
I can't believe it.

386
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,579
Did you come here for
the Seoul Station protest yesterday?

387
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,849
- What?
- All the way from Gwangju?

388
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:52,589
If only there was someone like her
on the student council.

389
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,390
Right, guys?

390
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,028
Are you here alone?

391
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,929
Come and sit with us. Come here.

392
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,798
No, thanks. I...

393
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,869
What is it?

394
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,670
Are you waiting for someone?

395
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,009
Hey, by any chance,
did Won Seok come here with you?

396
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,589
Sang Min, I'm sorry.

397
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,390
What?

398
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,329
(Honam Building)

399
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,240
Hey! Do you have a death wish?

400
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:41,740
Get out of the way!

401
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,890
You're home late.

402
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,558
I have to step out for a minute.

403
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,230
Where are you going?

404
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,929
I have something to do.

405
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,900
What is it that you have to do?

406
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,399
It's a personal matter.
See you later.

407
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,769
Hwang Hee Tae.

408
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:17,940
Are you doing this to punish me?

409
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,509
What?

410
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,609
I know you are.

411
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,380
You blame me for everything.

412
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:27,419
That's why you're ignoring
and avoiding me...

413
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,950
to make me feel uncomfortable.

414
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:34,288
Let's talk when I get back.

415
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:35,460
Why?

416
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,400
Am I not even worth
fighting anymore?

417
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,329
Just hit me or something.

418
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:43,699
Be sarcastic, yell at me,
or get angry like you used to.

419
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,799
Then what?

420
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:49,140
What difference does it make?

421
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:54,180
What difference does it make?

422
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,319
What difference does it make?

423
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,519
Then what about this?

424
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,689
If you keep avoiding me like this...

425
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,818
and pretend I don't exist,
what difference does that make?

426
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:09,829
- I never avoided...
- You don't have to do this!

427
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:13,130
I know too.

428
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,900
I know everything is my fault.

429
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,098
I'm responsible for what happened...

430
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:21,239
to both Myeong Hee and you.
I know it so well...

431
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,039
that it's driving me crazy!

432
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:25,139
- So just insult me.
- Soo Ryeon.

433
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,548
Blame me. Get angry with me!

434
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:28,710
Soo Ryeon!

435
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,019
I've never blamed you for anything.

436
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,759
Ever.

437
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,099
Okay?

438
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,180
Let's go.

439
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,549
I have someone to introduce to you.

440
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:18,529
So she was the leader
of the labor union strike?

441
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,869
I didn't know you were so famous,

442
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:23,900
Seok Chul.

443
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:29,309
So the reason you came to Gwangju
in the first place...

444
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,009
and went on that blind date was...

445
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,980
Yes.

446
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,650
She's being transferred tomorrow.

447
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,719
With the ambulance and everything,

448
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,619
there are many arrangements to make.

449
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,130
Ms. Jang Seok Chul's guardian?

450
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:53,359
Stay here. I'll go sign some papers.

451
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,550
It looks like a child's hand, right?

452
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:17,759
Her hands are so thin...

453
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,920
that I sometimes have trouble
sticking needles in them.

454
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:24,630
I can't believe such a petite woman
got up to something so huge.

455
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,899
The world is never going to change.

456
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,530
She sacrificed herself for nothing.

457
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,499
She should've known
how scary the world is.

458
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,469
I'm sure she was scared.

459
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,670
Pardon?

460
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,949
That's why what she did is...

461
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,219
even more remarkable.

462
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,880
She did what needed to be done...

463
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,219
even though she was scared.

464
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,468
End the martial law!

465
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:08,069
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

466
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,609
Release the arrested students!

467
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,109
- Release the arrested students!
- Release the arrested students!

468
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,678
Guarantee farmers' rights!

469
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,349
- Guarantee farmers' rights!
- Guarantee farmers' rights!

470
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,249
Hey, there! Hold the torch up!

471
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,289
You'll burn the man's hair.

472
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,658
Yushin remnants, step down!

473
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:28,158
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

474
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,699
- Until Mount Baekdu is worn away
- Until Mount Baekdu is worn away

475
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,099
- And the East Sea runs dry
- And the East Sea runs dry

476
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:42,908
The rally is supposed to end today.

477
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:46,079
But to prevent it from recurring,
the leaders should be...

478
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,079
Not yet.

479
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,889
Hello, Defense Security Command.

480
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:00,460
Salute.

481
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:04,599
I'll be on my way immediately.

482
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,345
I've been urgently summoned
to the headquarters.

483
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,639
Stand by until I get back
from Seoul.

484
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:18,809
Hey.

485
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,309
Hey, Hwang Hee Tae.

486
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,579
Hey!

487
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:27,719
What is it?

488
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,690
Wake up.

489
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,690
There's a place I want to go to.

490
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,828
Goodness. I thought...

491
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,929
you wanted to go to some cool place.

492
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,129
You country bumpkins
are so predictable.

493
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,729
You all want to check out
the palaces,

494
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,170
Myeong-dong, Deoksu Palace...
My goodness.

495
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,869
Look at you talking
as if you're not a country bumpkin.

496
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,579
I never said that.

497
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,679
I'm actually enjoying this,
and that proves...

498
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,010
I'm still a country bumpkin
after all.

499
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,349
Hey, Country Bumpkin.

500
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,989
What?

501
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:08,530
You should go...

502
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,760
back to Gwangju with Seok Chul.

503
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,909
I can't go back
until my father says that I can.

504
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:23,639
What's the real reason?
Your father...

505
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,380
or Myeong Hee?

506
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,249
Let's head back home.

507
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,789
If it's because...

508
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:38,590
you're afraid
Myeong Hee would be hurt,

509
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,559
just go back to Gwangju.

510
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:44,599
I said I won't.

511
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,769
Hey, Hwang Hee Tae!

512
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:54,869
She said she's scared.

513
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:57,909
Myeong Hee is scared of me.

514
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,449
Are you dumb?

515
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:08,219
Do you actually believe that?

516
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,190
Myeong Hee is...

517
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,829
She's not scared of you.

518
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,800
She doesn't want you to get hurt.

519
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,460
She said
that's what she's most afraid of.

520
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,539
What?

521
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,170
Your father is what?

522
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,440
What do you mean?

523
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,039
That's why I wanted to...

524
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,150
apologize to you...

525
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,719
before you left.

526
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:41,820
I guess we were
on the same wavelength.

527
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,019
Why should you...

528
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,489
apologize to me?

529
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,059
You know, that incident years ago.

530
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,469
I blamed you.

531
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,769
I'm sorry.

532
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,639
It wasn't your fault at all.

533
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,469
I guess I needed someone to blame.

534
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:13,280
Your friend here is such a loser.

535
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,019
Right?

536
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,090
What about Hwang Hee Tae?

537
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,190
Does he know about all this?

538
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,860
Did you tell him?

539
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,500
Myeong Hee!

540
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,070
- Will you suffer alone again...
- Soo Ryeon.

541
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,369
If I stay with him,

542
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,010
both of our lives will be destroyed.

543
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,079
And if that happens,
he'll think it's all his fault,

544
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,150
just like you beat yourself up
for what happened to me.

545
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:02,929
So...

546
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:07,710
you tell him on my behalf...

547
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,809
that he doesn't have it in him
to destroy anyone.

548
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,590
So?

549
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:25,619
Are you afraid
Myeong Hee would ruin your life?

550
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,960
No, right?

551
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,199
She feels the same way.

552
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,469
So you're both okay with it.
Then what's the problem?

553
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,039
No.

554
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,239
Myeong Hee will be hurt in the end.

555
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:55,989
Seriously.

556
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,190
You guys are two peas in a pod.

557
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,730
Fine, you decide
whether you'll go back or not.

558
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:06,800
I'll be on my way now.

559
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,969
Let's part ways here.

560
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,469
They say couples always break up...

561
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,140
if they walk along the Deoksu Palace
stonewall together.

562
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:18,010
Hwang Hee Tae.

563
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:23,309
Let's please not get dragged
into each other's lives again...

564
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,480
and just wish each other
all the best. Okay?

565
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,170
(Hansaeng Hospital)

566
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,099
Shouldn't you go to Gwangju anyway
to oversee everything?

567
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,738
Just go with us.

568
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,539
We can take one guardian
in the ambulance.

569
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:02,289
(May 17, 1980,
Guardian, Hwang Hee Tae)

570
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,419
No, I'm not going.

571
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,659
Well, all right then.

572
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,400
I'll call you
when we arrive in Gwangju.

573
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:14,098
- Please take good care of her.
- No problem.

574
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,539
(Hansaeng Hospital)

575
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,050
Did she really say
she's no longer going abroad?

576
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,849
Maybe it's just something she said.

577
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:38,019
Did she seem okay?

578
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,059
All right.

579
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,360
Okay, good luck with the training.

580
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,599
Bye.

581
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,440
Gosh, you scared me!

582
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:54,639
Did you have to creep up on me
like that?

583
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:56,769
What did you just say?

584
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,079
What?

585
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,079
What did you say? Going abroad?

586
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,090
She worked very hard for years
to prepare for it.

587
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,619
I heard she got accepted
to the school this time.

588
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:14,630
But the last time she was here,

589
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:18,159
she seemed distraught,
so I'm thinking maybe...

590
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,929
(Account Number, Balance)

591
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,750
Gosh, when did this happen?

that you've received the patient.

Father.

601
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,429
Hey, Myeong Hee.

602
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,130
I'm sorry I keep changing my mind.

603
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:06,900
I know you suggested it
to help me out.

604
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,010
Don't worry about it.

605
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:11,715
The scholarship program chooses
new recipients every year.

606
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:13,409
You can apply again next year.

607
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,980
No.

608
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:18,219
I've decided against...

609
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,119
studying abroad.

610
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:23,849
Did something happen?

611
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,860
Nothing happened.

612
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:31,699
I just don't want to go anymore.

613
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:36,030
My little brother is
still very young.

614
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,199
And going abroad won't solve
all my problems.

615
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,210
After causing all the fuss...

616
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,139
I'm sorry.

617
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,650
I'm actually happy for you.

618
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,250
Pardon me?

619
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,420
Why did you want to study abroad?

620
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,189
You said you had no reason
to stay in this country...

621
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,630
because nothing
was keeping you here.

622
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:02,090
I'm assuming you changed your mind
and decided to stay...

623
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,760
because you found a reason to stay.
Am I wrong?

624
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,710
I did find...

625
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,579
one reason,

626
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,150
but it's gone now.

627
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,719
I can't even leave now,

628
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,860
but it's gone.

629
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,000
It's okay.

630
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:49,239
Whether you go abroad or not,

631
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,380
if a door closes,
another one always opens.

632
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,750
What if it doesn't?

633
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,690
I've lived my whole life...

634
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:05,460
behind closed doors.

635
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,489
Even now,

636
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:12,098
it feels like every door
around me is closed,

637
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:13,959
and I can't sleep...

638
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,570
or even breathe.

639
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,920
It may seem dark at first,

640
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,219
but a door will open soon.

641
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,320
It will open for sure.

642
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:41,429
Myeong Hee.

643
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,230
I promise.

644
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,610
No.

645
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,889
I know.

646
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,960
I already heard why...

647
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,730
you had no choice but to say no.

648
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,940
I know I shouldn't have come.

649
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:05,010
Whenever I think of you,

650
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,750
I know...

651
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:13,019
that I'll eventually cause you pain.

652
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:22,190
But I want to be with you...

653
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,199
and stay by your side.

654
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:39,780
Can I come closer, Myeong Hee?

655
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:38,369
Hello?

656
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,570
Hey, Hye Gun.
It's me, Lee Soo Ryeon.

657
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,210
Hey, Soo Ryeon. What...

658
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,610
I heard your photo studio
is a hideout for runaways.

659
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:52,280
Do you have room for me too?

660
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,639
It's broken.

661
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:48,099
It's no use trying to tweak it.

662
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,440
Hold on.

663
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,150
I'm almost done.

664
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:12,460
Recently, Korea's second...

665
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,739
You could open up
an electronics store...

666
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:26,210
in the mountains someday.

667
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:29,650
An electronics store?
That sounds nice.

668
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,348
My dream was to become
an engineering professor...

669
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:36,349
until my mother fell ill.

670
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:39,058
Then you should get
a doctorate degree...

671
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,590
before you open
an electronics store.

672
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,230
Whether I open an electronics store,
work at a construction site,

673
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:51,570
or stow away on a ship in Busan,

674
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,739
I'm fine with anything...

675
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,110
as long as I'm with you.

676
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,920
When I was a kid,

677
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,230
I liked turning the dial
like this...

678
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:18,059
more than listening to the radio.

679
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,699
Whenever I turned the dial
slowly like this,

680
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:25,299
I sometimes heard...

681
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,309
a faint signal
that sounded unfamiliar.

682
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,710
That signal seemed...

683
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,210
like me.

684
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,820
A signal that no one listened to...

685
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:47,590
and floated around aimlessly
in the universe...

686
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,630
with no sound or color.

687
00:54:02,469 --> 00:54:05,210
Until you found me like this.

688
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,280
Me too.

689
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:16,750
Before I met you,

690
00:54:17,949 --> 00:54:19,719
I couldn't hear anything.

691
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,480
You really...

692
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:48,590
don't have to be scared
of anything anymore.

693
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:03,530
Hey.

694
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,530
Maybe your friend died.

695
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,868
He should've already answered
by now.

696
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:11,599
But someone else answered yesterday.

697
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,510
Just hang up
and call him again tomorrow.

698
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,900
It's time.

699
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,500
Round them all up.

700
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:43,499
As of 24:00 on May 17, 1980,

701
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,069
the emergency martial law
is in effect...

702
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,570
throughout the country.

703
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,339
Considering the recent movements
of North Korea...

704
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,379
and the ongoing disturbances
in all parts of the country,

705
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,979
the entire nation is deemed
to be in an emergency state.

706
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,479
On these grounds,
it has been decided...

707
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,689
that the emergency martial law
is in effect nationwide...

708
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,989
starting 24:00, May 17, 1980.

709
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:15,369
Hye Gun.

710
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,940
What?

711
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:27,539
(Youth of May)

712
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,388
Why are you doing this?

713
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:43,750
Drag them all off!

714
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,089
He made you start a rebellion,
didn't he?

715
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,988
You promised you'd leave with me
in the morning.

716
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:50,328
Are you saying
we should leave in this situation?

717
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:51,459
Leaving my patients behind?

718
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,759
Yes, let's just leave.

719
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,058
Even if you throw yourself
into that mayhem,

720
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:56,229
nothing's going to change.

721
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,968
There are things I can do.

722
00:58:57,969 --> 00:58:59,169
"Stabbed by a bayonet?"

723
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,669
There are patients waiting outside.

724
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,209
This is a neurosurgery case.
Call the surgeon.

725
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,308
- Hee Tae!
- Please call someone!

726
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:06,710
Jin A, please. Please come back.
