Hey! Can you go see what's in there?

3
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:38,070
My goodness.

4
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:40,769
What if we find
some prehistoric artifacts?

5
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:54,150
What the... What is this?

6
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:55,690
Gosh!

7
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:57,860

8
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,629

(Unidentified Skeleton Found
at a Construction Site)

10
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,348
The police are investigating
an unidentified skeleton...

11
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,090
found at a construction site
in Gwangju this morning.

12
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:30,219
The police have sent the skeleton...

13
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,689
to the National Forensic Service...

14
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,289
for DNA analysis
in order to identify the victim.

15
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,559
The construction workers
at the site have stated...

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,969
that they found the skeleton
at about 1m below the ground...

17
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,829
while digging the ground
with an excavator at around 10 a.m.

18
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,538
They called the police right away,

19
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:47,409
and the police have sent
the skeleton to the NFS.

20
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:50,378
Those in the political circles
are saying...

21
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,079
the skeleton may belong...

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,549
to one of the victims
of the Gwangju Uprising...

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,549
and that the blood sample may need
to be compared with the families...

24
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,349
of those who disappeared
during the Gwangju Uprising.

25
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,859
Meanwhile, the NFS is expecting
it will take a while...

26
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,359
for the analysis results
to be available...

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,029
since it will be difficult
to determine the cause of death...

28
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,059
and identify the victim
as there are very few leads...

29
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,030
and because the skeleton
was buried for such a long time.

30
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:15,939
The train is arriving.

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,769
Please stand behind...

- What's going on?

40
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,480
- Goodness.
- What's he doing?

41
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,148
- My gosh.
- Look at that.

42
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,319
- What's he doing here?
- What's his deal?

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,718
- What's he doing?
- Who is he?

44
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,088
- Oh, my.
- What's he doing?

45

- Who is he?
- Let him pass.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,028
- My gosh.
- Just let him pass.

47
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:22,129
- Why is he staring at us?
- What's his deal?

48
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,938
- Who is he?
- Goodness.

49
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,069
- Look at that.
- Just let him pass.

50
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,870
- It's no big deal.
- Why is he staring at us?

51
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,648
- Did he just honk at us?
- What was that?

52
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:35,778
- He'll run us over with his car.
- Just let him pass.

53
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:38,519
- What's he doing?
- Come on.

Good day.

56
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,569
What a jerk!

57
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,009
Hey, have you no shame?

58
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,248
You never showed up...

59
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:16,078
when we were campaigning
to save Kyung Soo.

60
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,149

to set foot in here?

00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:25,119
Because we have to pay back
our debt together.

63
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,460
Let's say we stood joint surety.

64
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,559
Hold on.

65
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,470
I didn't know you cared so much
about Kyung Soo.

66
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,639
Were you two close?

67
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,779
Hey, get lost.

68
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,710
I don't want to talk to a jerk
like you.

69
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,248
But then again, what do you expect?

70
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,850
Med students aren't
real college students, you know?

71
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,719
You jerks say that
you're studying to save lives...

72
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,589
but don't care about the people
dying on the streets.

73
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,489
All you do is study.

74
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,030
What are med students then?
Are they in middle school?

75
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:10,738
Right, so just study
like you always do...

76
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,368
and play the guitar or something.

77
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,369
Selfish fence-sitters like you
shouldn't come here.

78
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:21,480
My gosh.
What are you doing here then?

79
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,850
You never protested
and got a job right away.

80
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,949
Oh, that reminds me.

81
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:29,789
Tell the newspaper company
you work for...

82
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,618
that you guys should make
Molotov cocktails.

83

These are very good.

84

You jerk!

85
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:43,939
- Let's get married.
- Get married?

86
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,369
With who? Me?

87
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,839
We broke up.

88
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,609
Right, I did say we should break up.

89
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,050
But that doesn't mean I let you go.

90
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,909
What does that mean?

91
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,850
I was just testing you.

92
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,289
I asked you out on our first date
and for all other dates.

93
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,248
You only hold my hand
when I tell you to.

94
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:05,119
I was wondering whether or not
you actually had feelings for me.

95
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,099
So? What's your conclusion?

96
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,459
Let's get married.

97
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,769
My family will take care
of everything.

98
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,299
You can just move in with me.

99
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,539
My dad will pay...

100
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,368
for our living expenses
until you open your own clinic,

101
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:21,009
- so after your internship...
- I won't do an internship.

102
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:22,369
What?

103
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,340
Why not?

104
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,448
Don't tell me
it's because of Kyung Soo.

105
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:30,719
Do you suddenly want to rebel
against society and the system?

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,618
- No, it's not that.
- Then what is it?

107
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,349
Just why?
You graduated top of your class.

108
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,619
- I haven't graduated yet.
- What?

109
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,019
Why not?

110
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,460
Because I want to participate
in the University Song Festival!

111
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,558
I won't be eligible once I graduate.

112
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,999
Then what about me?

113
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:49,139
You? What about you?

114
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,008
Do you want to be a singer too?

115
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,138
No. I want to get married.

116
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,009
I need a husband who's a doctor,
not a singer.

117

Yu Jin, then let's do this.

124

I had some change left over,
so I bought this.

Just a moment please.

than In Jae does.

Yes, okay.

129
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,319
I confirmed it.

130
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,329
You paid the bill,
so you should see the patient.

131

But the visiting hours are over.

132
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,530
You always come after hours.

133
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:58,140
Go see him quickly.

00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,448
so I'm sure you're settling in fine.

164
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:01,420
- Hold it up properly.
- Team C, let's go!

165
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,929
Don't tell me you're still upset
because of what happened that day.

166
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,530
Stand straight, you fool!

167
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,099
If that's the case,

168
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,399
let me tell you that thanks to you,
my life is also plenty messed up,

169
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,770
so let's just call it even.

170
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:22,370
I'm trying my best to untangle
this mess.

171
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,380
I'm not sure how,

172
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,550
but I'll do everything in my power.

173
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,979
So please write me back.

174
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,040
His stomach was pierced
by some construction material.

175
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,069
They tried pulling it out,
so he's bleeding really badly.

176
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,558
Go get Doctor Kim. Now.

177
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,420
What? Okay.

178
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:16,228
Sir, I'll press down on the wound.

179
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,509
It's going to hurt a little bit.

180
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,540
Gosh, is it just now lunchtime?

181
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,140
It looks like we'll have to
work overtime again tonight.

182
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,608
This is all because of that brat,
Kim Myeong Hee.

183
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,578
What use is it if we request
extra personnel?

184
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,925
She just keeps working
until broad daylight...

185
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:09,479
when she's on night shifts.

186
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,218
That's why the higher-ups think
that's natural.

187
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:13,919
Gosh. Darn it! That stubborn brat.

188
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,620
Why does she work so hard though?

189
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:19,420
It doesn't seem like she cares
about what others think of her.

190
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,859
What do you think?
It's because of the money.

191
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,228
What on earth can she possibly do...

192
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,929
with some few extra bucks?

193
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
(Gwangju Station)

194
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,439
Are you here to see a friend?

195
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:33,709
Thank you very much!

196
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,010
I'm here.

197
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,839
Gwangju.

198
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,218
(New volition for a new Gwangju)

199
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:45,779
(Host of 19th South Jeolla Province
Athletic Meet...)

200
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,980
(and 61st Preliminaries
of the National Sports Festival)

201
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:03,240
(Reception)

202
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,969
Where is the
Deputy Director's office?

203
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,510
Hey!

204
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,709
What will you do about this?

205
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,709
If you hold this for a while...

206
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,520
Pull it out
and just stick it in again.

207
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,719
Come on, stick it in somewhere else.
Come on.

208
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:32,760
Okay.

209
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,609
Gosh, what are you doing?

210
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,170
Are you caressing me or what?

211
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:48,349
- Move, I'll do it.
- Okay.

212
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,318
Hey, little lady.
I never asked for your help.

213
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,550
You can leave.

214
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:58,188
What else do you expect
in an emergency room?

215
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:00,829
You little... Hey, you.

216
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,929
You darned brat.

217
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,500
Hey. Do you know who I am?

218
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,339
I do.

219
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,870
You're a patient.

220
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:17,540
Let go of me!

221
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,109
(Patient, Jang Seok Chul)

222
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,849
Oh, dear.

223
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,289
I think it would be better...

224
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,819
to just stay put,
for you and the patient's sake.

225
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,718
It's not an easy thing
to transfer a coma patient...

226
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,558
from Seoul to Gwangju either.

227
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,698
To be frank, it'll cost you
an awful lot of money too.

228
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:37,799
Do you have that much money?

229
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,469
If you give the approval,
I promise to get the money...

230
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,170
You seem like a young student,

231
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,838
and you're going about things
in the wrong order.

232
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,198
We don't take empty promises.

233
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,369
We only take cash.
Come back when you have the money.

234
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,439
It's not an empty promise.

235
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,239
The patient is in need
of urgent care...

236
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,879
I'm glad you mentioned that.

237
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,280
Our hospital is in need
of urgent money.

238
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,520
Goodbye.

239
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:57,849
But...

240
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,689
Sir.

241
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,089
This patient was born in Gwangju.

242
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:07,189
Going back home might be
his last dying wish.

243
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,489
I think he should spend
his last moments here...

244
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,530
Get out of my way!

245
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,699
My gosh, Sang Gon. What is going on?

246
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,800
Byung Geol.

247
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,270
Fire this brat now.

248
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,668
What kind of nurse...

249
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:24,539
assaults a sick patient
in this world?

250
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,648
Hey, I'm not saying this
because he's a friend.

251
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,408
How can a medical worker
assault a patient?

252
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:29,979
Apologize to him now.

253
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,740
Now you're treating me
like a medical worker?

254
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:33,388
What?

255
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:35,549
You pretended not to see anything...

256
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,559
when a young nurse
was being sexually harassed.

257
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,158
But now that I react,

258
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,290
you're suddenly mentioning
my duties as a nurse?

259
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,799
Who are you to talk back to him
like that?

260
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
Wait, she's...

261
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,868
My goodness.

262
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,838
My gosh, Sang Gon. Are you okay?

263
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,668
What do you think you're doing
in my office?

264
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:56,979
It was self-defense.
Since you weren't helping me.

265
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,578
What's that attitude
after making this mess?

266
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,608
I'm not the one who made this mess.

267
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:02,010
What? Hey...

268
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,148
Hey, is anyone out there?
Take her out!

269
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,220
My goodness.

270
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,389
Can you help him?

271
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,530
That cheeky wench!
How dare she yell at me?

272
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,329
So, about the transfer...

273
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,300
Get out. Get out now!

274
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,050
Hey. Go check over there.

275
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,649
Let's split up and search.

276
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,730
I don't know
if these will last another year.

277
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,930
Hey, little lady.

278
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,369
Are you on your way home?

279
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,169
Goodness, does that line still work?

280
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,179
Of course.
This line has never failed.

281
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,139
Were you busy getting chased again?

282
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,849
How do you have so much energy?

283
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,949
Let's go. No time for chit-chat.

284
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,578
What are you talking about?
I just got off work.

285
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,219
Come on.
We don't have time for this.

286
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,550
Hey, I even got a nosebleed!

287
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,318
Hurry up and ring the doorbell.

288
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,489
My father will be coming out
any minute.

289
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,859
So why do you keep sneaking out
like a cat in heat?

290
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,700
Just go in and beg his forgiveness.

291
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,270
Who is it?

292
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,280
Hello. It's Myeong Hee,
Soo Ryeon's friend.

293
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,619
You go this way,
and I'll go this way, okay?

294
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:21,290
- Okay?
- Okay.

295
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:31,398
Well, I'm here
because Soo Ryeon called me...

296
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:33,158
and asked me to come over.

297
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,369
She called you?

298
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,740
She's been sick in bed
since yesterday evening.

299
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:42,739
She must've woken up for a bit
this morning.

300
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,239
She called me around 5 a.m.

301
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,079
Around 5 a.m.,
I was already up and working.

302
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:51,049
Wait. That's wrong.

303
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,219
It was 4 a.m. It was around 4 a.m.

304
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,919
I see. Come on in.

305
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,309
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

306
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,389
Hold on. Is that you, Myeong Hee?

307
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,429
Mr. Lee. How have you been?

308
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,099
I've been good.
Are you here to see Soo Ryeon?

309
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,469
Don't tell me she's still sleeping.

310
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,078
She told me not to wake her up...

311
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,949
under any circumstances.

312
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,918
What? I can't believe that brat.

313
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,280
Lee Soo Ryeon!

314
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,690
Lee Soo Ryeon!

315
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,730
My goodness. Lee Soo Ryeon!

316
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,200
- Gosh. It's Father.
- Lee Soo Ryeon!

317
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:16,970
Lee Soo Ryeon!

318
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,010
She must've completely passed out.

319
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,740
Lee Soo Ryeon!

320
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,440
- What should I do?
- Lee Soo Ryeon!

321
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:31,020
Lee Soo Ryeon!

322
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,659
Lee Soo Ryeon!

323
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,790
What time is it? I slept like a log.

324
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,119
Why are you soaked in sweat?

325
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,460
What?

326
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,328
You have the chills.

327
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:21,829
Well, I must be coming down
with something.

328
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:23,740
Gosh, I have the chills.

329
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,970
We had to meet up
with a wanted person last night,

330
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,639
and I was the only one
they could trust.

331
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,209
What's happening today?

332
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,408
Today is even more important.

333
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,169
In the evening,
we're going to give speeches.

334
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,119
At night, we're printing out flyers.

335
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,319
I bet, within a couple of weeks,
all your hair will be shaved off.

336
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,559
This is the least I can do
to deserve to be called Joan of Arc.

337
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,599
What does that even mean?

338
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:55,899
Do you need a license
to protest these days?

339
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,970
If only there were a license,
I'd go and get one.

340
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,210
Whatever I do,

341
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,940
I'll always be my father's daughter.

342
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:11,148
Guilt by association is nonsense.

343
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,950
Your father being a capitalist
doesn't make you a hypocrite.

344
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,659
Anyway, I'll go wash up.

345
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,305
(Joint Statement Demanding
Democratization of Universities)

346
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:23,089
Give it a read, okay?

347
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:25,658
What are you talking about?

348
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:28,770
I said I worked all night!

349
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:54,829
Oh, my. When did you get here?

350
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,119
I don't think
it needs any corrections.

351
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,599
- Soo Chan, is that you?
- Myeong Hee?

352
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,169
Goodness, how long has it been?

353
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,309
You've become a real lady.

354
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,069
Soo Chan!

355
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,108
What happened?

356
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:50,319
I thought you were coming back
next month.

357
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,818
Are you back in Korea for good?

358
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,690
Yes, it seems so.

359
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,290
A dress?

360
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:03,759
I never wear these.
Why do you keep getting them for me?

361
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,358
My dressing room is already packed.

362
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,799
Why else? I want you to wear them.

363
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,239
Stop dressing
like a North Korean soldier.

364
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,899
What are you talking about?

365
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,408
By the way,
if I'd known I'd run into you,

366
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,480
I would've gotten something
for you too, Myeong Hee.

367
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,750
What? Don't worry.
That's unnecessary.

368
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,879
Myeong Hee,

369
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,020
you could ask him...

370
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,449
to get you those foreign books
when he goes on business trips.

371
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,960
- Hey.
- What?

372
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,558
Soo Chan, Myeong Hee is preparing
to study abroad.

373
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,789
- What? Really?
- Yes.

374
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,999
That's impressive.
You're working too, right?

375
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,369
It's just my dream.

376
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,839
I haven't been accepted
to any schools yet.

377
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,770
And I haven't saved up
enough either.

378
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,709
If you'd cut back on the money
you send home for the kid,

379
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,180
you would've studied abroad
a dozen times already.

380
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:56,949
It's not my kid.

381
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,618
I have a little brother,

382
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,720
and he's still very young.

383
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,318
You couldn't pretend not to care,
could you?

384
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,619
You must be the pillar
of your family.

385
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,199
Do you see this, Soo Ryeon?

386
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,669
You'll never understand
how us firstborns feel.

387
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,499
"Us first-borns?"

388
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,740
Goodness. Myeong Hee,
you're still so young yourself.

389
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:22,569
It must be hard being the grown-up.

390
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:35,719
It was really nice seeing you today.

391
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,289
Call me if you need anything
while preparing for your studies.

392
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,020
Okay. Thank you.

393
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:48,300
Well... Is it really okay
if I call you?

394
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,740
When I want to ask you something,
I mean.

395
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:54,309
Yes, of course.

396
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,639
I started a company recently.

397
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,049
Call me at this number
if I'm not home.

398

(Changhwa Pharmaceuticals,

399
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,780
You're the first person
to receive my business card.

400
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,519
Thank you.

401
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,460
- Drive safe.
- Okay.

402
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,430
- Bye.
- Take care.

403
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,339
Go.

404
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,608
- Hey, Kim Myeong Hee, come here.
- Come here.

405
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:35,280
- Come on here.
- What is it?

406
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:39,318
What's going on?

407
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,719
Tell us the truth, Kim Myeong Hee.

408
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,020
You were with a guy.

409
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,859
Judging from his car,
he must be a bourgeois.

410
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:48,290
Gosh, it's not like that.

411
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,960
"It's not like that?"

412
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,300
What does she mean?

413
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,868
Why did you call me here?

414
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:58,199
I'm about to pass out.
Make it quick.

415
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,269
Goodness, can you believe
the way she talks?

416
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,509
Let's see what you're going to say
when you see this.

417
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,809
What is it?

418
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,210
Are you being drafted?

419
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,079
See for yourself.

420
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,809
- Congratulations!
- You got in!

421
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:44,578
My gosh, is this real?

422
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,078
Guys, is this a prank?

423
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,049
Come on!
It's real, all the way from Germany.

424
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,989
I went to the post office
every single morning...

425
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,659
to pick this up for you.

426
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,760
I don't have time for this.

427
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,299
Hey, I have to go.

428
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,199
Where are you going?
We should celebrate!

429
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,199
I should go tell Father.

430
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,230
- My gosh.
- Bye!

431
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,089
What? Hwang Hee Tae!

432
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,530
How have you been?

433
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:42,068
Good job.

434
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:43,670
I'm proud of you.

435
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,508
Have you decided
when you're going to enroll?

436
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:50,278
Not any time soon.

437
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,079
I have to apply for a passport...

438
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:55,119
and save up more money.

439
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:03,089
You see, I got a call
from the Bishops' Conference.

440
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,660
They're giving a scholarship
to just one person this year.

441
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:08,899
A scholarship?

442
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,368
Yes. I was going to recommend you,

443
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:15,038
but I was afraid
I was getting ahead of myself.

444
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,769
And you brought me
this good news today.

445
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:21,308
It's the Lord's will.

446
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:23,549
That would really help me.

447
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,619
But there's one condition.

448
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,990
You must leave the country
in a month.

449
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,359
In a month?

450
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,220
It's too soon, right?

451
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,430
Flights are expensive too.

452
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,930
You can try again next year
if you want.

453
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,969
No. Please recommend me.

454
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,239
I'll prepare the money somehow.

455
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,339
All right. That sounds good.

456
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,179
Hold on.

457
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,880
Shouldn't you call your family?
Tell them the good news.

458
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,150
Call them immediately.

459
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,990
That's my condition.

460
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,558
The preliminaries...

461
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,169
will be completely different
from the school races.

462
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,068
The fastest runners...

463
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,639
from all over the province
will be there.

464
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,439
The winner can even enter
the National Sports Festival.

465
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,108
Is that right?

466
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:27,109
Mother,

467
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,480
our Myeong Soo might even compete
in the Olympics at this rate.

468
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,480
But no one in the whole world
can run faster than Hyun Chul.

469
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,250
What? Father?

470
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,089
Grandma, you're being silly again.

471
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,900
(Watch repair)

472
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:51,029
Hold on. The phone is ringing.

473
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,339
Here.

474
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,210
Hello?

475
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:10,150
(Public telephone)

476
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,758
Myeong Soo, answer the phone.
It's your sister.

477
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,000
It's Myeong Hee?

478
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,829
Hello?

479
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:26,440
Goodness. I'm not deaf.

480
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:29,639
What are you so excited about,
little bear?

481
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,979
Myeong Hee, I'm entering a race
in Gwangju next week!

482
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,179
Can you come?

483
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,049
I'll be there if I'm off duty.

484
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,420
Hey, Myeong Soo.

485
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,749
Can I talk to Mother?

486
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,489
I won't let you talk to her
unless you promise you'll come.

487
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,589
- Move.
- Mother.

488
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:48,730
Hi, Myeong Hee. What's the matter?

489
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:53,730
What? Really?

490
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:58,239
That's great.

491
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,039
But how are you going to afford it?

492
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,269
I'll ask your father...

493
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:08,750
You don't want me to tell him?

494
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,509
All right.

495
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,150
I didn't call to ask for help.

496
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,488
My son is innocent!

497
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,658
Who are you taking away now?

498
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,089
- There she goes again.
- Take me instead!

499
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,599
- I'm hanging up.
- Take me!

500
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,170
My son is innocent!

501
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,868
- You little...
- Mother!

502
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:36,038
- You can't do this!
- Mother, calm down.

503
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:39,038
- You can't take him away!
- Mother!

504
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,949
Hwang Ki Nam, you jerk!

505
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,329
If only you remembered that sooner.

506
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,300
We could've saved each other
so much trouble.

507
00:34:58,699 --> 00:34:59,860
Sir.

508
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,440
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

509
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:15,880
Finish up.

510
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,149
At the opposition party's request...

511
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,218
for the resignation
of the Yushin government...

512
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:24,919
and the introduction of
the single-member district system,

513
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,459
the security commander commented...

514
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,328
that it is time...

515
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,928
that the parties worked together...

516
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,459
for an advanced political system.

517
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,069

inside and outside the country,

520
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,840
At this rate,

521
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,669
they'll even kick out
all the dogs...

522
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,440
that were kept
during the Yushin regime.

523
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,110
A scared dog barks first.

524
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,619
All they do is bark but never bite.

525
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,849
What if we relax
thinking it's a scared dog,

526
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,219
but it turns out to be a crazy dog?

527
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,558
In these turbulent times,

528
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,929
you should find someone...

529
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,000
who can have your back.

530
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,638
I will be fine
as long as I have you on my side.

531
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,840
What I mean is,

532
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,139
you need a lifeboat you can hop into
when you're in a pinch.

533
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,079
Thanks.

534
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:30,118
You already have an excellent card
in your hand.

535
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,559
Why look further?

536
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,989
You know what's the surest way
to form an alliance?

537
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:38,800
Your son is marrying age, isn't he?

538
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,828
I'll lead you to water.

539
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:45,769
Try and catch the fish yourself.

540
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,440
Of course.

541
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:50,510
Thank you, sir.

Dear student democracy activists.

Punishing the remaining powers
on campus...

547
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:30,849
should go beyond opportunism.

548

We should all be
the guillotines of history.

549

We must expel
all government-funded professors,

of the Yushin dictatorship...

- Yes!
- Yes!

553
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:46,999

That's a girl's name?

00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:01,780
Yes. She's 24 years old.

559
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:04,610
Would it be possible?

560
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:10,089
He's the most resourceful member
of the student council.

561

He's better
than most private detectives, right?

This is not much to go on,

563

but I'll ask around.

It's tonight.

Well, I brought the sample here.

This place isn't open
to just anyone.

Can we trust you?

If you can't,

576
00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:51,989
are you going to torture me
or something?

577

Well, as long as we confirm
your identity,

578

we can use all the help we can get.

Gosh, I'd rather be tortured.

580

Come on.
If you came all the way here,

581
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,738
isn't it because you're interested
in what we're doing?

582

No. I just came to drink.

- What?
- You tell her!

588
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,900
Why should I? You go...

589
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,369
Go tell her.

590
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,050
Well...

591
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,920
- Myeong Hee.
- Yes?

593
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,489
Oh, the rent.

594
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,320
I forgot.

at all.

Then what about the rent?

600
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,889
Oh, you can pay me the original rent
starting next month.

Good morning.

650
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,079
- Hee Tae?
- Yes.

651
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:30,989
What brings you to Gwangju?

652
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,059
What the...

653
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:38,928
Why are you here?

654
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,929
Hey, Jung Tae.
It's good to see you too.

655
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,630
Jung Tae,
don't be rude to your brother.

656
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:53,009
Bring it if you're done writing.

657
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,110
Oh, okay.

658
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,779
So due to the curfew,
I couldn't go to an inn...

659
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,190
and ended up falling asleep
at that house.

660
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:07,089
Eventually, at precisely 5 a.m.,

661
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,129
you found me and dragged me back...

662
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,599
to where I am now.

663
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,699
That's all.

664
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,469
Why aren't you working as an intern?

665
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,570
How did you know that?

666
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:26,178
Are you tailing me?

667
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:27,539
Don't joke around.

668
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,110
I'm asking why you're not working
at the hospital.

669
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,949
I didn't graduate.

670
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,690
I thought it would be better
than getting expelled.

671
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:52,469
I waited six years to see
this flower bloom.

672
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,868
I turned on the heater in winter...

673
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:57,510
just for this flower
in this empty room.

674
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,110
I raised it with the utmost care,

675
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:02,510
but bugs started living inside it.

676
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,510
I was worried the pesticide
might harm the flower,

677
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,550
so I even diluted it with water.

678
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,110
But the insects eventually
hatched eggs inside it.

679
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,260
No matter how precious it is,

680
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:18,789
if the roots have been eaten away,

681
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,400
it's nothing more
than a host of parasites.

682
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,269
I only accepted you as my son...

683
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,940
because I believed
you would prove useful.

684
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:38,179
Instead of becoming
a host of parasites.

685
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,219
So...

686
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:46,760
How much have you been eaten away?

687
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:01,199
Father, I...

688
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,309
need money.

689
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,679
What?

690
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,349
I need money to sort out
a situation that I created.

691
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,519
If you help me out
without asking any questions,

692
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,948
I'll do whatever you tell me to do
without asking any questions...

693
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:17,750
from now on.

694
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,559
Whatever I tell you to do?

695
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,329
Lee Soo Ryeon, come out.

696
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,440
What about the others?

697
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,409
I had this sensation
in the back of my head.

698
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,448
My sense of smell and hearing...

699
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:50,019
All my senses were telling me,

700
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:52,319
"It's that way."

701
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,719
Let go of me.

702
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,988
I said, let go!

703
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:57,689
Why am I the only one
being released?

704
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,599
Hey, stop right there.

705
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:04,800
What's going on here?

706
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,070
Why are you letting her go
after all my hard work?

707
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,170
Exactly.

708
00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:13,409
What are you doing? Put me back in.

709
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,678
Put me back in right now.

710
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,549
What on earth is going on?

711
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,150
Come on.

712
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,349
What are you all doing?

713
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,059
Chief, you came at the right time.

714
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,988
The senior inspector here...

715
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:30,589
is releasing the trespasser
that I went to so much trouble...

716
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,860
to catch red-handed...

717
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,000
Watch your language.

718
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:38,598
She was just visiting a factory
owned by her father.

719
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:40,670
How is that trespassing?

720
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,969
Pardon?

721
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:47,409
A factory owned by her father?

722
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:52,750
Then release the others too.

723
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,650
They were just visiting like I was.

724
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:58,550
That's enough.

725
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:05,730
Unbelievable.

726
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,629
You brought the whole gang
to my factory now?

727
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,468
I know I spoiled you
raising you alone,

728
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,038
but this is just too much.

729
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:14,769
I never asked you to get me out.

730
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,538
I can take care of myself.

731
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:19,879
You can take care of yourself? How?

732
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,979
By going to prison?

733
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,308
Once you're convicted,

734
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:25,408
my factory will be stigmatized
as a place that prints flyers.

735
00:51:25,409 --> 00:51:26,849
We'll go out of business.

736
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,049
You're not to leave this house,
not even for school.

737
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,150
End of discussion.

738
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:35,119
Father. Father!

739
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,800
What? Arrested?

740
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:44,399
Everyone who gathered
to print out flyers got arrested.

741
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,339
What about Soo Ryeon?
She must've been there too.

742
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,109
She's been released alone
thanks to her father.

743
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,369
Are you happy now?

744
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,610
I heard everything from Father.

745
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:03,090
You're going to Germany
next month, right?

746
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:06,388
I don't know yet.

747
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,360
I need money for the airfare.

748
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:10,988
Ask your lady for help.

749
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:12,499
I'm no beggar.

750
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,098
Why on earth would I ask her
to give me money?

751
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:17,928
You're just borrowing it.

752
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:21,039
That scholarship is
such a rare opportunity.

753
00:52:23,869 --> 00:52:25,840
I can apply again next year.

754
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:29,710
What if you don't get it next year?
Will you wait another year?

755
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:33,780
Do you want to lose the opportunity
because of your pride?

756
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:40,488
There are unpaid bills.

757
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:41,789
Mr. Choi!

758
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,599
My goodness.

759
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,638
(Regular savings account,
Hwang Hee Tae)

760
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,969
I brought the money.

761
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,939
(Regular savings account,
Hwang Hee Tae)

762
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,138
My, nice to see you.

763
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:00,939
It's been a while, Mr. Kim.

764
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,448
It's been so long.
How have you been?

765
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:06,678
My goodness.
They say, when the tiger is away,

766
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:09,249
the fox plays the king.

767
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,518
Hwang Ki Nam seems to be
enjoying more power...

768
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,889
since the president passed away.

769
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:16,159
How frustrating.

770
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,829
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

771
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,269
- I'll get going.
- All right.

772
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,869
Oh, hello.

773
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:35,038
Did your daughter
come back home safely?

774
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:37,049
Yes, thanks to you.

775
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,780
I feel so bad every time.

776
00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:41,519
We help each other.
You don't have to feel bad.

777
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,149
In these turbulent times,

778
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,320
there are many things
to think about.

779
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:47,988
Especially for those who are
on their own like you and me,

780
00:53:47,989 --> 00:53:50,659
one small mistake can be
all it takes.

781
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,230
You're right.
We're living in strange times.

782
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:00,269
Speaking of which,

783
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,610
isn't it time your daughter started
getting ready to get married?

784
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,260
Father.

785
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:28,098
Father, we need to talk.

786
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:31,030
Go to your room.
I have nothing to say to you.

787
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,800
Do you want to see
your daughter die?

788
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,038
Please get them out.

789
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,869
If something happens to them,

790
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,340
how will I face the world?

791
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,980
Father.

792
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,519
I can get your friends out
on one condition.

793
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,190
I'll do anything. Anything at all.

794
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,159
Soo Ryeon, it's time...

795
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:02,769
for you to grow up.

796
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,138
How can I go on a date
with such a horrible person's son?

797
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:12,368
Go on a date,
and they'll be released.

798
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:13,738
It's already decided.

799
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:16,309
He's the son of Hwang Ki Nam,
of all people!

800
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:19,348
He was once the Head
of Anti-communist Investigation.

801
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,119
So what?

802
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,190
All you have to do is sit with him
for a while and turn him down.

803
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,948
Imagine someone sees me...

804
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:28,960
with the likes
of a powerful anti-communist's son.

805
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,589
Joan of Arc will be burned
at the stake immediately.

806
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,230
What can you do?

807
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,469
This is the only way
to get your friends out.

808
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:42,909
Right. Didn't you say
you had something to tell me?

809
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,678
I feel bad for sharing good news...

810
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:52,349
when you're so devastated.

811
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:54,619
What is it?

812
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:01,590
What could this be?

813
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:09,570
What? "Acceptance Letter?"

814
00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:14,340
Hey, did you get in?

815
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:19,009
Goodness. When did you even apply?
You never told me.

816
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,139
I wasn't counting on getting in.

817
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,879
I guess I was lucky.

818
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,348
Congratulations.

819
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:28,579
I knew you could do anything
once you set your mind to it.

820
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,919
It must've been so hard,
working and studying all at once.

821
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,889
I'm proud of you, Myeong Hee.

822
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:36,989
Thanks.

823
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:43,030
But this feels
as if you're being drafted.

824
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,800
When are you leaving?

825
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:49,138
I'm going to try
to leave next month.

826
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,340
What? Next month?

827
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:56,179
Didn't you say you'd have to save up
for another year?

828
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,880
You're just borrowing it.

829
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:04,449
Well...

830
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:08,690
I won
the Catholic Foundation scholarship.

831
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,360
Really?

832
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,530
That's great.

833
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,360
You must be so relieved.

834
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:20,369
But the thing is...

835
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:24,570
To get the scholarship,
I must leave next month.

836
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,980
So I have to...

837
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,510
scrape up money for airfare soon.

838
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:34,848
But flights are so expensive.

839
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:36,920
Where are you going to get
all that money?

840
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,460
Well... Myeong Hee.

841
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,599
I could ask my father...

842
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,899
No. Forget it.

843
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,699
I shouldn't have said anything.

844
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,239
I can find a way. Don't worry.

845
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:59,110
So when is this date of yours?

846
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:05,380
Hold on.

847
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:11,590
I was just...

848
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:15,489
struck with a brilliant idea.

849
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,598
You can go on the blind date
instead of me,

850
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:26,170
and I'll buy the plane ticket...

851
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,840
instead of you.

852
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,178
You just have to meet with him
three times.

853
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,238
And if he dumps you first,

854
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:38,349
you just have to meet him once.

855
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:41,979
No one will ever find out
since you don't know each other.

856
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,218
Come on, that's total nonsense.

857
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:48,159
Why? Let's help each other out
in this difficult situation.

858
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,289
Three dates
for a plane ticket to Germany.

859
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:57,030
Come on. Don't you think
this is a win-win for both of us?

860
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,730
Ta-da!

861
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:35,670
What in the world?

862
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:36,968
Soo Ryeon, I'm going to kill you.

863
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:38,369
Stop it! My goodness.

864
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,909
Hey!

865
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:52,019
How about this purple dress
to start with?

866
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,789
- What about this?
- I don't think so.

867
01:00:02,329 --> 01:00:03,570
Who are you?

868
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:07,469
Are you really Myeong Hee?

869
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,309
What are you doing?

870
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:08,159
Yes! That's perfect!

871
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,909
Goodness, let me see.

872
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,980
Most of my clothes fit you,

873
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,150
but the shoes are the problem.

874
01:01:30,489 --> 01:01:32,190
Try it on again.

875
01:01:37,889 --> 01:01:40,960
Good. It won't slip off now.

876
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:45,400
All right.
It's time for the last touch.

877
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:49,809
This is my good luck charm.

878
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:52,808
I never failed
to get rejected by a guy...

879
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,380
whenever I wore this.

880
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,179
Gosh, it's perfect.

881
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,610
You look gorgeous.

882
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,919
I don't know what I'm doing
right now.

883
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,289
Come on, why?

884
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:07,389
Don't you want to go on the date
now that it's about to happen?

885
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:10,429
No. Going on a date
isn't a big deal.

886
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,699
It's just that the plane ticket
is too expensive.

887
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,198
I don't want to get you
in trouble...

888
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:17,369
There you go again!

889
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,469
It's not like I'm doing it for free.

890
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,569
We both have nothing to lose
from this.

891
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:27,280
So just go and get dumped. Got it?

892
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,539
Okay?

893
01:02:30,349 --> 01:02:31,480
Okay.

894
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,659
(Gwangju Park Hotel Cafe, 4 p.m.)

895
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:01,679
Darn.

896
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,319
Jin Woo... Jin Woo!

897
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,989
- Oh, dear. My son.
- He's been hit.

898
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:13,359
- Jin Woo.
- What's going on?

899
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,419
What happened?

900
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,058
My son...

901
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,189
- Oh, gosh.
- Jin Woo.

902
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,460
Jin Woo...

903
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,800
Please look at me.

904
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,570
No, Jin Woo...

905
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,940
(Patient, Jang Seok Chul,
Guardian, Hwang Hee Tae)

906
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:52,289
Hee Tae. Please save Seok Chul.

907
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:55,559
Hee Tae! Please save her.

908
01:03:57,929 --> 01:03:59,130
Hee Tae!

909
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,610
- Oh, dear.
- What do we do?

910
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,909
- Hey!
- Lay him down.

911
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,718
Did he hit his head?

912
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:14,719
No.

913
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,819
I just bumped into him slightly,
and he fell down.

914
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,849
Ma'am, please save my son.

915
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,260
- My gosh.
- My son...

916
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,429
I think he's injured.

917
01:04:28,829 --> 01:04:31,169
I think he just passed out,
so calm down.

918
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:33,269
- Call an ambulance now.
- Okay.

919
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:51,690
My son. Please...

920
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,759
Hey, little boy. Open your eyes.

921
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,960
Kid. Look at me.

922
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,329
He woke up!

923
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:14,879
What is your name?

924
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,980
Can you look here for me?

925
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,949
- Gosh.
- I'm so glad he's not hurt.

926
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:33,800
- Sang Gon, what is going on?
- Byung Geol.

927
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:36,099
Fire this brat now.

928
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,598
What kind of nurse...

929
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:41,468
assaults a sick patient
in this world?

930
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:44,739
Ma'am, please save my son.

931
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,940
That cheeky nurse!

932
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,179
I'm sorry I'm late.

933
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,389
My name is Lee Soo Ryeon.

934
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,760
(Youth of May)

935
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:52,738
Even when you did everything
I told you to?

936
01:06:52,739 --> 01:06:54,709
No matter what I did,
he did something worse.

937
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,638
You look like you're the one
who went on a date.

938
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,649
- What?
- What?

939
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:58,808
Myeong Soo!

940
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:00,280
Is he Myeong Hee's secret son?

941
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,279
Stop being so silly.

942
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,618
Soo Ryeon,
do you have time tomorrow?

943
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:07,089
- How about dinner?
- I have plans tonight.

944
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,218
She's a total vixen.

945
01:07:09,219 --> 01:07:11,359
After struggling with my life
all day long,

946
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,800
I feel free whenever I meet you.

947
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,260
I'll play a song for you next time.

948
01:07:16,429 --> 01:07:18,570
Do you want to meet again
before the flowers wither?
