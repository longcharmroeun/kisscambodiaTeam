1
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:15,306
Her recovery is slow.

2
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,846
I can't say for sure
how long she'll hold out.

3
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,976
Hee Tae, you'll be a great doctor.

4
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:21,576
I only accepted you as my son...

5
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:23,882
because I believed
you would prove useful.

6
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:26,182
Hee Tae!

7
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,621
Please save Seok Chul! Please!

8
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,612
Oh, you're up.

9
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:56,981
You should have some hangover soup.

10
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:58,712
Yes.

11
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:01,682
Where's Myeong Hee?

12
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:31,041
Myeong Hee.

13
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,152
I'm ready to be hurt.

14
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:42,291
Do you want to go out with me
just until the end of May?

15
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:54,032
Let's talk later.

16
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:57,972
I'll give you my answer...

17
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,271
when you're sober.

18
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:08,612
Ms. Kim.

19
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:12,456
The manager said you can stop by
before lunch for the meeting.

20
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:14,522
Okay, I will.

21
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:19,631
By the way, do you have a fever?

22
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:22,661
Your face looks a bit flushed.

23
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:28,032
Maybe it's my spring tan.

24
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:38,511
(Episode 4, Crossing the Line)

25
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:43,182
My goodness.

26
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:51,866
Okay. So everyone is available
next week, right?

27
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,937
You made such a big fuss
first thing in the morning,

28
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:55,932
so I thought
it was about something important.

29
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:57,166
It is important.

30
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,036
Everyone in Seoul wants
Gwangju's confirmation...

31
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:01,907
and vice versa.
You're all just putting it off.

32
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:05,571
Anyway, I'll give this date
to those in Seoul.

33
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:08,941
What is your relationship
with Jang Seok Chul, by the way?

34
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:12,816
She's neither your family
nor your spouse.

35
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,856
Why are you putting so much time,
money, and effort into this?

36
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:18,022
I have to say, I'm really curious.

37
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,832
I'd say, we're offender and victim.

38
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:29,402
Let's leave it at that.

39
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,036
1, 2, 1, 2. Halt!

40
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,302
1, 2!

41
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:39,541
What are you doing?

42
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:43,611
I told you not to make it so obvious
that you're a leftist nerd.

43
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,016
Private Kim Kyung Soo!

44
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:49,212
I wasn't studying.

45
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:50,522
Hand it over.

46
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,122
About, face!

47
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:55,296
You dimwit.

48
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:58,291
Must you always be one step behind?
You drive me crazy.

49
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:01,261
Here it is, sir.

50
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:08,532
My gosh. A letter?

51
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:10,945
Are you planning
a secret rendezvous...

52
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,472
with your comrades outside?

53
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:20,152
Even going forward,
you're not allowed...

54
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:21,911
to send letters
or make any phone calls.

55
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:26,251
- Answer me!
- Yes, sir!

56
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,731
Yes, we'd like to transfer
patient Jang Seok Chul.

57
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:41,902
Right, we made the decision
with the risks in mind.

58
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:46,041
The hospital in Gwangju can do it
next week.

59
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:48,741
Two weeks?

60
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,116
Can we expedite it a little?

61
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:54,911
As you know,
the patient's current condition...

62
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:56,357
Aren't you going to have lunch?

63
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,522
- You go ahead.
- Okay.

64
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:06,092
Yes, I'm aware.

65
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,132
Right, so...

66
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:13,731
That's why...

67
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,041
(Pay Phone)

68
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,582
Yes. Please kindly look into it,
Professor.

69
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:35,892
Myeong Hee.

70
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,192
What brings you to the hospital?

71
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,636
Oh, I have a bad hangover.

72
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,472
I was hoping to get
some IV fluids in the ER.

73
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:49,001
It doesn't look like
that's why you're here.

74
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,276
What is it? Did something happen?

75
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,642
No, it's nothing.

76
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,416
I have to say, you're so mean.

77
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,686
Why didn't you wake me up
when you were heading out?

78
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,987
I can't believe
you just left me there.

79
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,051
You were sound asleep.

80
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,857
If it's something to do
with the hospital, I could...

81
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:09,222
You didn't wake me up
because I was sound asleep?

82
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:13,892
Does it mean you peeked at me
when I was sleeping?

83
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:17,466
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:20,301
Anyone could see
that you were fast asleep.

85
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:24,301
Sure, all right.

86
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:29,481
I have a tutoring session later.
I'll see you at home.

87
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:36,082
Gosh, that makes it sound like
we live together, doesn't it?

88
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:40,692
Nonsense.

89
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:43,692
Get going already.

90
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,161
See you later.

91
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:02,442
(Letter of Resignation)

92
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:08,351
Oh, dear.

93
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:11,057
You always talked about going abroad
since you were a newbie.

94
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,822
Are you finally going?

95
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:16,597
Even if you submit
this resignation letter,

96
00:07:16,597 --> 00:07:18,491
you know you have to work
for another month, right?

97
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:21,696
I'll work extra hard until I leave,

98
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:22,962
so don't you worry.

99
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:31,442
Hello?

100
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:32,972
Hey, Myeong Hee.

101
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:36,311
Today? Sure, I have time.

102
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:38,481
Why?

103
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,551
Did Hwang Hee Tae bother you again?

104
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:43,882
I'm glad to hear that.

105
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,952
Do you want to come over after work?

106
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,561
Soo Chan, aren't you going to work?

107
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,462
Auntie is coming over today.

108
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,501
Oh, right.

109
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:04,142
I guess I'll have to meet
Myeong Hee somewhere else.

110
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:07,741
No need for that.

111
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:11,041
We have plenty of food at home.
Just tell her to come over.

112
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:14,251
Gosh, I don't want to hear
Auntie's nagging.

113
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:16,656
She'll start nagging me now...

114
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:17,987
since you'll be
getting married soon.

115
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,927
Who says I'm getting married?

116
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:22,851
Aren't you about to?
I'm sure I'm not.

117
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:26,861
Why? Did you two fight again?

118
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:31,706
I told you
that you have the wrong number.

119
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:33,801
How many times is this already?

120
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,241
Ma'am, who was that?

121
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,217
The thing is,

122
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:46,082
someone keeps calling
since this morning...

123
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:48,457
asking if this is
some kind of publishing company.

124
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:50,322
Wait, I received that call too.

125
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,251
Wasn't it Jihye Publishing?

126
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:54,792
Oh, you're right.

127
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,662
Oh, that...

128
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,636
- Oh, gosh.
- My goodness, Soo Ryeon.

129
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:04,562
Soo Chan, I have to go somewhere.

130
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,506
What? I thought Myeong Hee
was coming over.

131
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,501
Oh. If she comes,

132
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:11,101
tell her to wait in my room.

133
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,072
Wait a minute...

134
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,542
Hey, Soo Ryeon!

135
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:28,751
Sir, I'm from Jihye Publishing.

136
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,131
Hey.

137
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:44,241
No one is coming after you,
so you can eat slowly.

138
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:47,241
Take off your shoes too.

139
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:55,981
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

140
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,822
I couldn't call anyone,
not even my house.

141
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:04,361
Has anything been decided in Seoul?

142
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:08,092
They've decided to hold
a full protest,

143
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:09,631
and the leaders will get together...

144
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,332
on the ninth at Korea University
to set up a specific plan.

145
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,871
How are things at the university?

146
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:18,702
Pretty much the same.

147
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:22,247
We'll shift the focus from
government-funded professors...

148
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,781
to demanding
the withdrawal of martial law.

149
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:26,082
We're still working closely
with Chosun University...

150
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,457
and trying our best
to fill your shoes,

151
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:30,722
so don't worry.

152
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:35,052
Won Seok, are you in there?

153
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:36,367
You have a call.

154
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,166
He says his name is Sang Min.

155
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,562
Sang Min?

156
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,162
Wait.

157
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,731
I never told her my name.

158
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:58,842
Won Seok,
don't make this worse than it is.

159
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:04,582
What are you doing? Get out of here!

160
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:23,141
Why isn't she coming?

161
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:25,447
(Lee Ji Eun, 22,
Ewha Womans University)

162
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,276
This young lady is
the youngest daughter...

163
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:28,576
of Baekwoon Textile.

164
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:32,247
She may be young,
but I hear she's an elegant lady.

165
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:33,412
- Auntie.
- What?

166
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:36,452
I'm really not interested
in blind dates.

167
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:38,851
Why you little...

168
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:41,727
You'll turn 30 soon!

169
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,827
If you keep living
as a lonely old bachelor,

170
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,462
you'll humiliate our family.

171
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:48,067
You should tie the knot
before Soo Ryeon...

172
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,001
so people don't talk
behind our backs.

173
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,962
Goodness, this is driving me crazy.

174
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:53,932
Hey, Myeong Hee.

175
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:55,901
Are you leaving already?

176
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,172
Yes.

177
00:11:57,806 --> 00:11:59,717
- I'd better get going.
- Hey.

178
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,416
Did you say
you're Soo Ryeon's friend?

179
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,546
Can you come over
and look at this with me?

180
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:04,987
Look at what?

181
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:07,552
Women are a better judge of women,
I tell you.

182
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:10,222
Why don't you come and have a seat?
Come on.

183
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:13,426
(Choi Eun Ji, 26,
Lee Ji Eun, 22)

184
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:17,026
Who do you think is
the best candidate?

185
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:19,367
Number 1 is 26 years old.

186
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,666
She's the eldest daughter
of a judge.

187
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,962
Number two is...

188
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,361
22 years old. The youngest daughter
of Baekwoon Textile.

189
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:30,072
- Number 3 is 24...
- Auntie!

190
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:38,981
Who do you think you're yelling at?

191
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:41,981
Why don't you choose someone
yourself then?

192
00:12:43,056 --> 00:12:46,857
Naive guys like you always let
cunning girls coax you...

193
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:49,026
and end up bringing home
the worst girls.

194
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:51,121
Auntie, you'd better go now.

195
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:53,436
Are you kicking me out right now?

196
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,197
I'll take care of myself,

197
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:56,506
so please mind your own business.

198
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:59,536
What? Hey, Soo Chan,
how can you say that to me?

199
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:01,276
- Please just go.
- What are you doing?

200
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:04,347
Let go of me. I said, let go!

201
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:07,176
Am I a stranger to you?
I'm your aunt!

202
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,312
Please! Go!

203
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:13,781
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:16,987
She's a very feisty woman.

205
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,851
She's just doing that
to find you a perfect match.

206
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:23,092
They all seemed like
great candidates...

207
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:28,636
I bet your aunt is going through
so much trouble for you...

208
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,261
since you're so picky.

209
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,731
What? I'm not picky.

210
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:34,802
I just don't like blind dates.

211
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,306
It's not like someone can meet
their other half...

212
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:41,741
based on
some silly matchmaking cards.

213
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:45,542
I'll look around too.

214
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:47,552
There are plenty of girls around me.

215
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,281
What's your ideal type?

216
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,162
Someone who's like a wildflower,
I guess?

217
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:06,977
Someone who never gives up
on her dream...

218
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:09,072
no matter how hard it is...

219
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:11,347
and never complains...

220
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:12,901
about having to devote herself
to her family.

221
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:20,011
A strong person that says no
to a sheltered life.

222
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:30,722
That's you.

223
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:33,067
Aren't I right?

224
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,432
Your ideal type is
a female version of yourself.

225
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,832
Gosh, it'll be very hard to find
someone like that.

226
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,101
("It's Been a Long Time,"
Love and Peace)

227
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:02,722
Then who is
Myeong Hee's favorite singer?

228
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:05,361
I'm not sure.

229
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,261
Bae In Sook?

230
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:08,792
Bae In Sook.

231
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:11,631
Then what is
Myeong Hee's favorite snack?

232
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,972
Sweet red bean jelly
and butter bread?

233
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:16,942
Sweet red bean jelly
and butter bread?

234
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:20,871
But what does this have to do
with math?

235
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:26,617
It's a necessary step
to figure out your study pattern.

236
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:29,011
Your previous tutor
used to be Myeong Hee, right?

237
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:30,556
If you don't review your past,

238
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,481
you will never move forward.

239
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,822
Jin A?

240
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,991
I have a new dream.

241
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:41,891
If I win an award
at the University Song Festival,

242
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:45,101
I want you to play my song
on the radio show...

243
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:46,562
that you produce in the future.

244
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:49,371
And the DJ will say,

245
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:50,947
"This is the musician..."

246
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:53,572
"that our producer discovered
before anyone else in the world."

247
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:55,312
- Hee Tae.
- What do you think?

248
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:57,582
Will you help me achieve my dream?

249
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:04,381
Then will you help me
achieve my dream?

250
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,452
Can you show me around Seoul
this summer break?

251
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:11,462
Show me TBC's broadcasting station
and your university too!

252
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:21,806
If you promise you'll do
all the homework I give you.

253
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,401
- I promise.
- Okay.

254
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:25,141
From here...

255
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:27,072
to here.

256
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,987
You want me to solve
all these questions?

257
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:33,617
Yes. If you start now,

258
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,552
you'll probably be done
in about two days.

259
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:36,682
You can do it!

260
00:16:37,256 --> 00:16:38,786
- I can do it!
- Jin A can do it!

261
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:39,857
Repeat it three times!

262
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,092
- I can do it!
- I can do it!

263

(1 p.m., Visit Sarang Orphanage)

265
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:01,871
It's tomorrow.

266
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,297
They might be fake coughs,
but you sound like...

267
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:24,462
you're coughing up a lung.

268
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,571
Gosh...

269
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:31,172
Do you want to go have
some butter bread at the bakery?

270
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:35,011
Or do you want to listen to
Bae In Sook at the coffee shop?

271
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:38,946
We could also go to the bookstore
and read some poetry.

272
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:41,612
Who tutored who now?

273
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,597
So aren't you going to tell me...

274
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,462
why you came
to the hospital earlier?

275
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:55,862
Goodness. I said it's nothing.

276
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,331
You're being awfully suspicious.

277
00:17:58,706 --> 00:18:02,231
You don't strike me
as the secretive type.

278
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,571
So I wonder just what it is
you're keeping from me.

279
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:11,382
Give me an answer first,
and I'll tell you.

280
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:17,081
- An answer?
- Yes, an answer.

281
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:22,192
I've sobered up completely.

282
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:27,991
I'll give you my answer
when you're sober.

283
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:39,372
- Gosh.
- You should leave now.

284
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:42,541
Why? Are you still not ready
to give me an answer?

285
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:45,017
I have to study later,

286
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:48,581
and I'm pretty beat
after my long shift.

287
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,486
Anyway, get going now.

288
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:53,926
All right.
Do you have time tomorrow then?

289
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,152
- I don't.
- You're lying!

290
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:58,622
It's true.

291
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,466
I have somewhere to be.

292
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:01,892
I'll come with you.

293
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:04,367
You don't even know where.

294
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:07,271
What? Is it somewhere I can't go?

295
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:12,547
Suit yourself then.

296
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:14,277
Really? Are you sure?

297
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,547
Meet me at the bus stop at 11 a.m.

298
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:18,541
You volunteered to go.

299
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,051
Sure.

300
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:31,392
So I guess we meet again.

301
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:34,662
I never imagined
I'd see you here though.

302
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:37,206
Eat first.

303
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:40,061
You'll need the energy for later.

304
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,432
I don't know anything.

305
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:49,612
If you're talking about
the wanted man that you were with,

306
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:52,011
he got caught.

307
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:58,051
I guess you're very trusted
by your gang.

308
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:00,751
He didn't doubt you
even for a second.

309
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:04,362
Have you been spying on me?

310
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:09,932
Let's just say I'm interested
in my future daughter-in-law.

311
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,402
Who says I'm going to be
your daughter-in-law?

312
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:21,341
Do you remember the company,
Bongdeok Brewery?

313
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:23,017
About ten years ago,

314
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:25,412
they were number one
in the entire Honam region.

315
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:29,617
In an effort to expand
throughout the country,

316
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:32,886
the chairman even made his daughter
marry a man in the KCIA,

317
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:34,527
but something went wrong.

318
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:35,757
Then, the company...

319
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:38,422
went out of business
after a series of tax audits.

320
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:41,962
The son-in-law was demoted
to South Jeolla Province.

321
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:48,271
That's how things are in this field.

322
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:51,807
They never force you...

323
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:54,011
into the direction
they want you to go.

324
00:20:56,746 --> 00:21:00,587
They just slowly
bleed those around you dry...

325
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:02,182
until you go in the right direction.

326
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:07,952
But human nature is a funny thing.

327
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:11,962
As you remain quiet,

328
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:16,231
you feel like you're a worse person
than the one bleeding everyone dry.

329
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:19,402
So...

330
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:25,301
keep your mouth shut...

331
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:27,972
as long as you want.

332
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:45,692
Right now,

333
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:49,362
your father must be busy
with the new factory.

334
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,402
So an engagement ceremony will do.

335
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:56,571
Also,

336
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:00,942
this is my limit.

337
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:04,341
Make sure
you don't cross the line again.

338
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:09,652
Get some sleep...

339
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:11,722
or meditate if you like.

340
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:35,071
Hee Tae. Please save Seok Chul.

341
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:38,685
Hee Tae! Please save her.

342
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,781
Hee Tae!

343
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:45,682
Please save her.

344
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:31,761
I must be getting weak.

345
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,331
I'm even hearing things now.

346
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:38,771
Jung Tae.

347
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,241
Jung Tae, open the door.

348
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,622
I'm joining the camp.

349
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:03,936
Later. Later, okay?

350
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:06,301
Father is on edge lately.

351
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:07,932
Later when?

352
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,472
I bet you'll make me quit track
next year.

353
00:24:12,277 --> 00:24:14,246
Stop acting like a little child.

354
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,517
Do you really want me to look
like a complete fool?

355
00:24:16,517 --> 00:24:18,612
Why? You don't have to.

356
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:22,081
This is why people call you
a mistress behind your back.

357
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:25,981
What?

358
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:33,591
Well...

359
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:36,632
I'm going to the bathroom.

360
00:24:58,656 --> 00:24:59,952
Where's Jung Tae?

361
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:02,122
Is he still in bed?

362
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:07,261
He's at school. He left early today.

363
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:10,932
This early?
He's still in grade school.

364
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:19,146
He said he had to leave early
and do some homework.

365
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:20,372
Homework?

366
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:25,841
I saw him leave.

367
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:27,781
He doesn't have homework.

368
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:32,327
I just recommended
a few books to him...

369
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:34,491
that he should read
before middle school.

370
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,666
You recommended books to him?

371
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:41,597
It wasn't a friendly recommendation.

372
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:44,561
I told him all the sports
could make him stupid,

373
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,932
and he rushed
to the library right away.

374
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:49,331
He's still a little kid after all.

375
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:56,672
At home, maybe.

376
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,442
At his age,
I was already earning my rent.

377
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,311
Hae Ryung, you shouldn't be
so protective of him.

378
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,922
(City bus)

379
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,531
Myeong Hee!

380
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:37,581
Well, first off, some boiled eggs.

381
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:41,622
And some soda
for when we get thirsty.

382
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:43,726
Last but not least,

383
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:47,392
your favorite, butter bread.

384
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,567
You don't even know
where we're going.

385
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,301
Do you think this is a picnic?

386
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:55,702
It's a picnic whenever I'm with you.

387
00:26:57,406 --> 00:27:00,372
Wait. What did you bring? Show me.

388
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:03,071
I didn't bring anything special.

389
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:07,311
Come on.
I see you packed a bunch of stuff.

390
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,226
- Show me.
- No.

391
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:12,722
No, because you hate me?

392
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:14,127
- No.
- Come on. Hand it over.

393
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:15,827
- I just...
- Let me see.

394
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:17,962
Look at this. It's so heavy.

395
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,602
Sweet red bean jelly.

396
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:28,702
Candy? My gosh.

397
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:30,872
What's this?

398
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,942
Herbal breath refresher?

399
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,571
Are you trying to quit smoking?

400
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:39,882
No, that's for...
Just in case I get car sick.

401
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:44,051
Oh, boy.

402
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,797
The more I get to know you,

403
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:49,892
the more I think
that you're like an old man.

404
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:51,722
Goodness. Give it back!

405
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:54,462
It's not like
you're all that sophisticated.

406
00:28:01,607 --> 00:28:02,771
Grandpa Myeong Hee.

407
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:06,246
I shall peel an egg
for Grandpa Myeong Hee.

408
00:28:06,246 --> 00:28:08,511
What? "Grandpa Myeong Hee?"

409
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:23,952
I have to say,

410
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:28,162
you're always so chipper, Hee Tae.

411
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:34,271
That sounded a little sarcastic.

412
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:37,702
No, it was a compliment.

413
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:40,372
Do I sound sarcastic when I talk?

414
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:43,642
No.

415
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:48,751
Here.

416
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:51,922
Where are we going anyway?

417
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:55,751
Tell me.

418
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:57,991
Come on, tell me!

419
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:01,996
Jae Young!

420
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:03,831
Oh, the witch is here!

421
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:07,872
Did they just call you a witch?

422
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:09,902
I gave them vaccination shots
last time I saw them.

423
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:11,702
Reverend Mother!

424
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:15,266
Myeong Hee!

425
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:17,126
(Sarang Orphanage)

426
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:18,292
My gosh.

427
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:21,462
I thought you wouldn't be able
to come.

428
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,407
Aren't you really busy
at the moment?

429
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:24,532
No.

430
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:27,272
- How have you been?
- I've been well.

431
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:31,072
By the way, who is this young man?

432
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:34,941
Oh, this is...

433
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:41,822
- I'm Myeong Hee's...
- He's a doctor.

434
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:43,526
What?

435
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:46,127
My gosh, you're a doctor?

436
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:47,157
That's great.

437
00:29:47,157 --> 00:29:49,391
We have a few kids
who need to see a doctor.

438
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,615
No, I'm not yet...

439
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:52,717
He just got his medical license.

440
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:55,052
He's a rookie doctor.

441
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:58,921
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

442
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:21,051
Myeong Hee, I can't treat patients.

443
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:23,226
I told you already,
I haven't even graduated...

444
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:24,766
You passed
the medical licensing exam.

445
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:27,591
You only deferred your graduation
for the University Song Festival.

446
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:36,107
No. I really can't do this.

447
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:37,506
I'll do something else.

448
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,546
I can clean, carry heavy things...

449
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,841
Oh, I'm good with kids too.

450
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:44,587
You don't have to treat them.
Just examine them.

451
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:46,456
I'm not asking you to do surgery
or anything.

452
00:30:46,456 --> 00:30:49,157
Just examine the kids
to make sure they're all well.

453
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:51,051
You've done that much in school,
haven't you?

454
00:30:53,996 --> 00:30:56,992
Well, I have a lot to do.

455
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:59,162
I trust you'll do a good job.

456
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,061
Gosh.

457
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:26,821
Let me listen to your tummy
for a second.

458
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,162
You're all good.

459
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,972
Say "ah." Open wide.

460
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:45,012
There you go. Look up. Good.

461
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,772
Stick it out even further.

462
00:31:48,387 --> 00:31:50,311
This might sting a little.

463
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:03,692
- He'll get better soon.
- Thank you, doctor.

464
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:16,801
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

465
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:27,081
Kids take twice as much energy
as grown-ups, right?

466
00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:29,781
What...

467
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,391
Well...

468
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:38,932
Why are you more tired than me
when I did all the hard work?

469
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:41,436
Are you okay?

470
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:43,762
It looked like
you were sweating a lot.

471
00:32:44,877 --> 00:32:46,831
Well, that's because...

472
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:49,972
my blood sugar level dropped.

473
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,442
This is great.

474
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:55,817
I was debating...

475
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:58,242
whether I should stuff myself
with the grass or the soil.

476
00:32:58,286 --> 00:33:01,486
It's like we communicate
through telepathy.

477
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:04,482
My energy level is shooting back up!

478
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,861
Just don't become a pediatrician
in the future.

479
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:16,637
I'll go and finish up some work.

480
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:19,031
- Stay here and rest up.
- I can help you.

481
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:21,902
Forget it. It's only some paperwork.

482
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,601
Enjoy the bread.

483
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:25,742
But...

484
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:40,051
Oh, dear.

485
00:33:47,397 --> 00:33:48,631
Hi there.

486
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:52,772
We haven't met.

487
00:33:58,347 --> 00:34:00,012
Do you want some?

488
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:03,841
Here you go.

489
00:34:06,617 --> 00:34:08,311
Slow down.

490
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:12,692
By the way,

491
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:15,126
about that good-looking doctor...

492
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:16,462
How do you know each other?

493
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:19,196
This is the first time
you've brought someone along...

494
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:21,291
apart from Hye Gun and Sun Min.

495
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,606
For a nun,
you sure are interested...

496
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,741
in relationships
between men and women.

497
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:33,411
I knew it.
So is it that kind of relationship?

498
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:36,486
That's not what I mean.
What I mean is,

499
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:38,886
we're a man and a woman,
biologically speaking.

500
00:34:38,887 --> 00:34:40,212
That's all.

501
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:44,181
Myeong Hee.

502
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:49,121
Something's wrong with the kid.

503
00:34:58,106 --> 00:35:00,672
Young Mi.

504
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:03,541
Open your eyes. Young Mi.

505
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:11,581
Did you perhaps give her
something to eat?

506
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:16,451
I gave her some bread.
The bread you gave me.

507
00:35:19,157 --> 00:35:21,592
She has gastroenteritis
and is not allowed to eat.

508
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:29,336
It's okay. Goodness.

509
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,606
It's okay.

510
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:34,701
Keep going, Young Mi. Don't worry.

511
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:45,782
Hee Tae, it's okay.

512
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:51,081
Hee Tae.

513
00:35:53,227 --> 00:35:54,391
Hee Tae!

514
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,291
Yes.

515
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,632
It's okay.

516
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:02,402
It's nothing serious.
She's okay now.

517
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,077
I'll go get some water.

518
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:13,272
No, I'll go.

519
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:16,141
Sit down and get some rest.

520
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:17,681
I'll be right back.

521
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:51,041
Hey, wait!

522
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:54,681
Hey, can you please not do this
during exam season?

523
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:57,427
Just take him to the hospital.

524
00:36:57,427 --> 00:37:00,022
You know I brought him here
because I can't do that.

525
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:15,871
Please be gentle.

526
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:20,077
You won't find a surgeon...

527
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:23,181
who'd be gentler than this
even at a university hospital.

528
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:24,641
That's true.

529
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:27,081
He's the top student
at our med school.

530
00:37:27,387 --> 00:37:29,026
- We call him Hua Tuo.
- Hua Tuo, my foot.

531
00:37:29,026 --> 00:37:31,422
I'll stitch your lips together.

532
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:32,696
Hua Tuo?

533
00:37:32,696 --> 00:37:34,152
Is my specialty treating fugitives?

534
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,291
What if I get caught doing this
and get expelled from school?

535
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:40,061
Will you take responsibility
for my future?

536
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:42,232
Yes, I should.

537
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:44,632
I'll write lyrics
while you compose songs.

538
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:47,106
We'll win the grand prize
at the University Song Festival.

539
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:49,247
You troublemaker.

540
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:52,311
At this rate,
we'll be dragged to Namsan first.

541
00:37:55,387 --> 00:37:56,511
Seriously!

542
00:37:56,617 --> 00:37:58,541
Stay still
while I'm stitching the wound.

543
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:01,782
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Thanks.

544
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:07,652
Hee Tae,

545
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:09,991
you'll be a great doctor.

546
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,466
Go write some lyrics
for the song festival.

547
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,502
Don't use the night school
as an excuse to date.

548
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:17,962
Hey, what are you talking about?

549
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:19,537
You know what I'm talking about.

550
00:38:19,537 --> 00:38:21,871
I can tell from the lyrics
you've been writing!

551
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,272
Hey.

552
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:31,842
Don't bring anyone else, please.

553
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:33,811
Thanks.

554
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:35,827
- Get going.
- Bye.

555
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:36,951
Bye.

556
00:38:56,946 --> 00:38:58,641
Hey, do you realize what time it is?

557
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:01,442
Hee Tae.

558
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:04,041
Please save Seok Chul.

559
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:19,092
Her pulse is weak,

560
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:21,061
and she's lost a lot of blood.

561
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:22,802
You should take her to the hospital.

562
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:25,376
No, not the hospital.

563
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:28,532
I know you brought her to me
because you can't take her there.

564
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:29,672
Darn it.

565
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:34,141
You know the small clinic
down the street?

566
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:35,916
Knock on the door,
and someone will come out.

567
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,316
Tell them I sent you.
It's my friend's clinic.

568
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:38,482
Okay.

569
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:48,152
Hee Tae.

570
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:50,922
Save her.

571
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:53,632
You must save her, no matter what.

572
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:55,962
Okay. You need to hurry.

573
00:40:07,946 --> 00:40:09,241
Darn it.

574
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:14,652
Gosh, this is crazy.

575
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,761
Stop!

576
00:40:33,477 --> 00:40:35,902
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Stay still!

577
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:37,677
- Let go of me.
- Hey!

578
00:40:37,677 --> 00:40:38,942
Cuff this punk.

579
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:44,081
Please...

580
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:47,681
Can someone please come
and help me? Anyone?

581
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:06,632
Hee Tae.

582
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:11,201
Hee Tae.

583
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:40,732
I'm not qualified to be a doctor.

584
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:47,471
I chose this path
because I wanted to treat the ill,

585
00:41:50,517 --> 00:41:51,712
but everything I touch...

586
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:54,052
just breaks.

587
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:07,391
Maybe your heart is the one
that is broken.

588
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:12,772
You know,

589
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:15,802
we don't decide who lives or dies.

590
00:42:16,807 --> 00:42:18,672
That decision is up to the Almighty.

591
00:42:20,177 --> 00:42:23,011
All we can do is do our best
within the lines...

592
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:26,911
drawn by the Almighty.

593
00:42:31,557 --> 00:42:32,951
And...

594
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:35,862
if I may share my opinion
as someone...

595
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:38,522
who's working in the same field,

596
00:42:40,637 --> 00:42:41,791
I know for a fact...

597
00:42:44,537 --> 00:42:46,632
that you'll be a great doctor.

598
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:49,977
You're beating yourself up
like this...

599
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:51,802
because you're
a very responsible person.

600
00:42:53,816 --> 00:42:55,511
And people like that
are hard to come by.

601
00:43:03,657 --> 00:43:05,152
I'm not being sarcastic.

602
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:32,811
There.

603
00:44:13,296 --> 00:44:15,791
I can't believe you did this again
knowing what's going on.

604
00:44:15,966 --> 00:44:18,022
Aren't you ashamed
to face your family?

605
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:20,696
I've never done anything
to be ashamed of.

606
00:44:20,696 --> 00:44:21,937
How could you say that...

607
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:24,201
after humiliating me in front of
your future father-in-law?

608
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:25,632
Father.

609
00:44:28,137 --> 00:44:30,641
I won't get married.

610
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:32,477
What? What are you talking about?

611
00:44:32,477 --> 00:44:33,641
I just...

612
00:44:33,946 --> 00:44:36,112
couldn't muster up the courage
to say this to you.

613
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,086
I have no interest
in getting married...

614
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:40,756
and getting involved
with that kind of family...

615
00:44:40,756 --> 00:44:43,552
That family will help us
with the business.

616
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:45,022
What?

617
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:46,427
The company is about to go bust,

618
00:44:46,427 --> 00:44:48,626
so I couldn't turn down their offer.

619
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:50,592
All my enemies want my business
to go bust.

620
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:52,867
And my daughter jumps into flames...

621
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:54,166
with gunpowder in her hand
any chance she gets.

622
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,561
So what choice do I have?

623
00:44:56,807 --> 00:44:58,207
Father!

624
00:44:58,207 --> 00:44:59,471
It's already decided.

625
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:00,772
Earlier today,

626
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:03,442
your brother met the investor
they put us in touch with.

627
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,646
Technical partnerships...

628
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:08,241
are already very common
in other countries.

629
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:11,782
The construction for the factory
is expected to be completed soon.

630
00:45:11,847 --> 00:45:13,252
So I'm certain...

631
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:15,482
we can start selling the products
by the end of this year.

632
00:45:15,827 --> 00:45:18,026
(Lee Soo Chan,
Changhwa Pharmaceuticals)

633
00:45:18,026 --> 00:45:20,026
This isn't some kids' game.
We can't just back out...

634
00:45:20,026 --> 00:45:21,891
because we've now changed our minds.

635
00:45:22,227 --> 00:45:23,896
With just one word,
he can make companies go bankrupt...

636
00:45:23,896 --> 00:45:25,192
and make people disappear.

637
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:26,566
You, of all people,

638
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:28,561
must know
what Mr. Hwang is capable of.

639
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:31,502
Just get married.

640
00:45:32,336 --> 00:45:34,532
I don't care if people criticize me
for selling off my daughter.

641
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:36,041
Our family...

642
00:45:36,506 --> 00:45:39,442
is already on the back of the tiger.
If we fall off,

643
00:45:41,276 --> 00:45:42,741
we'll get eaten alive.

Why? Let me go with you.
We're almost there anyway.

00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,517
Come on, she's probably busy
doing her homework right now.

650
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:22,152
I can go alone.

651
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:26,121
Okay then.

652
00:46:26,756 --> 00:46:29,092
I enjoyed today's picnic,
Myeong Hee.

653
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:30,721
Handshake?

654
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:42,132
Me too.
Thank you for everything today.

655
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:58,621
Look back.

656
00:46:59,696 --> 00:47:03,661
Look back. Look back...

657
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:05,931
Look back!

658
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,471
Hey! Gosh.

659
00:47:18,707 --> 00:47:22,011
I was wishing you'd look back.

660
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:23,382
Did you hear it?

661
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:27,851
I'll give you my answer...

662
00:47:28,756 --> 00:47:30,252
tomorrow.

663
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:39,232
Can't you answer me today?

664
00:47:40,336 --> 00:47:42,661
There's something
I need to sort out.

665
00:47:43,466 --> 00:47:46,032
I'll tell you tomorrow afternoon
after my shift.

666
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:48,132
Here.

667
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:06,422
Yes!

668
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:16,701
(Head of Anti-communist
Investigation, Hwang Ki Nam)

669
00:48:45,066 --> 00:48:48,491
(Kim Myeong Hee)

670
00:48:48,966 --> 00:48:51,931
(Father, Kim Hyun Chul)

671
00:48:56,946 --> 00:49:00,112
(Kim Hyun Chul, Choi Soon Nyu,
Kim Myeong Soo)

672
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:26,376
- Hello?
- Hey, Soo Ryeon.

673
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:29,741
What happened the other day?
I couldn't reach you.

674
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:35,471
Myeong Hee.
Something suddenly came up.

675
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:39,612
What? Is it something serious?

676
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:42,882
No. It's not serious at all.

677
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:45,252
So, what's up?

678
00:49:46,327 --> 00:49:50,661
Can I see you
before I go to work later?

679
00:49:50,966 --> 00:49:54,862
The thing is...
I have something to tell you.

680
00:50:00,937 --> 00:50:04,601
Sorry, I don't have time today.

681
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:08,241
I have plans.

682
00:50:09,146 --> 00:50:11,342
(Watch repair)

683
00:50:17,086 --> 00:50:18,887
Can I get my watch repaired now?

684
00:50:18,887 --> 00:50:22,522
You'll have to wait
about 15 minutes.

685
00:50:23,026 --> 00:50:24,991
Can't you look at mine first?

686
00:50:24,997 --> 00:50:26,831
I just need a new battery.

687
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:28,391
Let me see it.

688
00:50:34,836 --> 00:50:38,041
(The Blue House)

689
00:50:44,517 --> 00:50:47,081
Oh, look who it is.

690
00:50:47,287 --> 00:50:49,212
Aren't you Hyun Chul?

691
00:50:50,187 --> 00:50:52,621
How have you been?

692
00:50:53,126 --> 00:50:55,221
Is your mother still alive?

693
00:51:02,497 --> 00:51:04,232
Just tell me what you want.

694
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:07,572
There's no need to be so edgy.

695
00:51:07,677 --> 00:51:09,776
I just came to get a new battery
and see you as well.

696
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:11,302
We're old neighborhood friends
after all.

697
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:20,052
I see your daughter is having
a lot of fun lately.

698
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:23,322
Keep a good eye on your daughter.

699
00:51:23,356 --> 00:51:25,221
She's not a kid anymore.

700
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:27,491
I won't go easy either.

701
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:41,371
You don't have to pay me.

702
00:51:47,776 --> 00:51:49,342
I'll see you later.

703
00:52:00,126 --> 00:52:01,896
Let me say it again.

704
00:52:01,896 --> 00:52:05,721
The most important thing
in track and field is the line.

705
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:09,097
Especially when you run,

706
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:12,735
if you cross into
another runner's track,

707
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:16,471
you may get disqualified
for deviating from your own track.

708
00:52:16,977 --> 00:52:20,347
Hence, do not trespass
into another runner's zone,

709
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:23,046
and always stay within your line...

710
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:24,887
and run as fast as you can.

711
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:27,681
That's my main point.

712
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:31,157
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes.

713
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:34,022
Is there a boy named
Myeong Soo here?

714
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:35,692
That's me.

715
00:52:37,727 --> 00:52:39,221
Father.

716
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:42,561
Be careful, you might fall down.

717
00:52:42,597 --> 00:52:45,462
Why are you here?
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

718
00:52:45,836 --> 00:52:47,201
No reason.

719
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:50,402
I missed my little bear,
so I came early.

720
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:53,876
How is Myeong Hee doing?

721
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:55,376
She's doing fine.

722
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:58,187
Father, I shortened my record
by two seconds.

723
00:52:58,187 --> 00:52:59,687
My coach told me...

724
00:52:59,687 --> 00:53:02,256
that I can run
with the middle schooler next time.

725
00:53:02,256 --> 00:53:03,727
Is that so?

726
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:06,152
Gosh, that's amazing, son.

727
00:53:06,457 --> 00:53:09,296
Are you getting along well
with the other kids?

728
00:53:09,296 --> 00:53:12,592
Well, almost all of them,
except for one guy.

729
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:19,971
Hey. Are you Myeong Soo's friend?

730
00:53:23,446 --> 00:53:25,302
Speak of the devil.

731
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:28,741
Man, that annoying jerk.

732
00:53:29,517 --> 00:53:31,141
Don't say that to a friend.

733
00:53:35,486 --> 00:53:36,586
Here.

734
00:53:36,586 --> 00:53:39,652
I bought plenty,
so share it with the others.

735
00:53:39,957 --> 00:53:42,057
Wait, isn't this pulbbang?

736
00:53:42,057 --> 00:53:44,761
Gosh, you didn't have to.

737
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,836
My goodness.
Where did you learn to say that?

738
00:53:48,836 --> 00:53:51,002
You don't have to say that to me.

739
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:55,732
Me too?

740
00:53:58,106 --> 00:53:59,971
It's good.

741
00:54:00,177 --> 00:54:02,416
Hey, let's go this way.

742
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:03,916
I told you!

743
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,687
I told you it's this way.

744
00:54:06,687 --> 00:54:08,887
Come on, let's go.

745
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:11,581
- Hurry up, it's this way.
- Okay.

746
00:54:18,597 --> 00:54:21,831
I'd better get going now.

747
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:23,437
Already?

748
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:25,137
You should come meet my coach...

749
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,502
and the place I'm staying at.

750
00:54:28,637 --> 00:54:30,842
It's okay, there's no need.

751
00:54:31,506 --> 00:54:34,911
Your mom sent
some clothes and underwear.

752
00:54:35,316 --> 00:54:38,411
You should go now. Go on.

753
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:43,382
Go on.

754
00:54:43,887 --> 00:54:46,052
Go on now.

755
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:09,842
Hey, isn't that pulbbang?

756
00:55:11,146 --> 00:55:14,451
Let's go inside and eat it
before the others see us.

757
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:17,851
Shall I call Jung Tae over?

758
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:25,462
Let's just keep it a secret.

759
00:55:39,407 --> 00:55:42,371
Do it again! That's so funny.

760
00:56:19,486 --> 00:56:21,287
I don't have time
for bickering today.

761
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:23,052
Get straight to the point.

762
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:28,451
I met your father yesterday
at the Defense Security Command.

763
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:31,121
He tried to threaten me...

764
00:56:31,896 --> 00:56:33,331
into getting engaged to you.

765
00:56:35,597 --> 00:56:37,002
That's my father's specialty.

766
00:56:37,537 --> 00:56:38,632
So?

767
00:56:41,537 --> 00:56:44,201
Your family is getting involved
in my father's business.

768
00:56:45,006 --> 00:56:46,471
Did you know that?

769
00:56:52,086 --> 00:56:53,351
How would I have known?

770
00:56:56,086 --> 00:56:57,282
Like I said,

771
00:56:58,026 --> 00:57:00,522
we won't be able to back out
once things get more serious.

772
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:05,192
So what's your plan?

773
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:10,161
My father's factory...

774
00:57:11,336 --> 00:57:13,002
will be finished in a month.

775
00:57:16,747 --> 00:57:19,871
Let's keep this up until then.

776
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:23,041
After that, I'll do as you say.

777
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:28,752
Once the factory is finished,

778
00:57:28,986 --> 00:57:31,626
should we get engaged to make sure
the factory runs smoothly...

779
00:57:31,626 --> 00:57:33,057
and even get married...

780
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:34,727
until the business takes off?

781
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:36,322
I don't need your sarcasm.

782
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:38,422
This is driving me crazy as it is.

783
00:57:38,466 --> 00:57:40,497
Fine. I'll be straightforward then.

784
00:57:40,497 --> 00:57:41,661
I don't want to.

785
00:57:43,267 --> 00:57:45,232
- You don't want to?
- No.

786
00:57:48,577 --> 00:57:50,002
Then what about
my father's business?

787
00:57:50,506 --> 00:57:51,907
What about my family?

788
00:57:51,907 --> 00:57:55,077
Look, don't put all the blame on me.

789
00:57:55,077 --> 00:57:56,387
You started all this.

790
00:57:56,387 --> 00:57:57,612
Hwang Hee Tae.

791
00:58:16,137 --> 00:58:17,661
Let's tell the truth...

792
00:58:18,137 --> 00:58:19,502
and take responsibility equally.

793
00:58:19,977 --> 00:58:23,172
We shouldn't cross the line
just to save ourselves for now.

794
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:32,911
If you need someone
to beg for forgiveness with you,

795
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:35,081
call me.

796
00:58:58,707 --> 00:58:59,971
Why did you do that?

797
00:59:03,046 --> 00:59:04,212
I mean earlier.

798
00:59:04,946 --> 00:59:06,442
Why did you punch him?

799
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:10,951
Just because. I couldn't stand him.

800
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:13,991
You're impossible.

801
00:59:14,657 --> 00:59:16,822
Didn't you hear
what the coach said earlier?

802
00:59:17,196 --> 00:59:19,161
"Don't cross the line."

803
00:59:19,997 --> 00:59:22,831
Why cross the line
and get yourself into a mess?

804
00:59:27,707 --> 00:59:30,201
You must've missed
some of the stuff the coach said.

805
00:59:31,106 --> 00:59:32,201
What?

806
00:59:32,376 --> 00:59:35,172
In long-distance running,
it's okay to cross the line.

807
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:37,347
You need to know
just when to cross the line.

808
00:59:37,347 --> 00:59:38,712
That's what makes a good runner.

809
00:59:40,687 --> 00:59:42,482
And we run 1,000m.

810
00:59:51,597 --> 00:59:53,561
Eat them
before you brush your teeth.

811
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:16,922
(Cashier)

812
01:00:19,756 --> 01:00:21,856
So Ms. Jang will be transferred
in a private ambulance...

813
01:00:21,856 --> 01:00:23,267
that you hired in Seoul?

814
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:24,661
Yes.

815
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,732
I already paid for it.

816
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:34,437
Then please make sure
she is transferred here on time.

817
01:00:34,437 --> 01:00:35,632
(Receipt)

818
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:41,177
Is everything all set?

819
01:00:41,177 --> 01:00:42,842
Yes, you're good to go.

820
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:47,851
(Receipt)

821
01:00:49,927 --> 01:00:51,081
Hey, grunt.

822
01:00:51,157 --> 01:00:53,451
It's me again, Hee Tae.

823
01:00:54,457 --> 01:00:57,761
Your dear Seok Chul
will be transferred to Gwangju soon.

824
01:00:58,227 --> 01:01:00,661
So visit her in Gwangju
if you miss her.

825
01:01:06,437 --> 01:01:07,532
You see,

826
01:01:07,907 --> 01:01:09,946
if only you knew
how much trouble I went to,

827
01:01:09,946 --> 01:01:11,871
you'd write me back immediately.

828
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:18,942
Her transfer won't get you out
of the military...

829
01:01:19,247 --> 01:01:22,112
or help her recover,

830
01:01:23,017 --> 01:01:24,882
but I hope it'll help us all...

831
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:27,152
finally take a step forward
from that day.

832
01:01:28,057 --> 01:01:30,192
(From Hwang Hee Tae,
To Kim Kyung Soo)

833
01:01:31,566 --> 01:01:33,831
I'm finally ready
to slowly walk forward...

834
01:01:34,396 --> 01:01:36,391
from the line I drew that day.

835
01:01:40,376 --> 01:01:41,876
(Samyang Flower Shop)

836
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:43,032
PS,

837
01:01:43,577 --> 01:01:45,201
you once told me...

838
01:01:46,177 --> 01:01:49,541
that I wrote bad lyrics
because I didn't know love.

839
01:01:50,816 --> 01:01:52,581
But I think I'm ready now.

840
01:01:53,486 --> 01:01:55,011
There's someone who can help me.

841
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:21,612
Myeong Hee.

842
01:02:29,856 --> 01:02:31,022
Hee Tae.

843
01:02:32,557 --> 01:02:33,721
Yes?

844
01:02:38,026 --> 01:02:39,322
Can you...

845
01:02:45,207 --> 01:02:46,831
get engaged to Soo Ryeon?

846
01:03:08,557 --> 01:03:11,362
(Youth of May)

847
01:03:24,646 --> 01:03:25,807
To settle the situation,

848
01:03:25,807 --> 01:03:27,747
I thought I should tell you
as soon as possible.

849
01:03:27,747 --> 01:03:28,776
Hwang Hee Tae.

850
01:03:28,776 --> 01:03:31,416
- Aren't we even saying hi now?
- I didn't have time to.

851
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:33,887
You can continue to see other women
even after you get married.

852
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,057
Like how you dated my mother?

853
01:03:35,057 --> 01:03:37,157
Hwang Ki Nam, the Head of
Anti-communist Investigation, right?

854
01:03:37,157 --> 01:03:39,557
She was picking out a ring,
looking all happy.

855
01:03:39,557 --> 01:03:41,256
I was going to return your favor.

856
01:03:41,256 --> 01:03:44,126
You're supposed to buy a new outfit
when your sibling gets engaged.

857
01:03:44,126 --> 01:03:45,927
- Soo Chan, you're here.
- My future brother-in-law.

858
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:47,997
My goodness,
you look like a movie star.

859
01:03:47,997 --> 01:03:50,701
Myeong Hee, what are you doing here?
