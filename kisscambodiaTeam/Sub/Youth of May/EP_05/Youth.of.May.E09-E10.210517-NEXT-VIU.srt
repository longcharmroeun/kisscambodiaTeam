You made and distributed illegal propaganda leaflets.

Yes.

to get engaged to Lee Soo Ryeon?

00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:01,534
I heard your family...

26
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,344
is now involved in her family's business.

27
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,480
If the factory doesn't get built...

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,945
I'm not asking about Soo Ryeon. What's your reason?

29
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:17,885
Did you invest in Changhwa Pharmaceuticals?

30
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,684
Then I'll understand.

31
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,024
To me, Soo Ryeon is...

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,764
as important as Kyung Soo is to you.

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,839
I encouraged her...

34
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,595
when I should've stopped her if anything.

35
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,105

I'll beat myself up for it for the rest of my life.

39

I wanted to see you even for just a moment.

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,430
I was actually wondering if I should call you...

58
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,064
and see you tonight even if it's late.

59

61
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,374
I'm going to start seeing Hee Tae.

62
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,744
I thought I should tell you first.

Can you please try to persuade Hee Tae?

69

You told me that he already said no.

How can I...

71
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,364
He may change his mind if you ask him to do it.

72

Help me just this once.

73

I'm sorry for stopping by unannounced at this early hour.

Yes, stay still. I'll take it now.

Hey, smile a little.

112
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,895
No, not a smirk.

Lucky you for having a friend like me.

It would've taken you at least two days...

117
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,454
even if you had gone to every photo studio downtown.

Lee Soo Ryeon? Did she lend you the money?

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,174
I thought you didn't want to ask for a favor.

124
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,104
Well, that's how it turned out.

125
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:55,375
I guess she has a conscience.

126
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,674
I'm glad.

127
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,820
Don't even think of paying it back and just use it.

128
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,255
Think of it as compensation.

129
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,584
Compensation for what?

130
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,530
You know, for what happened in high school.

If you hadn't taken all the blame,

132
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,400
you wouldn't have to be making a passport like this.

133
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,869
You would've gone to a nice university here...

and lived a proud life like her.

135
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,440
Why do you keep mentioning that?

136
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,365
Soo Ryeon had nothing to do with that.

137
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:20,209
Okay, whatever you say.

138
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:23,339
Lady Soo Ryeon had nothing to do with it whatsoever...

139

and it was all voluntary?

00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,795
You always pretend to be strong and unfazed...

145
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,900
but eventually end up taking all the blame...

146
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,094
and giving everything away.

147
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,765
Don't you have any pride?

148
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,834
You're not even saying hi now?

149
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,314
I didn't have time to.

150
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,344
I'm too busy preparing for the engagement ceremony.

151
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:40,684
Hello.

152
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,584
I heard.

153
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,125
That you're getting engaged.

154
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,795
Thank you.

155
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,334
Instead of thanking me,

156
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,535
don't you have anything else to say?

157
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,074
I'm sorry...

158
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,074
for forcing you to do this.

159
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,054
Instead of saying "thank you" or "I'm sorry",

160
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:19,554
I'm asking you how you really feel.

161
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,594
Like whether you feel happy or sad.

162
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,434
If you tell me to stop, I will.

163
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,304
I'll stop right away.

164
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,944
I'm going to leave soon anyway.

165
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,584
And you and Soo Ryeon...

166
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,584
will have to stay.

167
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,184
I don't want to cause trouble just to be happy for a short while.

168
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:03,035
So this is how you hold yourself back.

169
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,505

334
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,170
Feel free to look around...

335
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,304
and let me know if you'd like to try something on.

336
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,574
Okay.

337
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,884
What are you doing?

338
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,455
I'm looking at clothes.

339
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,124
Go pick out a dress for yourself instead.

340
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,425
Don't tell me...

341
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,495
you think we're going to pick out clothes for each other.

342
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,894
Well, fine.

343
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:39,364
Go and ask Myeong Hee to persuade me again.

344
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,209
Who knows if I'll go along with it again?

345
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,604
Don't be ridiculous.

346
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,104
Why would I want to do that with you?

347
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,045
Then go on upstairs.

348
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,945
You're a jerk.

349
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:57,485
I'll come back tomorrow with my brother.

350
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,854
Okay, sure.

351
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,535
Congratulations on your engagement.

352
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,675
Did you find any jewelry you like?

353
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:26,945
So you joined hands with the dog of the military dictatorship?

354
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,785
You, Lee Soo Ryeon,

355
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,225
of all people?

356
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,654
I don't know what to say.

357
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,795
- But... - Forget it.

358
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,965
Did you rat on Won Seok?

359
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,969
I never did anything like that.

360
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:49,175
Do you expect us to believe you?

361
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:52,144
You were the only person who was in touch with him.

362
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,045
There you are.

363
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,590
I'm sorry to interrupt the people's court,

364
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,519
but we have more to prepare before our engagement.

365
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,685
Hey.

366
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:08,999
Can I take her away?

367
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,360
Who are you?

368
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,930
Me? I'm her fiance...

369
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,834
and the son of the Head of Anti-communist Investigation,

370
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,404
the puppy of the military dictatorship.

371
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,479
If you haven't found a job yet,

372
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,334
why not consider the Defense Security Command?

373
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,604
What?

374
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,479
It's just that I think you're really cut out for it.

375
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:34,519
You find a target, cook up a hypothesis,

376
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,354
and pretend it's a fact.

377
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:38,959
That's what my father does all the time.

378
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,759
What did you just say, punk?

379
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:44,160
There you go. I knew you'd grab me by the collar.

380
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,370
Come here.

381
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,795
What? What are you doing?

382
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,864
Pretend we're friends.

383
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,404
If it looks like we're fighting... You see the two cars over there?

384
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,505
You guys might get arrested.

385
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,814
Hey, let's go. Come on.

386
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,884
What? You're leaving?

387
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:13,255
Listen, fighters.

388
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,824
Come over on the weekend if you have time.

389
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,525
I'll prepare a really nice dinner!

390
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,074
Are we really being watched?

391
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,975
I don't know.

392
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,049
They want you to pick out your dress today.

393
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:41,314
The fitting takes time.

394
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,255
Come on.

395
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,140
What are the odds of us running into each other in Seoul?

396
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,340
At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that?

397
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,709
I know.

398
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:02,940
Without your help,

399
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,804
I would've had to forget about studying abroad.

400
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,814
Is that so? Then I shouldn't have helped.

401
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,019
Anyway, your passport will be ready soon.

402
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,719
Just apply for your visa in time.

403
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:20,725
I don't have any friends at the embassy.

404
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,025
Okay.

405
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,054
Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

406
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,930
Myeong Hee, would you like something to eat?

407
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,940
We won't arrive until well past lunchtime.

408
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,894
Let me get you something.

409
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:34,610
Hold on. Are you trying to humiliate me?

410
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,580
Come on. Forget it.

411
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,309
I mean it. It's my treat.

412
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,609
Seriously. Don't do this.

413
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,219
This isn't enough.

414
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:43,850
Buy me something more expensive sometime.

415
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,745
- Fine. - Here.

416
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:48,144
- Excuse me. - Yes, sir?

417
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:52,229
Can I get you something?

418
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:55,255
Let me see. Some bread,

419
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,795
butter cookies, soda...

420
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,299
Here's your soda.

421
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:04,134
- I'll take eggs too. - Sure.

422
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,564
Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

423
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,350
I shall peel an egg for Grandpa Myeong Hee.

424
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,614
What? "Grandpa Myeong Hee"?

425
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,205
Myeong Hee.

426
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,205
Thank you.

427
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,074
Squid, peanuts, and eggs!

428
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:15,865
No.

429
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,374
It says here that Y is a natural number.

430
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:22,439
X is greater than 36,

431
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,505
and Y is a natural number. So which quadrant is it?

432
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,045
The first quadrant.

433
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,715
Right, the first quadrant.

434
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,584
- Here. - Hold on.

435
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:40,024
Where is the third quadrant?

436
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,969
Jin A, didn't you learn this in middle school?

437
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:50,965
I don't know!

438
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,968
My brain isn't functioning...

439
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:54,975
as we've been doing this for three hours.

440
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,804
Sit up.

441
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,775
Come on.

442
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,784
At this rate, you can't go to Seoul during your school break.

443
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:06,855
You said you wanted to check out TBC.

444
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,990
I should've just gone to Seoul with Myeong Hee.

445
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,155
Seoul?

446
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,930
What's she doing in Seoul?

447
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,325
She went to the Capitol building to get her passport made.

448
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,100
I should've tagged along...

449
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,165
to see Gyeongbok Palace and check out Seoul.

450
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,040
Are you going somewhere?

451
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,105
Oh, I have to go to Seoul.

452
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,215
How will you solve functions when you don't even know quadrants?

453
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:41,954
Open your book.

454
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,600
Thank you for the ride.

455
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,799
You helped me out so much all day today.

456
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,935
Come on. Your place is on my way home anyway.

457
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:01,974
Thank you so much again. I'll be sure to return the favor.

458
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:04,645
Get home safely.

459
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,104
All right. Good night.

460
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,344
Myeong Hee.

461
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,555
If you have some time tomorrow,

462
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,754
can you help me with something?

463
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:36,775
Hee Tae, what are you doing here?

464
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:41,275
Did you go to Seoul earlier?

465
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,284
- Yes. - With Soo Chan?

466
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,254
How did you know?

467
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:53,925
You could've asked me to go with you.

468
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,699
How could I do that knowing you're getting engaged?

469
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:58,824
Why not?

470
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:02,034
All you had to do was ask me, but you didn't.

471
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,539
Look, this is...

472
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,335
All you had to do was ask.

473
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:07,979
You know that I'm waiting for you to say...

474
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:09,974
Exactly. So how can I, knowing that?

475
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,115
If we went to Seoul together, what about your engagement?

476
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,354
What will you say to your family as well as to Soo Ryeon's?

477
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,189
What do you expect me to do...

478
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:24,830
when there's nothing I can do?

479
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,685
Why do you say there's nothing you can do?

480
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,594
Do they have something on you?

481
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:31,224
Is someone threatening you?

482
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,064
- Hee Tae. - No, right?

483
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,504
You just don't want to be a bad person.

484
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,275
Do you think I'm not afraid of anything?

485
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,344
You probably think I don't even care what people think of me.

486
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,275
I'm trying to hold back every single moment.

487
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:52,015
Because it's you.

488
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:54,715
Because I believed you felt the same way about me.

489
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,055
We only have a month.

490
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,895
I don't even want to let a day pass by like this.

491
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,934
I thought you were holding back too.

492
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,775
But I guess you're...

493
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,945
I guess you're okay.

494
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,344
I'm done writing letters to someone who won't write me back.

495
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,895
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

496
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,895
What brings you by so late?

497
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,434
Well, here.

498
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,434
Can you give this to Soo Ryeon?

499
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,344
What is this?

500
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:59,505
You can give it to her yourself.

501
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:02,575
Well, I'm not invited to her engagement ceremony.

502
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:04,945
Plus...

503
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:08,184
She won't want to see me because it'll be awkward.

504
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,160
(Declaration for Democracy)

505
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,724
Soo Ryeon wrote it.

506
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,265
She worked so hard on it,

507
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,934
so she should see how it turned out.

508
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,965
Make sure she gets it.

509
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,744
Hey.

510
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,315
So? What can I help you with today?

511
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,025
I need to borrow your fine taste. Let's go.

512
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,724
We have many places to check out.

513
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:24,670
What about this? This will go with everything.

514
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,224
Myeong Hee, Myeong Hee.

515
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:28,565
What's your shoe size?

516
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:31,240
230mm. Why do you ask?

517
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,405
Oh, these happen to be 230mm.

518
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:38,249
Here. Try them on.

519
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:40,949
Why should I? We're here to buy your shoes.

520
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,775
Well, this is just...

521
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,784
Just try them on.

522
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:46,344
Come on.

523
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,585
Here.

524
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,835
How pretty.

525
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:11,505
Myeong Hee, Myeong Hee.

526
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,015
This one. This too.

527
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,149
And this one too. Go try them on.

528
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:21,490
Why do you keep doing this? Pick out things for yourself.

529
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,955
Goodness. Just go try them on.

530
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:27,525
Go on. We don't have time.

531
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,099
Hurry. Go.

532
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,794
- I'm really okay... - Go on!

533
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,520
- Watch out. - My gosh!

534
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,714
Oh, no!

535
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,989
What's going on?

536
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:57,959
- Goodness. - My gosh.

537
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,760
(Watch Repair)

538
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,300
My goodness.

539
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,430
Those punks.

540
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,369
Are you all right?

541
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,130
- Gosh. - Yes, I'm okay.

542
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,265
Goodness.

543
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:12,040
What's going on though?

544
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,704
Obviously,

545
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:16,534
they're trying to catch the kids who protested.

546
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:18,074
What a mess.

547
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,680
Goodness.

548
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,284
I see your daughter is having a lot of fun lately.

549
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,314
Keep a good eye on your daughter.

550
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:28,385
She's not a kid anymore.

551
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:36,958
I thought we came to pick out your clothes,

552
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,265
but these are all for me.

553
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,099
You're making me uncomfortable.

554
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:41,900
Just consider it as a gift for your help.

555
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,564
I'm choosing mine now.

556
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,640
I came to return a favor,

557
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,775
but I'm receiving more in return.

558
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,304
Come on, it's just a dress. There's no need to say that.

559
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:56,044
Myeong Hee, you're like a sister to Soo Ryeon.

560
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,420
It's natural for siblings to receive gifts...

561
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,784
when their sister or brother gets engaged.

562
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,554
How does this look?

563
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,155
It looks like a suit for a groom.

564
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,135
What about this? This will look good on you.

565
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:18,334
I like it. It's nice and neat.

566
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,040
Ma'am, can I try this on?

567
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,574
Oh, there's someone in the dressing room right now.

568
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,174
- Can you wait for a second? - Sure.

569
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,934
Hey, future brother-in-law!

570
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:50,040
Hello, Soo Chan.

571
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,005
Did you come to get your suit fitted?

572
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,310
Gosh, what a great choice.

573
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,574
You look like a prince.

574
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,579
Are you going to try that on?

575
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:04,414
Yes. I'll go try this on.

576
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:05,714
Okay.

577
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,544
Hey, look at this.

578
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:36,845
It's so tight that I can't even breathe...

579
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:43,985
Myeong Hee.

580
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,824
What are you doing here?

581
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:51,424
Oh, Soo Chan asked me to help him pick out a suit.

582
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,369
Gosh, that looks perfect on you.

583
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,905
I wonder what the groom thinks about it.

584
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,145
It looks nice.

585
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:08,775
It's as if it were her own dress.

586
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,145
I told you it would look good.

587
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,194
Soo Ryeon!

588
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,135
I never imagined seeing you in a dress.

589
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:33,069
Goodness, you both look amazing.

590
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:34,635
The perfect bride and groom.

591
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,849
Oh, my. You're both tall too.

592
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:40,209
You look like foreign actors.

593
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:41,444
Don't you think?

594
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,184
Yes, they do.

595
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:48,414
Hee Tae.

596
00:41:49,189 --> 00:41:50,855
You look like you could be an actor.

597
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,554
No way.

598
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,099
You look great too.

599
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:58,395
Oh, this? Myeong Hee chose this for me.

600
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,709
By the way, where are you two headed?

601
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:11,079
I'll give you a ride.

602
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:12,979
It's okay. We can take a cab.

603
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:14,714
We need to drop by a few places.

604
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,880
- Hey, Soo Ryeon. - You do? I can give you a lift.

605
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,719
Do you have time later?

606
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,689
- It's okay. - Today?

607
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:23,954
Yes. I have something to give you.

608
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,554
I'm a bit busy today.

609
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,324
Myeong Hee.

610
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:33,725
Can we talk after the engagement ceremony?

611
00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:37,194
Soo Ryeon.

612
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,444
Okay then.

613
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,459
We'll be off then. Drive safely.

614
00:42:57,459 --> 00:42:59,385
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

615
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,674
Why is it pouring so suddenly? My goodness.

616
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,355
Is anyone home?

617
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,885
Who is it?

618
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,355
Hello.

619
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:11,365
Is Myeong Hee here by any chance?

620
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:15,135
May I ask who you are?

621
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,684
What are you doing here?

622
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,595
I'm asking what you're doing here.

623
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,225
Do you still do this kind of stuff?

624
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,469
Give it to me. It's not what you think.

625
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,204
Give it to me!

626
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,734
What are you...

627
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:06,510
You still haven't come to your senses...

628
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,545
even after what happened?

629
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,545
Why do you care?

630
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:16,290
Why do you care if I protest...

631
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,960
or set myself on fire?

632
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,355
Kim Myeong Hee!

633
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:23,494
I'm living just the way you want.

Father.

636
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,990
Father, something's wrong with this place.

637
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,659
All the others were released. Why am I...

638
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:51,855
No matter what,

639
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:54,260
just say "yes".

640
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,329
Father, I really didn't do anything wrong.

641
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:58,095
How can I take the blame for something I didn't do?

642
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,835
Just say yes to everything.

643
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:05,264
Say that everything is your fault.

644
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,905
Father.

645
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,734
They've agreed to punish you...

646
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:12,545
by making you drop out of school.

647
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:17,414
So live gratefully from now on...

648
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,984
Don't even breathe too loudly.

649
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,595
Live quietly.

650
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:35,764
Father.

651
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,305
Just like you wanted,

652
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:41,934
I'm living quietly, saying yes to everything.

653
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,204
I gave up everything in my life.

654
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:49,744
What more do you want me to do?

655
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:54,085
What more do you want from me?

656
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,569
By the way, how is an engagement ceremony...

657
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:18,704
different from a wedding?

658
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:21,065
Don't they just...

659
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:23,075
promise to get married at an engagement ceremony?

660
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,805
I thought that's what you do at a wedding.

661
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,444
I think an engagement ceremony is like a preview of a wedding.

662
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,444
Anyway, only rich people seem to do it.

663
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,914
Right?

664
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:38,555
Whatever. Just go back to sleep.

665
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,895
Hey. Can you bring back some good food for us?

666
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,365
Yes, you should.

667
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:47,530
What? Are you out of your minds?

668
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,464
How can I possibly bring back food from the ceremony?

669
00:49:50,669 --> 00:49:51,805
Hold on.

670
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:59,045
At least bring back some rice cakes in this bag.

671
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,914
Are you beggars? Don't be ridiculous.

672
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:03,514
Get him!

673
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:08,319
- Stop it! - Are you going to do it or not?

674
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,419
- Bring back some food! - Get off me!

675
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:11,220
Are you going to do it?

676
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,385
- Promise that you will! - Answer!

677
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,895
Are you okay?

678
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,940
You have a fever.

679
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,335
You should've taken the afternoon off.

680
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,734
I'm fine.

681
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,145
I'm getting off work soon anyway.

682
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:46,085
Thanks.

683
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,050
(From Assemblyman Han Seok Joong)

684
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,220
(Congratulations on Your Engagement, Hwang Hee Tae and Lee Soo Ryeon)

685
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,514
This way, please.

686
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:14,919
(From President Yoon Soon Young of Gyeongju Gas)

687
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:17,785
Make way please. This way, sir.

688
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,885
Hello.

689
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,924
Congratulations.

690
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,500
Couldn't your wife make it?

691
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,629
- She's helping out at the church. - I see.

692
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:28,795
Please.

693
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:33,305
Thank you.

694
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:52,924
There you are.

695
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,125
Myeong Hee.

696
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,865
Come on. Don't cry.

697
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,635
You'll ruin your makeup.

698
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,375
By the way...

699
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,075
Here.

700
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,155
I'm sorry.

701
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:27,125
I should've taken better care of it. It's all in pieces.

702
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,454
This is...

703
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:32,994
It's from Hye Gun.

704
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,734
He said you should see the result of your hard work.

705
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:51,274
The ceremony is starting soon. Please get ready.

706
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,845
See you out there.

707
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:12,835
It's starting!

708
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,295
The engagement ceremony...

709
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,194
of Hwang Hee Tae and Lee Soo Ryeon will begin shortly.

710
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,365
Please be seated.

711
00:53:43,399 --> 00:53:45,535
Myeong Hee, sit here.

712
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,674
We're honored...

713
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,609
to have you all as our guests...

714
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:54,305
on this happy day.

715
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,678
We will now begin the engagement ceremony...

716
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,085
of Mr. Hwang Ki Nam's eldest son, Hwang Hee Tae,

717
00:53:59,149 --> 00:54:02,260
and Mr. Lee Chang Geun's eldest daughter,

718
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,414
Lee Soo Ryeon.

719
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:11,024
First,

720
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:13,694
the parents of the couple will thank the guests.

721
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:15,595
Please give them a big hand.

722
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:24,075
Auntie.

723
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:25,575
Why are you...

724
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,349
(Congratulations)

725
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:34,585
Thank you all for coming.

726
00:54:41,899 --> 00:54:43,055
Now,

727
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,694
- it's time to welcome the couple. - What was that?

728
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,764
Please give a warm round of applause...

729
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,704
for the soon-to-be bride and groom!

730
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,274
You want me to get engaged to Lee Soo Ryeon?

731
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,145
Yes.

732
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,545
Are you sure you'll be okay...

733
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,385
if I get engaged?

734
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,655
Yes.

735
00:56:20,929 --> 00:56:22,694
Now, the soon-to-be bride and groom...

736
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:27,595
will bow to the guests to show their gratitude.

737
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,385
Sir, my son would like to thank you.

738
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,355
- Congratulations. - Thank you very much.

739
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:50,914
She's the daughter of Changhwa Industrial.

740
00:56:51,929 --> 00:56:53,629
- I see. - Enjoy your meal, sir.

741
00:56:53,629 --> 00:56:54,754
Come this way.

742
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,555
Hello.

743
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:59,764
Thank you for coming.

744
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:01,899
Do you like the food?

745
00:57:01,899 --> 00:57:04,264
I love it. You should thank him.

746
00:57:10,409 --> 00:57:13,444
I must be distracting you from your meal.

747
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,909
I shouldn't have made you sit next to me.

748
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:16,075
Don't...

749
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,780
Don't worry.

750
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,319
Do you want some more water?

751
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:21,954
- Excuse... - It's fine. I'll get it myself.

752
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:23,514
Go and talk to your guests.

753
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,264
Gosh, why am I doing this?

754
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,345
I'm sorry.

755
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,184
No. I shouldn't have popped up from behind.

756
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,085
Don't worry.

757
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:00,984
It's really fine.

758
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:02,454
Go and eat some more.

759
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,045
My, the groom is so good-looking.

760
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,220
She wouldn't need any wedding gifts!

761
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,690
I know.

762
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,560
Soo Ryeon is such a lucky girl.

763
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,589
He's handsome, and he's a doctor on top of that.

764
00:58:30,589 --> 00:58:34,560
It's a mystery that he didn't get snatched up sooner, you know?

765
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,254
- It is a mystery indeed. - Right?

766
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,230
- He's so good-looking. - Come on. Hurry.

767
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,795
Oh, dear.

768
00:58:44,169 --> 00:58:47,710
- What a fine young man. - I know. He's very handsome.

769
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,234
He really is.

770
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,694
Even the grasshoppers aren't helping me today.

771
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,905
I look forward to May every year.

772
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,674
On a May night, even if you sing badly,

773
01:00:02,649 --> 01:00:04,645
the grasshoppers help you out.

774
01:00:04,919 --> 01:00:06,389
The grasshoppers?

775
01:00:06,389 --> 01:00:08,315
Whenever I think of you, Myeong Hee,

776
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,684
I can't help but sing.

777
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,355
Myeong Hee.

778
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,264
Do you want to go out with me just until the end of May?

779
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,694
Are you okay?

780
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:54,825
No.

781
01:00:57,369 --> 01:00:58,934
I'm not okay.

782
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,234
I don't want this May...

783
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:08,914
to pass by without you.

784
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:08,595
(Youth of May)

785
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,719
Do you think you can beat me now that you're grown up?

786
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:26,190
What would you have done if your family had seen it?

787
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,389
Why are you so angry?

788
01:03:27,389 --> 01:03:29,460
You can't say that when you ran away from your engagement ceremony.

789
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,290
Why did he drink so much?

790
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,389
I'm off today and tomorrow.

791
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:34,590
Then let's hang out the whole time.

792
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,130
What a coincidence.

793
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:39,000
I can't believe Hee Tae's brother is your roommate, Myeong Soo.

794
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,464
What is your relationship?

795
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,699
Joint management?

796
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:43,369
It's so the investors can put their worries to rest.

797
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:44,639
Call off the engagement.

798
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,265
Hwang Hee Tae is seeing someone.
