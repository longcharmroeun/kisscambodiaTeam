1
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:09,443
Are you okay?

2
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:12,312
No.

3
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:16,583
I'm not okay.

4
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,722
I don't want this May...

5
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:26,292
to pass by without you.

6
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:07,215
(Congratulations on Your Engagement,
Hwang Hee Tae and Lee Soo Ryeon)

7
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:34,498
Excuse me.
May I ask why you're here?

8
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:37,398
It's nothing.

9
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:40,067
Wait.

10
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:42,907
Thank you for coming
such a long way.

11
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:44,168
- No problem.
- Congratulations.

12
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:45,508
When your children get married,

13
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,907
- remember to invite me.
- Yes, of course.

14
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,138
I promise to be there.

15
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:49,377
- Sure.
- Thank you.

16
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:50,508
Thank you so much.

17
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:52,877
- Congratulations once again.
- Thank you.

18
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:57,047
Whenever you hold a family event,
don't forget to invite me.

19
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,657
I'll be the first
to congratulate you.

20
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:02,927
Once again,
thank you so much for coming.

21
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,208
Soo Ryeon.

22
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:22,208
Our guests are about to leave.
Where is Hee Tae?

23
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,708
It's been a while
since I last saw him.

24
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,518
Did he get sick or what?

25
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:28,648
I sent him home.

26
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,048
What do you mean, you sent him home?

27
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:34,917
Well, he wasn't feeling well
since this morning,

28
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:37,328
so I told him to go home
and get some rest.

29
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,697
My goodness. But still,

30
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:42,097
how could he really leave?

31
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,298
Can you believe this?

32
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:55,578
(Episode 6,
A Cough, Love, And...)

33
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:04,887
What's wrong with Hee Tae?

34
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,287
I think he came down with a cold.

35
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:12,058
I see.

36
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,157
Myeong Hee was coughing
all day long too.

37
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:16,597
I guess it's because
the seasons are changing.

38
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:19,498
Things were so hectic...

39
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:20,998
that I didn't even notice
her leaving.

40
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:22,708
Did you say goodbye to her?

41
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,437
Both of us were so busy,

42
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,407
so I guess she just left quietly.

43
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:32,877
You know how Myeong Hee
doesn't like to bother others.

44
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,187
- Soo Ryeon.
- What?

45
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:39,218
You did great today.

46
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:42,727
Thanks.

47
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:45,528
It would've been nice
if Mother were here too.

48
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:55,868
Why can't I walk you
all the way home?

49
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,377
It's right over there.
We're almost here anyway.

50
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,407
And I don't want...

51
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,817
You don't want Jin A to see us
and cause a fuss?

52
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:09,847
Okay.

53
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,018
What are you doing tomorrow?

54
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,757
I need to work
after going to church.

55
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,697
Then I'll schedule my lesson
for tomorrow evening.

56
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,698
So I can bump into you
when you get off work.

57
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,398
Oh, why don't you just hand me
your work schedule?

58
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:28,237
So I can schedule
our dates accordingly.

59
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,838
Sure thing.

60
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,747
Gosh, I guess this is why
people write song lyrics.

61
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,078
Since we can't talk on the phone...

62
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,688
or look at a picture
when we miss each other.

63
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:45,318
The nights feel too long.

64
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,167
Can I take this with me?

65
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,338
So I can think of you.

66
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:21,157
What about me?
Shouldn't you give me something too?

67
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:23,828
I don't have anything to give you.

68
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:25,797
Shall I rip off a button?

69
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,448
I'll take this.

70
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:07,667
Hey, over there.

71
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:10,468
It's almost time
for the curfew siren.

72
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:12,607
What are you two doing
so late at night?

73
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:13,807
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,378
If you're not going to get a room,
go home already.

75
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,547
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- That's how the law is.

76
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,018
- Yes, I know.
- Okay.

77
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:25,117
Well, I'd better go home now.

78
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:28,188
Okay then.
See you tomorrow, Myeong Hee.

79
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:29,557
Get home safe.

80
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:10,268
Good morning, Father...

81
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,867
I heard
you weren't feeling well yesterday.

82
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,968
Do you feel better now?

83
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,208
Yes.

84
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:38,028
Do you think you can beat me
now that you're all grown up?

85
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,398
Don't be mistaken.

86
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:43,927
All you can do is block my hand.

87
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:47,838
No matter what you do,
I'm always one step ahead of you.

88
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:52,938
Also...

89
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:57,008
If you ever disappoint me
as my son...

90
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,148
in front of people like that again,

91
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,477
it won't end with a slap.

92
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:03,818
Do you understand?

93
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:11,888
Sir, you have a guest.

94
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:42,887
Gosh, you must've been tired
after the engagement ceremony.

95
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:43,958
You didn't have to.

96
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,257
I didn't get to pay my respects
before the ceremony,

97
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,127
and my father earnestly told me...

98
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:51,798
to bring these gifts to you myself.

99
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,767
What a precious gift.

100
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:58,938
- Please thank your father for me.
- Okay.

101
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,147
- Is the food ready?
- Yes.

102
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,448
Where's Jung Tae?

103
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,418
Jung Tae went to a church retreat
and will be back tomorrow evening.

104
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:11,588
Let's go eat then.

105
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,853
- You...
- Wait.

106
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,552
If you're going to slap me,
slap me on this side.

107
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:49,123
What did you expect me to do
after disappearing like that?

108
00:09:49,593 --> 00:09:52,432
Do you know how hard it was
to come up with an excuse?

109
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:55,463
Sorry. Something came up suddenly.

110
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,503
I saw you last night...

111
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,333
leaving with Myeong Hee.

112
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,042
What are you two thinking?

113
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:07,073
Whatever it is,
isn't it none of your business now?

114
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:09,713
We got engaged like you wanted,

115
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,113
and we'll maintain this
until the factory is completed.

116
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:14,253
That's as far as we go.

117
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:16,753
Why is it none of my business?

118
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:19,522
Like you just said,
we have to maintain this situation.

119
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:21,323
If people find out
about your relationship,

120
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,762
the engagement and everything else
will be ruined.

121
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:26,593
Got it.
We'll be careful from now on.

122
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,162
Why do you sound so carefree?

123
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,833
To be honest, you guys are lucky...

124
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,473
that I was the only one who saw you.

125
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:35,073
What if our family
or one of our guests saw you?

126
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,743
How would I explain it?

127
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:40,373
Why are you so angry?

128
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:43,243
Who says I'm angry?

129
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,343
Come inside for some snacks.

130
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,253
- Okay.
- Okay.

131
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,562
Oh, dear.

132
00:11:00,963 --> 00:11:03,062
Show me your photo albums.

133
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,902
I'd love to see how ugly
you were as a kid.

134
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,003
I don't have any photo albums.

135
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:11,943
Is there anything you do have?

136
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:32,193
Who's this?

137
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:36,802
It's my mother.

138
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:38,162
What?

139
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,873
Oh, not the one you saw downstairs,

140
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:44,073
but my birth mother.

141
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:47,343
That's the only photo of her
from before she got sick.

142
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,912
Goodness.

143
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:54,912
Why did you shove a photo
of your mother in the corner?

144
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:57,152
Frame it or something.

145
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:58,323
Gosh.

146
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:02,662
What about you?

147
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:05,932
I didn't see a single photo
of your mother at your place either.

148
00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:11,032
That's because I hid all of them
because seeing them makes me...

149
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,172
miss her more.

150
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,402
I know the feeling.

151
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,012
How old were you
when she passed away?

152
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,083
I was 12.

153
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:30,953
Goodness. You were too young.

154
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,993
It must've been hard
to deal with all the events.

155
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,652
What events?

156
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:39,392
I mean, you must've missed her
on every sports day,

157
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,693
school entrance ceremony,
graduation, and such.

158
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,532
The only event
that I had to deal with...

159
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,703
without my mother was
my high school graduation,

160
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:48,373
and it was hard enough.

161
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,713
I was only forced to attend it...

162
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,473
because I was the valedictorian.

163
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:07,922
<i>Into my heart</i>

164
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:15,493
<i>A sheep wandering</i>

00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:21,632
<i>In the dark</i>

166
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:24,943
Here you go.

167
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,812
- Thank you so much.
- Enjoy.

168
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:30,682
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

169
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:32,512
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

170
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,682
- Dig in.
- Thanks.

171
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,652
- This is so good.
- Enjoy.

172
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:40,522
They all need to be washed, right?
Give them to me.

173
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:45,932
Hye Gun.

174
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:48,333
Is something wrong?

175
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,203
Why are you ignoring me?

176
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:53,833
What's the matter? Tell me.

177
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,843
- I saw everything.
- What do you mean?

178
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,613
At Soo Ryeon's engagement ceremony,

179
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:02,443
I saw you with...

180
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,682
Hee Tae.

181
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,083
How do you know each other?

182
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:14,292
No. More importantly,

183
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,823
what's going on between you two?

184
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:20,662
Hee Tae is Soo Ryeon's fiance.

185
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:23,632
And you're her friend.

186
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:26,073
- Hye Gun.
- Does Soo Ryeon know...

187
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,402
what's going on...

188
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:33,073
between you two?

189
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,682
Hello?

190
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,723
Master Hee Tae, this is for you.

191
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:20,652
Me?

192
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,623
Hello?

193
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:28,892
Hee Tae, are you feeling any better?

194
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:33,333
I feel like we haven't spent
enough time together.

195
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,473
How about we meet up this evening,
just us guys?

196
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:36,672
Well...

197
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:41,443
I'm sorry, but I already have plans.

198
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:44,682
Come on, don't be like that.
Please free up some time.

199
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,713
I promise it won't take long.

200
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:50,152
Well...

201
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:56,422
(Resume, Hong Yong Gil)

202
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:00,093
It's my cousin
that I once talked about.

203
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,963
About Changhwa Pharmaceuticals,

204
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:06,333
the president seems inexperienced.

205
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,402
Wouldn't joint management
be helpful?

206
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:17,682
I appreciate
your thoughtful opinion,

207
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:19,812
but his father, Mr. Lee Chang Geun,

208
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,282
is already participating
in the management.

209
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:26,223
I don't think they'll be interested
in joint management.

210
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,123
This isn't like you.

211
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:30,623
Are you already trying...

212
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,593
to protect your in-laws?

213
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,292
It's not like that, sir.

214
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:41,573
Thank you.

215
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:49,943
You know the president left for
the Middle East yesterday, right?

216
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,083
Emergency martial law
will be expanded soon.

217
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,583
The boat is about to set sail.

218
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:02,392
To get into the same boat,
this is your only chance.

219
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,062
Mr. Hwang.

220
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,203
Do you think the new government...

221
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,403
will only last for five years?

222
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:14,203
You need to look far ahead.

223
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:17,243
You're too good
to be stuck where you are now.

224
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:28,953
You're absolutely right.
I'd like to pour you one as well.

225
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,653
Good.

226
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:37,022
Let me pour you one.

227
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,342
One more?

228
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:57,812
- Another bottle, please.
- Coming up.

229
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,143
Cheers.

230
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:02,453
(Mokpo Skate and Rice Wine)

231
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,552
This is nice.

232
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,122
You can slow down if you want.

233
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,292
You don't have to drink
as fast as I do.

234
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:14,032
Goodness, you don't have to worry
about me.

235
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:15,993
Have two, okay?

236
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:22,802
So what's your plan now?

237
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,302
The wedding and everything.

238
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:26,102
Where will you live?

239
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:29,913
I guess we will go with
what our parents want.

240
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:36,683
Is that also why you had
an engagement ceremony?

241
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,582
Your parents made you do it?

242
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,322
What about Soo Ryeon?

243
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:47,733
From going on that blind date
to the engagement,

244
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,233
did she want all of it?

245
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:56,973
Listen, Hee Tae.

246
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:00,973
Just because you don't want
this marriage,

247
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:03,612
it doesn't mean you don't have...

248
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:06,042
any responsibilities and duties
to fulfill.

249
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,582
I believe I'm fulfilling
all my duties.

250
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:13,622
You can't say that...

251
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:18,163
when you ran away
from your engagement ceremony.

252
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:26,062
Also, you didn't run away alone...

253
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:27,802
that day.

254
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,473
(Congratulations on Your Engagement,
Hwang Hee Tae and Lee Soo Ryeon)

255
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,713
Excuse me.
May I ask why you're here?

256
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,683
It's nothing.

257
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,483
Wait.

258
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:04,342
Why did you want to see me today?

259
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:09,342
Whatever you're up to,
you should stop right now.

260
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,612
Don't do anything
you can't take responsibility for.

261
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:14,883
I don't think I'm doing anything
I can't take responsibility for.

262
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:19,352
Do you even know what it means
to take responsibility?

263
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,562
It means to make sure
no one gets hurt by your action.

264
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,562
Even if everyone around you
becomes devastated,

265
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:27,933
do you think it's no problem
as long as you're okay?

266
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:30,203
How can you be so reckless?

267
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:49,782
Let me ask you something.

268
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:54,552
Are you sure you're angry
because of Soo Ryeon?

269
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:57,592
What?

270
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:09,272
You can be responsible
and do your duty.

271
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:13,042
What's more important to me
is not having any regrets later on.

272
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:19,582
The last one.

273
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,892
Oh, it's just you.

274
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:40,063
I thought it was Hee Tae.

275
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,422
Is he not here yet?

276
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,533
I thought you had
a tutoring session this evening.

277
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:47,503
I have no idea what's going on.
Did he forget about it?

278
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:56,473
Hold on. How did you know
I had a session this evening?

279
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:00,882
Well...

280
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:04,952
I'm here!

281
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:09,253
You're late.
I was getting worried about you.

282
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:18,563
The thing is...

283
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:23,473
I did all the homework, but...

284
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:26,743
I couldn't finish writing down
all the questions I got wrong.

285
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:29,172
My gosh,
you finished all the homework?

286
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:32,442
I gave you a lot of homework.

287
00:22:33,043 --> 00:22:35,182
Good girl, Jin A.

288
00:22:41,823 --> 00:22:43,593
Hee Tae, did you drink?

289
00:22:43,593 --> 00:22:45,223
Music is what?

290
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:47,892
- Math!
- That's right.

291
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:49,833
Go put on a song.

292
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:53,162
Show me your fine taste in music,
Director Jin A.

293
00:22:55,162 --> 00:22:56,233
Okay.

294
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:06,343
Do you want a Korean song
or a pop song?

295
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:33,773
Hee Tae.

296
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:36,273
Hee Tae.

297
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:40,813
Hee Tae, wake up.

298
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:42,682
Hee Tae.

299
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:45,952
Hee Tae.

300
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:48,323
Hee Tae.

301
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:51,452
Wake up, Hee Tae.

302
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:57,493
Myeong Hee, this is the first time
I'm seeing you in my dream.

303
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,862
Gosh, I guess
you haven't sobered up yet.

304
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:06,803
Mr. Hwang.

305
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:09,872
Wake up and have some hangover soup.

306
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:28,023
Why am I here?

307
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,333
I told you to make
soybean sprout soup.

308
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,833
Who'd want to eat this spicy soup
first thing in the morning?

309
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,033
I didn't make it for you.

310
00:24:39,473 --> 00:24:40,942
Just eat your breakfast
and go to school!

311
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:45,912
This is totally making
my hangover go away.

312
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:51,182
I knew he'd have
a discerning palate!

313
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:55,253
These Jeolla Province natives
don't know how good this is.

314
00:24:57,553 --> 00:24:58,852
I'm also from Jeolla Province.

315
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:00,622
Born and raised in Gwangju.

316
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:05,533
Jeolla Province is famous
for good food indeed!

317
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:06,563
That's right.

318
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:14,503
You talk like a Seoul native.
I had no idea you were from Gwangju.

319
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:17,243
I guess you rarely use the dialect.

320
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,043
I do use it,

321
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:22,813
but my father is adamant about me
speaking with a Seoul accent.

322
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,813
Of course!

323
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:31,122
No wonder such a wise man
did a great job raising his son.

324
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:33,462
When my son was enlisting
in the army,

325
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:35,263
I also emphasized to him...

326
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:37,533
that he must be mindful
of his dialect.

327
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:40,503
Fortunately, my son is
half Gyeongsang and half Jeolla,

328
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:43,333
so he can use both dialects freely.

329
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,372
He's like those people
in border towns!

330
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:47,642
- Border towns?
- That's right.

331
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:49,872
I'm originally from Jinju.

332
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:51,343
It's too hot!

333
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:55,412
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?

334
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:57,583
Do you have a girlfriend?

335
00:25:57,813 --> 00:26:00,352
I'm asking you
if you have a girlfriend.

336
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:05,753
Hey, I heard the girls who protest
sleep around a lot.

337
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:10,563
Come on. Tell me some stories.

338
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:12,263
Especially girls
who work in factories.

339
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:14,102
I heard...

340
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,533
they'd sleep with any college guys.

341
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:21,702
Have you hit on any factory girls?

342
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:24,543
No, I have not.

343
00:26:27,442 --> 00:26:29,283
You look like you want to punch me.

344
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,483
If you don't have
any stories to tell,

345
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:34,783
then make some up or something.

346
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,823
How dare you glare at me?

347
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:45,733
Am I eating seaweed soup
with clams or sand?

348
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:49,303
They should've removed
the sand properly!

349
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:56,243
Darn it.

350
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,283
- Halt!
- 1, 2!

351
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:10,952
Hey.

352
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:12,993
Take a break.

353
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:15,063
This is exhausting.

354
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,333
Earlier...

355
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,333
Why did you do that?

356
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:26,473
I was going to take it up with him
anyway.

357
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:28,473
He always speaks ill
of Jeolla Province...

358
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:29,973
in front of this Gwangju native.

359
00:27:31,313 --> 00:27:34,212
Elite colleges and Jeolla Province
are his trigger points, you know.

360
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:36,642
But because of me...

361
00:27:36,882 --> 00:27:37,952
It's okay.

362
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:40,452
That jerk will be discharged
in a month anyway.

363
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:44,443
It's so nice
to talk comfortably like this.

364
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:45,503
My goodness.

365
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:50,642
My best friend is also from Gwangju.

366
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:52,783
You little...

367
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:55,882
Gwangju isn't a small town
where everyone knows everyone.

368
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:02,193
- Quick.
- Okay.

369
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:05,892
(Resume, Hong Yong Gil)

370
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,193
What is this?

371
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,433
Joint management?

372
00:28:10,763 --> 00:28:12,632
Don't think too much of it.

373
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:15,173
It's so the investors
can put their worries to rest.

374
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:17,842
Mr. Hwang, I'm a businessman.

375
00:28:17,842 --> 00:28:20,513
I've overcome all sorts of hardships
in this industry.

376
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:22,743
Bribing people in high places...

377
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,683
Sure, I was prepared for it
and will deal with it.

378
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:26,783
But this is different.

379
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:29,882
You're asking me to hand over
the business to this person.

380
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:32,283
This is practically robbery
without a gun.

381
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:33,953
With a gun, I'd say.

382
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:40,733
(Resume, Hong Yong Gil)

383
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:44,362
I suggest you make a choice
that will result in less damage.

384
00:28:45,162 --> 00:28:46,362
Like a true businessman.

385
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:54,612
Myeong Hee.

386
00:28:57,443 --> 00:28:59,013
I hope your hangover is gone.

387
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,112
Who did you drink with last night?

388
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:03,783
Just someone
who makes me uncomfortable.

389
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:06,183
Oh, your work schedule.

390
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:09,223
- Were you being serious?
- Yes.

391
00:29:11,923 --> 00:29:14,263
- I'm off today and tomorrow.
- Really?

392
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:17,203
Then let's hang out the whole time.

393
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:23,273
I mean, not including the night.

394
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:25,572
We can meet up two days in a row.

395
00:29:31,243 --> 00:29:32,683
Can we spend the night together too?

396
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:39,152
Myeong Hee! A call for you!

397
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:40,852
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

398
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,062
Hey, Myeong Hee.

399
00:29:46,723 --> 00:29:49,862
What time does your shift start
today?

400
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:52,733
Oh, that's great.

401
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:54,402
Then...

402
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,003
can Myeong Soo sleep over
at your place tonight?

403
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:01,273
Your dad was going to pick him up
on his way home from the market,

404
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:04,013
but he's not feeling well.

405
00:30:09,882 --> 00:30:12,122
What time should I pick him up?

406
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,062
Okay.

407
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:20,062
All right.

408
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:29,773
Let's head out now.

409
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:33,043
No? Why not?

410
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,260
What a coincidence.

411
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,889
I can't believe Hee Tae's brother...

412
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,060
is your roommate, Myeong Soo.

413
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:05,577
Is this uncomfortable for you?
I'm sorry I dragged you here.

414
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:09,287
Don't worry.
He has nowhere else to go anyway.

415
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:12,857
He's supposed to be at a church
retreat by this evening. Right?

416
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:17,597
When he glares at you like that,
he's your spitting image.

417
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:19,057
- That's not true.
- That's not true.

418
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:20,968
Be polite to her.

419
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:24,468
That's so interesting.

420
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:27,008
They even say the same thing
at the same time.

421
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,418
Myeong Soo, dig in.

422
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:47,028
But don't eat too fast, okay?

423
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:48,087
Okay.

424
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:51,528
This boy is obviously growing
a lot faster and needs more food.

425
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,468
Come on. He's done growing.

426
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,137
I was just as tall as Myeong Soo
when I was 12.

427
00:31:58,238 --> 00:32:00,807
Kids who grow later end up taller.

428
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:03,438
It's all nonsense,
so don't listen to him.

429
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:04,978
Eat up now.

430
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:07,478
Here. Try it.

431
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:11,478
Hurry up and eat.

432
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:23,258
By the way,
what is your relationship?

433
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:32,498
That reminds me.

434
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:35,008
Your brother recently
got engaged, right?

435
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,377
Wait, are you his fiancee?

436
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:41,978
What are you talking about?

437
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:45,248
We're just...

438
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,658
We're just friends. Eat up.

439
00:32:56,597 --> 00:32:58,928
If you're just friends,
why are you so inseparable?

440
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:01,397
Gosh, what about you and Myeong Soo?

441
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,998
You two are just as inseparable
even though you're not engaged.

442
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,837
Hold on a second.

443
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:08,137
This is the last day
you can take it easy...

444
00:33:08,137 --> 00:33:09,837
before the race, right?

445
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:12,178
Is there any place you want to go?

446
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:19,077
There is a place
I want to go with all of you.

447
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:21,188
We can do that.

448
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:22,817
Where is the place?

(Ticket Office)

450
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:35,788
I can't believe the first
of our precious two days together...

451
00:34:35,788 --> 00:34:37,857
is passing by like this.

452
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:41,667
It's not like we were going to spend
the entire time together.

453
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:44,198
And I had a lot of fun.

454
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:46,538
Didn't you have fun?

455
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:49,937
Do you know this feeling?

456
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:52,877
The feeling when you're eating
sweet candy...

457
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:56,647
and one of your molars is aching.

458
00:34:56,718 --> 00:34:58,917
You can't really enjoy the candy...

459
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:01,218
because you're distracted...

460
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:03,988
by the pain in your tooth.

461
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:06,618
Why do you hate
your brother so much?

462
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:12,127
You have no idea
how mean he usually is to me.

463
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:16,567
To me, it looks like
you're the one being mean to him.

464
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:17,667
What?

465
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:19,738
Jung Tae may be tall,

466
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,567
but he's still only 12.

467
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:24,278
Do you want to fight with a kid?

468
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:26,508
Are you 12 too?

469
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:31,377
Forget it. You don't understand.

470
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:34,988
He may be young,
but he can really be...

471
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:38,558
Come on. He pretends to be mature,
but he's still a little kid.

472
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:45,297
See? Does he look
like a grown-up to you?

473
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:52,038
There are things you can't hide
no matter how hard you try.

474
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:56,738
I think Jung Tae
wants to become close to you.

475
00:35:58,278 --> 00:36:00,348
That kid? To me?

476
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:04,747
Gosh. No way.

477
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,278
That makes no sense.

478
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,948
Reach out to him first.

479
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:12,687
You're a grown-up,
not a 12-year-old boy.

I made some revisions
to the draft you gave me.

489
00:37:01,437 --> 00:37:03,477
for the upcoming street protests
and rallies.

490
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:07,107
I got so much arm exercise...

491
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:09,308
from running the mimeograph.

492
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:10,678
Do you see this?

493
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:13,247
I can beat anything now.

494
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,857
After putting in so much work,

495
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:19,417
you must be disappointed.

496
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:22,028
Not at all.

497
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:25,457
I just feel bad
that I can't fight next to you.

498
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:28,797
Anyway,

499
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:32,198
I'll be printing flyers in my room.

500
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:36,837
Let me know if I can help you
with anything.

501
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,607
Thank you so much.

502
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:43,678
By the way,

503
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:46,218
are you okay?

504
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:47,348
What?

505
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,317
I mean...

506
00:37:50,988 --> 00:37:52,788
Hee Tae and Myeong Hee.

507
00:37:55,988 --> 00:37:57,497
She...

508
00:37:58,428 --> 00:38:00,468
told you too?

509
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:08,667
What do you mean? A woman problem?

510
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:12,937
I don't mean to badmouth
your future brother-in-law,

511
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:14,508
so this is a little awkward,

512
00:38:14,508 --> 00:38:18,247
but you know
his family is quite complicated.

513
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:22,747
It wouldn't hurt to look into it
before Soo Ryeon marries him.

514
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:24,058
Who knows?

515
00:38:24,058 --> 00:38:26,758
He might have another woman
in Seoul like his father did.

516
00:38:26,758 --> 00:38:28,788
You're going too far.

517
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:31,227
You can never be sure.

518
00:38:31,357 --> 00:38:32,997
He's used to it.

519
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:34,497
Even after he gets married,

520
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:36,667
what if he seduces
an innocent lady...

521
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,598
and has a child with her
or something?

522
00:38:40,437 --> 00:38:42,138
Enough of that.

523
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:44,078
Just bring me
last year's financial statements.

524
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:53,047
There are things you can't hide
no matter how hard you try.

525
00:38:53,218 --> 00:38:56,817
I think Jung Tae
wants to become close to you.

526
00:38:58,857 --> 00:39:00,258
What are you looking at?

527
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:06,897
Aren't you tired of hating me yet?

528
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:08,968
What about you?

529
00:39:08,968 --> 00:39:11,337
Aren't you tired
of living with us yet?

530
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:14,707
Not at all. I love it.

531
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:16,707
I'm going to live with you
for the rest of my life.

532
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,377
Leech.

533
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:22,508
Let me ask you something.

534
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:24,377
Why do you hate me so much?

535
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:27,218
You give me no choice.

536
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:30,417
When someone hates me,

537
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:32,517
I can't help but fight back.

538
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:34,988
So don't show it.

539
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:36,328
Just ignore me.

540
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:39,227
Think of me as a gardener
who eats with you.

541
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:41,328
You keep pretending
you're the real son.

542
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:48,038
People call my mom a mistress
since you moved in.

543
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:50,508
They say I'm the son of a mistress.

544
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:53,678
My parents and I
are the real family.

545
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:56,408
I'm the legitimate son!

546
00:40:01,988 --> 00:40:03,448
Is that what made you so anxious?

547
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:07,892
Gosh, you...

548
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,892
You are still a kid indeed.

549
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:15,403
(The 61st Preliminaries
of the National Sports Festival)

550
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:16,502
You're right.

551
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:20,303
No matter how hard I try to hide it,

552
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:22,843
I can't change the fact
that I was born out of wedlock,

553
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:24,642
and you're the legitimate son.

554
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:28,383
So you don't need to be anxious.

555
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:31,412
Okay?

556
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:44,363
Don't tell anyone about Myeong Hee.
I'll do the same about the retreat.

557
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,432
I wasn't going to tell anyone
anyway.

558
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:48,303
Really?

559
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:56,272
Myeong Hee, would other people
think that we look alike too?

560
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:57,443
Like Jung Tae and his brother?

561
00:40:57,573 --> 00:41:00,783
What? Me and this little bear?

562
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:03,752
We don't look alike at all.

563
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:12,392
Soo Chan?

564
00:41:20,702 --> 00:41:23,232
That must be your baby brother
you told me about last time.

565
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,903
He looks just like you
when he smiles.

566
00:41:27,642 --> 00:41:28,642
You think so?

567
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:33,013
By the way,
why were you waiting for me?

568
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,452
Myeong Hee.

569
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:45,423
What's going on between you
and Hwang Hee Tae?

570
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:00,372
It's okay.

571
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:02,743
Mistakes can be rectified.

572
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:04,943
You're being fooled by him
right now.

573
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:05,943
It's...

574
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:09,482
not a mistake.

575
00:42:12,682 --> 00:42:14,223
And I'm not being fooled.

576
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:17,392
Myeong Hee, Hwang Hee Tae is...

577
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,452
not a good person.

578
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:22,122
You should not get involved
with him.

579
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,263
But it is the choice I made.

580
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:28,903
All my life,

581
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:31,732
I put others first
and gave up on what I wanted.

582
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:34,502
I didn't have the courage
to do otherwise.

583
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:38,272
And for the first time in my life,

584
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:41,943
I mustered up my courage
and chose Hee Tae.

585
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:46,482
Even if people bash me for it
and hurl stones at me,

586
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:49,582
I will put up with it...

587
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,693
since I made the choice.

588
00:42:52,693 --> 00:42:53,763
But why...

589
00:42:54,522 --> 00:42:56,463
Why must you put up with people...

590
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:59,993
pointing their fingers at you
because of a jerk like him?

591
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:04,973
I'm sorry.

592
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:41,843
Just try them on.

593
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:43,372
Come on.

594
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:46,642
How pretty.

595
00:43:51,113 --> 00:43:53,682
Myeong Hee, you made it.

596
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:03,693
Well, go on in.

597
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:04,863
Okay.

598
00:44:22,582 --> 00:44:25,982
Hey, mister. Take this off at least.

599
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:27,423
Soo Ryeon.

600
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:33,493
Do you like Hwang Hee Tae?

601
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:35,963
Gosh, you're drunk.

602
00:44:36,162 --> 00:44:37,932
What's with this random question?

603
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:40,093
Answer my question.

604
00:44:41,732 --> 00:44:43,602
Do you like Hwang Hee Tae?

605
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47,202
Why would I get engaged
to someone I don't even like?

606
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:50,073
Then what about him?

607
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:54,613
Does he like you?

608
00:44:59,412 --> 00:45:02,022
I don't know. Just sleep.

609
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:06,392
Goodness.

610
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,892
You and Myeong Hee both. Why...

611
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:22,843
Why fall for such a jerk?

612
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:34,153
I said I can take you there.

613
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:36,223
Come on. I'm not a baby.

614
00:45:36,423 --> 00:45:37,423
I told you, if I had a map,

615
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:39,452
I could walk all the way
to our home in Naju.

616
00:45:40,093 --> 00:45:41,662
You stubborn rascal.

617
00:45:42,363 --> 00:45:43,593
Watch out for cars.

618
00:45:43,593 --> 00:45:45,193
You made sure
to pack everything, right?

619
00:45:45,193 --> 00:45:47,662
Yes, don't worry. Just bring some
fried chicken next time.

620
00:45:53,202 --> 00:45:54,602
You don't need to walk me out.

621
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:56,173
Bye!

622
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:09,682
I knew it!
Did you forget something again?

623
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:27,872
I'm sorry about last time.

624
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:29,642
I know it was an important event.

625
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:31,042
You two...

626
00:46:32,013 --> 00:46:33,812
Do you really have to do this?

627
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:38,713
I understand you like each other.

628
00:46:38,852 --> 00:46:41,653
But did you have to make it obvious
to Hye Gun and my brother too?

629
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:45,252
Must you make me look like an idiot
and cause all this fuss?

630
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,593
Soo Ryeon,
I'm not trying to make a fuss.

631
00:46:48,493 --> 00:46:49,823
About Hye Gun and Soo Chan...

632
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,732
You're leaving anyway!

633
00:46:53,832 --> 00:46:54,863
What?

634
00:46:58,633 --> 00:47:00,943
You're leaving in less than a month.

635
00:47:02,303 --> 00:47:04,042
You're only here
for a few more weeks.

636
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:05,713
But to my family and me, this is...

637
00:47:10,343 --> 00:47:11,883
This all sounds too familiar.

638
00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:17,923
So if I leave,

639
00:47:19,852 --> 00:47:21,292
all will be good again,
like that time?

640
00:47:23,463 --> 00:47:24,463
What?

641
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:31,232
Myeong Hee.

642
00:47:32,832 --> 00:47:34,573
Is the priest at your church...

643
00:47:34,872 --> 00:47:37,173
one of the priests who got arrested?

644
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:43,213
I've got a good idea.

645
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:45,582
Do you want to do it with me?

646
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:47,153
What is it?

647
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:57,633
(End the Oppression
of Religious Leaders!)

648
00:48:01,403 --> 00:48:03,403
Hey, Hyun Ju. Read this.

649
00:48:03,403 --> 00:48:04,903
Take a look.

650
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:08,102
- Read this.
- You're here.

651
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:10,002
You're early. Read this.

652
00:48:14,312 --> 00:48:15,312
Kim Myeong Hee.

653
00:48:16,113 --> 00:48:17,182
Come with us.

654
00:48:19,412 --> 00:48:20,923
- Why...
- Come on.

655
00:48:20,923 --> 00:48:21,952
Myeong Hee.

656
00:48:25,493 --> 00:48:27,022
- Hey.
- What?

657
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:30,292
I heard Myeong Hee submitted
a letter of withdrawal today.

658
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:32,263
You know, because of the protest.

659
00:48:32,263 --> 00:48:34,533
- But why just her?
- I don't know.

660
00:48:50,142 --> 00:48:51,182
Is that...

661
00:48:52,982 --> 00:48:54,852
what you thought this whole time?

662
00:49:00,963 --> 00:49:02,363
It must've been awful
to have to hide it...

663
00:49:03,093 --> 00:49:05,392
while acting like a friend
to my face all these years.

664
00:49:34,823 --> 00:49:36,193
My gosh! You scared me.

665
00:49:37,122 --> 00:49:38,662
I nearly jumped out of my skin!

666
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:41,732
You speak with the Jeolla dialect
whenever you're startled.

667
00:49:41,863 --> 00:49:44,272
I wouldn't be startled
with the Seoul dialect, would I?

668
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,332
Goodness.

669
00:49:46,073 --> 00:49:47,102
Hold on.

670
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:50,812
I came early,
but you got here earlier than I did.

671
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:53,412
I guess you missed me a lot.

672
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:55,113
No!

673
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,682
It's not that.

674
00:49:58,452 --> 00:50:00,482
Today's our first official date.

675
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:02,182
Is there anything you want to do?

676
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:08,267
They're all just ordinary things.

677
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:11,937
What do you want to do?

678
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:15,076
Well...

679
00:50:17,946 --> 00:50:21,216
If I tell you,
are you willing to do anything?

680
00:50:24,346 --> 00:50:25,346
Gosh.

681
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:28,256
What?

682
00:50:38,196 --> 00:50:39,826
"Love and Peace?"

683
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:49,006
(Love and Peace)

684
00:50:49,107 --> 00:50:51,846
- Don't come so close.
- What?

685
00:50:55,747 --> 00:50:58,116
Myeong Hee's favorite butter bread.

686
00:50:58,116 --> 00:50:59,986
Goodness, Hee Tae.

687
00:51:00,147 --> 00:51:02,317
What? Stop taking them.

688
00:51:24,276 --> 00:51:25,946
What are you doing?

689
00:51:25,946 --> 00:51:28,616
Look at you. You look so stupid.

690
00:51:30,176 --> 00:51:32,517
Here. Eat all of this.

691
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:49,196
("Like the Last Wildflower")

692
00:51:57,006 --> 00:51:59,676
(Resume, Hong Yong Gil)

693
00:52:02,517 --> 00:52:04,787
A joint management with someone
I don't even know?

694
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:06,187
What is this...

695
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:09,056
I know.

696
00:52:09,386 --> 00:52:11,857
I understand giving out bribes
is an old custom,

697
00:52:11,857 --> 00:52:13,687
but getting involved like this
is an abuse of authority.

698
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:15,627
I can never allow this, Father.

699
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:19,026
Do you think I don't know that?

700
00:52:21,196 --> 00:52:23,866
I had no choice this time.

701
00:52:26,037 --> 00:52:27,776
No matter how filthy it is,
what can we do?

702
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:29,937
We're about to become a family,
so we must oblige.

703
00:52:38,147 --> 00:52:40,317
We shouldn't let this drag on.

704
00:52:41,017 --> 00:52:42,756
Let's call off
Soo Ryeon's engagement.

705
00:52:44,687 --> 00:52:46,256
What are you talking about?

706
00:52:46,457 --> 00:52:48,127
That punk Hwang Hee Tae...

707
00:52:49,326 --> 00:52:51,227
is seeing someone else.

708
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:55,897
"Completing the lyrics for my song."

709
00:53:00,366 --> 00:53:03,306
Wait. I requested this song.

710
00:53:06,276 --> 00:53:09,017
Okay then.
What else do you want to do?

711
00:53:09,176 --> 00:53:10,776
What else?

712
00:53:13,017 --> 00:53:15,656
Oh, I need to go to Naju.

713
00:53:15,656 --> 00:53:18,986
It's been a while since I went home.
All I did was call.

714
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:22,127
I'm planning on visiting
when I'm off next time.

715
00:53:22,957 --> 00:53:24,127
Okay.

716
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:26,826
"Visit home in Naju."

717
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:31,707
Open parenthesis, "With Hee Tae."

718
00:53:33,136 --> 00:53:36,236
What? Why would you go there?

719
00:53:36,236 --> 00:53:37,506
How will you introduce yourself?

720
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:40,446
What do you think?
I'll say I'm your boyfriend.

721
00:53:41,477 --> 00:53:45,346
Once I put my mind to it,
I can make adults love me.

722
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:47,817
It's just that
I don't actually do that very often.

723
00:53:49,116 --> 00:53:51,127
Promise me
we'll go to Naju together.

724
00:53:53,587 --> 00:53:56,826
Let's see. What else is there?

725
00:53:56,897 --> 00:53:59,026
We have so many things to do.

726
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:08,337
The song you requested
sounds so nice.

727
00:54:08,337 --> 00:54:10,607
What's the title?

728
00:54:12,147 --> 00:54:14,716
I'll tell you if you tell me first.

729
00:54:15,317 --> 00:54:17,547
Mine is Nogoziri's "A Cup of Tea..."

730
00:54:18,747 --> 00:54:20,647
Not the song you requested.

731
00:54:22,556 --> 00:54:24,986
I mean what you've been thinking of
all day...

732
00:54:25,357 --> 00:54:28,227
to wear those sad looking eyes.

733
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:33,426
I'm making so many people suffer...

734
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:36,866
just for my own happiness.

735
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:41,977
That's why whenever I feel happy,

736
00:54:43,437 --> 00:54:45,547
it feels as if I've become
a bad person.

737
00:54:49,517 --> 00:54:53,087
You should've told me.
Why are you hiding your pain?

738
00:54:53,087 --> 00:54:55,087
You're hiding your pain too.

739
00:54:56,886 --> 00:55:00,787
In case you'll seem regretful
if I see you in pain.

740
00:55:07,227 --> 00:55:09,037
I have no regrets.

741
00:55:09,797 --> 00:55:13,006
But it's not like there's no pain
just because we don't regret things.

742
00:55:14,337 --> 00:55:17,906
Even if we don't seem strong
or happy,

743
00:55:19,747 --> 00:55:22,576
I hope
we can show each other everything.

744
00:55:31,256 --> 00:55:33,756
Gosh, you're in trouble now.

745
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:36,357
I'm actually a real sissy.

746
00:55:36,526 --> 00:55:39,227
I'm going to whine all day
from now on.

747
00:55:39,227 --> 00:55:41,466
Sure, I'll hear you out.

748
00:55:41,866 --> 00:55:44,397
Anyway, what is the title
of this song?

749
00:55:57,946 --> 00:56:00,187
(Declaration for Democracy)

750
00:56:05,256 --> 00:56:06,756
<i>Let's become one</i>

751
00:56:06,756 --> 00:56:10,256
<i>Let's gather together and become one</i>

752
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:17,966
(End the emergency martial law!)

753
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:21,276
<i>- Let's take a step forward</i>
<i>- Let's take a step forward</i>

754
00:56:21,276 --> 00:56:24,276
<i>- We will continue to stay strong</i>
<i>- We will continue to stay strong</i>

755
00:56:24,276 --> 00:56:27,147
<i>- And fight for democracy</i>
<i>- And fight for democracy</i>

756
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:30,076
<i>- Let's keep marching forward</i>
<i>- Let's keep marching forward</i>

757
00:56:49,397 --> 00:56:50,966
What is going on?

758
00:56:53,406 --> 00:56:55,377
I hope you don't get shocked.

759
00:56:57,136 --> 00:57:00,747
I heard your fiance
is seeing someone else.

760
00:57:04,116 --> 00:57:06,386
Since this is your son's fault,

761
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:08,986
let's not make matters worse
and end it here.

762
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:16,826
Does your daughter know
nothing about this?

763
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:18,696
If she knew that...

764
00:57:21,366 --> 00:57:23,567
Would she have gotten engaged?

765
00:57:27,006 --> 00:57:31,377
So, you had no idea
Hee Tae was seeing someone else...

766
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:34,076
or who that woman was?

767
00:57:34,747 --> 00:57:37,917
You had no idea whatsoever?

768
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,423
I have no excuse.

769
00:57:57,337 --> 00:58:00,006
It's all my fault for
failing to raise my son properly.

770
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:04,406
However, our families
have finally managed to be united.

771
00:58:04,506 --> 00:58:07,406
How can we end everything
because of one setback?

772
00:58:08,377 --> 00:58:10,377
If you give me a chance,

773
00:58:10,716 --> 00:58:14,517
I'll take responsibility
and sort everything out.

774
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:26,966
I never had a chance to take
two days off like this.

775
00:58:26,966 --> 00:58:28,567
I guess everyone is like this,

776
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:30,837
but I didn't have enough
vacation days to begin with.

777
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:33,267
There's this junior nurse
named In Young.

778
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:34,977
She's a newbie
and clumsy with her work...

779
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:37,906
so everyone keeps making me
work with her...

780
00:58:41,207 --> 00:58:43,176
I'm boring you, aren't I?

781
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:46,486
What? No.
I was enjoying listening to you.

782
00:58:46,486 --> 00:58:47,517
Keep going.

783
00:58:47,517 --> 00:58:49,417
Just let me know if I'm boring you.

784
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,627
You didn't say anything,
so I kept blabbering.

785
00:58:51,787 --> 00:58:53,526
It wasn't boring.

786
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:55,756
I'm really okay.

787
00:58:58,627 --> 00:59:01,596
If you're okay,
what are those sleepy eyes?

788
00:59:04,437 --> 00:59:07,937
Come on. Didn't we promise
to tell each other everything?

789
00:59:09,736 --> 00:59:12,207
Hey, Sissy. How could you?

790
00:59:23,287 --> 00:59:24,857
It's just that I'm anxious.

791
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:32,096
I'm so happy right now.

792
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:36,497
This type of happiness...

793
00:59:38,607 --> 00:59:41,576
was never something I could have
all my life.

794
00:59:47,047 --> 00:59:49,817
It's like I'm flying
really high in the air...

795
00:59:52,486 --> 00:59:54,647
until I suddenly crash.

796
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,017
It makes me anxious.

797
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,937
I know it's silly and absurd.

798
01:01:43,526 --> 01:01:46,567
I can't walk you all the way home
today either, can I?

799
01:01:50,037 --> 01:01:52,567
See you tomorrow.

800
01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:42,065
(City bus)

801
01:03:18,213 --> 01:03:20,983
(Youth of May)

802
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,741
I'd like to report a missing person.

803
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:37,871
Has it ever occurred to you
that she might be avoiding you?

804
01:03:37,871 --> 01:03:39,181
I'm sorry you came
all the way here...

805
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:40,840
but couldn't meet Myeong Hee.

806
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,581
Are your parents aware
that you're seeing Myeong Hee?

807
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:44,650
Why are you asking that?

808
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,880
The Defense Security blocked
her passport and visa applications.

809
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,451
I have something to tell you.

810
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:49,891
I lied.

811
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:52,290
- Lee Soo Ryeon, you little...
- Father.

812
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,121
