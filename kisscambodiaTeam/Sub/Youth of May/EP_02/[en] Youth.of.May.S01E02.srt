1
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,559
Darn it! When did this happen?

2
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,029
Hello, I have a blind date at 4 p.m.

3
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,279
That cheeky nurse!

4
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,079
I'm sorry I'm late.

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,050
My name is Lee Soo Ryeon.

6
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:09,669
(Episode 2, The Shoes That Fit Me)

7
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,599
Write everything down, okay?

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,109
This method has a 99.9 percent
success rate of being rejected.

9
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,779
This data is based
on all the blind dates I've had.

10
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,980
Just follow my instructions,

11
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,279
and getting rejected
is just a matter of time.

12
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,230
I'll have coffee. Just black please.

13
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:35,998
I'll have...

14
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:37,130
First.

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,100
Leave a strong first impression
when you choose the menu.

16
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,269
I'll have a beer.

17
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,839
So it'll be one black coffee
and one beer?

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,870
Okay.

19
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,650
I guess you like to drink.

20
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:58,049
Yes. I can't live without it.

21
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:01,049
Whenever I feel sober,
my hands tremble like crazy.

22
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,919
I see.

23
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,239
May I have a sip?

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,480
- What?
- You make it look so delicious.

25
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,489
Now this is some nice beer.

26
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,899
But keep in mind that it's useless
to guys who are heavy drinkers.

27
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,169
So you need to switch
to the modern woman mode.

28
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,269
It's an obvious fact
that most men...

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,668
believe in a patriarchal society.

30
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,739
Did you come here to find
your future wife?

31
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,880
That's usually the case
when it comes to blind dates.

32
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,350
Did you have something else in mind?

33
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,859
No. I came to find my husband too.

34
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,030
But I'm quite a picky woman.

35
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,060
First of all,

36
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,999
I've never done any work at home...

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,570
and I'm not the type that stays home
to support my husband.

38
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,869
My career is more important.

39
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,239
I like that.

40
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,410
My ideal type is an ambitious woman.

41
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,010
I'll never have a baby either.

42
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,379
That's up to the woman, of course.

43
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,720
I won't force you to do anything.

44
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,320
I'll never look after
my parents-in-law either.

45
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,959
No need to worry about that.

46
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,989
My parents don't care about me
at all.

47
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:53,269
You're not as picky as I thought.

48
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,470
I guess we're pretty compatible.

49
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,668
If he's a guy
with a smooth tongue...

50
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,679
that has an answer for everything,

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,880
it's time to turn on
the philosopher mode.

52
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,950
First of all, put on a hazy look...

53
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,889
and sigh as if everything in life
is futile and say...

54
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:17,560
What do you think marriage is?

55
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,300
I'm not sure.

56
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,630
What a profound question.

57
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,740
But...

58
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,170
do you know
you didn't even ask me my name yet?

59
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,180
And your name is?

60
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,380
It's Hwang Hee Tae.

61
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,519
Hwang Hee Tae.

62
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,659
Hwang Hee Tae?

63
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,728
The one who went to...

64
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,129
Seoul National University
College of Medicine with top marks?

65
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,369
I guess you saw the banner.

66
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,899
Gosh, practically everyone
in Gwangju saw that banner.

67
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,468
"Congratulations on your acceptance
to SNU, Hwang Hee Tae."

68
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:09,510
Boom.

69
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm glad my father put up
that banner...

70
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,420
since you're showing
such deep interest.

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,089
I didn't show any interest.

72
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:26,360
Why don't you stop drinking,
so we can go eat?

73
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Eat?

74
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,370
Yes, eat.

75
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,670
If he says he wants to eat,

76
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,740
that means something is going
awfully wrong.

77
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,208
At this point,
you need to switch to filthy mode...

78
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,950
and stimulate his basic instincts.

79
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,289
Use the sense of sight,
smell, hearing,

80
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,149
and every other sense
you can think of...

81
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,789
to make him feel uncomfortable.

82
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,529
Oh, my goodness!

83
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,529
Almost all the men
who come on blind dates are similar.

84
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,099
They all grew up being sheltered.

85
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:12,539
Thank you.

86
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,839
Let's eat.

87
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,800
What? You should have a bite too.

88
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,510
Did you bring me here
thinking I'd be repulsed?

89
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,750
What?

90
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,250
Is this the best you can do?

91
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,060
I know worse places than this.

92
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,440
I guess you grew up
being sheltered...

93
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,389
since you're the daughter
of Changhwa Industrial.

94
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,409
I'm not...

95
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,479
the neat, spoiled son
you have in mind.

96
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:37,659
I'm someone who grew up
eating other's leftovers.

97
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,469
What?

98
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,469
Go on and eat.

99
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,209
If he doesn't bat an eye
and keeps eating,

100
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,250
then...

101
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,990
that means he's a hard one to crack.

102
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,459
Why?

103
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,389
It means he's a guy
that likes easy-going women.

104
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:16,159
And if you stuffed your face
with gukbap in front of him...

105
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:23,670
But Myeong Hee, don't worry.

106
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,399
There's still a way.

107
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,009
There's one thing that guys
who dig easy-going women...

108
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,880
hate most in the world.

109
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,279
Let's go shopping.

110
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,879
Shopping? Now?

111
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,519
It's my rule to go shopping...

112
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,119
at least once a day.

113
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,259
Sure. Where do you want to go?

114
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,170
There's a shop I frequent.
Follow me.

115
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,349
Guys who like easy-going women...

116
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:17,489
tend to hate it
when someone is extravagant.

117
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,790
Oh, dear. What do I do?

118
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,060
I left my wallet at home.

119
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,770
How about you buy me something
as a gift?

120
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,040
To celebrate our first date.

121
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,339
Sure.

122
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,709
Look around freely.

123
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,410
And if he's still pretending
to be unfazed,

124
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,109
then it's time
for the second strike!

125
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,820
Show me your most expensive items.

126
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:46,349
Please come this way.

127
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,259
These are
your most expensive items, right?

128
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,998
Gosh, I don't know
if it's because of the price tag.

129
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,959
I really love all of them.

130
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:02,670
Excuse me, Soo Ryeon?

131
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,739
Yes?

132
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,950
Choose anything you want.
Don't worry about the money.

133
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:28,859
(330 dollars)

134
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,530
This bag is worth
three months of my pay.

135
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,300
Why don't you carry it around?

136
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,669
It's the same brand
as the dress you're wearing,

137
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,009
so it'll be a perfect match.

138
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,009
Oh, that's why it felt familiar.

139
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,079
I already have this one at home.

140
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,550
I'll look around some more.

141
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,300
(Madonna Fashion)

142
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,749
You bought a passport case
when you don't even have a passport.

143
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,910
What odd taste you have.

144
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,050
Well, it's my hobby to buy
useless stuff.

145
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,339
Thank you for today...

146
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,509
- Gosh.
- Why are you getting in?

147
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,118
What are you doing?

148
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,519
I'll take you home.

149
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,718
Goodness. That's unnecessary.
I can go by myself.

150
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,489
My father told me to take you home
no matter what.

151
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,389
Please drop this lady off first.

152
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,128
Sure. Where to, ma'am?

153
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,259
Hyangrim-dong...
That came out wrong.

154
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,729
Please drop me off
in Dongmyeong-dong.

155
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,410
It's in the middle of the semester.
You must be busy.

156
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,650
What courses are you taking
in the school of law?

157
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,150
What kind of student takes classes
at a time like this?

158
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,949
We're boycotting all courses taught
by government-funded professors.

159
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,790
We consider all classes
to be canceled.

160
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:42,190
I see.
You consider classes to be canceled.

161
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,099
Then you must have more time
on your hands.

162
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:51,498
What about you?

163
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,910
Most interns don't even have
time to sleep.

164
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,209
How did you find the time
to go on a date in Gwangju?

165
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,849
I have a lot of time.
I'm not an intern.

166
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,410
I've deferred my graduation.

167
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,920
You deferred your graduation?

168
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,520
Goodness. You must've failed
the medical licensing exam.

169
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,599
I heard that a few people fail
every now and then,

170
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,260
but you're the first person
I've met in real life.

171
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,570
Sorry to disappoint you,

172
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,270
but I passed the exam.

173
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,609
Then why haven't you graduated?

174
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,719
I'll tell you when we become closer.

175
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,900
This is me. Are you happy now?

176
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,728
Hurry up and go home now.

177
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:55,229
Today was the most fun
I've had in a long time.

178
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,869
By the way, take this.

179
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,639
What is this?

180
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,810
You'll need it on our next date.

181
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,050
Our next date?

182
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,849
Didn't you say we have to meet
at least three times?

183
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,320
When should we meet next?

184
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,659
Well...

185
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,989
I'm not sure when I'll have time.

186
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,560
Hold on. Are you turning me down?

187
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,170
The thing is...

188
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,978
I hope you're not.

189
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,680
I'd love to see you again.

190
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,320
Me too. You should leave now.

191
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,919
- Can we meet again then?
- Yes. Call me.

192
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,419
How can I reach you?

193
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,019
Sir, please get going.

194
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,160
Wait.

195
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,200
Myeong Hee?

196
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,499
Soo Chan.
Are you just coming home now?

197
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,259
Wait. Why are you two
coming in together?

198
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,290
We met at the gate. That's why.

199
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,289
Hold on. Look at you.

200
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,660
Is that what you wore
to your blind date?

201
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,799
Myeong Hee looks like
she went on that blind date instead.

202
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,040
- What?
- What?

203
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,868
What? I was just joking.

204
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:44,239
Myeong Hee looks different
than usual.

205
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,878
I look funny in these clothes,
don't I?

206
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,280
They're all Soo Ryeon's.

207
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,190
You look great.
The clothes suit you perfectly.

208
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,290
Did you go somewhere nice?

209
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,128
What? Well... She was on a date.

210
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,459
We're going upstairs.

211
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,070
A date?

212
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,969
How did it go?

213
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,709
Even when you did everything
I told you to?

214
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,140
He's no ordinary guy, I tell you.

215
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,810
No matter what I did,
he did something worse.

216
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,420
What a weirdo.

217
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,849
What's all this booty
that you brought back?

218
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:32,390
Don't tell me you even got
to the boutique phase.

219
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:39,129
I'm not shameless.
I picked the cheapest one.

220
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,499
I don't know what this could be.
He gave it to me.

221
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,009
A pair of shoes?

222
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,810
Try them on.

223
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:08,629
They fit perfectly.

224
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:11,360
How did he figure out your size?

225
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,228
No idea.

226
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:15,469
Is this guy a pervert?

227
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,539
You know, like guys who have
an obsession with women's feet.

228
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,109
He did seem a little weird,

229
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,410
but he didn't really come off
as a pervert.

230
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,549
For now,

231
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,319
- we're putting these back in.
- Why?

232
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,119
"Why?"

233
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,019
Do you want your feet
to give him the okay sign?

234
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,958
Next time, we should plan ahead...

235
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,659
Forget it.
It's not going to work anyway.

236
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,430
It'll only torture me.

237
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,900
And I don't care
if I have to meet him a dozen times,

238
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,039
as long as I can get the airfare.

239
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,468
Hey, that's no problem.

240
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:56,640
I promise I'll get the money
before the third date.

241
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:59,239
So don't worry about anything
and get ready for your studies.

242
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,248
Anyway, what should you wear
on your next date?

243
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,390
We should probably pick out
some outfits beforehand.

244
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,279
Are you just getting home?

245
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,489
Have you been waiting for me?

246
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,830
Did you do anything that her family
might disapprove of?

247
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,430
No, not that I can think of.

248
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,729
Our family's future
depends on this marriage.

249
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,298
A communist brat like her...

250
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:00,670
might not be easy to control
at first,

251
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,309
but no girl is impossible to tame.

252
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,140
Make sure this works out.

253
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,009
Goodnight, Father.

254
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:19,590
Gosh.

255
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,410
I'm sorry I'm late.

256
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,709
My name is Lee Soo Ryeon.

257
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,429
I'm not the neat, spoiled son...

258
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,630
you have in mind.

259
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,769
You'll need it on our next date.

260
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:48,569
Honey.

261
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,709
Can you stop by Mudeung Stadium
on your way to work?

262
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,350
The stadium? Why?

263
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,478
Jung Tae has a meet today,
representing Gwangju...

264
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,989
in the provincial preliminaries.

265
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,920
Are you running again?

266
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:07,229
It's about time you quit.

267
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,059
If you're that focused on it,
you'll have no energy to study.

268
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:12,700
By the way, Hee Tae.

269
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,130
Have you asked her out
on a second date?

270
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,499
I'm working on it.

271
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,299
I'll see her again soon,
so don't worry.

272
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,080
You remember
the appointment today, right?

273
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,139
They're important people,
so don't be late.

274
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,239
Okay, Father.

275
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,420
(Kim Myeong Hee)

276
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,690
Myeong Hee, you have a call.

277
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,350
Me?

278
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,360
I'm not expecting a call.

279
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,630
A man asked to speak to you
in an urgent voice.

280
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:43,299
What?

281
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,539
Hello?

282
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,269
Myeong Hee!

283
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,670
Myeong Hee, I'm in Gwangju now.

284
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,755
You haven't forgotten
about the meet today, right?

285
00:22:57,779 --> 00:22:58,909
You have to come!

286
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,749
Kim Myeong Soo!
I told you not to call...

287
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,478
I told you not to call me at work.

288
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:07,519
You're coming, right? You'd better.

289
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,789
I'll keep calling you
until you come.

290
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:15,489
Okay. What time does it start?

291
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,700
Let's start with this.
Then I will...

292
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,569
My goodness.

293
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,900
Your father will faint
when he comes home.

294
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,709
Why don't you set up
a command center here?

295
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,340
You jerk! Don't crack such a joke.

296
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,180
Keep talking.
I'll be right back, guys.

297
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,420
What's your problem?

298
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,819
Do you not want this?

299
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,519
(540-3 Boncheon-dong,
Seo-gu, Gwangju)

300
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,239
How did you find out?
You said it'd be hard.

301
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,830
I stumbled
upon an unexpected helper.

302
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,829
I went to middle school with her.

303
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,269
Jang Seok Chul isn't a common name
for girls, you know.

304
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,840
We met briefly the other day.

305
00:23:58,969 --> 00:23:59,969
What's your name?

306
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,369
I'm Park Sun Min.

307
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,580
Thank you, Sun Min.

308
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,509
She must be that girl.

309
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,479
Your secret girlfriend in Gwangju.

310
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:13,519
The three of us
should grab a bite together soon.

311
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Bye, sis.

312
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,959
- That crazy jerk!
- What's he saying?

313
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,209
Soo Ryeon!

314
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,709
Goodness.

315
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,380
Soo Ryeon.

316
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,360
(Madonna Fashion)

317
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,290
You should always watch
where you're walking, Soo Ryeon.

318
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,170
I'm sorry. I called you,
but you didn't hear me.

319
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,999
Hwang Hee Tae?

320
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,940
Did you follow me?

321
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,140
What?

322
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:47,009
I'm going to the bus stop too,
so don't be so guarded.

323
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:50,719
You're rich.
Why won't you take a taxi?

324
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,390
Isn't your family wealthier
than mine?

325
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,558
I wasn't sure
whether it was you or not.

326
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,890
Your style is very different
from the last time I saw you.

327
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,830
I was at a rally earlier.

328
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,299
Oh, is that right?

329
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,239
That makes you even more likable
than last time.

330
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,269
Don't be sarcastic.

331
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,640
I really meant it.

332
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,549
By the way,
what are you looking for?

333
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,509
I can't find the bus token.

334
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,248
You can be on your way.
I have to get some tokens.

335
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,219
Oh, I have some that I can spare.

336
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,590
Will this be enough?

337
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,830
Do you sell tokens?

338
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:38,429
How do I go about doing that?

339
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,830
Should I charge interest?

340
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,539
Well, then I'll just take one...

341
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,769
It's not like I can dig the ground
and find these.

342
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,650
Take them all
and pay me back with interest.

343
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,150
Sure, okay.

344
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:03,719
We should meet again.
The flowers are in full bloom.

345
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,689
Sorry, I have somewhere to be.

346
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,759
Bye.

347
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,090
What? Wait.

348
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,830
Soo Ryeon!

349
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:21,709
Soo Ryeon! Then how about tomorrow?

350
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:24,609
What's this?
Get out if you're not getting on.

351
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,709
Just a second please.

352
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:28,179
You, the lady over there
with her head facing the window...

353
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,249
and with her left hand
over her face!

354
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,249
Are you free tomorrow?

355
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,019
Miss!

356
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,690
He's asking you
if he can see you tomorrow.

357
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,988
Yes, sure!

358
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,190
Where? What time?

359
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:53,709
My goodness!
Just meet at Woo Cafe around 4 p.m.

360
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:58,109
Okay, 4 p.m. at Woo Cafe it is.

361
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,910
Thank you all for waiting.

362
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,279
All right!

363
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,090
- Go for it!
- You got this!

364
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:10,860
Good luck!

365
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:12,890
Kim Myeong Soo!

366
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,029
Myeong Hee!

367
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,199
Myeong Hee!

368
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,130
(Naju)

369
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,340
Good luck, Myeong Soo!

370
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:26,299
Thanks!

371
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,169
(Go, Suseong Middle School!)

372
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,640
(Go, Eungbo Middle School!)

373
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,880
- Good luck.
- You got this!

374
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,979
Best of luck!

375
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,390
- You got this.
- Good luck!

376
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:42,489
- Go for it!
- Do a good job!

377
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,700
Myeong Soo, my gosh...

378
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,819
(Gwangju)

379
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,719
My gosh!

380
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,559
Go, Myeong Soo!

381
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,319
(Gwangju)

382
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,989
Myeong Soo! I'm so proud of you.

383
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,899
You made Naju proud!

384
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,930
What are you talking about?
I came in second.

385
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,799
This means I'm out.

386
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:37,538
What? You didn't know?

387
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,968
Second-place winners can participate
in the Junior Sports Festival.

388
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:41,738
You now represent
South Jeolla Province!

389
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,670
What? Seriously?

390
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:46,039
My gosh!
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

391
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,609
My lungs are about to burst.

392
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,350
This is an announcement.

393
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:51,079
Catch your breath.

394
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,119
I have to go to the main desk.

395
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,390
Teachers, please come
to the main desk.

396
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,430
My gosh.

397
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:05,429
Even though your shoes came off,

398
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,569
you almost beat Hwang Jung Tae.

399
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,469
You totally could've come
in first place.

400
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,469
What is your name?

401
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,609
I'm Kim Myeong Soo.

402
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,670
Myeong Soo?

403
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,610
Myeong Soo?
It sounds like a digestive drink.

404
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,120
I'll see you
at the Spartan training.

405
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:31,420
"Spartan training?"

406
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,519
Myeong Hee!

407
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,559
I did it. I made the team!

408
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,558
The second place winner can join
the South Jeolla team too!

409
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,968
What?

410
00:31:40,969 --> 00:31:44,269
Gosh, I'm so proud of you.

411
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,169
My little bear.
What do you want to eat?

412
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,238
Just tell me.
I'll buy you everything.

413
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,039
I want...

414
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,478
What? Is it because of your friends?

415
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,778
Bring them along. I'll buy...

416
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,279
Father!

417
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,069
We don't need any entrees.

418
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,019
We'll just have three bowls
of jjajangmyeon.

419
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:24,640
We'll have tangsuyuk too.
Make it a large.

420
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,180
One large tangsuyuk and three bowls
of jjajangmyeon coming up.

421
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,329
Oh, my.
This jjajangmyeon looks delicious.

422
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,029
Let's eat.

423
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:53,370
You're supposed to be a runner.
Look at the state of your shoes.

424
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:57,069
With good shoes,
you would've easily won the race.

425
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,580
Mind your own business
and get some new shoes yourself.

426
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,380
What kind of grown woman wears
shoes like those?

427
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,420
The more I think of it,
the stranger it seems.

428
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,329
Is the bank clerk intercepting
all the money...

429
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,229
or does your wallet have a hole
in it?

430
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,360
Where did
all my hard-earned money go?

431
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,370
Oh, I almost forgot.

432
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,739
Can I stay with you
at the boarding house...

433
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,640
for a few days?

434
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,279
The provincial representatives
will be training in Gwangju.

435
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:37,949
Does that mean...

436
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,479
you'll be coming to Gwangju
every weekend?

437
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,749
Actually, it's not just
the weekends.

438
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,788
We'll be training there
throughout May.

439
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:49,890
What did you say? Throughout May?

440
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,458
What about school?

441
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:52,958
The teacher said...

442
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:56,169
the school wouldn't care
as long as it's for training.

443
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,299
No.

444
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,339
Enough with your nonsense.
Just stay in school.

445
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,769
Father.

446
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:08,979
Do you break your children's wings
as a hobby?

447
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,749
What did you say?

448
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,449
I'll look after Myeong Soo
during his training.

449
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,060
Stay out of it.

450
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,339
Just worry about yourself.

451
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,680
- Get up.
- Father.

452
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,290
Sit back down.

453
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,330
We haven't had the tangsuyuk yet.

454
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,230
Are you coming or not?

455
00:35:21,649 --> 00:35:23,989
Well... Excuse me.

456
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,390
Is this Ms. Jang Seok Chul's home?

457
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,859
Is someone here?

458
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,810
She started sending us
less and less money.

459
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:42,569
In the end, she stopped completely.

460
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:44,909
Is it about a guy?

461
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,540
No, that's not it.

462
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:49,449
She probably stopped sending money
because of the factory strike.

463
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,980
It's been going on for months.

464
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,119
A strike?

465
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,588
Did she get arrested
for going on strike or something?

466
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:57,319
No, she didn't get arrested.

467
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,790
The thing is,

468
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:05,029
she got seriously injured.

469
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,298
She's in a hospital in Seoul
right now,

470
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,999
but she'll be transferred
to a hospital in Gwangju soon...

471
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,369
Wait. If she's sent here to Gwangju,

472
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,509
she can't work
at the factory anymore.

473
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,480
Right now,
she's not in the condition to work.

474
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,579
This isn't much,
but use this for living expenses...

475
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,180
and her medication.

476
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,620
Who cares about her medication?

477
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
My eldest son...

478
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:34,660
can't go back to school
because he can't pay his tuition.

479
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,700
Why did that wench have to...

480
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:42,500
go on that useless strike?

481
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,409
The boy's family told me that...

482
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,508
the date went well. I'm surprised.

483
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:56,179
What else could I do?

484
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,148
Going on three dates
was the condition.

485
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:00,549
Goodness.

486
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,918
Your effort has paid off.
You should go and see.

487
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,088
What do you mean?

488
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,489
I got a call that
your gang has been released.

489
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:11,359
Is that right?

490
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,029
Father. Father!

491
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:20,769
My goodness. That's enough.

492
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,378
Father. I'm going out for a bit.

493
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:25,839
See you later.

494
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,149
My gosh.

495
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:31,818
(Shut down professors' offices!)

496
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:33,980
Guys, I brought tofu for you.

497
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,049
(Report the facts!)

498
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:39,020
Hold on.
Why do you all look so serious?

499
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,290
Did something happen?

500
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:45,100
Have some tofu first...

501
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:52,839
How did you get us out?

502
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,668
What are you talking about?

503
00:37:56,669 --> 00:38:01,009
No. Maybe the first question
should be how you got out.

504
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:03,680
Tell us.

505
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:06,850
You're the one who got caught
holding a bunch of flyers.

506
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,520
So how come you were the first
to get released?

507
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,699
What could I do?

508
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,870
With all our seniors
being wanted and on the run,

509
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,200
I couldn't let you guys
go to prison.

510
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:25,870
In that case,

511
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,739
why don't you ask your father
to let them off the hook too?

512
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,249
Guys, don't be like that.

513
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,909
We're all here to fight
for democracy.

514
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,549
Yes, we're all here
to fight for democracy...

515
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,850
except one person is
here to play tag.

516
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:47,730
You apparently had no problem...

517
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,930
with using my father's factory
for printing out flyers.

518
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,229
And all of a sudden,

519
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,330
we belong to different classes?

520
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,270
You could've been straightforward
and said you don't like me.

521
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,779
Wait, Soo Ryeon.

522
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,579
Come on.
While trying to save five seconds,

523
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,548
you may lose 50 years of life.

524
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,548
No jaywalking.

525
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:17,789
Sir, you're not a car.
Please use the sidewalk.

526
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,890
- Sir!
- Gosh.

527
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,890
Wait.

528
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,730
How dare you try to jaywalk
right in front of an officer?

529
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:30,229
Aren't you the criminal
that I caught red-handed?

530
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,838
Hey, there.
Do you break the law as a hobby?

531
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,140
Your father won't be able to
get you out this time.

532
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:38,310
Shouldn't you try
to keep up appearances?

533
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,049
A well-off person should set
a good example...

534
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,989
I was just...

535
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,960
I didn't mean to make you cry.

536
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,028
Hey, Hyun Chul.

537
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:03,989
It's not a market day today.
What brings you here?

538
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,040
Well...

539
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:10,439
Show us a pair of running shoes.

540
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,239
They are...

541
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:16,048
for the National Sports Festival.

542
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:18,249
So show us the best pair you have.

543
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,419
The National Sports Festival?

544
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:21,689
Myeong Soo!
Are you participating in it?

545
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:26,089
We have these ones and...

546
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,930
There's this one too.

547
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,759
Take your pick.

548
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:47,139
This one?

549
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,950
Unlike your father,
you have a good eye.

550
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,519
Do you want to try them on?
All right, come here.

551
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,790
Here, the right foot first.

552
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,989
Let's see.

553
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,489
There. Perfect.

554
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,160
Father.

555
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:04,859
It's really okay.

556
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,299
I guess he doesn't want new shoes.
Forget it then.

557
00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:09,699
No!

558
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,540
Now, try on the left shoe too.

559
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,238
Put them on and try running in them.

560
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,159
Come on. Hurry,
before your dad changes his mind.

561
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,640
Try running in them. Yes, try now.

562
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,049
How is it?

563
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,119
It should be somewhere around here.

564
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,620
What's that, Father?

565
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,988
The recipient is Kim Myeong Hee?

566
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:35,128
(To Kim Myeong Hee)

567
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:36,160
What?

568
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:39,560
Oh, I brought this because it has
your sister's address on it.

569
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,969
Father, did you write her a letter?

570
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:44,898
Give me that.

571
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:46,238
I'll hand-deliver it.

572
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,539
This way, you don't have to buy
the postage stamp.

573
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,540
You rascal.

574
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:52,509
Hey, that tickles.

575
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:54,910
- Stop.
- Oh, it's Myeong Hee.

576
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,310
Myeong Hee!

577
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,759
I should get going.
Here, take your shoes.

578
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,960
I'll stop by the training camp later
and drop off your clothes.

579
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:14,029
What? Aren't you going to say hi
to Myeong Hee?

580
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,629
Go on. She's waiting.

581
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:18,799
Myeong Hee!

582
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,529
Dear Lord.

583
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,459
Please bless us with the ability
to help those in need...

584
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,330
and spread kindness.

585
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,769
Please give us the strength
to fully carry out our mission...

586
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,540
using the abilities
that you bestowed upon us.

587
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,168
Lord, we pray to you...

588
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:58,310
with all our hearts.

589
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:59,909
- Amen.
- Amen.

590
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,210
Amen.

591
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,680
I'm sorry I'm late.

592
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,159
You're late indeed.
You should introduce yourself.

593
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
Sure.

594
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:16,060
Hello.

595
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:19,109
My father must've already told you
lots of good things about me.

596
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,029
It's nice to meet you in person.

597
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,129
I'm Hwang Hee Tae, his eldest son.

598
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,040
My gosh.

599
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,750
My goodness. Mr. Hwang,
what a happy family you have.

600
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:37,579
Your wife is the most gorgeous lady
in Gwangju,

601
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,020
and your son attends
the number one university in Korea.

602
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
And...

603
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:44,319
your younger son is adorable.

604
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,520
I'm sure just looking at them
makes you happy.

605
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,330
Kiddo, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

606
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,029
A doctor, like your big brother?

607
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,640
I want to...

608
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:00,468
Actually, Jung Tae qualified...

609
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:02,809
to compete
in the Junior Sports Festival as...

610
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,140
He wants to become a soldier.

611
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,679
He's already training...

612
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,250
to attend the Military Academy
later on.

613
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:12,620
Clearly, he takes after his father.

614
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,350
What a blessed family!

615
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:19,790
Wait.

616
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,060
Don't eat so fast.
You'll burn your tongue again.

617
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,210
You can eat now.

618
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:45,849
If someone asks me what I'd want
to eat in my final moments,

619
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,020
I'd pick ramyeon cooked by you.

620
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,290
Eat up.

621
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,989
Eat it with kimchi at least.

622
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,890
I said I could fix you
a proper meal.

623
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,660
My gosh, thank you.

624
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,798
- Eat up.
- I'm home.

625
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:03,999
Hey, you're back.

626
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,500
Oh, I smell ramyeon!

627
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:09,969
Careful, it's hot.

628
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,609
Who's this kid?

629
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,349
Myeong Hee, is he your secret child?

630
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,389
Gosh!

631
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,290
You wench, watch what you say.

632
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,089
He's my baby brother.

633
00:45:26,419 --> 00:45:28,430
He's here
for his track and field training.

634
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,700
Hello, I'm Kim Myeong Soo.

635
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:38,339
Unlike you, he's very friendly.

636
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:40,500
Cut it out.

637
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,468
- Take your shoes off, will you?
- Gosh.

638
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:45,139
- And go wash your hands.
- That hurts!

639
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,878
- That's the point!
- Stop hitting me! It hurts.

640
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:49,309
Like I said, that is the point!

641
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,180
- Why you...
- Stop! I'll take them off.

642
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,980
Here. Are we good now?

643
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,489
Myeong Hee.

644
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,720
If you're going abroad,
when will you return?

645
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,569
I'll come back when your grandson
is getting married.

646
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,370
You're leaving
because you hate our family, right?

647
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:26,480
What is this nonsense about?

648
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,890
Can you not leave?

649
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:31,859
If you leave,
you won't get to see me win a medal.

650
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:34,960
Father doesn't even know
that you're leaving.

651
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:47,069
You're just a kid.
Stay out of grown folks' business.

652
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,069
I just...

653
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:54,980
want to see you and Father
get back on good terms.

654
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:56,950
Like the old days.

655
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,589
Back then, you smiled a lot
even when you were at home with us,

656
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,390
like you're doing here.

657
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,060
You little rascal.

658
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,700
Just go to sleep.

659
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,770
Get home safely, ma'am.

660
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:39,589
A few more dinners with them
will make you quit smoking.

661
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,430
I told you not to be late.

662
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,060
Where were you?

663
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,370
I went to see Soo Ryeon.

664
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:52,270
You said
I should see her again soon.

665
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,799
I'm meeting her tomorrow.

666
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,980
Myeong Hee,
can I borrow your powder?

667
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:15,329
You'll start middle school soon.

668
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,890
How do you still not know
how to tie your own shoelaces?

669
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,550
It's because I've never owned shoes
with laces before.

670
00:48:23,899 --> 00:48:26,568
Stop! That's way too tight.

671
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:28,409
This way, it won't come undone
even if you run.

672
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:31,140
There.

673
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,850
Are you sure
I don't have to go with you?

674
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,149
I'm not a baby.
I can look at the map.

675
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,750
I'm very good with directions,
you know?

676
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,859
See you later, Myeong Hee!

677
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,429
Watch out for cars.

678
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,189
And come home
as soon as you're done!

679
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,799
My goodness.

680
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,100
It's warm today.
What's with the coat?

681
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:02,640
Well...

682
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,379
My hands and feet
get cold so easily, you know.

683
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,379
See you later!

684
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:16,418
- I told you.
- Who can I take?

685
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:17,549
You can go with Ms. Choi.

686
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:18,919
Would she be free?

687
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:22,960
My gosh, Myeong Hee!

688
00:49:23,529 --> 00:49:24,759
Are you going somewhere today?

689
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,298
Why did you get all dolled up
to come to work?

690
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,430
Who are you trying to impress?
My goodness.

691
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:33,939
Not you, obviously.
Just finish that cigarette.

692
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,310
Why that little...

693
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:44,919
- Rock-paper-scissors. Paper.
- Paper, paper.

694
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,250
Are you here for the training?

695
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,189
You can come stand here.

696
00:50:05,899 --> 00:50:07,298
Oh, that's...

697
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:09,739
Always be careful
and eat well, okay?

698
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,608
Don't push yourself too hard.

699
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,479
- Call me if anything happens.
- Okay.

700
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,710
Even his mom is so pretty.

701
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,180
She's prettier than Jung Yoon Hee.

702
00:50:20,149 --> 00:50:22,120
She used her looks to become
a mistress.

703
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,319
My mom told me...

704
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,359
that Hwang Jung Tae's mom
is a mistress.

705
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:28,859
"Mistress?"

706
00:50:43,939 --> 00:50:46,109
It's nice to meet you.

707
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:49,709
I'm your coach who's in charge of
your overall training,

708
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,249
Park Chul Bum.

709
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,449
The month of May will become
a month you'll remember...

710
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:58,688
as the most passionate moment
of your lives.

711
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:02,259
I'll make that happen through
a Spartan-style training program.

712
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,859
Now, everyone get into groups
according to your main event!

713
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,629
- Center.
- Center.

714
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:12,140
Move faster.

715
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:18,169
You two have the same shoes.

716
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,219
They're not the same.

717
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,519
His shoes look cheap.

718
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,750
- What?
- It's fake.

719
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,189
Did you buy that at the market?

720
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,488
Why do you care what I bought...

721
00:51:35,489 --> 00:51:37,390
or where I bought it from?

722
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:42,299
Hey, doesn't he smell like a beggar?

723
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,569
What?

724
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:47,140
You little...

725
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:53,809
Hey, Myeong Soo and Jung Tae,
come here.

726
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,310
Get over here now!

727
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:04,249
The hardest thing in the world
is to become a steady sponsor.

728
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,890
I'll make sure
this money is put to good use.

729
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,890
Oh, yes.

730
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:10,930
Okay.

731
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,960
(Executive Director, Lee Soo Chan)

732
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:17,298
Thank you for your time.

733
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:19,540
Gosh, I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

734
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:27,509
(Emergency Room)

735
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,159
Excuse me, when can you check this?

736
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,930
Oh, I'll be right there.

737
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,899
I'll be right back.

738
00:52:57,469 --> 00:52:58,879
Oh, dear.

739
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:01,949
(Emergency Room)

740
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,350
Ma'am.

741
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,149
You look very busy.

742
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,489
Hey, Soo Chan.
What are you doing here?

743
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,149
Are you hurt?

744
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,560
I come here often
even when I feel fine.

745
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,128
Is it about time to go home now?

746
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:20,499
I'll be waiting outside.

747
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,799
How about dinner?

748
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,568
I'm sorry. I have plans tonight.

749
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:28,739
Plans?

750
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,579
Oh, is it that date
you mentioned last time?

751
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,450
No, it's not a date. It's...

752
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,619
Soo Chan, I'm still on the clock.

753
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,620
Oh, right.

754
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,620
I'm sorry to bother you
when you're so busy.

755
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,060
I'll see you next time then.

756
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,759
Goodbye.

757
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:12,379
Thank you.

758
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:22,029
Excuse me?

759
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,299
Which fork do we have to use?
There are so many.

760
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,200
This is the salad fork,
and this is for the main dish.

761
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:33,370
Thank you.

762
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,870
I thought you were used to stuff
like this.

763
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,338
Aren't you rich?

764
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:40,878
I'm totally clueless,

765
00:54:40,879 --> 00:54:44,049
but I just came here because I heard
this place is expensive and famous.

766
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,450
I just wanted to impress you.

767
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,049
Oh, right.

768
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:53,790
My tokens.

769
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,410
My gosh.

770
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:11,839
Are these brass coins or what?

771
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,279
I can't deny it.

772
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,648
Every time I meet you,

773
00:55:16,649 --> 00:55:19,549
it feels like I laugh more
than the past few years combined.

774
00:55:20,419 --> 00:55:21,520
Gosh.

775
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,849
You say that to every girl you meet,
don't you?

776
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,359
No. You're the first.

777
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,259
After struggling with my life
all day long,

778
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,730
I feel free whenever I meet you.

779
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,410
You're really special. I mean it.

780
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:50,609
It is special to be the daughter
of Changhwa Industrial.

781
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,620
Did the shoes I bought you last time
fit well?

782
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:01,189
Well, the thing is...

783
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:03,559
Man, this place is nice.

784
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,059
It took me a month
to get a reservation at this place.

785
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,830
I never expected you
to bring me here.

786
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:16,609
Why? Shall I order something else?

787
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,339
I suddenly feel thirsty.

788
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,750
What kind of drinks do they have?

789
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:28,318
- I can't believe it's just us two.
- Is your hand trembling?

790
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,318
- Shall I order some beer?
- Where are the girls?

791
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,120
- No, I'll just have water.
- Come on, I barely got us a table.

792
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:35,858
- Go on and eat.
- You can come with her next time.

793
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,559
"Her?" Who?

794
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,159
You know,

795
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,529
that nurse in the ER
that you're hitting on.

796
00:56:42,629 --> 00:56:45,599
- That cold-hearted girl.
- Oh, her?

797
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,199
Cold-hearted, my foot.

798
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,210
It turns out she's a total vixen.

799
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:53,779
She's just wagging her tail
to marry into a rich family.

800
00:56:53,939 --> 00:56:55,778
What a true surprise.

801
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:59,048
You know, that guy who supplies
our hospital with imported medicine.

802
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,819
Don't force yourself to eat.
You'll get sick.

803
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,749
I'm not feeling well.

804
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,218
- Can we...
- But you know,

805
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:09,059
no matter how hard she tries,
no rich man will want her.

806
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,489
She should know her place.

807
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,329
- You know what I mean, right?
- Soo Ryeon, I'll go get some water.

808
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,330
Why is she trying so hard?

809
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:18,599
Let's choose our menu.

810
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,139
I'll have the New York steak course.

811
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,910
What shall I have?

812
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,040
What the...

813
00:57:28,509 --> 00:57:30,309
Are you crazy?

814
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:33,278
My goodness. I'm sorry.
My hand must've slipped.

815
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:35,318
How could your hand slip on my head?

816
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,318
- Darn it.
- I'm so sorry.

817
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,960
- I'll pay to get it cleaned.
- What?

818
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,028
I can't believe this.

819
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:45,189
Hey, Myeong... Wait...

820
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:50,128
Use this to get it dry-cleaned.

821
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:51,770
And watch your mouth from now on.

822
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,270
(New York Steak)

823
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,239
Soo Ryeon!

824
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,349
Are you okay? Can you get up?

825
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,379
I'm fine. It's just a sprain.

826
00:58:09,189 --> 00:58:11,020
- Let me carry you.
- No.

827
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:14,890
I said it's okay. I can walk.

828
00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:17,559
How can you walk wearing this...

829
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,299
I said I can walk!

830
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:29,969
My gosh!

831
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,738
What are you doing?

832
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:36,648
You need treatment.
Let's go to the hospital.

833
00:58:36,649 --> 00:58:37,850
No.

834
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:40,419
Not the hospital.

835
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:52,960
Lift your foot.

836
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,379
Wow, look at those flower petals.

837
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,269
I took an introductory course
on Botany,

838
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:32,439
and I bet all these flowers
will wither by next weekend.

839
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,169
So that means...

840
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:40,839
we must meet again
before next weekend.

841
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:49,049
Does your father keep forcing you
to meet me?

842
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,359
I'm the daughter of
Changhwa Industrial,

843
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:53,819
so you must marry me, is that it?

844
01:00:02,129 --> 01:00:03,529
To be honest,

845
01:00:04,469 --> 01:00:06,969
it wasn't my first time seeing you
at the hotel.

846
01:00:10,439 --> 01:00:13,509
I witnessed the car accident
in front of the hotel.

847
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,419
The whole time I was waiting...

848
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:22,218
for Ms. Lee Soo Ryeon
in the coffee shop,

849
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,219
I was thinking,

850
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,588
"Gosh. Who cares about this date?"

851
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,819
"I should've talked to that girl
from earlier."

852
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:32,029
But then...

853
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,660
you walked in...

854
01:00:35,669 --> 01:00:36,870
as my date.

855
01:00:39,799 --> 01:00:42,016
You didn't have to be Lee Soo Ryeon,
the daughter of Changhwa Industrial.

856
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,469
Even if you were Ms. Song Mal Ja...

857
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,680
or Ms. Kim Bok Soon,

858
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,420
it would've made no difference
to me.

859
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,129
It's done.

860
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,910
My goodness.

861
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:23,549
I can see
that you received good training.

862
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:27,579
If only you had passed the exam,
you would've made a great doctor.

863
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,689
Gosh. I said I passed.

864
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,850
Why can't you believe me?

865
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,319
It's not that I failed to graduate.
I chose not to.

866
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,359
Why would you choose not to?

867
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:40,930
Do you want to know why?

868
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,140
But if I tell you,

869
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:49,509
it'll mean we're close.

870
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,289
I'm entering
the University Song Festival.

871
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:03,390
What?

872
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:05,919
I'm not qualified once I graduate.

873
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:09,029
I can only enter it
because I'm still a student.

874
01:02:23,939 --> 01:02:26,140
I can sing for you sometime.

875
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:29,549
Can we meet again
before the flowers wither?

876
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:44,369
Did you write the song yourself?

877
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:46,859
I did.

878
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,270
Then I'd love to.

879
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:15,259
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

880
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,758
To think how proudly they pointed
their fingers at me...

881
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,759
like they were independence fighters
or something.

882
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,298
They'd find fault
with whatever you do.

883
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:26,870
Don't let it bother you.

884
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,040
What's that anyway?

885
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,140
Oh, I came to return your clothes.

886
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,379
I'll return the blouse
after washing it.

887
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:43,319
Did you meet him again?

888
01:03:43,549 --> 01:03:44,818
When? How?

889
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:46,919
I've been ignoring all his calls.

890
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,029
I ran into him.

891
01:03:51,529 --> 01:03:55,299
I couldn't reach you,
so I just went to see him.

892
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,169
I couldn't answer the phone
because I was too upset.

893
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,200
Did anything special happen?

894
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,569
I'm meeting him once more soon.

895
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:11,210
But I feel so bad for lying to him.

896
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:15,278
Why did those punks have to kick
at the tofu I brought?

897
01:04:15,279 --> 01:04:17,250
They could've just returned it
to me.

898
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:22,560
Sorry.

899
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:24,790
What were you saying?

900
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:30,869
I'm meeting the guy once more soon.

901
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,798
You don't have to anymore.

902
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:33,799
What?

903
01:04:34,439 --> 01:04:36,108
You've done enough.

904
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:38,810
I only asked you to meet him
to get those punks out.

905
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:47,579
I'll still give you the money
for your airfare as promised,

906
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,049
so don't worry about that.

907
01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:53,120
Thanks for all the trouble
you went to for me.

908
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:00,330
Soo Ryeon,
come downstairs for a moment.

909
01:05:06,899 --> 01:05:08,270
You really didn't have to.

910
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,269
Soo Ryeon, get over here.

911
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:13,439
Mr. Hwang sent us
this precious gift.

912
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,910
A gift? What gift?

913
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:21,080
And his son brought it
all the way here in person.

914
01:06:14,569 --> 01:06:16,569
You must be surprised
that I showed up unannounced,

915
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:18,739
Soo Ryeon.

916
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,439
(Youth of May)

917
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:07,988
This is Mr. Hwang's son.

918
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:10,159
- You know him well, don't you?
- What?

919
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,459
What kind of scheme brings you here?

920
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,829
I'm here to figure out your scheme.

921
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:13,959
I'd like to apologize.

922
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,599
Do you and Myeong Hee
know each other?

923
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,798
Would you mind writing down
your phone number here?

924
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:19,298
I'll write it
with a permanent marker.

925
01:07:19,299 --> 01:07:20,375
Are you here to order rice cakes
for your wedding?

926
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:21,799
- Marriage?
- It seems like...

927
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:22,839
our parents are talking about it.

928
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,468
My in-laws are looking
for a business to invest in.

929
01:07:25,469 --> 01:07:27,479
Hee Tae. How did you find my house?

930
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,139
- Just a moment.
- Do you drink?

931
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,108
I'll have just one glass, sir.

932
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:32,278
Are you drunk?

933
01:07:32,279 --> 01:07:34,180
Can you sit with me for a moment?
