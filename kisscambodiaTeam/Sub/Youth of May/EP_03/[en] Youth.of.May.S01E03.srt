1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,509
Leave them here.

2
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,180
- That should go in the back seat.
- Yes, sir.

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,078
If you bribe someone like this,

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,649
you'll be caught right away.

5
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,589
I guess you could call this a bribe.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,689
Today is your future
father-in-law's birthday.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,859
What?

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,800
I'm grateful enough that you came
to wish me a happy birthday.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,630
You really didn't
have to bring anything.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,569
Soo Ryeon, get over here.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,040
Mr. Hwang sent us
this precious gift.

12
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,338
A gift? What gift?

13
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:45,949
And his son brought it
all the way here in person.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,588
We must expel...

15
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:03,399
all government-funded professors,
who have lived as parasites...

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,629
of the Yushin dictatorship
from our sacred campus!

17
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:28,649
You must be surprised
that I showed up unannounced,

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,519
Soo Ryeon.

19
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,909
Why are you standing around?
Come have a seat.

20
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,379
Guys, come have a seat.

21
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,580
Well, I should get going.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,489
Why? Stay and eat with us.

23
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,719
No, you have a guest.

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,258
Oh, are you uncomfortable?

25
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,929
No, I'm fine.

26
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:14,929
But Soo Ryeon's friend can do
as she wishes.

27
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,369
- I'll get going, then.
- Myeong Hee!

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,110
Where are you going?
Stay and eat with us.

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,748
No, I should get going.

30
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:28,649
Come on. I bought a cake.

31
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,219
Just stay and eat with us.

32
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,748
Who might this be?

33
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,719
Oh, Soo Chan.

34
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,860
This is Mr. Hwang's son,
who I told you about the other day.

35
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,429
Oh, the guy
Soo Ryeon has been seeing?

36
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,300
I'm Hwang Hee Tae.

37
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,938
Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,369
I'm Lee Soo Chan,
Soo Ryeon's brother.

39
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,350
(Episode 3, Your One Month)

40
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,289
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday.

41
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,759
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,730
Let's eat. Eat up.

43
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:26,769
Goodness.

44
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,809
I'm sorry that all we did was put
an extra spoon on the table.

45
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,778
I would've gotten a hen
had you told us you were coming.

46
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,249
A hen? Please, Dad.

47
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:38,050
If you cooked a hen on top of this,
the table would collapse.

48
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,849
It's a humble spread
but eat as much as you want.

49
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,850
Will do.

50
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:43,489
By the way, Hee Tae.

51
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,458
Soo Ryeon is such a tomboy.
What do you like about her?

52
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,928
Don't say that you like everything
about her.

53
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,759
That's such a cliche.

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,899
Why do you like her?

55
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,029
Well...

56
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,969
This place isn't open
to just anyone.

57
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,969
Can we trust you?

58
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:06,610
She left a strong first impression
on me.

59
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,488
Right away,
she said we should go print...

60
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,609
some anti-government flyers.

61
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,360
My gosh, you're really something.

62
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:30,239
Soo Ryeon, what about you?
What do you like about him?

63
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,609
Are you losing your mind?
Why must you ask such a question?

64
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,309
I'm curious too.

65
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,480
I want to know
how you've felt about me until now.

66
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,389
The thing is...

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,730
Whatever, never mind.
Let's just eat.

68
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:00,800
My gosh.

69
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,876
It seems like
you really should get married soon.

70
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,369
I've never seen you get so shy.

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,669
I told you!
It's really not like that.

72
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,739
Goodness, you and your temper.

73
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,050
Myeong Hee, you know them well,
don't you?

74
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,290
What?

75
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:25,389
Oh, the rice cake place.
You said you're a regular.

76
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,559
I should order some rice cakes
for the grand opening.

77
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,559
Will they take good care of me
if I go alone?

78
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,899
Why don't I go there
and place the order for you?

79
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,498
It's very close to my house,
you know.

80
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,800
Let's just go together then.

81
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,770
How about we meet there
before your shift tomorrow?

82
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,910
All right, then. Come on.

83
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,790
Dad, shall I tell them
to come back inside?

84
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,650
No, leave them alone.
Don't ruin the mood.

85
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,840
I'll drop the honorifics
since we're the same age.

86
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:17,379
What kind of scheme brings you here?

87
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,579
Me?

88
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,009
I'm here to figure out your scheme.

89
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:24,678
What was your purpose
behind starting this ruse?

90
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:27,290
And what do you plan to do
going forward?

91
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,929
My purpose and plan? It's simple.

92
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,068
I don't want to marry you.

93
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,928
Go ahead and reject me.

94
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,540
You need to gauge
the situation better.

95
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,040
I'm the one who has leverage
over you.

96
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:49,339
Reject you? Why would I?
It'll be such a hassle.

97
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,739
All I need to do is
tell our parents what you did.

98
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,549
Go ahead then!

99
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,920
Why bother playing along?

100
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,689
I don't want to get Myeong Hee
into trouble.

101
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,689
Why are you bringing her up
all of a sudden?

102
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,189
She has nothing to do with you.

103
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,800
I like her, that's why.

104
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,900
What? Who?

105
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,938
You like Myeong Hee?

106
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:19,410
Yes, I like Myeong Hee.
Got a problem with that?

107
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,039
Hey, I sent Myeong Hee there...

108
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,710
to be rejected in my place.

109
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,179
Right.

110
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,919
If getting rejected was your goal,
you should've come yourself.

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,919
Why did you have to send Myeong Hee
as your stand-in...

112
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,449
and complicate things?

113
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,720
You're being ridiculous.

114
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,419
I think you got the wrong idea.

115
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,629
Don't you dare hit on her.

116
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,498
Myeong Hee has
no feelings for you whatsoever.

117
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:46,068
In fact, she can't stand you.

118
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,400
Well...

119
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,139
I have a hard time believing you.

120
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,139
You don't seem all that interested
in other people's feelings.

121
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,079
Money is the reason
she's been seeing you.

122
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,410
What?

123
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:04,420
Myeong Hee has been forcing herself
to see you to earn money.

124
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,759
Why?

125
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,489
Did you actually think
that she had feelings for you?

126
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,530
Yes.

127
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,139
What's with her suddenly?

128
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,040
Did you two have
a lover's quarrel or what?

129
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,138
Thank you so much for today.

130
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,409
And happy birthday, sir.

131
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,410
Thanks.

132
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,279
Gosh, I almost forgot.

133
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,290
I almost sent you home empty-handed.

134
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,688
Oh, right.

135
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,558
We packed some food for you.
Wait right here.

136
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,819
Oh, it's okay...

137
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:57,599
Is your leg okay?

138
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:03,910
It's true that I missed you,

139
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,179
but I didn't expect to see you here.

140
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,020
Hee Tae...

141
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:45,890
Then I'll see you again next time,
Myeong Hee.

142
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,050
Hee Tae, here.

143
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,359
Gosh, there was no need.

144
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,459
It's nothing much,
so no need to feel uncomfortable.

145
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,829
Okay, thank you.

146
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,300
- Drop by again next time.
- Sure.

147
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,170
Anyhow, I'm afraid
we'll have to maintain...

148
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,609
this situation for the time being.

149
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,609
What? Do you mean you'll keep lying?

150
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,650
What do you mean? It's not a lie.

151
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,079
What I mean is,

152
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,920
we'll just continue
to not tell the truth for a while.

153
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:22,619
Whenever I tell my dad
I'm going to meet him,

154
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,358
he's totally okay with it
whether it's day or night.

155
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,188
If he's going to find out anyway,

156
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:28,588
why don't we get
what we need out of it...

157
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:30,499
and worry about the aftermath later?

158
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,468
My goodness, you're totally crazy!

159
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:34,899
What if things get out of hand?

160
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,769
What will you do then?

161
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,900
Gosh, I don't know.

162
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,609
Anyway, let's stop talking
about that.

163
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,309
The thing is...

164
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,279
Myeong Hee, can I ask you something?

165
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,349
What?

166
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,679
Well...

167
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,819
Do you...

168
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,390
like Hwang Hee Tae?

169
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,329
What are you talking about?

170
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,270
No way!

171
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,630
Right?

172
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,800
Okay, I'm glad to hear that.

173
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,568
I made it quite certain...

174
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,540
that he won't hit on you anymore.

175
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,308
What did you say to him?

176
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:19,848
I told him you're meeting him
to make money...

177
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:22,079
and you have
no feelings for him whatsoever.

178
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,149
What... Did you really say that?

179
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,189
Yes. Why?

180
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,890
It's the truth, isn't it?
You won't see him again anyway.

181
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,459
Are you seeing him again?

182
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,199
No.

183
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,469
(Tonight at 7 p.m.,
Music Cafe Hee Hee Nak Rak)

184
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,579
What is it?

185
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,319
Is something wrong?

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,290
You look like an antsy dog.

187
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,260
The thing is...

188
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:10,630
A friend of mine wants to see me.

189
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,328
But my best friend...

190
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,030
hates that friend so much.

191
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,270
And she said
she won't hang out with us anymore.

192
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,270
Then don't meet that friend.

193
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,309
What if that friend keeps waiting,
thinking I'll show up?

194
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,380
Then meet secretly.

195
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:32,218
Then I'll be lying
to my best friend.

196
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,150
Don't meet the first friend then.

197
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,189
- But...
- Man, whatever.

198
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,890
If you want to go, just go.
If you don't, don't.

199
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:41,890
What's gotten into you?

200
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,209
The DJ at this place
is kind of ugly,

201
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,380
but he plays some amazing songs...

202
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,848
Hey, two o'clock, look.

203
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:06,920
Two o'clock?

204
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,260
He's gorgeous, isn't he?

205
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,500
- Hey, give me some lipstick.
- Lipstick?

206
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,569
What for?

207
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,690
Are you going to go talk to him?

208
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,779
Are you insane?

209
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,050
Only a woman with courage
gets the hot guy.

210
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,650
I'll go fix my makeup
and go right over.

211
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
Myeong Hee.

212
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,170
It'll taste bad
if you keep stirring it like that.

213
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,839
That's how I like it.

214
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,780
Why did you ask to meet me?

215
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,160
I promised to play my song for you.

216
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,729
Were you waiting for me
all this time for that?

217
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,199
What about you then?

218
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,929
Why did you come?

219
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,199
I came to apologize.

220
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,569
I'm sorry for deceiving you
all this time.

221
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,349
Why are you apologizing?
You never deceived me.

222
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,449
Why didn't you say anything
when you knew?

223
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,009
If I said something,
we wouldn't be able to meet.

224
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:53,229
I wanted to keep seeing you,

225
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,660
and I still do.

226
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,400
You want to keep meeting me?

227
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,870
Yes, I do.

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,040
I'm not the person you think I am.

229
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,708
I'm not the daughter
of Changhwa Industrial either.

230
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,880
I know.
The cheeky nurse from the ER, right?

231
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,849
I'm the eldest daughter
of a penniless family,

232
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,050
and I dropped out of high school
and took the GED.

233
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:23,660
I was born out of wedlock.

234
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,219
My mom used to sing at nightclubs.

235
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,469
But what's the problem with that?

236
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:37,869
Thanks to our pasts,
we turned out to be...

237
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,010
strong and interesting people.

238
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,410
The truth is,

239
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:51,479
next month, I'm...

240
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:05,329
Hey!

241
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,270
Wait, lady!

242
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,979
That blouse looks very familiar.

243
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,620
Right, I know that face too.

244
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:31,659
But that person should be studying
in the library right now.

245
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,829
Myeong Hee,
please don't tell Dad about this...

246
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:56,380
Oh, dear.

247
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,150
Do you know Myeong Hee?

248
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:04,420
Yes.

249
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,400
(Reliable Communication and Finance)

250
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:20,909
It's my first time actually seeing
someone who goes to SNU.

251
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,779
May I hold your hand?

252
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,510
What are you doing?

253
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,180
Behave yourself.

254
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,949
Myeong Hee,
what's your relationship with Jin A?

255
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,020
We live together.

256
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,318
My dad owns some real estate.

257
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,419
It's just a boarding house.

258
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,490
Oh, a boarding house.

259
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,669
Jin A, do you have a pen?

260
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,440
Shall I give you my pencil case?

261
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,139
If it's okay with you,
can you write down your number?

262
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,319
I'll write it
with a permanent marker.

263
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:07,720
- What are you doing?
- What?

264
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,159
I just want to
talk about music with her someday,

265
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,990
since we're both music fanatics.

266
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,059
By the way,

267
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,329
how do you and Myeong Hee
know each other?

268
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,069
Well...

269
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,039
Myeong Hee and I...

270
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,940
Our bus is here. Get up.

271
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:51,359
Hello?

272
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,800
Oh, it's you, Hee Tae.

273
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,270
Soo Ryeon? You haven't met her?

274
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,869
I see.

275
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,079
So she said she had a date with me.

276
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,509
No. We do have a date.

277
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,780
All right. Have a great time.

278
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,558
Soo Chan. Are you going somewhere?

279
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,699
I'm going to order rice cakes
for the opening ceremony.

280
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,970
I'm running late.
I'll see you later.

281
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,309
- Have you been well?
- Hey, it's been a while.

282
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,510
Hold on.

283
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,385
Are you here to order
rice cakes for your wedding?

284
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,050
Our wedding? It's not like that.

285
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,979
What are you talking about?
It's for his opening ceremony.

286
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,079
Can you prepare them
by tomorrow morning?

287
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,950
Tomorrow morning?
We're a bit backlogged here.

288
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,858
I don't think we can.

289
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,519
Come on.

290
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,190
You should never miss a customer
who's having an opening ceremony.

291
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,430
I brought him here
so he'd become your regular.

292
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,770
Have them ready
by tomorrow morning, okay?

293
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,270
What are you going to order, anyway?

294
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,009
- First, some red-bean rice cakes.
- Red-bean rice cakes.

295
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,809
Hold on. These red beans
look a bit old.

296
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,279
Do you have any newer batches?

297
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,249
They were delivered this morning.
What are you talking about?

298
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,079
Also, rice cakes made with old beans
taste better.

299
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,579
Don't use these.

300
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,949
Use the ones
that you hid in the back.

301
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,558
They're all the same.

302
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,388
- Can we get a discount?
- Of course.

303
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:29,760
Soo Chan,
do you want to have them delivered?

304
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,430
What? Yes, that sounds good.

305
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,769
If I'd come here alone,
my guests would've had...

306
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,010
just one bite of rice cake each.

307
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,379
It's better to have too much.
It's a celebration.

308
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,219
Hold on.
Shouldn't you eat before work?

309
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,378
What do you want to eat?

310
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:53,249
Don't worry.
I'll eat at the hospital.

311
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,760
Come on.
Let me buy you something nice.

312
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,059
Are there any good places
around here?

313
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,059
(Watch repair)

314
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,339
You don't want ribs, do you?

315
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,819
- Let's go eat somewhere else.
- Should we do that?

316
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,990
What? Marriage?

317
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,859
It seems like
the parents are talking about it.

318
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:42,099
Hasn't Soo Ryeon told you?

319
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,569
But they only just met...

320
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,809
Hey.

321
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,408
You can't believe...

322
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,010
the mighty Lee Soo Ryeon
is getting married, can you?

323
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,680
I can't either.

324
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,489
I'm also worried
that they're rushing things a bit.

325
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,490
It doesn't feel right.

326
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,519
There also seem to be
rumors going around about the guy.

327
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,389
I wish Soo Ryeon would be
more careful.

328
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,530
What kind of rumors?

329
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,839
They're nothing serious,

330
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,669
but I would've preferred a guy
who grew up in a happy family.

331
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,609
I'm probably just being nosy.

332
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,078
Goodness. Like I said,
I'm just being nosy.

333
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,849
As long as they like each other,
who cares?

334
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,520
Don't you think the two of them
are quite similar?

335
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,889
A couple like that may quibble,
but they live happy lives.

336
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:44,858
Government-funded professors
must resign!

337
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:48,199
- Resign!
- Resign!

338
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,799
Yushin remnants must resign!

339
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,068
- Resign!
- Resign!

340
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:54,568
Government-funded professors
must resign!

341
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:57,909
- Resign!
- Resign!

342
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:01,050
My dear student democracy activists.

343
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,450
We should not be
onlookers or bystanders.

344
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,848
We should be
the leaders of the university...

345
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:13,088
and the democracy movement!

346
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:15,529
Government-funded professors
must resign!

347
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,358
- Resign!
- Resign!

348
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,729
Government-funded professors
must resign!

349
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,598
- Lee Soo Ryeon.
- Resign!

350
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,469
Government-funded professors
must resign!

351
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,598
- Lee Soo Ryeon.
- Resign!

352
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,739
Government-funded professors
must resign!

353
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,909
- Hey!
- Resign!

354
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,989
What's this?
What are you doing here?

355
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,520
What else? You and I have a date.

356
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,430
They have a date.

357
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,929
We'll talk later.

358
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,029
I don't have time
to deal with you right now.

359
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,199
Do you really have the right...

360
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,840
to criticize
government-funded professors?

361
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:58,068
What?

362
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,068
You want to reap the benefits...

363
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,270
while avoiding the responsibilities?

364
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:07,279
Do they know
that you're playing a hero...

365
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,809
using the son of the Head
of Anti-communist Investigation?

366
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,879
- What's he saying?
- I'm not sure.

367
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,619
Get lost while I'm still being nice.

368
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,159
Gosh, seriously...

369
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:30,069
Hey, Hee Tae.

370
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,839
What are you doing here?

371
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:36,510
So?

372
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Do you want to be humiliated
in front of everyone?

373
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,888
Government-funded professors
must resign!

374
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:54,689
- Resign!
- Resign!

375
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,898
Government-funded professors
must resign!

376
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,800
- Resign!
- Gosh!

377
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,300
- Oh, no.
- Gosh!

378
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,440
- Myeong Hee.
- Myeong Hee.

379
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:14,009
What happened?
You have a concussion?

380
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,878
I'm totally fine,

381
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,680
but this jerk still dragged me here.

382
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,219
She fell while fooling around
on the railing of the rooftop.

383
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,189
Hey, I only fell
because you grabbed me.

384
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,720
Be quiet, both of you.

385
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,599
So? Did you get a CT scan?

386
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,629
Yes. Everything seems fine,

387
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,629
except for some minor symptoms
of a concussion.

388
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,399
Myeong Hee,
please make sure I can leave soon.

389
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,039
The protest must be at its height
right now.

390
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,009
Gosh, do you still want to play
a hero?

391
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,509
Hey, no one will even notice
you're not there.

392
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,279
- What did you just say?
- Stop it.

393
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,809
Stop it, you two!

394
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,519
I'll go and ask if you can leave.

395
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,720
Wait here.

396
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,818
- Okay.
- You little...

397
00:25:57,819 --> 00:25:59,190
Will you...

398
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,359
- Don't fight, okay?
- Okay.

399
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,669
Come on. Seriously.

400
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,829
Behave, okay?

401
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,669
Gosh.

402
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,839
- Stop it. I said, stop it.
- Let go.

403
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,639
Gosh!

404
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,979
- This is so dusty.
- Did you just hit me?

405
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,549
What? No, I didn't.

406
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,619
Don't you think the two of them
are quite similar?

407
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,418
A couple like that may quibble,
but they live happy lives.

408
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,219
- You really need to stop.
- Whatever.

409
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,259
- Hey.
- What?

410
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,459
- My patience has a limit.
- What did you say?

411
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,930
(Emergency room)

412
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,409
Myeong Hee.

413
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,079
Well, so...

414
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,339
I wasn't going to wait for you.

415
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,479
I just had some business
at the hospital and the timing...

416
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,949
Where's Soo Ryeon?

417
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,849
I don't know. She went somewhere.

418
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,348
You're hungry, aren't you?

419
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:04,359
Let's go get something to eat first.

420
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,960
Then I'll sing you that song
I wrote like I promised.

421
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't want that.

422
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:20,099
What do you mean?

423
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,908
You're going to tell me
we should stop seeing each other.

424
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,010
I don't want that.

425
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,079
Did you know
that your fathers are discussing...

426
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,319
your marriage?

427
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,618
Both you and Soo Ryeon have
complicated problems to solve.

428
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,819
I don't want to make things
any worse for you guys.

429
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:41,059
Forget me and Soo Ryeon.
What about you?

430
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,398
Tell me how you feel,

431
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,399
and I'll make everything simple.

432
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:55,470
I'm going abroad to study.

433
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,540
What?

434
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,109
That's what I was trying
to tell you yesterday.

435
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:03,109
I'm leaving in a month.

436
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,619
I only went on that blind date
with you...

437
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:09,250
to earn my airfare.

438
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,300
When... When will you come back?

439
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:25,069
My plan is to move there...

440
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,940
permanently.

441
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,440
So let's not do anything
we'll regret later on.

442
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:33,079
Let's end this here...

443
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,040
so we can only remember
the good things.

444
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,190
Wait, Myeong Hee.

445
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,099
I'm glad to have met you.

446
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,369
I really mean it.

447
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,060
A month?

448
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:36,530
At this point,
even that's pretty optimistic.

449
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,728
Her recovery is slow.

450
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:41,370
I can't say for sure
how long she'll hold out.

451
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:43,630
Can't she...

452
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:46,800
still be transferred?

453
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,708
That's beside the point.

454
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:50,109
She's unconscious.

455
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,408
To her, it'll make no difference
whether she's in Seoul or Gwangju.

456
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:54,478
Don't you think it's selfish...

457
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,209
to make her take this risk?

458
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,310
Hey.

459
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,009
You seem to have many secrets
these days.

460
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,079
What was that earlier?

461
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,050
What's going on
between you and Soo Ryeon?

462
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,949
Why do you want to know that?
I barely know her.

463
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:37,360
It didn't seem that way though.

464
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,630
Do you like her?

465
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,500
Is it even allowed to develop
romantic feelings for a comrade?

466
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,900
Nonsense. Stop being absurd.

467
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,668
Can you play something else already?

468
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:52,468
You've been playing
the same thing over and over.

469
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:53,699
This is plain torture!

470
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,979
My gosh. What is it now?

471
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:02,650
Why doesn't anything ever go my way?

472
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,019
Hey, be honest now.
Is everything really okay?

473
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,969
Think about this.

474
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:24,738
Let's say you just met
the woman of your dreams,

475
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:27,408
but she's going away for good
in a month.

476
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:28,739
What would you do?

477
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:33,810
- Is Soo Ryeon going somewhere?
- I'm not talking about her!

478
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:39,979
The woman of my dreams
who's going away for good?

479
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,419
I'd give up immediately.

480
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,988
- Why?
- I'd rather live with regrets...

481
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:48,860
than miss her
for the rest of my life.

482
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:50,699
I hate heartaches.

483
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:53,928
Just continue to live the way
you always have.

484
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:57,269
Isn't it your philosophy of life
to live lightheartedly?

485
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:01,239
That's when it's only about my life.

486
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,769
It's totally different...

487
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,316
once another person's life
is involved.

488
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,780
Goodness. You've come a long way.

489
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:11,850
You care about another person now?

490
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,050
If you have a headache,

491
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,890
why not try the solution
from our high school days?

492
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,290
Here.

493
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,439
Goodness. You startled me.

494
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:36,370
You're home late.

495
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,409
Since when do you smoke?

496
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:40,479
Well, this is...

497
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:44,449
Go to bed early.
We have somewhere to be tomorrow.

498
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,880
Father. Your lighter.

499
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:50,550
Keep it.
Make sure you carry it at all times.

500
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,339
So, Father is going to bring
more clothes to the camp?

501
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,739
Yes, on the next market day.

502
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,810
Why don't you put on
the new shoes instead?

503
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:19,320
The shoelaces are a hassle.

504
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:22,619
They keep getting tangled
if I tie them.

505
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,189
You wear worn-out shoes
because shoelaces are a hassle?

506
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,200
Put these on instead.

507
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:35,899
Come on.

508
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,469
I don't want to. I don't!

509
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,708
Little bear.

510
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:43,438
It's all over. I messed up.

511
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:45,308
All the kids are annoying.

512
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:47,280
I got on the wrong side
of the coach.

513
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,660
When something is tangled,
just untangle it.

514
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,889
Untangle it carefully
and tie it nicely again.

515
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:08,970
If you leave it tangled,
it's your loss.

516
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:11,999
Whether it's your shoelaces
or training.

517
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:15,209
Isn't running fast
the most important thing to you?

518
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,820
Jung Tae,

519
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,070
are you angry you're not allowed
to stay at the camp?

520
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:37,558
You know how Father is.

521
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,659
He barely gave permission
about you missing school to train...

522
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,400
No, it's not like that.

523
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,800
I'll get going.

524
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,808
I'll come pick you up
before Father gets off work.

525
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:50,570
Don't come to the camp.

526
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:52,840
Meet me here instead.

527
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,590
Guys, don't run.

528
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,499
- Ju Bin, you're in Room One.
- Yes, coach.

529
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,499
Kyung Jae, Room One.

530
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:17,639
- Gun Woo, Room One.
- Yes, coach.

531
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:20,808
Digestive Drink, Room Four.
Work hard.

532
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:21,809
Yes, coach.

533
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:24,909
- Attention.
- Attention!

534
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,578
I can't hear you. Attention!

535
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:27,708
- Attention!
- Attention!

536
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,879
You have just three minutes.

537
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,118
Go to your rooms and unpack.

538
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,590
Change into training clothes
and get back here.

539
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,289
Ready.

540
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,759
Too slow. Hurry up!

541
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,860
Yes, coach!

542
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Jung Tae, are you in Room Four too?

543
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:04,780
Just my luck.

544
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:07,280
Move.

545
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,659
You have one minute left!

546
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,820
There will be a penalty
for the one who comes last.

547
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,169
Guys, hurry.

548
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:28,368
Hey, Digestive Drink!

549
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,208
What?

550
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,839
Take it off. It's mine.

551
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,938
We all have the same uniform.

552
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,379
Why must you be so fussy?

553
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,410
Hand it over.

554
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,349
Hey, let go!

555
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,749
- Hand it over.
- I said, let go!

556
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:45,288
- This is mine.
- Hey, let go!

557
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:48,859
- Stay focused.
- Stay focused.

558
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,659
- Stay focused.
- Stay focused.

559
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,829
- Stay focused.
- Stay focused.

560
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,208
Hey, I can barely hear you.

561
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:03,938
Do you want to do ten more laps?

562
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:07,780
Stay focused. Stay focused.

563
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:12,049
Stay focused. Stay focused.

564
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,050
If you leave it tangled,

565
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,618
it's your loss.

566
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:17,249
Stay focused.

567
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,759
- Stay focused.
- Stay focused.

568
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,288
Stay focused. Stay focused.

569
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:26,458
My gosh, Gyeongju Gas sent one too.

570
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:28,668
I know. There's limited space,

571
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:30,268
so it'd be better
to leave them here.

572
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:32,038
- Yes, let's do that.
- That's right.

573
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,709
- Perfect.
- Soo Chan. Everyone's here, right?

574
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:37,039
I'll get going then.

575
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:40,979
You brat! Where do you need to go?

576
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,748
You must stay until the end
as a member of the family!

577
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:46,019
Hey, Auntie is right.

578
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,590
What's going on?
Do you have another date?

579
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:51,388
What? You have a date?

580
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:52,888
Why didn't you tell us?

581
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:56,458
My gosh, Mr. Kim! You made it!

582
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,829
- Thank you for coming.
- Hello.

583
00:38:58,329 --> 00:38:59,800
Gosh, Mr. Hwang!

584
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,769
I'm sorry we're a little late.

585
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,439
Congratulations, Soo Chan.

586
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:12,509
Gosh, thank you.

587
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,110
Can you take this?

588
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,680
Aren't you guys going on a date?

589
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,650
I guess you came to see her
because you couldn't wait.

590
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:24,189
Right.

591
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:27,388
My goodness.

592
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:29,529
You keep showering me
with such precious gifts.

593
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,559
My gosh.

594
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,759
You gave my son permission
to marry your daughter,

595
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,260
your dearest treasure.

596
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,579
- Myeong Hee.
- Myeong Hee.

597
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:46,808
- What?
- My gosh.

598
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,529
I didn't know
there would be so many guests.

599
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,150
I had no idea.

600
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:58,919
My goodness,
you didn't have to bring anything.

601
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,499
Soo Chan.

602
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,829
- Show Mr. Hwang around.
- Right.

603
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,070
I'll be right back. Wait here, okay?

604
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,920
Mr. Hwang,
I'll give you a little tour.

605
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:15,570
This way, please.

606
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:21,909
Gosh, Soo Ryeon.

607
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,679
Your husband-to-be is here.
Why are you standing around?

608
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,279
Go make some coffee for him.

609
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,589
Auntie, don't call him like that.

610
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,189
I'll make coffee.

611
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,619
Take a seat.

612
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,660
Yes, take a seat.

613
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:37,260
Enjoy the food, everyone.

614
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,569
Yes, thank you for coming.

615
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,229
(Changhwa Pharmaceuticals
Aerial View)

616
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:48,469
You'll buy patented medicines
from other countries...

617
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,070
and manufacture them?

618
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,910
Will this be more profitable
than just importing them?

619
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,309
Yes, of course.

620
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:58,949
Being able to supply
such medicines on our own...

621
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,880
without having
to rely on importing them...

622
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,789
will help strengthen our country.

623
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,419
You have such an admirable son.

624
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,958
Gosh, he has grand plans...

625
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,260
but has a long way to go.

626
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,469
We underestimated
building a pharmaceutical factory.

627
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,829
It costs a fortune.

628
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:22,309
One of my in-laws is looking
for a good company to invest in.

629
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,609
Shall I introduce you to him?

630
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,680
Pardon me?

631
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,949
We'd be grateful,
but you don't have to.

632
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,450
This isn't some stranger's business.
We're a family now.

633
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,590
You're the brother
of my future daughter-in-law.

634
00:41:44,189 --> 00:41:45,999
Oh, make two cups of coffee for me.

635
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:48,300
- No sugar, please.
- Sure.

636
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:49,800
Hey.

637
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,769
Is that the guy?

638
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,410
Soo Chan's future brother-in-law.
The one born out of wedlock.

639
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,910
He wasn't just born out of wedlock.
His mother was a courtesan.

640
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:03,110
My gosh,
what is Soo Chan's family thinking?

641
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,578
I understand their daughter
is a troublemaker,

642
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,888
but how could they marry her off
to someone's illegitimate son?

643
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:10,119
Come on. I heard he's a med student.

644
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,590
And he's good-looking.

645
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:13,388
He'd better be.

646
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:15,030
His mother was a courtesan
after all.

647
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,260
Keep it down. He'll hear you.

648
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:21,530
I was born out of wedlock.

649
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,439
But what's the problem with that?

650
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:27,368
Thanks to our pasts,
we turned out to be...

651
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:29,470
strong and interesting people.

652
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:36,780
My goodness.

653
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,450
If you let this year go by,
it'll be too late.

654
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,949
There's a right time for everything.

655
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,558
You won't be
an eligible bachelorette forever.

656
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,958
Why would you put it off?

657
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:48,729
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

658
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:51,530
- Stop it.
- Miss, are you a bookkeeper?

659
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:53,630
No, I'm Soo Ryeon's friend.

660
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,768
My gosh.
You kept making coffee over there,

661
00:42:56,769 --> 00:42:58,499
so I thought you worked
at a coffee shop.

662
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,470
Don't get me wrong.
It's because you're pretty.

663
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,208
- Did you go to college together?
- Listen to me.

664
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,439
Do you have a boyfriend?

665
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,209
She's my guest.

666
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,590
Really?

667
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:18,389
Myeong Hee, let's go.
I'll take you home.

668
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,260
Come on.

669
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,970
Enjoy the coffee.

670
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,639
I'm off.

671
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,179
We should get going too, ma'am.

672
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,749
- Shall we?
- Oh, okay.

673
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,919
- See you.
- Okay, see you.

674
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:01,800
You should never force yourself
to do what you're not used to.

675
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,845
If I keep forcing myself like this,
I may actually fall ill.

676
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,169
Let's end this here.

677
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:08,939
What?

678
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,679
Hey, you're also...

679
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,680
I'll give you three days.

680
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,479
Whether you tell the truth
or another lie,

681
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,380
do what it takes
to deal with your family.

682
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:19,749
If we take this further,
we can't get out of it.

683
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:23,450
What if I say no?

684
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,419
Then I'll do whatever I want.

685
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,070
What? Med school?

686
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,679
Myeong Hee, I'm so impressed.

687
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,280
It's nothing impressive.

688
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,808
The med schools here only admit
those who will become doctors,

689
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:52,748
whereas everyone gets admitted
in Germany,

690
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:54,380
but few survive.

691
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,670
I have to do a good job
once I start school.

692
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,940
People who are overly modest
can be annoying, you see.

693
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,590
So when do you leave?

694
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,599
In a month. That's the plan now.

695
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:09,369
What? In a month?

696
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,939
It all depends on the situation,
so it might change,

697
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:16,329
but that's the plan for now.

698
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:19,078
That's too soon...

699
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:21,849
I mean, that's soon.

700
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:24,410
A month will fly by.

701
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:29,519
What? You have a gray hair.

702
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,919
What? I do?

703
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,789
Hold on. Let me pluck it.

704
00:45:44,669 --> 00:45:45,900
Let's go, shall we?

705
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,889
Myeong Hee...

706
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,459
Hold him down.

707
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,430
You idiots.

708
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,930
I told you to interrogate him,
not butcher him.

709
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,799
Who will take responsibility
if things go south...

710
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,999
in this day and age?

711
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:21,139
We're sorry, sir.

712
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,280
Sir, please spare me.

713
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,840
Don't kill me!

714
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,979
Sit up!

715
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:34,079
Please, sir...
I really didn't do anything wrong.

716
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:36,689
Hey.

717
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,589
I really didn't do anything wrong!

718
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,130
I did nothing wrong!

719
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,169
Dad.

720
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,699
Please believe me! I didn't...

721
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,039
- I'm sorry, sir. We'll quickly...
- Forget it.

722
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,110
Have someone tail him.

723
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,609
The student council executive?
We're already on it.

724
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,650
No.

725
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,820
My son.

726
00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:10,749
(Gwangju Pyeonghwa Hospital,
Emergency Room)

727
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:14,660
My goodness,
I'm in the main sector again.

728
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,530
It's already May.

729
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,669
Time really flies.

730
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,660
(I'll pass the exam this year
no matter what!)

731
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,030
Goodness.

732
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:00,638
Darn, a year has passed already...

733
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:02,840
but I can still smell
my brother's stink.

734
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,110
Dad!

735
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:08,308
- Dad!
- What?

736
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:11,109
- Dad.
- What is it? I'm busy.

737
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,248
Can you give me
some of those mothballs?

738
00:48:13,249 --> 00:48:14,819
I need to get rid of that
horrible stink.

739
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,388
I already put mothballs
in that room a long time ago.

740
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:18,958
- Seriously.
- Come on.

741
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:21,459
- I'm so busy. Goodness.
- Come on. Hurry.

742
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:27,829
Yes?

743
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,539
Yes, who is it?

744
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:42,479
Hee Tae?

745
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:45,079
How did you find where I live?

746
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:47,549
I mean, why are you here?

747
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,450
Oh, Myeong Hee. I...

748
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,760
Excuse me. Where is...

749
00:48:53,419 --> 00:48:54,618
Are you crazy?

750
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:57,030
What do you think you're doing?
There are people in there.

751
00:48:57,229 --> 00:49:00,200
I'm glad.
I wanted to say hi to them.

752
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,300
Wait, Hee Tae.

753
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,668
Do you not remember what I said?

754
00:49:04,669 --> 00:49:05,999
How can you...

755
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,839
Gosh, can you let go of me?

756
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,708
- Is he already here?
- Come on...

757
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:12,280
Oh, hello.

758
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,789
No!

759
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:28,760
Hee Tae!

760
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,760
Mr. Hwang!

761
00:49:32,229 --> 00:49:33,400
Oh, dear.

762
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:48,280
Have you lost your mind?
What did you do to our tutor?

763
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,449
What? Tutor?

764
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,050
Hee Tae is going to be my tutor
starting today.

765
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,050
Don't worry about it.

766
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:02,090
Wow, the taste is perfect.

767
00:50:30,919 --> 00:50:32,019
Wait.

768
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,389
This belongs to my brother,
but it's all out of tune.

769
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,160
Do you want to tune it for me?

770
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,829
Later.

771
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,740
There we go.

772
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:52,840
First of all,
let's take a look at this.

773
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:54,579
(Report Card, Lee Jin A)

774
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,749
Let's see.

775
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,779
Ethics, D, History, C,

776
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,249
Math, F.

777
00:51:04,249 --> 00:51:05,918
Jin A, what is your dream?

778
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:06,990
What?

779
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,659
My dream is to become
a radio producer.

780
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,929
I want to produce a music show
like "Forgotten Nights."

781
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,860
Oh, I see.

782
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:18,840
But Jin A, you know what?

783
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:24,639
I have to be good at math
to be a producer?

784
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,038
No.

785
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:31,880
You're already destined
to be good at math.

786
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:34,849
- I am?
- Yes.

787
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,989
Listen. Pythagoras,
who is known for his famous theorem,

788
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,759
was the first to create a scale.

789
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,388
And the father of music, Bach,

790
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,729
composed songs
based on mathematical calculations.

791
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:45,860
Do you know what that means?

792
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,998
It means that math is music.

793
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:51,569
And music is math.

794
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,938
But the thing is,
you are a music fanatic.

795
00:51:53,939 --> 00:51:57,168
You've unknowingly mastered
the nature of numbers already,

796
00:51:57,169 --> 00:51:59,809
and you're destined
to be good at math.

797
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,439
Like me.

798
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,450
So?

799
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,279
Are you prepared
to accept your destiny?

800
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,220
- Yes.
- Good.

801
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:10,689
- Get in there already.
- Why should I...

802
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:14,720
Go give Mr. Hwang some apples.

803
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,570
Oh, my. What is this?

804
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:28,139
An apple?

805
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,079
I was mistaken earlier.

806
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:37,779
Why didn't you tell me
you were her tutor?

807
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,479
Is this really an apple?

808
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,990
I'm sorry.

809
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:48,729
I've washed your shirt,
so don't worry.

810
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,090
It really is an apple.

811
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,930
Yes?

812
00:52:56,829 --> 00:52:58,469
I'm sorry to interrupt.

813
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,599
Mr. Hwang, can you stay for dinner
after today's lesson?

814
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,309
Oh, dinner?

815
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,680
I'd be happy to.

816
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:10,510
Here we go.

817
00:53:13,249 --> 00:53:15,820
Do you drink?

818
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,749
I was waiting to open this...

819
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,559
when my son gets discharged
from the army.

820
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:20,689
Wait.

821
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:25,860
Gosh, then you shouldn't open
such a precious thing.

822
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:27,659
I'll go out and get some makgeolli.

823
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,569
No need. Come on.

824
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,099
It's because you're like my son.

825
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,680
In that case,
I'll have just one glass, sir.

826
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:46,079
Do you even know
what that's made of?

827
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,450
This is really...

828
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,789
Medicine. It's medicine.

829
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,459
- Mr. Hwang.
- Yes, thank you.

830
00:53:59,499 --> 00:54:01,229
Let's clink glasses.

831
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:03,999
Cheers.

832
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,249
Do you know what I did for my wife?

833
00:54:19,749 --> 00:54:24,189
I left my home
and started living with my in-laws.

834
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:30,458
Can you stop talking about that?
This is the third time already.

835
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:34,159
This story doesn't get old
even if I tell it ten times.

836
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,828
You can't listen to it
without shedding tears.

837
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:40,169
Get your handkerchief ready.

838
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:47,240
You know, I used to be quite popular
in my old neighborhood.

839
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,279
But you know what? After...

840
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,879
- Hee Tae, you should go now.
- I came here...

841
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,389
If he gets more drunk,
you'll never get out of here.

842
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,688
- It's okay.
- Stop being stubborn.

843
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:00,919
- I'll be fine.
- Myeong Hee.

844
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,129
Can't you see I'm having
a talk with my son?

845
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,860
What are you whispering
to my new son?

846
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,569
He should get going now.

847
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,229
It's almost time for the curfew.

848
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:13,099
Curfew?

849
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:21,079
You can spend the night here.

850
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,709
- What?
- We'll spread out a blanket...

851
00:55:23,749 --> 00:55:25,180
in the living room...

852
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:27,748
- and sprawl out!
- But...

853
00:55:27,749 --> 00:55:29,748
- I'd love that.
- Really?

854
00:55:29,749 --> 00:55:32,888
My shirt isn't dry yet anyway.

855
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:34,719
- It isn't dry yet!
- Right!

856
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,530
It isn't dry yet!

857
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,328
- Son!
- Father!

858
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:43,268
- Let's have another drink.
- Give me another glass.

859
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:46,470
Sure thing. Here you go.

860
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,220
Are you drunk?

861
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,961
Why are you playing the guitar
in the middle of the night?

862
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:43,689
I'm not drunk.

863
00:57:45,249 --> 00:57:47,160
I'm just parched...

864
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:49,689
from all that soy sauce earlier.
That's all.

865
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:52,930
Well, then...

866
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:55,160
Should I get you some honey tea
or something?

867
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:56,900
Don't bother.

868
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,669
Suit yourself.

869
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:01,299
I don't need any honey tea, but...

870
00:58:11,249 --> 00:58:13,380
Can you sit with me for a moment?

871
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:45,979
I'm sorry.

872
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:49,919
For what?

873
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:57,430
I feel like I'm being selfish...

874
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,900
and causing you trouble
again and again.

875
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:08,139
You didn't cause too much trouble.

876
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,249
After what you told me,

877
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:22,320
I thought hard
about the remaining month.

878
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:27,188
And I realized,

879
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:29,030
it's not the month we have
that I'm afraid of,

880
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,900
but how much I'll be hurt
after that month is gone.

881
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:37,970
I like you, Myeong Hee,

882
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,970
and I'll only continue to like you
more and more.

883
00:59:44,169 --> 00:59:46,639
Goodness, you and your cheesy words.

884
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:07,300
I look forward to May every year.

885
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,800
On a May night,
even if you sing badly,

886
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:14,700
the grasshoppers help you out.

887
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:16,570
The grasshoppers?

888
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,570
Yes.

889
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,880
Let's see here.

890
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,740
(Madonna Fashion)

891
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,389
Whenever I think of you, Myeong Hee,

892
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:19,530
I can't help but sing.

893
01:02:24,169 --> 01:02:25,329
Goodness.

894
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,020
There you go again
with those cheesy words.

895
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,150
Myeong Hee.

896
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:43,799
Do you want to go out with me...

897
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,260
just until the end of May?

898
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:17,189
(Youth of May)

899
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:32,299
What's your relationship
with Ms. Jang Seok Chul?

900
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,970
We're offender and victim.

901
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:36,469
- Come along now.
- Leave right now!

902
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,609
Do you have time tomorrow?

903
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,438
- I have somewhere to be.
- I'll come with you.

904
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:41,538
- You don't even know where.
- It doesn't matter.

905
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:44,109
Keep an eye on your daughter.
She's not a kid anymore.

906
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,279
I won't go easy.

907
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,848
Have you been spying on me?

908
01:03:46,849 --> 01:03:49,848
Let's just say I'm interested
in my future daughter-in-law.

909
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:51,118
I have no interest
in getting married.

910
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,819
He's going to invest
in our business.

911
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,058
My father's factory will be finished
in a month.

912
01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:56,989
Let's keep this up until then.

913
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,999
We shouldn't cross the line
just to save ourselves for now.
