1
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,390
Get in the car!

2
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:46,709
(Episode 7, The Unbreakable Tie)

3
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,439
Hwang Jung Tae,
do you not want to eat?

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,769
Pardon?

5
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,680
It's not that.

6
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,248
Why? He's eating.

7
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:22,150
It's because he just woke up.

8
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,248
It's all because
he's never had to starve...

9
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:27,289
and gets a hot meal served to him
three times a day.

10
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,796
If we just give him water
and nothing to eat for a few days,

11
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,990
he'll never pick at his food again.

12
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,669
Mr. Hwang,
what brings you by so early?

13
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:43,400
Oh, I found a book
Jin A should read.

14
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,108
- Here.
- My gosh, this is precious.

15
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,138
("The Principles of Mathematics")

16
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:51,179
Can she read this though?

17
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,809
Yes, of course.

18
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:56,479
She's improving by the day.

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,120
- My gosh, thank you.
- No problem.

20
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,249
Oh, my.

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,759
Jin A has her midterm exam today,
so she'll come home early.

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,460
Why don't you eat with me
and wait for her?

23
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,829
Oh, then...

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,828
Then Myeong Hee should join us too.

25
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,199
- Myeong Hee?
- Yes.

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,869
She's not home at the moment.

27
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,440
I guess her overnight shift
isn't over yet.

28
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,810
- Overnight shift?
- Yes.

29
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,709
She didn't work last night.

30
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,209
She didn't come home last night,
so I assumed she was working.

31
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,819
She didn't come home?

32
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,880
No.

33
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,689
Maybe she came home
after the curfew began...

34
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,989
and left early this morning
before I woke up.

35
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,230
After the curfew began?

36
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,399
(Emergency Room)

37
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,138
How can we help you?
Are you a guardian?

38
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,609
No, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,279
Hey, In Young.
Can't you tidy up right away...

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,649
- Clean this up, will you?
- Yes, ma'am.

41
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,959
By the way,
I thought you were off today.

42
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,429
Don't get me started.
This is all Myeong Hee's fault.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,899
(Ethanol)

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,669
Oh, I got this. My goodness.

45
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:28,980
In Young, right?

46
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,040
- Do I know you?
- Well...

47
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,619
Is Ms. Kim Myeong Hee here today?

48
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:39,320
She didn't come in today
and didn't even call.

49
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,289
She's never even taken
a half-day off,

50
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,459
but she didn't even call.
I wonder what's going on.

51
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,030
What?

52
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,298
What do you mean Myeong Hee is gone?

53
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,230
She's not at home.
She missed work without calling in.

54
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,970
Did you hear from her at all?

55
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,839
No, I didn't.

56
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,540
Maybe something urgent came up
last night.

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,950
Then she would've called
the hospital.

58
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,850
Do you know where she could be?

59
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,549
Why are you asking me?

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,148
Now, you know more about her
than I do.

61
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:16,389
You've known her longer than I have.

62
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,160
You said she's your best friend.

63
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,229
Hello?

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,899
Hello?

65
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,579
Soo Chan.

66
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,180
Don't answer
Hwang Hee Tae's calls...

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,380
until things get sorted out.

68
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:45,519
But if I hang up on him like that...

69
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,550
Don't answer his calls.

70
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,170
Do you want to keep this job or not?

71
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,039
- Get your job done properly.
- I'm sorry, sir.

72
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,909
Goodness, what should I do with you?

73
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,440
Just do what your predecessors did.
You can't even do that?

74
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,050
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Excuse me.

75
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,750
I'd like to report a missing person.

76
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,180
Oh, no. Is your child missing?

77
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:20,518
How old?

78
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,389
No, it's an adult.
She's 26 years old.

79
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,329
What's your relationship with her?

80
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,029
I'm her boyfriend.

81
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,899
How long has she been missing?

82
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,839
It's been...

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,968
About 15 hours, I think.

84
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:41,209
15 hours?

85
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,779
So you saw her last night...

86
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,309
but haven't heard from her since.

87
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,348
That's right.

88
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,310
We parted ways
in front of her place last night,

89
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,019
but I can't reach her.

90
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,820
- Go on. Go.
- No, wait.

91
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,518
Why won't you listen to me?

92
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,059
Has it ever occurred to you
that she might be avoiding you?

93
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,360
She's not at home,
and she didn't go to work today.

94
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,999
What if she got into an accident
on the way to work...

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,629
Goodness. People don't go missing...

96
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,398
that easily, okay?

97
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,500
- Hey.
- Hello, sir.

98
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,768
And we can't say she's missing
if it's only been 15 hours.

99
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,139
It looks like she went somewhere.

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,549
Wait. She'd never go anywhere
without telling me.

101
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,478
Come on. How do you know?

102
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,820
How can you be so sure?

103
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,288
Well, for example...

104
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:28,689
Maybe she saw
her late grandparents...

105
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,458
in her dream
and went to visit their graves.

106
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,629
Or maybe she went to see her parents
because one of them collapsed.

107
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,430
Who knows?

108
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:35,899
Hello.

109
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,029
You need a haircut, punk.

110
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:42,969
First, check all the places
where she could be.

111
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,809
Wait another day...
No, come back in three days.

112
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,180
Then I'll open a case for you.

113
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,950
I'm already so busy.

114
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,950
Where she could be...

115
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,820
Oh, I need to go to Naju.

116
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,820
It's been a while since I went home.
All I did was call.

117
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,599
Go away! That hurts.

118
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,329
Hey, Digestive Drink!

119
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,099
Your big brother is here.

120
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,170
Big brother? I don't have a brother.

121
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,950
I think they unplugged the phone.

122
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,348
Why?

123
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,060
They do it from time to time
because of my grandma.

124
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,190
But...

125
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,700
is Myeong Hee in Naju now?

126
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,598
I wanted to call them and ask,

127
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,370
but you're saying
they unplugged the phone.

128
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,240
Do you know
when they'll plug it back in?

129
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:56,078
That will depend on
my grandma's condition.

130
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,539
It could be for half a day?
The whole day?

131
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,510
It's different each time.

132
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,490
Myeong Soo,
can you give me the address?

133
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,320
(190 Maeseong-ri, Sanpo-myeon,
Naju, South Jeolla Province)

134
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,729
Hold on.

135
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,130
Visiting her parents
when it's only been a few hours...

136
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,839
That's creepy.

137
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,839
Okay, I'll just check from afar
and see if she's there...

138
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,279
That's creepier.

139
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,189
I should pick up some gifts
on the way...

140
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,320
and properly introduce myself
to them...

141
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,088
That will creep them out even more.

142
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,089
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

143
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,329
Young man.

144
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,759
Listen, can you...

145
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,728
Can you call a doctor?

146
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:53,800
What?

147
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:58,099
My son is about to die right now.

148
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,070
I took him to a local hospital...

149
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,838
and they said I need to prepare
to say goodbye.

150
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,410
Oh, what's wrong with your son?

151
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,879
Oh, my.

152
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:10,320
Are you a doctor?

153
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,089
Oh, well, no...

154
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:15,719
I am...

155
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,030
Then why don't I call
an ambulance for you?

156
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,598
Why are you up already?

157
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,279
You should lie down
and get some more rest.

158
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,269
I'm sick of lying down.

159
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,640
It's just a cold.

160
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,008
Gosh, you must be fine now,
hearing you say that.

161
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,079
- Drink this.
- Okay.

162
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,449
Where's Mother?

163
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,159
She got up
in the middle of the night...

164
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,989
and stayed by your bedside...

165
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,290
She's not in the room.

166
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,128
She was here just a minute ago.

167
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,628
My goodness.

168
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,399
Gosh, I was busy brewing
your herbal tonic.

169
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,738
I'll go take a look around
the neighborhood...

170
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:05,098
so call the village foreman
and ask him to make an announcement.

171
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,310
Okay. Where's the phone?

172
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,680
I can't believe this.

173
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:12,180
Is anyone home?

174
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,708
- Hyun Chul.
- Gosh, Mother!

175
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,578
- Mother!
- Goodness.

176
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:18,848
Where have you been?

177
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:20,920
You scared me to death.

178
00:10:21,349 --> 00:10:22,660
Where is her son?

179
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,959
Oh, yes.

180
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,030
I'm her son.

181
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,329
Oh, she said you were my age.

182
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,110
Can you tell me
what's troubling you?

183
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,039
Sorry?

184
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,440
Oh, did she say her son was
about to die...

185
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,909
and drag you here?

186
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,539
The thing is, my mother loses
her memory from time to time.

187
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,878
Gosh, I'm sorry about this.

188
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,749
Oh, don't worry about it.

189
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,550
I'm glad you're okay.

190
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,150
Then...

191
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:56,488
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

192
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,789
Mother, let's go inside.

193
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,089
Oh, by the way...

194
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,059
Can you tell me which direction
this is?

195
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,759
- It's my first time here.
- Oh, sure.

196
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:08,179
(190 Maeseong-ri, Sanpo-myeon,
Naju, South Jeolla Province)

197
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,919
Sorry we don't have
many side dishes.

198
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,950
I should've fried some eggs.

199
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,689
I'm sorry you came
all the way here...

200
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,560
but couldn't meet Myeong Hee.

201
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,728
Seeing you're here on a weekday
instead of at work,

202
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:43,540
I guess you're a college student.

203
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:47,910
Well, yes... So...

204
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,608
I'm about to graduate
from college soon.

205
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:54,810
You're the same age as Myeong Hee
but haven't graduated yet?

206
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,619
You must've taken a few years off.

207
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,820
Actually, I didn't take time off...

208
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:06,358
It takes six years to graduate
from my department.

209
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,390
Six years?

210
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,200
Then does that mean...

211
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,070
you're a medical student?

212
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:16,140
Where? Chonnam National University?

213
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:17,800
Chosun University?

214
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,009
No. It's...

215
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,040
Don't tell me...

216
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,749
Seoul National University?

217
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,050
Yes.

218
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,020
Cut it out.

219
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,089
Mother, what are you smiling about?

220
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,729
So, do your parents know...

221
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,359
that you're seeing Myeong Hee?

222
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:49,400
Why are you asking that?
How silly of you.

223
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,868
Kids these days
aren't like us anymore.

224
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:53,409
Don't mind him and eat.

225
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,169
Sorry he keeps interrupting
your meal.

226
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,410
Go on.

227
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,609
- Go on and eat.
- Okay.

228
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,079
Stop talking to him
when he's eating.

229
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,118
Thank you so much for today.

230
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,150
I came so abruptly,
but you even cooked for me.

231
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,729
Gosh, I'm sorry I couldn't make you
a proper meal.

232
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,728
If you tell me in advance next time,

233
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,958
I'll show you how good a cook I am.

234
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,729
So come with Myeong Hee
next time, okay?

235
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,499
Okay. I look forward
to seeing you again.

236
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,810
Ma'am, I'll see you next time.

237
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,290
We should repair this darn door.

238
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,650
Take care!

239
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,070
She's not here either.
Where on earth is she?

240
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,709
No, it'll be okay.
Her mom told me not to worry.

241
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,940
She'll be fine. I'm sure she's fine.

242
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,849
Myeong Hee!

243
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,320
Where did you go
without even telling me?

244
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,729
Do you know how...

245
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,560
Do you know what I was thinking?

246
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,930
What brings you here?

247
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,019
Do you think I came all the way here
to have fun?

248
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,139
You weren't at home or at work...

249
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,620
so I thought
you might've come here...

250
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,348
I know it may creep you out. I know,

251
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,019
but put yourself in my shoes.

252
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
How could I remain calm...

253
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,619
How did you find out my address?

254
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,560
I asked Myeong Soo.

255
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:53,430
I know this may creep you out too.

256
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:54,890
I know, but...

257
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,270
Myeong Hee, what's wrong?

258
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,109
Is something wrong?

259
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,050
What's wrong, Myeong Hee?

260
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,840
You seem like a different person.

261
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,290
Myeong Hee.

262
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,839
Stay still, you brat.

263
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,030
Who are you people?

264
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,628
Why are you doing this to me?

265
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,229
Well, who do you think we are?

266
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,930
Why don't you make a guess?

267
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,300
Is this because of money?

268
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:12,439
If it is,
I'll give you everything I have.

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,570
Man, are you treating us
like some petty thieves?

270
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:18,540
We don't need your money.
Your body will do fine.

271
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,780
I wonder how much we'll get for you.

272
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:23,378
It's a waste to sell you off
to an island.

273
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,420
Hey. Who would buy her?

274
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,700
I did nothing wrong.

275
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,800
Gosh, what a surprise.

276
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
You caught on faster than I thought.

277
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,599
Let me go.

278
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,608
I did nothing wrong
to be dragged here like this.

279
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,640
Hey, you brat. Hey.

280
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,179
That's for us to decide.

281
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,978
How can a government organization
abduct a civilian like this...

282
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:59,749
without even telling me
what I did wrong?

283
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,119
Why do all of you
blabber on so annoyingly?

284
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,330
Shall I make you shut your mouth?

285
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,430
Go on and try it.

286
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,728
I'll tell the press...

287
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:18,170
and the Catholic Church
about what you did to me...

288
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,238
The parents of the couple
will thank the guests.

289
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,080
Please give them a big hand.

290
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,559
(End the martial law!)

291
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,630
(End the Martial Law!)

292
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,410
I heard you're preparing
to go study in Germany.

293
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,509
Why Germany, of all countries?

294
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:41,519
You see,
compared to other countries,

295
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
Germany's visa screening process is
a lot stricter.

296
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,589
There are communists
who try to defect to North Korea...

297
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,660
through East Germany.

298
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,529
That's why...

299
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,940
we must look closely into...

300
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,859
whether the applicants
have participated in any protests...

301
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,979
and what kind of ideology
they believe in.

302
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,009
Are you doing this...

303
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,880
because of Hee Tae?

304
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,689
Defeat the Yushin remnants!

305
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,329
- Defeat the Yushin remnants!
- Defeat the Yushin remnants!

306
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,058
End the martial law!

307
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,998
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

308
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,099
- We say no...
- We say no...

309
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,340
- to martial law!
- To martial law!

310
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,238
End the martial law!

311
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,268
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

312
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:35,370
Defeat...

313
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,640
Step down!

314
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,748
Why are they protesting
in broad daylight?

315
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:44,049
- We say no to martial law!
- We say no to martial law!

316
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,349
End the martial law!

317
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,488
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

318
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:50,419
Defeat the Yushin remnants!

319
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,089
- Defeat the Yushin remnants!
- Defeat the Yushin remnants!

320
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,329
- Myeong Hee.
- End the martial law!

321
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,429
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

322
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,599
- We say no...
- We say no...

323
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,830
- to martial law!
- To martial law!

324
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:07,039
Soo Chan. I don't mean to be rude,

325
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,370
but I need to ask you something.

326
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,580
I understand. Thanks.

327
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:29,059
I won't get a passport, will I?

328
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,370
Apparently, the process
has been put on hold.

329
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,170
It's almost done,

330
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
but they need
another institution's approval.

331
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,769
It's the Defense Security Command.

332
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,279
What?

333
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,920
It's Hee Tae's father.

334
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,370
Well... You see,

335
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,839
I'm sure they're just trying
to scare you.

336
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,068
Not even the Defense Security
can randomly stop...

337
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:15,369
an individual from studying abroad.

338
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,509
It's not like you violated
the National Security Act.

339
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,009
Myeong Hee,
don't worry and just wait.

340
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,249
I'll find a way somehow.

341
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,719
You'll be only wasting your time.

342
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,529
I'll be going now.

343
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,749
You should go back.

344
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,090
You're making me feel pressured
and uncomfortable.

345
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,690
- Myeong Hee, I just...
- Please just...

346
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,430
Please just go back.

347
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,580
Fine.

348
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,109
I'll be waiting for you in Gwangju.

349
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,549
Let's talk later.

350
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,420
See you at the terminal!

351
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:41,430
I'll be waiting, Myeong Hee!

352
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,068
I wondered why...

353
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,379
Myeong Hee was always stuck
in the hospital like a nun.

354
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,379
Who would've known
she was dating a doctor?

355
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,808
What a pleasant young man.

356
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:04,580
He even looks like a movie star.

357
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,390
- You're getting ahead of yourself.
- Goodness.

358
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,660
Gosh. You're one to talk.

359
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,959
Weren't you asking about his parents
when we just met him?

360
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:18,630
I wasn't getting ahead of myself.
I just...

361
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,170
Whatever.

362
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,769
Goodness, Myeong Hee!

363
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,080
Welcome home, sweetie.
It's been so long.

364
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:36,208
Did you see him on your way here?

365
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:38,319
He was waiting here for you
until a moment ago.

366
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,090
Oh, dear.
They must've missed each other.

367
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,819
Anyway, have you eaten?

368
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,700
Why are you so out of it?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

369
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:58,100
Myeong Hee, is everything okay?

370
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:01,340
What happened?

371
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,880
It doesn't matter why.
You can't leave the country anyway.

372
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,749
(Kim Hyun Chul)

373
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:15,690
(Daughter, Kim Myeong Hee)

374
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,789
(Convicted of violating
the National Security Act in 1954)

375
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,840
There's no way...

376
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,610
a commie's daughter will be allowed
to go to Germany.

377
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,979
No way.

378
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:41,748
My father can't...

379
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:43,680
Have you ever wondered...

380
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,849
why your father can't even open
his own shop...

381
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,319
and has to go from market to market
for decades?

382
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,920
When all the other protesters
were released,

383
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,759
your father made a confession.
Didn't you find that strange?

384
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,229
(Convicted of violating
the National Security Act in 1954)

385
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,799
Is that because...

386
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:10,809
Yes.

387
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:13,680
Your father...

388
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,809
is a commie.

389
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:17,979
That means...

390
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,289
Is it true
that I'm a commie's daughter?

391
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,459
I'm not sure...

392
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:34,568
what you've heard and from whom...

393
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,200
Father, you tell me.

394
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,539
Is that true or not?

395
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,850
Why did you never tell me?

396
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:55,390
I had no idea.

397
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:58,890
I've blamed myself for everything
all my life.

398
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,499
I've regretted everything
I've ever done.

399
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,999
You could've...

400
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,969
You could've told me
it wasn't my fault at least once.

401
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,039
- Myeong Hee.
- If only you'd told me...

402
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,039
If you'd only told me...

403
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,610
why I must live in silence once.

404
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:25,019
Then I wouldn't have gotten
my hopes up for nothing.

405
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,190
Why did you have to make a fool
out of me?

406
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,789
Why do I have to get shoved
into the ground without knowing why?

407
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,590
Answer me!

408
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,999
Answer me, Father!

409
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,768
You little...

410
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:53,478
You despicable little wench!

411
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:57,978
Were you sent by Hwang Ki Nam too?

412
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:01,018
- Go away!
- Mother, please calm down.

413
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,589
- Let go!
- Hurry up and unplug the phone.

414
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,659
Take Mother away.

415
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,389
- Mother, calm down.
- How dare you show up here?

416
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,058
- That's enough.
- Take me instead!

417
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:12,958
- Mother!
- Get lost!

418
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,100
Mother!

419
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,399
My goodness. My son is innocent.
Why are you taking him?

420
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,340
Sir, just a second, please.

421
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:25,610
Mother, they're just going to ask me
a few questions.

422
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,680
Like you said, I'm innocent.
You don't have to worry.

423
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,779
Honey, see you later.

424
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:34,589
See you.

425
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,519
- Be careful.
- Hyun Chul.

426
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,330
- My goodness.
- Wait.

427
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,620
Ki Nam.

428
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,748
You're Hwang Ki Nam, right?

429
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:10,319
It's been a while, Hyun Chul.

430
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,130
Goodness. Ki Nam.

431
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,430
My leg hurts so much.

432
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,569
I'm didn't do anything wrong.

433
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,499
You know that.

434
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,969
My father passed away.

435
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,068
My brother has been
out of reach for years...

436
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:34,209
Your father defected to North Korea
during the war.

437
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,109
Your communist partisan brother...

438
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,180
talks to you regularly.

439
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,249
That's what I heard.

440
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:46,620
- What?
- That's what you said.

441
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:49,559
You told me that yourself.

442
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,870
Hwang Ki Nam, you scumbag!

443
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:01,109
(Statement, Kim Hyun Chul)

444
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,809
Just admit it already.

445
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,880
If you end up with more injuries,

446
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,309
your mother will be so worried
that she'll fall ill again.

447
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,180
Your poor mother.

448
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,930
(Statement, Kim Hyun Chul)

449
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,110
Gosh, Mother...

450
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,779
That's all.

451
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:40,239
But that's how things were
back then.

452
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,080
So that was all...

453
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,120
Hwang Ki Nam's doing?

454
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,258
I was going to tell you
when you were leaving for Germany.

455
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:58,059
Who told you about it?

456
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,170
Don't tell me...

457
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,910
you can't study abroad
because of your father.

458
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,880
I should get going.

459
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,700
Myeong Hee!

460
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,019
I thought it would end
if I just stayed quiet.

461
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,690
I didn't want you...

462
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,190
to have to worry about such stigma.

463
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,700
I wanted to break it off
so you wouldn't be affected.

464
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,209
But it didn't stop with you.

465
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:37,799
Myeong Hee...

466
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:00,948
She still hasn't come home yet?

467
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:03,419
She must be working overtime.

468
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,619
I called the hospital,
and they said she wasn't there.

469
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
And I can't reach
her family in Naju.

470
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,358
She must be on a trip or something.
Myeong Hee isn't a kid.

471
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,529
Why is everyone making a fuss
looking for her?

472
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,439
Goodness gracious. Go on home, okay?

473
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,310
If you give me a chance,

474
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,280
I'll take responsibility
and sort everything out.

475
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,050
Then how long will the process take?

476
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:34,689
Several months?

477
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,989
I see. Then please call me
as soon as you find out...

478
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,659
about the part
I asked about earlier.

479
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,668
Soo Chan. What's going on here?

480
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:49,829
Soo Ryeon.
I'm a little busy right now.

481
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,869
Let's talk at home.

482
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:54,270
What's this?

483
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,580
Passport... Visa...

484
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,679
Is this about Myeong Hee?

485
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:04,119
What is it?

486
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,250
Soo Chan.

487
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,790
The Defense Security blocked
her passport and visa applications.

488
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,030
What?

489
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,590
It's all my fault.

490
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,500
You don't have to worry about it,
so just go home.

491
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:31,409
Hey.

492
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,580
I have something to tell you.

493
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,050
It's about Myeong Hee
and Hwang Hee Tae.

494
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,188
I don't know how you found out
they're seeing each other, but...

495
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,760
I lied...

496
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
from the beginning.

497
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,899
Are you saying...

498
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,639
it was all a lie,
even the blind date?

499
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,119
Then when Mr. Hwang asked,

500
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:14,619
why did you tell him
you didn't know anything?

501
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,089
I was scared.

502
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,469
I didn't know things would get
this out of hand.

503
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,170
Lee Soo Ryeon.

504
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,100
Do you realize...

505
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,468
what you have done?

506
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,139
Soo Chan, I was just scared...

507
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:43,278
that something bad would happen
to our family because of me...

508
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:45,750
Look what happened
because of your immature behavior!

509
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:56,329
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

510
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,658
Expedite the political process!

511
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:02,028
- Expedite the political process!
- Expedite the political process!

512
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:04,099
Guarantee workers' rights!

513
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,916
- Go home, you punks.
- Guarantee workers' rights!

514
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,310
- I'm sorry.
- Go home.

515
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,169
Yushin remnants, step down!

516
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,609
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

517
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,008
End the martial law!

518
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:19,350
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

519
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,219
Myeong Hee.

520
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:01,460
Myeong Hee!

521
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:06,499
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

522
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,500
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

523
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,339
Myeong Hee!

524
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,479
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

525
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,818
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

526
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:29,419
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

527
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,658
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

528
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,588
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

529
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,909
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

530
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:40,968
Myeong Hee,
can we talk for a second?

531
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:44,138
- Yushin remnants, step down!
- Yushin remnants, step down!

532
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,198
Myeong Hee!

533
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,609
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

534
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,509
- End the martial law!
- End the martial law!

535
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,460
What are you doing?

536
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,989
You saw me. Why did you run away?

537
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,839
You were following me, that's why.

538
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,339
Tell me what happened.

539
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,278
If I've suddenly become someone
you have to avoid overnight,

540
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:26,940
there must be a reason.

541
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:30,210
Must I tell you the reason?

542
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,250
Yes, I need to hear it.

543
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:35,389
I kept racking my brain,

544
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:36,888
but I can't figure out...

545
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:38,529
why you're suddenly treating me
like this.

546
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,759
I don't want to be by your side.

547
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:44,400
I hate it.

548
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:47,258
I don't want to be called a minx
who stole someone's fiance,

549
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:48,939
and I don't want to hurt those
around me...

550
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:52,040
I can't do this anymore.

551
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,220
Did something happen
between you and Soo Ryeon?

552
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,949
Or is it because of Soo Chan?

553
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,150
I just...

554
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:07,819
I just don't want to
do this anymore.

555
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,089
There, you heard it.
Are we good now?

556
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:16,730
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that?

557
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:19,060
You said you wouldn't regret it.

558
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:22,929
You said we should tell each other
everything.

559
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,100
You said that yourself yesterday.

560
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:28,869
Then you suddenly disappeared
and had me worried sick.

561
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,880
What is going on?
What are you trying to hide?

562
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,880
Go ask your father.

563
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
My father?

564
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,750
I can no longer study abroad...

565
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,420
because I dated you.

566
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:43,819
Why am I running away?

567
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,360
It's because I'm scared.

568
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:48,889
I don't know what could happen
if I stayed with you.

569
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,100
My life could get a lot worse
than it already is.

570
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:55,259
I ran away from you
because I was scared.

571
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,509
Hee Tae, I am...

572
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,040
scared of you now.

573
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,880
Father, you're home.

574
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,060
You didn't have to do that,
you know.

575
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,130
I heard you met that girl.

576
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,629
It was just a fling.

577
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,699
You didn't have to waste your time
like that.

578
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:37,269
You told me...

579
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,940
that men should date a lot
before settling down.

580
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,279
What's your point?

581
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,178
I just wanted to have some fun
before she left the country.

582
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,509
But now that she knows
you disapprove of her,

583
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,349
she thinks this is like
the love story of the century...

584
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,448
as if she's in
some kind of tragic love story.

585
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:55,719
My goodness.

586
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,159
I'm worried
she'd cling to me forever.

587
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,259
Just let her leave the country,
Father.

588
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,600
I never thought I'd see you...

589
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,909
pull such a dumb trick on me,
Hee Tae.

590
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,239
Seeing how desperate you are...

591
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,080
makes me think I should uproot
the foreseeable problem for good.

592
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,779
Wait.

593
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:29,119
Please let her leave.

594
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,290
Wouldn't you be relieved
if she left the country?

595
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,230
There are many things I could do
to be relieved.

596
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:41,329
I... I insisted that
we keep seeing each other.

597
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,830
She kept saying no,
but I made her...

598
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,199
She just...

599
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:48,209
Her only fault is
that she got involved with me.

600
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,270
You really don't need to do this!

601
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,409
I'll get married.

602
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,750
I'll get married right away
if that's what you want.

603
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,130
Of course,
you'll get married as planned.

604
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,730
Did you think you could use it
to strike a deal with me?

605
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,150
Hee Tae.

606
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,619
This is why
you shouldn't kneel down often.

607
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,860
Okay?

608
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,290
It'll look too cheap...

609
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,330
when you actually need to do it.

610
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:51,199
I told you.

611
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,869
The only thing you can block...

612
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,540
is this hand, nothing more.

613
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,179
And you're in the palm of my hand.

614
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:09,089
It's too early to get scared.

615
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,119
I haven't even begun yet.

616
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,000
What is it that you want?

617
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,969
I'll do anything you want.

618
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,500
I'll behave myself...

619
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,339
and live my life the way you want.

620
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,810
I'll do anything you say,
so please...

621
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:36,409
Please let her...

622
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,880
Please just let her live her life.

623
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,330
Get ready to go to Seoul at once.

624
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,600
And...

625
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:56,369
don't come back until I tell you to.

626
00:43:57,699 --> 00:43:59,339
As for that girl...

627
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,610
I'll decide what to do depending
on how you behave yourself.

628
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,389
What do you mean?

629
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,400
You want to send them to Seoul?

630
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:29,699
They should get a place to live
near the hospital in Seoul anyway.

631
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,069
Let's have them move there
and get a place first.

632
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,569
The wedding can happen
as soon as we decide on the date.

633
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,679
You talked big that
you'd get everything sorted out.

634
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:41,310
But were you actually planning
to just push forward with it?

635
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:47,679
Well, the woman problem
has been taken care of.

636
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,588
You don't need to worry anymore.

637
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:52,659
How do I believe you
that it's been taken care of?

638
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,929
Their marriage...

639
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,130
isn't a business merger.
You can't force it.

640
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,528
Let's take some time
and see how the situation unfolds...

641
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:04,569
Are you hoping...

642
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:08,969
the wedding will be called off?

643
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,979
We should put the broken pieces
back together...

644
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,779
for both families' sakes.

645
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,610
Those broken pieces...

646
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:20,380
could become weapons.

647
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,089
Is this...

648
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,759
a threat?

649
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,520
No, I'm offering you
a word of advice...

650
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,330
to help you make a wise decision.

651
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,580
Seoul?

652
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,179
So?

653
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,080
I said, no way.

654
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,479
Gosh, I must've been out of my mind.

655
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,290
I practically walked
into the tiger's den to keep warm.

656
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:58,289
I'm grateful to the girl
he cheated on you with.

657
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,718
At least we had that
to protect us...

658
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:01,460
from being eaten up.

659
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,069
Don't give him iced water.

660
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:15,810
Hey, it's just one glass.
Don't make such a fuss.

661
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,110
Father.

662
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,440
There's something I must tell you.

663
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,509
What is it? Is it about work?

664
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,860
It's something you should know.

665
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:38,330
Are you saying...

666
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,460
you planned the whole thing
from the get-go?

667
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:43,829
Why, you...

668
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,540
Lee Soo Ryeon! You little...

669
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:46,670
Father, no!

670
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,739
Father, please.

671
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,949
Forget it.

672
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:00,519
Talking about who's at fault...

673
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,350
will only upset me more.

674
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:04,960
It may be a blessing in disguise.

675
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,230
The situation has worked out
in our favor.

676
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,429
Father.

677
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,500
We should tell them the truth.

678
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,199
What do you mean?

679
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,130
Are you saying we should tell
Hwang Ki Nam about this?

680
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,499
I told you.

681
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,639
If we don't do anything,

682
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,110
Myeong Hee will be made
the scapegoat.

683
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,540
Listen, Soo Chan. Myeong Hee...

684
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,408
I know it's unfortunate.

685
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:30,849
But we must save our family first...

686
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,879
and compensate her somehow later.

687
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,189
That's what Soo Ryeon was thinking
when she started this.

688
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,649
This all happened
in order to save our family...

689
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,319
so we must make things right.

690
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,959
No, we can never do that.

691
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,690
If we suddenly reveal that,

692
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:44,388
it's practically throwing our family
at Hwang Ki Nam as prey.

693
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:47,729
So do you mean you want to
throw Myeong Hee instead...

694
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,129
and put an end to this?

695
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,629
What's wrong with that?

696
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,968
To be frank, she's not even family.

697
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:54,400
Father!

698
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,119
I'm sorry.

699
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,949
I'm afraid
I can't obey you this time.

700
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:10,889
What?

701
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:13,259
Hey, Lee Soo Chan! You...

702
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:18,460
Father!

703
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,799
- Father.
- Father!

704
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,698
Open your eyes.

705
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,429
- Father!
- Father!

706
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,039
He was lucky this time.

707
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,778
Like I've always told you,

708
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:34,810
stress is the most deadly disease
for patients with angina.

709
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,879
He may suffer a cardiac infarction,

710
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,049
so you must make sure
he gets absolute rest.

711
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,560
How long has Father been like that?

712
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:49,529
Why didn't you tell me?

713
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:55,500
If I did,
would it have made a difference?

714
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:02,469
Don't tell...

715
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,210
Hwang Ki Nam.

716
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,309
Lee Soo Ryeon.
How could you still...

717
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:11,619
I will...

718
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,219
I will go to Seoul.

719
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:19,989
Since I started all of this,

720
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:22,659
I'll take responsibility.

721
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,630
Both Myeong Hee and Father...

722
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:28,929
did nothing wrong.

723
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Yes, you made the right choice.

724
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:46,548
My son has a house in Seoul,

725
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:49,319
so they can stay there
until they find a new home.

726
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:51,249
Yes.

727
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,159
Then I'll make the preparations
for them to leave immediately.

728
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,529
Yes, okay.

729
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,380
"It's nothing?"

730
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,988
So I canceled my plans
on my day off and covered for you...

731
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:57,350
over nothing?

732
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,119
Hey, Kim Myeong Hee.

733
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,070
Are you acting up
since you'll be quitting soon?

734
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,460
No.

735
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,130
Why do you even come to work?

736
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:09,199
It seems like your heart
is already in Germany.

737
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,139
If you're going to skip work,
just stop coming at all.

738
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,500
I'm sorry.

739
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:28,549
Are you sure
nothing happened yesterday?

740
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:33,419
I'm sorry.
You must've had a tough time.

741
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,589
It's okay.

742
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,900
By the way,
did you talk to Mr. Hwang Hee Tae?

743
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,699
He came to the hospital yesterday
looking for you.

744
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:48,239
I think I said something
that must've worried him.

745
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,509
He seemed awfully concerned.

746
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:57,778
(Hee Tae's Song Writing Notebook)

747
00:51:57,779 --> 00:51:59,549
It's a Teacher's Day present.

748
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:02,049
Write a song that will win
the University Song Festival.

749
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:07,960
I have a present for you too.

750
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,560
You do?

751
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:16,468
Here you go.
This is for the upcoming finals.

752
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:19,969
And these are for next year.

753
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,909
And...

754
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:25,979
This is a math concept notebook
that I organized myself.

755
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,820
It'll be more useful
than your reference books.

756
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:33,520
Why are you giving me a book
for next year already?

757
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:36,489
You can just give it to me
next year.

758
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:39,460
I can't give it to you next year.

759
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:43,230
Today is our last lesson.

760
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,880
You can just listen from there.

761
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,889
I just came to say goodbye.

762
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,989
I'm going to Seoul tomorrow.

763
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,960
I probably...

764
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,670
won't ever be coming back.

765
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:28,909
Okay.

766
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:35,150
I wanted to thank you before I left.

767
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:43,819
The few weeks we spent together...

768
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,319
were the happiest moments...

769
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:52,029
in my entire life.

770
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:57,429
Thank you.

771
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,389
Can I come closer for a moment?

772
00:54:58,159 --> 00:54:59,529
I'm sorry.

773
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:02,770
I tried my best to be careful,

774
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,400
but I broke it.

775
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,110
That's how I am.

776
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,779
Anything that comes close to me...

777
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:18,719
keeps getting broken.

778
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,589
I hope you continue...

779
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:30,730
to bravely go down the path...

780
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,360
that you wanted to take.

781
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,369
You are...

782
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,710
a strong person
that no one can break.

783
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:52,619
You too.

784
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,819
I hope you stay strong...

785
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,089
and live bravely.

786
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:20,679
Look back.

787
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,279
Look back.

788
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,650
Look back.

789
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:31,960
Look back.

790
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,190
Look back.

791
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,299
Look back...

792
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,509
You'll ruin everything.

793
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,940
Just like your father
ruined your life,

794
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:29,909
you'll end up ruining...

795
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:32,920
Hee Tae's life
if you stay next to him.

796
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:35,619
He's your son.

797
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,690
If you're curious,

798
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,029
stay right next to him and watch...

799
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:45,759
how far...

800
00:57:46,759 --> 00:57:48,830
I can go.

801
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,170
Please...

802
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:56,710
leave Hee Tae alone.

803
00:58:00,779 --> 00:58:02,210
I'll break up with him.

804
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,360
(Youth of May)
