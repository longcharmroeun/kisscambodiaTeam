1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:15,330
Hey, wait! Let's talk it out. We can talk this out!

2
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:21,430
That's enough. You might kill him.

3
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:26,910
- Can I just kill him? - That hurts.

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,110
I think you're the one who'll die.

5
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,290
Please let me live. Please!

6
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,290
I'll... I'll give you money.

7
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,190
- Stay still! - Please spare my life.

8
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:51,630
- I can't aim right. - Please let me go.

9
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,460
Who are you?

10
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:55,790
You promised you'll give us an apartment unit.

11
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:59,060
- What? - I set the place on fire...

12
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,930
and killed people.

13
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,100
Give me the apartment.

14
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:09,370
The apartment.

15
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,630
- Give me my apartment. - What the heck is this nonsense?

16
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:33,470
Give me my apartment!

17
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:11,270
What are you doing? Go tend to the chairman now!

18
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,410
Get up.

19
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:24,220
(Episode 7)

20
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:28,050
What's going on?

21
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,590
Stop overreacting.

22
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:35,030
You didn't break anything. You only pulled a ligament.

23
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,600
Hey.

24
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:41,330
- What happened? - The spirit on Do Hak Sung...

25
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:44,670
suddenly possessed your body, then you began to attack him.

26
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,840
Thanks to you, the whole thing ended.

27
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:50,640
I see. So some evil spirits end up possessing people.

28
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,380
Figures. I'd be surprised if he had no unrested spirits on him...

29
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:57,580
after all that he has done.

30
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,990
You promised you'll give us an apartment unit.

31
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,790
- What? - I set the place on fire...

32
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,090
and killed people.

33
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:07,090
- Give me the apartment. - The apartment.

34
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:10,360
Anyway, how did you end up getting caught by them?

35
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:14,730
Man, only if they didn't attack me from behind, I could've...

36

(King-sized Mandu)

37
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,710
If you're about to take out your knife, don't.

38
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,480
You're the one who'll be hurt by the knife.

39
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,790
My story is similar to yours.

40
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:20,330
I thought you were invincible, but you're rather sloppy.

41
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,730
Wait, come to think about it,

42
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,470
I already saved your life twice.

43
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:29,670
Man, I don't think saying thank you is going to cover this.

44
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,580
Don't you think you owe me a nice suit?

45
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,180
You need to quit working as a psychic.

46
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:40,790
You're firing me to save on that suit?

47
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,090
It doesn't cost that much.

48
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,460
You need to quit before you get hurt from lurking around me.

49
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,420
Our contract will expire soon anyway.

50
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm not going to sell my place until I help my mom leave.

51
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,830
And something like this is bound to happen again.

52
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:57,470
Then...

53
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,540
why are you unable to send your mother away?

54
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:05,880
I remember you saying it's difficult because her spirit is special.

55
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:09,510
It's always difficult to send away an exorcist's spirit.

56
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:13,920
Until now, I just thought I needed to find a powerful psychic.

57
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:17,660
But I really have no idea now.

58
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:21,060
What was she like?

59
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:23,900
I mean your mother, Ms. Hong.

60
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:27,600
She was pleasant,

61
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,040
cool, and nice.

62
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:37,010
That's why she died. She was too nice.

63
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,050
She passed away because she was too nice?

64
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,250
What do you mean?

65
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:46,620
- Her last client was... - Help me.

66
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:50,150
an arsonist who murdered seven people.

67
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:59,460
She passed away helping someone who doesn't deserve to be helped.

68
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:08,210
I'll never forgive them.

69
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:22,520
Maybe what Kim Tae Jin said is true.

70
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,660
That he always saw ghosts near Daebak Realty.

71
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,090
What has gotten into you?

72
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,690
I'm sorry, but...

73
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,500
Silence! Go and get me...

74
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,070
all the information you can find on everyone at Daebak Realty!

75
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,670
- Don't leave anyone out! - Yes, sir.

76
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,610
I could've come home alone.

77
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,950
Get some rest. I'm leaving.

78
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:53,280
Ms. Joo.

79
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:56,420
I'd like to meet Mr. Jung.

80
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,360
Why do you suddenly want to see him?

81
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,830
I need to know what exactly happened to my mother...

82
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:05,100
and if I'm missing anything.

83
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:09,370
I thought Mr. Jung would know.

84
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:12,470
Okay, I'll give him a call. We can go see him.

85
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:15,370
No, I'll meet him alone.

86
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,340
Goodbye.

(Criminal Record, Hong Ji A)

88
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:27,190
So she's the CEO.

89
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,620
She may not have gone to jail,

90
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,390
but she has seven previous convictions.

91
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,730
Attempted fraud...

92
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,760
and blackmail.

93
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,360
Birds of a feather flock together.

94
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,430
They're a scamming duo.

95
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,340
Who is this lovely woman?

96
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,440
You startled me.

97
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:49,570
It's nothing.

98
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,110
Don't lie.

99
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,910
You're obviously abusing your power...

100
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,080
and doing a background check on someone you're interested in.

101
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,620
Cut that nonsense.

102
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,120
That's ridiculous.

103
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,250
I'll get back to work.

104
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,020
Why did you kill them?

105
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,790
I didn't want them to become burdens.

106
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,860
Isn't it obvious?

107
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:14,870
Ji A will visit you.

108
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,340
Please don't let her look into the case...

109
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:20,770
from 20 years ago.

110
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,740
Okay.

111
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,910
That woman didn't hesitate...

112
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,480
to kill her own kids...

113
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:33,520
out of selfishness.

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

115
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,960
It's been a long time.

116
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,470
I barely recognized you.

117
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,270
I know.

118
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:53,300
I'd like to read the case file from 20 years ago...

119
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,640
as well as the photos.

120
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:59,210
You're still just as direct.

121
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,050
But since your mother wasn't a victim...

122
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:05,950
and rather died of a cardiac arrest,

123
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:09,650
her file has been discarded.

124
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,720
But why are you looking for something...

125
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:13,760
that happened 20 years ago?

126
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:17,400
I recently remembered something new from that night.

127
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,000
You arrived at the scene first, didn't you?

128
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,170
I did.

129
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,670
Could you tell me everything you remember?

130
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:31,780
Let's see. It's been quite a long time.

131
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,320
Nothing really stood out.

132
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:45,320
I just saw 2 adults and 2 kids lying unconsciously.

133
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:50,900
It looked like any other realty.

134
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,810
I'm sorry I couldn't be of much help.

135
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,750
A realty that specializes in haunted houses?

136
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,880
That's correct.

137
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:15,350
Also, Oh In Bum and Heo Ji Chul are frauds...

138
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:17,290
who fabricate hauntings.

139
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,160
They fabricate hauntings?

140
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,130
I knew it.

141
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,400
How dare those brazen scumbags mess with me?

142
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,900
Sir, it turns out that Oh In Bum is...

143
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,970
Oh Sung Sik's nephew.

144
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,600
The arsonist of Yongnam Village from 20 years ago.

"Oh Sung Sik"?

146
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,550
And the last place he went...

147
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,550
before his death was...

00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,880
What?

150
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,560
I truly thought no one was there.

151
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,420
I'm telling you the truth! It's the truth!

152
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:56,430
That spirit possessed my nephew!

153
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,330
I'm serious!

155
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:05,640

Please call the police.

157
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,480
I said, please call the police!

158

I don't need any money...

159
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,650
or the apartment.

160
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:20,420
Are you finally awake?

161
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,290
Sir.

162
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:27,190
You're hell-bent on letting everyone know,

163
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,030
aren't you?

164
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:31,860
You even asked for the police.

165
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,660
Why? To report me?

166
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,070
No, sir.

167
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:38,070
I will never tell them that you had ordered it.

168
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm going to tell them that I did it...

169
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,470
and receive my punishment.

170
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:44,140
Did someone persuade you to do this?

171
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:45,540
Did they say I'd give you more money...

172
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,410
if you threatened me like this?

173
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,710

Not at all.

00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,380
- No? - I didn't tell a soul.

176
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:54,620
Please believe me!

177
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:57,690
I just can't burden the guilt.

178

I've taken many lives.

179
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:08,270
My goodness. I'm so softhearted.

180
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,040
Write that down.

(The fire at Yongnam Village on November 15 was my doing.)

182
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:21,080
That's a written statement claiming that you did it.

183
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,680
I should have a reason to believe you.

Really?

186
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,560
Okay. I'll do it right now.

You promised you'll give us an apartment unit.

and killed people.

about that?

Perhaps, he found the memorandum...

that we had failed to find.

was an arsonist...

Ms. Hong...

would be in a pickle without her special psychic.

but keep your mouth shut and leave once your contract ends.

Seeing how you didn't tell Ms. Hong about me even when you knew,

250
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:35,960
must mean you must also have an ulterior motive.

Hello.

00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:31,420
Is this the real estate agency that sells haunted houses?

254
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,620
Well, the house belongs to my mother.

255
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,420
We want to sell the house because people say it's haunted.

256
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,830
- Did you see the spirit yourself? - No. We don't live there.

257
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:45,900
Our tenants told us that their son was possessed by a spirit.

258
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,500
Gosh. There's no such thing.

259
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:51,340
He was sick, to begin with.

260
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:57,440
All right. Let's go inside and look at our new house.

What are you doing in the dark?

264

Anyway, because of the rumor that our house is haunted,

265
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:20,550
no one even came to see the house when we tried to sell it.

266
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:23,290
And other real estate agents told us to lower the price by half.

267

You guys will help us sell the house at market price, right?

Yes. She will.

The house belongs to her.

274
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,510
I must ask the homeowner if she wants to sell or not.

275
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:44,380
Why did you say it like that?

276
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,650
Then, are you insinuating that we're trying to take her house?

277
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,610
Mom, why won't you tell her?

278
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,920
Just say that you will sell it.

I...

280
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:01,690
Because you won't speak up,

281
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:03,760
she thinks we're taking advantage of you.

282
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:07,660
I'll sell it. I will.

283
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,800
Gosh.

284

she'll kick me out.

Unbelievable. Isn't she being so selfish?

296

She hasn't done anything for Mom as her daughter-in-law.

297

00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:59,320
Then, is the boy who was possessed by the spirit...

301
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:00,850
a psychic like me?

302
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:05,090
We'll know once we get there, but it's highly likely.

303
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,990
The spirit could have been there before they moved in,

304
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:09,090
but it had been quiet because its energy was weak.

305
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:12,700
But after the boy moved in, it must have made its move.

306
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,530
Hey. The house is haunted, right?

307
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,900

That's why we moved here. Gosh.

312

Consider it a shield that protects your character in games.

So don't take off this necklace no matter what. Okay?

Gosh. What was that?

323
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:07,370
You must have nothing to fear for. How could you take off the necklace?

324
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,170
Out of all things, how could you do something like that?

325
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:10,610
You know that there's an unrested spirit in the house.

326
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:12,480
What if you get possessed?

327
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,780
You said that the spirit had weak energy.

328
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:18,380
Besides, you're right here with me. I'm sure you would help me.

329
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,280
What?

330
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,990

He'd have kept getting possessed without knowing why.

332
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:27,420
How could I turn a blind eye on him?

333
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:31,160
Not everyone born with the ability becomes a psychic.

334
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:34,100
Usually, when boys like him have girlfriends or date girls,

335
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,500
they'd be fine because his energy gets mixed with yin energy.

336
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,540
"Usually"?

337
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,770
What do you mean by that?

338
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:46,240
What... What do you mean?

339
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,210
Can you elaborate? What do you mean?

340
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:54,220
- Tell me. - Shut your mouth and get in.

341
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:56,390
Come on.

342
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:00,760
This is a very old house.

343
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,730
At first, Yoo Young Soon's family lived in the house.

344
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:06,830
But starting 50 years ago, they left the house vacant...

345
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:10,330
or rented it out, so they kept getting new tenants.

346
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:12,600
I have put together...

347
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,340
a list of old tenants who died from the 1960s to now.

348
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:18,240
In 1979, an old man who rented Ms. Yoo's house died...

349
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,540
when he lost his footing at the reservoir.

350
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:20,640
And in 1993,

351
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:22,380
after Yoo Young Soon left...

352
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:24,250
It's none of these people.

353
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:25,950
What?

354
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,490
Right, you saw their face.

355
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,420
How's everything going with you, Ms. Joo?

356
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,060
I asked the detectives in the area for help with the search,

357
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:35,990
but it might take a while since we don't know the time of death.

358
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:38,800
I'll meet some elderly people in the town starting tomorrow.

359
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,960
Then I'll go meet Ms. Yoo Young Soon.

360
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,430
Where does she live?

361
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:45,640
She said she'll be at her daughter's place this week.

362
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:51,480
You haven't lived in that house for 50 years now.

363
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,980
Is there a particular reason?

364
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,980
I found it odd that you didn't live there for 50 years,

365
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,020
yet you didn't choose to sell it either.

366
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,690
You were hesitant about selling it the last time you came.

367
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:07,460
Many people keep their property as an investment too.

368
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:09,830
You know,

369
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:15,700
I don't even know how my father passed away.

370
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:18,200
The year when I turned 20,

371
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:21,840
my father collapsed after a stroke.

372
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:26,140
Then he was diagnosed with dementia after two years.

373
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,510
You never showed up since our father collapsed,

374
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,080
then the first thing you say is you want to sell this house?

375
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:32,980
I really think my next business will thrive.

376
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,850
Do you know how much you lost trying to run a business?

377
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,550
Stop obsessing over this.

378
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:37,650
Get a grip, will you?

379
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:40,190
Half of the share will be mine once Dad passes, right?

380
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,730
What's so bad about taking that share beforehand?

381
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,660
- It's not your money. - He's still alive.

382
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:46,500
He can't even recognize me!

383
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,530
How is that any different from being dead?

384
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,740
Instead of keeping him at home,

385
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:55,270
you should rather get him in a nursing home.

386
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:56,570
Get out.

387
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:58,810
I can't consider someone like you as my brother or family.

388
00:29:58,814 --> 00:30:01,040
Get out of here!

389
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:31,910
That night, my father suddenly disappeared.

390
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:36,480
It probably wasn't easy for him to walk after his stroke.

391
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:38,380
He disappeared.

392
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,880
I'm sure Young Sik killed him...

393
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:42,650
for his father's money.

394
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:45,920
Goodness, no matter how much he coveted after money,

395
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,060
how could a son kill his father?

396
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,290
His son could do that and worse.

397
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:52,730
Even before Young Sik graduated high school,

398
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,800
he sold off his late mother's jewelry...

399
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:55,800
to start a business or something.

400
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:58,370
Then were the police suspicious of him?

401
00:30:58,373 --> 00:30:59,670
They were.

402
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:02,440
But his father's body wasn't found, and there was no evidence.

403
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,510
What could they do?

404
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:06,340
I see. So there was no evidence.

405
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:07,510
He must've felt guilty.

406
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,310
He ran off as soon as he got released,

407
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:11,050
then never stepped a foot inside his hometown after that.

408
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:13,850
That should be considered as hard evidence. Don't you think?

409
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:15,650
I think that might be the case.

410
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,960
Where did you bury him? Just tell me where his body is.

411
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,230
- Tell me! - Stop it. How would I know?

412
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,760
Young Sik, please. We need to give him a funeral.

413
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,630
Let me go.

414
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:32,570
Young Sik!

415
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:35,970
Since that day,

416
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:39,940
I was unable to live in that house...

417
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:43,780
or sell that place to someone else.

418
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,350
This is a photo I took when I graduated my school.

419
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:50,720
I always keep this with me.

420
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:56,260
My other albums are at my son's place.

421
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:03,070
What did your father like?

422
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:05,470
He had a sweet tooth.

423
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:10,010
He loved chocolate, candies, and sweet snacks.

424
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:14,710
He'd buy those treats without telling my mom.

425
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,390
That's an expensive apartment.

426
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:33,600
But why does it look more like a jail than a home?

427
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:50,010
(Yoo Chul Gu)

428
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,290
Why are you taking so much sugar?

429
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,550
Because I need it.

430
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:00,690
My gosh.

431
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:03,630
And only because she doesn't have to carry this.

432
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,360
(Brown Sugar)

433
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,210
I think you have the wrong bait.

434
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,350
Shut it.

435
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,050
It's here. The ants are here.

436
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:28,890
- You called ants here. - And cockroaches.

437
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,420
Where? My gosh!

438
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,690
You have an awful taste in pranks.

439
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:08,690
Take your necklace off.

440
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,460
- What's he doing? - I think he came back to himself.

441
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,140
You can just leave it.

442
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,280
Dad, let me draw you a bath.

443
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:27,070
You look great, Dad.

444
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,970
Thanks. Thank you.

445
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,480
He can't even recognize me!

446
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,950
You should rather get him in a nursing home.

447
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:42,150
Get out.

448
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:44,420
I can't consider someone like you as my brother or family.

449
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,520
Get out of here!

450
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:59,260
Dad.

451
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:04,030
I'm sorry.

452
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:06,740
I just pity...

453
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:09,270
my sister. That's all.

454
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:12,980
I'm sorry, Dad.

455
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,720
You look great, Dad.

456
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,880
In Bum.

457
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,950
In Bum, where are you going?

458
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:37,950
In Bum.

459
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,790
(Do not enter.)

460
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,560
This is it.

461
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:49,030
- What do you mean? - He threw himself down the well.

462
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:52,700
He struggled to walk...

463
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,710
all the way here from his house...

464
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,570
and killed himself.

465
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,480
So?

466
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:07,380
Are you going to whine and tell me...

467
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:11,220
that she needs to know the truth?

468
00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:13,920
Do you think you're a deity?

469
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:17,560
Reading an unrested spirit's memory...

470
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:19,730
doesn't give you the right to meddle in others' lives.

471
00:40:19,734 --> 00:40:22,530
- I'm not trying to be a deity. - Then?

472
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:27,970
Remember what she told us?

473
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:31,270
She said she didn't know how her father passed away.

474
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,710
I also don't know how my uncle passed away.

475
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:42,920
What a cold-hearted scumbag.

476
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:45,220
I know very well how painful it feels...

477
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:47,220
not to know the reason behind your beloved's death...

478
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:51,130
and having to force yourself to accept it and move on.

479
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,160
I do.

480
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:59,840
If I were her, I'd want to know the truth...

481
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:02,810
no matter how gruesome it may be.

482
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:09,510
(Daebak Realty)

483
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,820
You once asked me...

484
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:18,020
what kind of person I was.

485
00:41:21,863 --> 00:41:24,960
When I first started this job,

486
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,330
I was just like you.

487
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:35,600
I thought it was right to tell them the truth I had witnessed.

488
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:39,240
I thought that would relieve the unrested spirits' grudges.

489
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:42,610
However...

490
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:44,610
What did you just say?

491
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,720
My son killed my wife?

492
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:50,320
He's only in middle school.

493
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:53,060
How dare you utter such a thing just to make more money?

494
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,790
I will report you for fraud.

495
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:08,640
- Goodness. - Excuse me.

496
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:10,810
(Emergency)

497
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,080
Goodness. He killed his son then committed suicide.

498
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,980
Why would he kill his son as well?

499
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:21,580
- What did that boy do so wrong? - Tell me about it.

500
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:26,460
That's when I promised myself not to interfere in their lives...

501
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:31,290
no matter what I learned during the exorcisms.

502
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:38,800
Goodwill doesn't always reap good fruit.

503
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:40,600
In fact,

504
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:43,740
it often brings bad results.

505
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:45,580
Then...

506
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,680
I'd like to at least tell her where he is.

507
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:50,450
We can do...

508
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,280
that much.

509
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,420
They must've found the body by now.

510
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,300
Does it bother you?

511
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,800
I can't help but see myself in Ms. Yoo Young Soon.

512
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:49,770
I've wasted the past 20 years of my life...

513
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:52,140
since I didn't know the truth.

514
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:57,180
Is it right for me to let her continue believing...

515
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:59,110
in a lie?

516
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:03,890
At times, the truth is more painful.

517
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:20,200
(Forensic)

518
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:52,200
I had no idea you were so close.

519
00:44:55,176 --> 00:44:58,040
You must've been so cold.

520
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:04,250
You must've been so cold.

521
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:25,600
It's so beautiful.

522
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,670
How could you take such good care of the house?

523
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:33,640
It's rare to find such an old but beautiful house.

524
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,310
This is a perfect place to raise one's children...

525
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,480
since it's surrounded by nature.

526
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:41,380
What? Oh In Bum?

527
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,020
What brings you here?

528
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:50,660
We make sure our houses...

529
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,660
are always in tip-top condition.

530
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,230
I'm so grateful.

531
00:45:57,438 --> 00:45:58,970
In Bum.

532
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:01,370
Hey, snap out of it.

533
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,940
Ms. Hong, I'll give them a house tour.

534
00:46:07,948 --> 00:46:09,350
Sure.

535
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,810
- Shall we? - No, thank you.

536
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:13,180
I'll wait here.

537
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,520
- Feel free to look around. - Okay.

538
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:16,720
- Okay. - Okay.

539
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:18,550
This way.

540
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,160
The trees have grown so much.

541
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:29,360
I heard my father planted them the year I was born.

542
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:35,070
Nothing has changed.

543
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:38,870
Only I have aged.

544
00:46:42,183 --> 00:46:45,680
I'd make snowmen out here...

545
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:49,250
and have watermelon during the summer.

546
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,290
This house holds...

547
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,990
so many memories.

548
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:01,630
Don't you want to look...

549
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:03,670
for your brother?

550
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,940
If you want, we can help you find him.

551
00:47:08,943 --> 00:47:12,840
My brother died 50 years ago.

552
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:16,410
Don't you just love how it was renovated?

553
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:19,380
Yes. You can move in right away.

554
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:23,390
What do you think? Did you look around the house?

555
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,020
Yes. I will talk to my husband one more time and call you.

556
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:29,760
Yes. Take all the time you need and make your decision.

557
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,960
Okay.

558
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:31,990
Shall we get going?

559
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:34,900
No. I'm going to stay here for a bit more.

560
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:37,700
Today might be my last day here.

561
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:40,040
Okay. I will call you soon.

562
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,870
Okay.

563
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:53,340
You're still here.

564
00:48:54,248 --> 00:48:57,980
Your brother didn't kill your father.

565
00:48:57,985 --> 00:49:01,550
Pardon? What are you talking about all of a sudden?

566
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:04,150
We are only telling you the truth which we came across...

567
00:49:04,158 --> 00:49:06,520
while performing an exorcism in this house.

568
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,590
Your father...

569
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:12,190
took his own life.

570
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,070
Why are you telling me such a lie?

571
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,630
I'm not lying.

572
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:20,740
That's the last memory...

573
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:22,540
your father held onto down to his last moment.

574
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:26,980
With that memory, we were able to find his body.

575
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:36,720
Your brother...

576
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,720
wasn't after the inheritance.

577
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:42,790
He just wasn't good at expressing himself.

578
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:45,560
He was heartbroken for you and the trouble you went through.

579
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:50,400
And your father knew how truly your brother had felt.

580
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,400
The fact that he was a burden...

581
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,600
on his children caused him more pain...

582
00:49:54,608 --> 00:49:57,170
than his illness.

583
00:49:57,478 --> 00:50:00,740
That's why when he was lucid,

584
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,050
he decided to end his own life.

585
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,550
Even until the last moment,

586
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:12,920
all he ever wanted was for you two to be happy.

587
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:18,560
If he knew that you guys would be strangers 50 years,

588
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:20,830
he would not have made...

589
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,270
that decision.

590
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:26,970
- Ma'am. - I see.

591
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:31,010
Thank you for telling me.

592
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:32,970
Ma'am.

593
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:37,380
I am sorry.

594
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:40,350
You are sorry? That's it?

595
00:50:40,354 --> 00:50:44,490
What if our mother dies? How will you fix that?

596
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:45,850
Darn it.

597
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:48,690
Mom. Wake up.

598
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:52,190
Mom. Oh, Mom...

599
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,230
Mom. Wake up.

600
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,310
Are you okay?

601
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,950
Why did you do that? That wasn't like you.

602
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:19,790
I'm the troublemaker between us.

603
00:51:19,793 --> 00:51:22,690
- Hey. - He's here.

604
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:26,400
Sir.

605
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,730
This is Ms. Hong Ji A, the CEO of Daebak Realty.

606
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:31,700
I see.

607
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:36,570
Hello. I'm Yoo Young Sik.

608
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,670
The visiting hours are over, sir.

609
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:42,370
Young Sik.

610
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,080
Young Soon. Can you recognize me?

611
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,710
Now that you are older,

612
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:52,410
you look just like Dad.

613
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,180
I came too late, didn't I?

614
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:56,850
I'm sorry.

615
00:52:56,857 --> 00:53:01,390
No. Thank you for coming.

616
00:53:02,029 --> 00:53:05,690
I should apologize.

617
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:09,260
I was young and didn't know any better then.

618
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,200
I only made things worse for you.

619
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:19,540
Thank you. Thank you for coming to see me.

620
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:29,720
(Daebak Realty)

621
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:34,090
I must have scared you dearly.

622
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:36,190
No.

623
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,500
Thank you so much for making a great recovery.

624
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Right.

625
00:53:42,502 --> 00:53:44,530
That day,

626
00:53:44,538 --> 00:53:48,540
I never got to thank you before I fainted.

627
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:51,310
I am sorry about that.

628
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:53,780
After hearing what you told me,

629
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,750
it would be a lie if I told you that I wasn't shocked.

630
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,720
But now that I am a mother...

631
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:02,720
and older,

632
00:54:02,723 --> 00:54:05,990
I can understand why my father...

633
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,220
made that decision.

634
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,500
Thank you. Thank you.

635
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,460
Thank you for helping me...

636
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:19,600
not resent my brother at the end of my life.

637
00:54:19,806 --> 00:54:21,200
I'm sorry to do this to you,

638
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:25,170
but I cannot sell the house.

639
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,040
I want to spend my remaining time in that house...

640
00:54:28,048 --> 00:54:30,680
where I have so many childhood memories...

641
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:33,050
before my time is up.

642
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:36,650
I'm sure your father will be very happy.

643
00:54:36,657 --> 00:54:38,650
Okay.

644
00:54:43,764 --> 00:54:48,030
Lighten up. Everything ended well.

645
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:56,200
By the way, why did you really do it?

646
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,240
You told me that our job was sending away the unrested spirit...

647
00:54:58,245 --> 00:55:00,410
and not to get involved in their lives.

648
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:04,880
Why did you tell Ms. Yoo the truth all of a sudden?

649
00:55:05,118 --> 00:55:08,720
Your nosy quality must have rubbed off on me.

650
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:12,250
So you're giving me all the credit.

651
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:15,790
Yes. You deserve all the credit.

652
00:55:16,263 --> 00:55:17,960
What's all this?

653
00:55:17,964 --> 00:55:20,430
Are you trying to make my heart flutter?

654
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:24,830
No. Right after you thanked me the other day,

655
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:27,000
you told me to go into the water.

656
00:55:27,007 --> 00:55:29,100
What's the catch?

657
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:30,970
What will you make me do now?

658
00:55:30,977 --> 00:55:33,340
There's no catch.

659
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:44,490
I've thought about this case.

660
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:47,860
Helping her find out the truth about her late father was nice.

661
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:50,730
But helping Ms. Yoo reconcile with her brother...

662
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:52,590
made me happier.

663
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:57,030
She'll be able to live without resentment now.

664
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,600
- Performing an exorcism isn't... - Performing an exorcism isn't...

665
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,910
- just for the unrested spirit. - just for the unrested spirit.

666
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:07,410
It's also for the people who are left behind.

667
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:10,510
They must go on their lives.

668
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:14,050
Yes. I was just about to say that.

669
00:56:14,054 --> 00:56:16,180
That's a nice lesson.

670
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,920
She was a good exorcist.

671
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:25,890
My mother used to say that all the time when I was young.

672
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,330
Back then, I didn't understand what she meant by that.

673
00:56:36,243 --> 00:56:38,440
Are you sure you can live here all by yourself?

674
00:56:38,445 --> 00:56:42,440
Goodness. I still got a few good years left in me!

675
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,880
Living alone would be great. It'll be very relaxing.

676
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:48,850
You should come by often.

677
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:50,650
Okay.

678
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:52,690
- You got it, Young Soon. - Okay.

(Withdrawn)

681
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,960
Forget about hitting the jackpot. That was a bust.

682
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:00,630
We lost two cases in a row.

683
00:57:01,134 --> 00:57:03,470
There are some bad days too.

(Record of Exorcism: 1978)

687
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:29,090
Only the record from 1979 is missing.

688
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:35,430
What?

689
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:38,600
What... What's going on?

690
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:40,440

At times,

693
00:58:17,277 --> 00:58:19,740
the truth is more painful.

694
00:59:03,924 --> 00:59:04,950
Did you give it a thought?

695
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,420
I told you to quit working as a psychic.

696
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:09,020
Aren't you the one who'd miss having me around?

697
00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:11,330
Do you know that your theme today is very odd?

698
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:13,090
- You seemed cute, that's all. - Shut up.

699
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:15,060
- Hold me. - Do not move.

700
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:16,430
It's right behind you.

701
00:59:16,436 --> 00:59:19,330
Will you be okay? I don't think Ji A will give up easily.

702
00:59:19,339 --> 00:59:20,370
If she finds out anything...

703
00:59:20,373 --> 00:59:23,100
I won't let that happen.

704

I'm the only one who looks into the Record of Exorcism.

705
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,480
One of my grandmother's Record of Exorcism is gone.

706
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,680
Did you take it?
