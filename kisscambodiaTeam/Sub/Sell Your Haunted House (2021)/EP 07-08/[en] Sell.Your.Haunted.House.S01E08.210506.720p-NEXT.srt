00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,779
EPISODE 8

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,609
- Wake up.
- That's my sister!

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,679
- What are we going to do?
- Move aside!

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,349
- Where are we going?
- Please let her live.

5
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,220
Goodness, stop doing this and leave.

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,689
Get over there.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,029
What did you see?
Come back to yourself.

8
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,200
That...

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,338
In March
of the Year of the Black Horse,

10
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,808
laborers who were...

11
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,110
building up the capital city
died of an epidemic.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,008
Those who survived claimed...

13
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,579
they witnessed a man without a face.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,720
In February
of the Year of the Black Chicken,

15
00:00:58,189 --> 00:00:59,628
three days went by...

16
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:01,930
after rumors of the faceless man
broke out in Hanyang.

17
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,798
A fire broke out
from the southern part of Hanyang...

18
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,500
and engulfed the entire city,
burning down over 2,000 houses.

19
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:29,069
Leap February, near spring
of the Year of the White Dragon,

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,789
hailstones the size of an egg
fell upon Gyeongsang Province,

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,689
freezing and withering the crops.

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,359
Farmers claimed
to have seen a faceless woman.

23
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:44,940
Oh my gosh.

24
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:47,368
These are records that say
big disasters broke out...

25
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,910
after faceless people were
witnessed.

26
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,308
There are similar records
from other time periods too.

27
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:53,679
Faceless people?

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,008
Egg ghosts.

29
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,718
You'll see an explanation
in the evil spirits section...

30
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,419
of the Encyclopedia
of Unrested Spirits.

31
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:06,989
"Egg ghosts are created..."

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,198
"through an entanglement of spirits
who die on the same day..."

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,058
"and the same hour..."

34
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:13,270
"due to events such as wars,
epidemics, and big fires."

35
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,899
"It can be characterized by
the lack of eyes, nose, and mouth."

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,098
"Once this ghost is observed,"

37
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,468
"many people will
either become ill or die."

38
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,209
The kid Oh Sung Sik brought
also didn't have a face.

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,709
The spirits who died from his arson
must've become an egg ghost,

40
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,218
then went onto possess that kid.

41
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,019
But it says right here...

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,119
that it's impossible
to drive it out with the needle.

43
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,159
That's what makes me concerned.

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,360
My mother already knew
that her needle was useless.

45
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:44,199
But she clearly made use of it
on that day.

46
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,629
I need to know
what she wanted to do.

47
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,269
But that doesn't change the fact
you need a strong psychic...

48
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,210
to send away the unrested spirit
of an exorcist.

49
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,109
Oh In Bum was strong enough,

50
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,710
but we couldn't do it.

51
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,050
It may not be
the problem of the psychic.

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,419
Just as I was sure
of my incorrect memory for 20 years,

53
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,659
I may be missing something again.

54
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:15,860
Anyway, the egg ghost is
the only lead I have at this point.

55
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,339
Anyway,

56
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:28,640
what have you been looking for?
You're being very distractive.

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,479
I've been looking through
Records of Exorcism to check...

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,520
if any of my ancestors
have driven out an egg ghost.

59
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:39,189
Only the record
from 1979 is missing.

60
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,990
Really?

61
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,589
I'm the only one who
looks into the Record of Exorcism.

62
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:55,629
I guess there was one more.

63
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:03,640
(From sunset to sunrise)

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,979
So from your boarding house
and your car,

65
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,020
you are missing 4 laptops
and 2 tablet PCs, correct?

66
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,819
I think that's about it for now.

67
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,919
I'll give you a call
when we find something.

68
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,260
But there are no CCTVs around here,
so it won't be easy.

69
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,070
Were you worried about us?

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,570
- It's nothing...
- Did you go through my bookcase?

71
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
What?

72
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,739
One of my grandmother's
Record of Exorcism is gone.

73
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,909
Did you take it?

74
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,278
She's treating me like a thief
on the day I got something stolen.

75
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,019
Did a thief
break into your place too?

76
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,080
What's a Record of Exorcism?
Is that expensive?

77
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,289
If you didn't, forget it.

78
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,620
Hey, you can't leave like this.

79
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:53,060
Hey, what's a Record of Exorcism?

80
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,159
Tell me!

81
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:58,728
Shouldn't you apologize
for suspecting me without proof?

82
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,199
I do have proof.

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,239
Did you forget that I caught you
snooping around my bookshelf?

84
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,869
Why would you bring that up?
You're so grudging.

85
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,440
- Ms. Hong, I'm off now.
- Okay.

86
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,779
- See you in the evening.
- Goodbye.

87
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,689
What in the world
is this Record of Exorcism?

88
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,250
They're exorcism records
written by an exorcist.

89
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:24,760
I see. Like a workbook.

90
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,989
You even have ones
from the Joseon Era.

91
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,598
This is a family business.

92
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:31,729
Correct.

93
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,969
But it'll end with me.

94
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,298
Why?

95
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:38,339
Why would I hand down something
so evil?

96
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,210
You absorb strangers' memories
and feel sadness,

97
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,880
hatred, and regret.

98
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,250
With time,
you start hating humans in general.

99
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,919
You don't know which emotions
are truly yours.

100
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:57,159
In the end,
you lose your entire life.

101
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,289
Don't worry.

102
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,330
You're someone...

103
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,299
that can't be forgotten so easily.

104
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,699
- Is it empty?
- Should we break in?

105
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,870
Who are you?

106
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,339
Hello, ma'am.

107
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,178
Doesn't Oh In Bum live here?

108
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:18,539
We're his friends.

109
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:20,049
Hello.

110
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,418
- Look over there.
- What are you looking for?

111
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,718
Get out! Get out this instant!

112
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,020
Stop bothering me!

113
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,819
We looked
into Oh In Bum's surroundings...

114
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,120
and his grandmother's house,

115
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,689
but found no memorandum.

116
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,728
(Chairman Do Hak Sung)

117
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:35,729
Are you sure?

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,570
Seeing how he's been visiting those
who knew his uncle,

119
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,270
I don't think he knows anything
for sure.

120
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,940
You promised
you'll give us an apartment unit.

121
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,179
- What?
- I set the place on fire...

122
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,979
and killed people.

123
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,349
No.

124
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,419
He wouldn't have said such a thing
had he not known anything.

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,750
I'm sure there's something.

126
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,520
(Ceremony for the Redevelopment
of Golden Apartment)

127
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,130
What was that?

128
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,510
Should I eat something
before I go to bed?

129
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
What was that?

130
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,080
Hold on.

131
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,200
Was I seeing things?

132
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:47,870
Gosh, that startled me.

133
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,339
I was scared to death.

134
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,950
What?

135
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,020
What's wrong with this? What?

136
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,859
What?

137
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,769
Rumors about a child spirit
have been going around...

138
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,929
since last month.

139
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,168
It's not uncommon for spirits
to appear in accident spots.

140
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,339
Did you two also witness
this child spirit?

141
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,338
No, we didn't.

142
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:32,908
Then why are you suddenly
putting your house on the market?

143
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,150
It's Byeol.

144
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,049
- Sorry?
- That child spirit...

145
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,520
is our daughter, Byeol.

146
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,289
She refuses...

147
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,159
to leave this earth
because it's too unfair for her.

148
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,569
It's all because
her murderer hasn't been punished.

149
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,870
He's so shameless.

150
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,770
He keeps denying
that he had anything to do with it.

151
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,470
Honey.

152
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,380
To be frank,

153
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,449
I've never believed in spirits.

154
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:08,949
But...

155
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,529
after hearing that our poor kid
was still wandering this earth,

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,959
how could I ignore it?

157
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,529
That's why we came all the way here
to ask for your help.

158
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:24,730
Please help our daughter...

159
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,970
find peace.

160
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,500
I beg you.

161
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,370
Nothing's for certain just yet.

162
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,409
Perhaps,
there really is an unrested spirit.

163
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,208
Or people could've concocted
that story...

164
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,110
just for fun
or could've just seen things.

165
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:44,679
If it turns out
that there is no unrested spirit,

166
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,919
we will decline your request.

167
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,729
I will start the briefing.

168
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,730
(Rendezvous Park Apartment)

169
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,859
("Young Girl Dies in a Car Accident
in Front of an Apartment Complex")

170
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,370
Rumors about an unrested spirit
appearing around the complex...

171
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,870
started a month ago...

172
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,640
after a car accident took place.

173
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,038
The victim was Eun Byeol,
a ten-year-old.

174
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,879
She lived in Block 108.

175
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,649
She got hit
by another resident's car...

176
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,418
on her way home from her friend's
in Block 109.

177
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,750
Goodness. Poor girl.

178
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,620
The driver claims
that he's innocent.

179
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,329
You murderer. Bring her back!

180
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:28,028
Stop it already!

181
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,198
How many times must I tell you?
I didn't kill her!

182
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:33,599
She was already on the ground!

183
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,028
It was too dark to see anything!

184
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,798
- Come on, now.
- Bring her back!

185
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,309
What about the CCTV?

186
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:43,678
They were putting up fences
inside the complex,

187
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,078
so both the street lamps
and the CCTV were turned off.

188
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,250
"Putting up fences?"

189
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,990
Is it normal to put up fences
inside apartment complexes?

190
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,818
This is a social-mix complex...

191
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,349
where local residents
and public rental residents...

192
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,459
live together.

193
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,428
"Social-mix"?

194
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:02,428
Some of the apartments
were given to low-income families...

195
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,529
when they were originally built.

196
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,869
Families from different statuses
were mixed together,

197
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,900
thus the term "social mix".

198
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,240
Just putting them together
won't help them become closer.

199
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:19,079
That's why the two groups
had a conflict.

200
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:22,918
The local residents put up fences
to keep themselves divided.

201
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,350
The public rental residents
were against this.

202
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,559
Then which group was Byeol in?

203
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,818
The local residents.

204
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,230
How could you block a pathway?

205
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,928
What about our kids?

206
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,099
They'll have to take a longer route
to school.

207
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,869
Please stop screaming.

208
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,599
This is right for our kids' safety.

209
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,668
Strangers come and go here.
It's not safe for them.

210
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:48,970
Are you calling us strangers?

211
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,980
Why won't you answer me?

212
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,649
We're residents
from the same complex,

213
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,979
so let's not fight.

214
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,650
We may live in the same complex,
but we're not the same.

215
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,689
What did you just say?

216
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:01,949
Don't push me! How uncivil of you!

217
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,689
I looked into the rumors.

218
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,889
I searched online community sites
for mothers and ghost story sites.

219
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,699
The most popular stories...

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,229
were about drivers who died
of a cardiac arrest...

221
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,328
at the sudden appearance
of a child spirit...

222
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:16,869
or the child spirit covered
the driver's eyes...

223
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,269
Child spirits aren't evil.

224
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,240
No victims from that area
were hospitalized or passed away.

225
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,709
Ghost stories and facts
don't go hand in hand.

226
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,380
Continue.

227
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,350
Anyway,

228
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,849
due to consecutive accidents,

229
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,390
they've blocked all vehicles
from entering the complex.

230
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,230
To be precise,
only delivery vans are forbidden.

231
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,298
The accident wasn't even caused
by a delivery van.

232
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,298
They're just abusing their power.

233
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,770
That has nothing to do with us.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
- We'll end the briefing here.
- Okay.

235
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,500
Will you visit the site today?

236
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,970
Yes. I should.

237
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,140
I ought to.

238
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,390
What?

239
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,448
Can you even drive in that?

240
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,519
- Be quiet.
- You look cute, that's all.

241
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,720
Shut up.

242
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:13,929
Gosh.

243
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,569
Look at that. You can't do it.

244
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,340
Do it yourself.

245
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,370
Gosh.

246
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,578
You can't do it?

247
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,249
The representative meeting
concluded...

248
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,048
that unauthorized vehicles
were forbidden to enter.

249
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,649
Don't get mad at me.

250
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,548
How am I to carry all these parcels
in there?

251
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:42,958
In any case,
your vehicle's not allowed to enter.

252
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,490
It's forbidden.

253
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,278
I knew it.
This is exactly why I hate kids.

254
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,779
They have no pattern.

255
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,110
You can do it, Ji A.

256
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,688
Do you know that
your theme today is very odd?

257
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,949
Child spirits
just don't stand still.

258
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,119
They go everywhere.

259
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,089
That's why it's difficult
to identify them.

260
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,759
My body temperature plummets
as well.

261
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,399
What's there to worry about?
Your special psychic is here.

262
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,100
Stop rambling.
You're distracting me.

263
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,569
What? Have you forgotten
that I saved your life twice...

264
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,510
It's here.

265
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,199
Darn it.

266
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,510
Oh, my.

267
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,720
What was that?

268
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,929
She's such a good runner.

269
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,329
Oh, no.

270
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,650
Hold my hand.

271
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,289
That's what I'm here for.

272
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,370
Don't move.

273
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,610
The child spirit is behind you.

274
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,520
Why aren't you doing anything?

275
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,090
- Did she leave?
- Wait.

276
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,059
I didn't get to check her face yet.

277
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,429
What are you two doing here?

278
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,968
They are my guests, sir.

279
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:16,330
I see. They are here for you?

280
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,070
I got a complaint about
a stranger going around the complex.

281
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,439
- I'm sorry about that.
- Have a good night.

282
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,880
Mom.

283
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,769
Did you confirm everything?

284
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:53,810
Is it my daughter, Byeol?

285
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:56,269
Yes.

286
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,439
It's Byeol.

287
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,509
Ma'am.

288
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,030
Are you feeling better now?

289
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,499
It's all my fault.

290
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,239
Ma'am.

291
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,009
I should've tried hard
to move to a better apartment.

292
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,380
Only if we didn't move in here...

293
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,748
Since I checked the face
of the unrested spirit,

294
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,489
my secretary will be in touch
to schedule the exorcism.

295
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,890
Ms. Hong.
When you perform the exorcism,

296
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,259
can't I be there with you?

297
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,158
No. It's dangerous to have
an outsider present.

298
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,529
I don't want her to be alone
when she leaves this world.

299
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,799
Please.
Please let me be there for her.

300
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,969
Let's go.

301
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,488
Not a word.

302
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,228
You don't know
what I'm going to say.

303
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,530
Just keep your mouth shut.

304
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,429
Don't even sigh.

305
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,370
What?

306
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,310
It's a green light now.

307
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,260
(Land, Private Properties,
Commercial Buildings, Rent)

308
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,769
(Changhwa Restaurant)

309
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,429
What? You...

310
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:34,769
My gosh.

311
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,800
Don't worry. He'll leave soon.

312
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:43,880
Did the universe finally punish you?
What a mess you are.

313
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:06,929
Thanks.

314
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,269
What happened?

315
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,649
Do Hak Sung tossed me out...

316
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,209
because I couldn't...

317
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,150
get rid of Daebak Realty.

318
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,789
He kicked me out of my nightclub.

319
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,390
- No. I can't leave!
- My gosh. Goodness.

320
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,999
Hey!

321
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,030
Oh In Bum.

322
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,439
What? Don't sound so serious.

323
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,540
Let me ask you one thing.

324
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,340
Remember that day...

325
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,080
when you scammed me
saying my nightclub was haunted?

326
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,150
It's the same thing, right?

327
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,580
What you saw that day?

328
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,290
(Taejin Service)

329
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,050
What I saw that day...

330
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,060
wasn't a real spirit, right?

331
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,800
It was a real spirit.

332
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,198
I'm sure you heard...

333
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:18,140
that Ms. Hong's late mother's spirit
still lives here.

334
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,310
Is that so?

335
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,540
I see.

336
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,449
Use this opportunity
to stop bullying people.

337
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,120
Live an honest life.

338
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,360
- Oh In Bum.
- Don't hold my hand. It's creepy.

339
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,390
Do you think Daebak Realty has...

340
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,900
an opening for me?

341
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,599
Gosh. You're a lunatic.

342
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,300
To be in that line of business,

343
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,039
I'm sure they'd need
some kind of bodyguard.

344
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,708
Ms. Hong is the bodyguard.

345
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:56,909
Besides, if you were in her shoes,
do you think you'd hire yourself?

346
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,209
Darn it. Ms. Hong is
stronger than me.

347
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,449
And she can fight better than me.

348
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,949
Hey, don't you owe me money?
350,000 dollars.

349
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,049
You won't have to pay me back.

350
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,120
Unbelievable.

351
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,530
I don't owe you any money
to begin with.

352
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,928
I earned the 50,000 dollars...

353
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:17,059
fair and square
for the exorcism I performed.

354
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,198
I really don't have a place to go.

355
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,998
Hey, look at this.

356
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,399
I'm trying to not get caught
by Do Hak Sung. Seriously.

357
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,239
He's a scary guy.

358
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:28,040
He really might kill me.

359
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,409
I'm really sorry
this happened to you.

360
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,019
You're on your own.

361
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,399
You're here anyway. Eat up.

362
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,900
Don't ever come back.

363
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,209
Slow down.

364
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,909
Hey, In Bum.
My baby sent me a present...

365
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,719
- My gosh.
- Are you sure her photo is real?

366
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,330
You've never met her in person.

367
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,059
Why would she send you
a birthday present?

368
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,958
She's real. My girlfriend is real.

369
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,699
We're meeting next week.

370
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:28,229
- Really?
- Yes.

371
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,969
That will be your first date.

372
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,209
It's underwear.

373
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,409
Read it.

374
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,219
"Thank you as always, Ji Chul.
Happy birthday."

375
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,689
My gosh. Let me see.

376
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,890
Wow, look how classy these are.

377
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,920
Don't you think
my baby has great taste?

378
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,560
Yes. They sure do look special.

379
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:02,499
Here. That's for you.

380
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,069
But aren't these your birthday gift
from your girlfriend?

381
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,909
- She told me to share with you.
- With me?

382
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,479
- Why?
- Because my baby is that kind.

383
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:12,810
Anyway,

384
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:16,179
don't you think it's very special
that she gave me underwear?

385
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,219
Yes, sure.

386
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,319
Giving underwear to a man.

387
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,120
I have to think hard now.

388
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,140
What kind of a special present
am I going to get her?

389
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,959
Congrats.

390
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,729
(Daebak Realty)

391
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:38,699
Hello.

392
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,110
This is it. This is the address.

393
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:45,109
- Is this it?
- Yes.

394
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,209
It doesn't look too great.

395
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,248
"From sunset to sunrise?"

396
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,478
- Are they open or not?
- What's going on?

397
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,489
- Hello?
- Excuse us.

398
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,919
Hello.

399
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:58,158
- My gosh.
- She was in.

400
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,889
- Come later.
- Let's go inside.

401
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,289
- Later, my foot.
- Let's go inside.

402
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,459
- Let's go.
- Hey, I said...

403
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:12,099
- You tell her.
- No, you talk to her.

404
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,140
Hye Jung's mother?

405
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:23,479
Byeol's family
put their house on sale, right?

406
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,390
I hear they're selling it urgently.
Is that correct?

407
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,418
The residents of Rendezvous Park
promised to not drop the price...

408
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,319
below 10,000 dollars
per square meter,

409
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,789
so please keep that promise.

410
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,459
I never made any promises.

411
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,630
Our residents made this promise
for everyone who lives there.

412
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,799
If one family
sells it at a cheaper price,

413
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,040
the price for our entire complex
will drop down.

414
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,639
It's a measure we took
to protect our property rights.

415
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,139
Rigging the price is illegal.

416
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
Rig...

417
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,109
We aren't rigging the price.

418
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,850
It's how our community
stands together.

419
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:03,290
Byeol's mother
knows that very well too.

420
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:07,130
She got a little emotional
and made this mistake.

421
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:11,158
You already know why she's leaving.

422
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,258
Yet you're here only to discuss
the selling price,

423
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:14,699
and you call that standing together?

424
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:22,939
We're more heartbroken
than anybody...

425
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:25,409
about what happened to that family.

426
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:29,050
However, that doesn't mean
we should all suffer a loss.

427
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,880
A loss.

428
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,189
Please leave.

429
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,860
I need to get some rest.

430
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,499
Well, it looks like
we've made our point very clear.

431
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,800
Let's go.

432
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,269
Unbelievable.

433
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,178
The problem
with tonight's operation is...

434
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,208
that it'll be held outdoors,

435
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:07,079
just like the time at the hospital.

436
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,718
Incense burns much faster outdoors,

437
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:13,320
so it'll become very problematic
if we get even a little stalled.

438
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,130
So don't you dare get distracted
or do anything else.

439
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:18,889
I never do anything else.

440
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,060
Whatever.

441
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,069
I already talked
to a security guard...

442
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,239
who works the night shift to keep
as many people away as possible.

443
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,799
- "Talked?"
- She bribed him.

444
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,938
I see.

445
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:32,509
(Eun Byeol)

446
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:38,350
You really won't tell her mother?

447
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:41,479
I told you not to get distracted
or do anything else.

448
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,119
I mean, she's a little kid.
You should do it with the mother...

449
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,459
Do you think we're holding
an open class for exorcism?

450
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:49,659
Are we letting parents in now?

451
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,099
I just thought I'd mention it.
I knew you'd say no.

452
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,799
All of her memories will flow
into me afterward,

453
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,920
so I thought it'd be better
to send her away in peace.

454
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,329
Oh In Bum. You did that again.

455
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,699
It wasn't me.

456
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,099
Ms. Hong, I beg you.

457
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,669
Please let me see her one last time.

458
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:40,439
I can't do that.

459
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,379
It's impossible for you to see
her unrested spirit anyway.

460
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,708
I don't mind.

461
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:48,320
Just let me be there with her
as she leaves this world.

462
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,030
Please do this
and help me save myself.

463
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,360
Please, I beg you.

464
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,030
Please.

465
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,870
Please.

466
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,810
Ma'am, please stand up.

467
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,280
You cannot see her.

468
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,249
But it might be possible...

469
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,688
for you to hear her voice.

470
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,590
I can't be sure of that either.

471
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:26,459
Are you all right with that?

472
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,929
That's more than enough. Thank you.

473
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,030
Thank you so much.

474
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,699
But you must promise me one thing.

475
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,439
You have to cover your eyes
with this...

476
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,679
and stay in this circle.

477
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,949
No matter what you hear,

478
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,050
you cannot take a step outside
or take off your blindfold.

479
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:58,120
Okay.

480
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,989
Let's get started.

481
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:10,699
We won't need that soccer ball.

482
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,199
Her mother is here.

483
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,659
Mom!

484
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:34,560
Mom!

485
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,499
Mom!

486
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:59,919
It's time. Take it off.

487
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,169
Mom.

488
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,340
Byeol?

489
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:25,939
Mom!

490
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,979
Byeol.

491
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,219
Byeol, is that you?

492
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,259
Byeol!

493
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,370
Byeol.

494
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,580
Mom, I'm sorry.

495
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:01,040
No.

496
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,549
I should be sorry.

497
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,320
I'll make sure I catch that man...

498
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,249
who did that to you.

499
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,789
I lied to you and said
I went to the English academy...

500
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,390
when I actually went to play
with Yoo Ri.

501
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,499
- Mom!
- Byeol.

502
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,599
- Hello.
- Hi, are you Byeol's friend?

503
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,069
Yes, Yoo Ri lives
in this apartment too.

504
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,239
- Really? Which block?
- Block 109.

505
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,169
I see, Block 109.

506
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,439
Okay. Goodbye.

507
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,248
Why are your clothes dirty?
Where did you play?

508
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:43,719
- What?
- Let's go.

509
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,090
You'll be
in fourth grade next year, right?

510
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,589
The other students will get
better grades than you...

511
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,330
if you only play soccer.

512
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,599
Yoo Ri's mom told her...

513
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,768
that she could play soccer
as much as she pleased.

514
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,498
That's why she's the best player
in our class.

515
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:01,699
That's why they live
in the rental block.

516
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:03,040
What's so bad about that?

517
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:06,380
Only the poor live there.

518
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,508
If you don't study,
you'll end up living there too.

519
00:34:09,509 --> 00:34:10,550
Is that what you want?

520
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,518
If you don't know what I mean,
just do as I say.

521
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,720
I'm only doing this for your sake.

522
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,689
- Okay?
- Okay.

523
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,689
Goodness. My princess.

524
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,699
- Hello.
- I'm glad we ran into you.

525
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,799
Where are you headed?

526
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,368
Residents from the rental block...

527
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,569
are causing a scene
at the fence construction site.

528
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,369
- Let's go together.
- Really?

529
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:37,139
I should go as well.

530
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,169
Goodbye.

531
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,779
Make sure to come home
right after the academy.

532

Dad's buying macarons,
your favorite.

533
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:45,349
- Yes!
- How cute.

534
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,130
I'm so late. Mom's going to kill me.

535
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,729
I need to get home.

536
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:49,950
I'm late. I should hurry.

537
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:01,289
You weren't hit by a car?

538
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:03,959
You fell off the fence?

539
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,970
Do you mean that fence...

540
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,598
that I allowed them to build?

541
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,200
I'm sorry, Mom.

542
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:18,970
I know you told me not to do
anything dangerous.

543
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:23,410
I really thought I could climb
over it.

544
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:27,418
No. No, Byeol. It's not your fault.

545
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,180
It's my fault.

546
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,150
I built that fence. I...

547
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,559
I killed my own daughter.

548
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:40,958
Byeol! I'm so sorry!

549
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:44,099
I'm... I'm so sorry!

550
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,700
It's okay. Don't cry.

551
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,969
Byeol.

552
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,680
Byeol, I'm so sorry!

553
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,349
Byeol...

554
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,320
Byeol...

555
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:14,800
Byeol.

556
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm sorry.

557
00:37:33,749 --> 00:37:36,079
Byeol, I'm so sorry.

558
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,110
Did Byeol leave safely?

559
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:06,479
She did.

560
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,789
I'm glad.

561
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,688
I was worried
because I didn't absorb her memory.

562
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:15,720
That's because
I didn't use the stick.

563
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:19,860
An unrested spirit's memory channels
through the stick.

564
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,929
Is it possible to send them away
without using it?

565
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,999
This is my first time
actually experiencing it.

566
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,280
Hello.

567
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
You're the one
who called Byeol's mom,

568
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,760
didn't you?

569
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,559
I'm a wench...

570
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:51,329
who killed her own kids.

571
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,360
I knew something had to be done.
I'm sorry.

572
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,630
Byeol found peace.

573
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,900
She told her everything she wanted.

574
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,610
She was even mature enough
to comfort her mom.

575
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,970
That's great.

576

578
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,978
All right. So you had already
planned everything out...

579
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:45,010
when you entered the inn.

580
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:49,918
I bet you weren't confident about it
and were terrified.

581
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:51,949
But had you asked for help,

582
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,490
many people could've done so.

583
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,030
You could've sent them
to an orphanage as well.

584
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,990
Why did you kill them?

585
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,760
That was unnecessary,
don't you think?

586
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,970
I didn't want them
to become burdens.

587

Isn't it obvious?

She wanted to see the case file
on Woo Sung Sik's suicide.

592
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,530
I told her no, of course.

Will you be all right?

594

I doubt she'll give up that easily.

and finds out?

she doesn't...

find out.

She told me herself.

Why did she close the restaurant?

She received a call about someone
having spotted her son this morning,

so she went to check.

651
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,868
After everything you said to me,

652
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:06,139
you're looking into Daebak Realty
behind my back.

653
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,309
- It's not what you think.
- Of course, it is.

654
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:12,579
Come here. Grab a chair.

655
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:18,789
Listen up.

656
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,760
Twenty years ago,

657
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,459
someone died at Daebak Realty.

658
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:28,300
And the person who died was
Hong Mi Jin, Hong Ji A's mother.

659
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:33,299
And Young Hong Ji A,
Young Oh In Bum,

660
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,769
and his uncle, Oh Sung Sik were
at the scene.

661
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:40,438
But the first person to call in
this incident was...

662
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:42,240
(Case Report)

663
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,909
- Ju Hwa Jeong.
- Really?

664
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,748
And two days later,

665
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:50,449
Oh Sung Sik wrote in his suicide
note that he was the one...

666
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,989
who set Yongnam Village on fire
and killed himself.

667
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,660
Yongnam Village?
The fire in the shantytown?

668
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,089
Right.

669
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,629
Golden Properties was the biggest
benefactor of the fire.

670
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,998
So obviously,
they were our prime suspect.

671
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,098
But with Oh Sung Sik dead,

672
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:04,629
they were no longer the suspect.

673
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,939
You know this company,
Golden Properties...

674
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,269
- Do you know what it is now?
- What is it?

675
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,038
It's Dohak Construction now.

676
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:13,879
Gosh. Keep going.

677
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,209
Here's what I think.

678
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:17,449
Golden Properties made
Oh Sung Sik...

679
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,848
set the shantytown on fire.

680
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,780
And they got Hong Mi Jin
to kill Oh Sung Sik.

681
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,789
But things went south,
so she was the one who died.

682
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,659
So they got rid of Oh Sung Sik
by making it look like a suicide.

683
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,929
Gosh. That makes no sense.

684
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,288
It makes perfect sense.

685
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:34,728
Then, how could the daughter
of Hong Mi Jin...

686
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:36,159
and the nephew of Oh Sung Sik
work together now?

687
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,720
It's hard to get over
that kind of past.

688
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,300
That's what puzzles me.

689
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,639
Did you think about it?

690
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:48,439
About what?

691
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:50,450
I told you to quit
working as a psychic.

692
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:55,820
I already gave you my answer.
That I won't quit.

693
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,459
Let's be honest. If I quit,
wouldn't that affect you the most?

694
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,319
I remember their memories
and absorb their habits.

695
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,040
I even help you bring back
your temperature.

696
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,729
You won't be able to find
a valuable partner like me again.

697
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,229
I'm not kidding.

698
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,800
I'm not kidding either.

699
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:20,280
To be honest, this job was tough.

700
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,340
But it was fun.

701
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,249
This was the first time
I felt rewarded...

702
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,550
for what I did.

703
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,950
I didn't know.

704
00:46:31,419 --> 00:46:34,260
But I think I can be
a good person too.

705
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,959
You are a good person.

706
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,630
So you should quit.

707
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:47,168
You weren't going to keep working...

708
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:49,340
as my psychic anyway
once your contract ended.

709
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:54,709
Who knows?

710
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:09,958
Hello.

711
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:12,130
What? Why are you here?

712
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,098
Until when will you waste your time?

713
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,130
- Go and deliver the food first.
- Okay. I'll go deliver it.

714
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:20,169
- I'll be back.
- What?

715
00:47:20,229 --> 00:47:22,139
Enjoy your meal. Enjoy.

716
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:32,280
He's working here now?

717
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,450
- It just happened.
- How?

718
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,050
Why do you keep asking me questions?
Am I on trial?

719
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,059
Come here.

720
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,490
What happened?

721
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,759
I thought she got news about her son
and went to a rural area.

722
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,299
That was a bust.
So she came back all disappointed.

723
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,139
And I guess he was in front of
the restaurant, looking all shabby.

724
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,069
So that must have reminded her
of her son.

725
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,269
Really?

726
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,439
- I don't feel good about this.
- Same here.

727
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,430
So the chairman let out the guys?

728
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:23,699
Yes. They raided
Oh In Bum's van, lodging,

729
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,828
and his house in the rural area.

730
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:27,199
We don't know what it is,

731
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,300
but he is looking for
something important. I'm sure of it.

732
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,269
Something important
for the chairman?

733
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,249
- Make sure to find out what it is.
- Okay.

734
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:41,019
Sir.

735
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:44,189
Are you making deliveries too?

736
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,260
To jump,

737
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,919
I must crouch down
no matter how embarrassing it is.

738
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:54,200
I am disgraced right now.

739
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:57,470
But I will find out the weakness...

740
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,569
of Oh In Bum and Hong Ji A
who are responsible for my disgrace.

741
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,240
And I will earn
the chairman's approval...

742
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,169
and go back to my position
with my head held high.

743
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,638
- Sun Nyu.
- Yes.

744
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:09,910
Pay for my food.

745
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:12,749
- Have a good night!
- Have a good night!

746
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,400
Help me.

747
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,300
Nothing really stood out.

748
00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:34,970
I just saw 2 adults and 2 kids
lying unconsciously.

749
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,149
(Oh Sung Sik)

750
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,379
(Had a 53-year-old mother
and a 7-year-old nephew)

751
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,319
His residence is unknown
ever since he moved out...

752
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,050
after he graduated high school.

753
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,748
It's not easy to track him down.

754
00:49:52,749 --> 00:49:55,030
(Born in Geonjeong-myeon, Haju,
South Gyeongsang Province)

755
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,268
Where are you going?
I bought us some treats.

756
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,569
I'm going to a rural area.
Don't come to work today.

757
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,509
Where? Let me come with you.

758
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,010
- We can eat this on our way there.
- It's a personal matter.

759
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,119
What?

760
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:29,719
Eat it as you drive there.

761
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,760
I thought of you, so I even
stood in line to get them for you.

762
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,599
Be careful when you drive.

763
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,090
It's good.

764
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,669
Is anyone home?

765
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,939
Is anyone home?

766
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,079
My goodness. I don't feel good.

767
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:29,749
Gosh.

768
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,590
Is anyone inside?

769
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,389
- Goodness.
- Ms. Jung Geum Ja?

770
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,559
Gosh.

771
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,130
Oh, my.

772
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,130
Goodness. I don't feel good.

773
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,880
Let's talk.

774
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,179
What took you so long?

775
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,150
- I couldn't reach you either.
- Pardon?

776
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,789
- Aren't you her guardian?
- No.

777
00:52:05,249 --> 00:52:06,919
I just happened to be...

778
00:52:08,689 --> 00:52:11,958
Wait. Ma'am. Where...
Where are you going?

779
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:13,630
Ma'am.

780
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:16,129
Gosh. You can't leave right now.

781
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,299
The cancer cells started to spread.
You're in critical condition.

782
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,029
Go to a big hospital now.

783
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,438
- I know that. Forget it.
- You must get...

784
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:22,939
My gosh. Ma'am.

785
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,939
(Dr. Kim's Clinic)

786
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,780
Ms. Jung.

787
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:37,820
I'll drive you home.
Please get in the car.

788
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,050
Buses are still running.

789
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,860
Do you even have a wallet?

790
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,999
Don't you have to call
your children?

791
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,209
They are all dead.

792
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,880
You're not in touch with
your grandson at all?

793
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,779
Why are you asking?

794
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,419
Did he take something of yours too?

795
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:12,949
Not exactly.

796
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,689
After he left home,

797
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,289
he's never called me.

798
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,109
Goodbye.

799
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:42,680
Where do you think you're going?
Eat before you go.

800
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,189
I'm fine.

801
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,490
Do I have enough rice?

802
00:53:47,419 --> 00:53:48,990
I'm not hungry.

803
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,769
- Do you want more rice?
- Yes.

804
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,579
Here.

805
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:18,049
It's late. You should stay over.

806
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,888
No, I'm leaving right away.

807
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:23,019
Anyway, why are you
looking for In Bum?

808
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,399
- What?
- You're here to look for him too.

809
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Aren't you?

810
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:35,300
Is your grandson named...

811
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,910
Oh In Bum?

812
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:17,340
(February 2014, Haju High School)

813
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:28,760
(Oh In Bum)

814
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,910
What are you hiding in a hurry?

815
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,979
Weren't you told
not to come to work today?

816
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,220
It became a habit now,
so I can't seem to sleep.

817
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:17,400
What are you doing?

818
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,109
I'm just going to look.

819
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,240
Am I not allowed to do that?

820
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:25,379
I told you to finish your contract,
then leave quietly.

821
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,879
Why are you dying to make me leave?

822
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,720
- Because I can't trust you.
- What about you?

823
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,349
Are you trustworthy?

824
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,189
You're back.

825
00:56:42,729 --> 00:56:44,829
You're here.
Didn't you enjoy the macaroons?

826
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:47,700
In Bum.

827
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,970
That kid from 20 years ago is...

828
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,939
you?

829
00:57:04,419 --> 00:57:05,490
Was it you?

830
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:11,530
Yes.

831
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:13,959
Tell me.

832
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,329
What happened on that day?

833
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,930
Tell me what caused...

834
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:21,199
my mother's death on that day.

835
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,340
- Tell me!
- How would I know?

836
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,840
I'm here to find that out too.

837
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,308
What?

838
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:31,479
What did your mother do to my uncle
on that day...

839
00:57:32,479 --> 00:57:34,380
to cause his death?

840
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,349
I wanted to know.

841
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,040
Do you want me to tell you why
Oh Sung Sik died?

842
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:46,160
Because you're a psychic.

843
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:54,200
If it hadn't been for you,
your uncle and my mother...

844
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:56,939
would be alive.

845
00:57:57,939 --> 00:57:59,369
No one would've died.

846
00:58:02,439 --> 00:58:03,939
The one who killed my mother is...

847
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,510
you.

848
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:51,129
SELL YOUR HAUNTED HOUSE

849
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,359
There are too many mysteries
surrounding my uncle's death.

850
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,359
But I do know that I can
no longer stay at Daebak Realty.

851
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,168
Maybe he tried to con us
by using his history.

852
00:58:58,169 --> 00:58:59,399
I'm sorry, Mom.

853
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,138
I didn't know he caused your death.

854
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:03,139
That jerk.

855
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,768
No, something is
definitely going on between them.

856
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:07,009
Someone was murdered
at the officetel I live in.

857
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,808
Please spare me.

858
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:10,409
I'll find you another psychic.

859
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,478
It's over, right?

860
00:59:11,479 --> 00:59:13,478
I cannot begin investigating
on pure speculation!

861
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:15,179
You don't have to believe
what I said about spirits.

862
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,478
But shouldn't you trust
what someone alive is saying?

863
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:18,719
- Ms. Hong!
- She's possessed.

864
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,550
Drop your knife and get up.
