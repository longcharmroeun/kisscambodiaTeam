00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:09,369
You're here. Didn't you enjoy the macaroons?

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,869
In Bum. That kid from 20 years ago is...

3
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:17,839
you?

4
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:22,879
Was it you?

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,148
Yes.

6
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:32,889
Tell me. What happened on that day?

7
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:35,029
Tell me what caused...

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,258
my mother's death on that day.

9
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,658
- Tell me! - How would I know?

10
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:42,628
I'm here to find that out too.

11
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,798
- What? - What did your mother do...

12
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:47,039
to my uncle on that day...

13
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,309
to cause his death? I wanted to know.

14
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,908
Are you suggesting that Oh Sung Sik died because of my mom?

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,118
He was the one who attacked her on that day.

16
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:59,578
Your uncle took his own life.

17
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:03,389
He couldn't deal with the guilt after murdering someone.

18
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,089
You can't just claim whatever you want.

19
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,059
Do you want me to tell you why Oh Sung Sik died?

20
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:09,389
Because you're a psychic.

21
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,999
If it hadn't been for you, your uncle and my mother...

22
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:15,729
would be alive.

23
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:18,139
No one would've died.

24
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:22,669
The one who killed my mother is...

25
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,178
you.

26
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:36,089
That's enough, you two.

27
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,699
Get out.

28
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:48,699
I never want to see you again.

29
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:05,919

31
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:16,228
The one who killed my mother is...

32
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:17,658
you.

33
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,008
Did you already know about it?

34
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:36,508
I found out a few hours ago.

35
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,519
I received a call from Mr. Jung...

36
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,688
and was shocked.

37
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:45,858
Maybe he tried to con us by using his history.

38
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,188
He was the first person.

39
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,818
It must've been tough.

40
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:18,959
I've only done it once, and it's already unbearable.

41
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,529
But you've been doing this singlehandedly for that long.

42
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:28,168
He could truly empathize with me...

43
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:30,739
about this painful ordeal I've been going through.

44
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:36,568
The mere thought of knowing that I wasn't alone in this...

45
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,149
gave me a great sense of comfort.

46
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:45,918
I even felt sorry toward him.

47
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:49,688
What a scumbag.

48
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,228
I'm sorry, Mom.

49
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,938
I didn't know he caused your death.

50
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:10,538
I worked with him...

51
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:15,879
and even thought that he was a decent guy.

52
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,358
I'm sorry for being so stupid.

53
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:34,998
Now,

54
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:39,368
I have no idea...

55
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,209
what I should do.

56
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:22,449
Uncle.

57
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:27,149
I don't know anything anymore.

58
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,889
Were you truly an evil person?

59
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:35,158
Or...

60
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,728
was I the root...

61
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:41,498
of everything?

What have you gotten yourself into?

66
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:25,538
Nothing.

67
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:28,748
Some men turned this place upside down.

68
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:30,219
They were looking for something.

69
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:33,689
What was it?

70
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,748

Here's your food.

75
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:36,368
I had some leftover fried shrimp, so I put them in as well.

No, it's going up.

- Darn it. - Hello.

81
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:05,238
Oh, you're from Unit 602. You're late.

82
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:07,008
Has anyone rented out the unit yet?

83
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:09,439
We only recently put it on sale.

84
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,478
Can you just give me back my deposit?

85
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:13,608
I'm too terrified.

86
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:16,409
- Last night... - Talking about spirits again?

87
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:20,819
You're a grown woman. Why are you so scared of them?

88
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,659
But someone died there.

89
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:25,819
I'm not the murderer.

90
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,189
If you're that terrified, come home early.

91
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:30,459

92

95
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:49,449

00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,018
How long have you been down here?

144
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:45,978
What time is it now?

145
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,518
Did you even eat?

146
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:09,138
I thought you weren't hungry.

147
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:11,579
I didn't eat anything for two days. Of course, I'm hungry.

148

Once I found that kid, I thought...

151
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,549
I would be able to find out what happened that day.

152
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:23,919
But he remembered less than me.

153
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,628
So no matter how much I think about this, books are my answer.

154
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:31,528
The saying, "Knowledge is power," must come from somewhere.

155
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,858
So did knowledge yield any fruit?

156
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,069
There are way too many books.

157
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:37,028
My ancestors' Record of Exorcism is way too extensive.

158
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,868
And there are way too many ancient texts.

159
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,809
They should have at least written it in Korean...

160
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:43,569
once the Korean alphabet was invented.

161
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:44,878
Everything was written in Chinese.

162
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:47,039
Do you know what's more frustrating? The prepositions are in Korean.

163
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,648
At a glance, I feel like I could make sense of it.

164
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:51,819
Gosh. This is just torture. Seriously.

165
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,819
Why do you think my battery died?

166
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:56,049
I used up all my battery, looking up Chinese letters.

167
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:57,988
My gosh, I looked and looked,

168
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:00,018
but I can't find anything on that egg ghost.

169
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:02,758
Did they use a different name back then?

170
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:04,329
Please eat.

00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:10,469

So I prepared a flower that resembles your beauty.

No.

187
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,628
Hello. I'm Heo Ji Chul.

188
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,969
Gosh.

189
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,498
What should I say to her? This is driving me crazy.

190
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:53,939
What should I say?

191
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,969
Ji Chul?

192
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,238
Hello.

193
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,048
They went like, "Chief Heo."

194
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:10,859
They were trying to stop me. "No, Chief Heo."

195
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,859
And they were laughing like this.

196
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,328
When I was saying hello, he just went like this.

197
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:21,828
So I went like this.

198
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:24,469
After that, no one laughed!

199
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,939
And then, it got all quiet.

200
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,119
My story is boring, isn't it?

201
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:45,288
- No. - Should we get going then?

202
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,369

You've seen the spirit yourself?

214
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,919
Yes. A month ago, someone was murdered...

215
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:52,588
in the building I live in now.

216
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:56,129
The spirit of the deceased keeps showing up and is torturing me.

217
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:57,629
Did you know the deceased?

218
00:18:58,629 --> 00:18:59,899
No.

222
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,308
Is it broken?

223
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:16,949
What? She's drunk.

224

Are you in college?

233
00:19:55,588 --> 00:19:57,588
She was pretty famous in the building.

234
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,518
Her hairstyle and outfits always stood out.

235
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:02,258
People saw guys carrying her home because she was drunk.

236
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:03,929
Did you kill her?

237
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:08,199
- Pardon? - If you saw her only a few times,

238
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,099
why would she want to bother you?

239
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,109
She's asking if you know anything about the murder.

240
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:20,179
I was...

241
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:23,349
the last person to see her.

Soo Jung, are you sure...

243
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,619
you didn't see the guy's face in the elevator?

244
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:29,649
Or did you notice any unusual?

245
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:33,189
No. He was wearing a mask and a hat too.

246
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,988
I really thought they knew each other.

247
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:38,399
This is frustrating.

248
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:41,268
Please help me. I have no place to go.

249

I can't keep staying with my friend.

250
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,238
We must check if the house is indeed haunted first,

251
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:46,939
so you must wait.

252
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,338
I'm telling you that it is.

253
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:49,909
I've seen her several times.

254
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,578
You might be mistaken.

255
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,849
You didn't tell them I referred them to you, right?

256
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,219
No.

257
00:21:02,488 --> 00:21:05,558
But she can't get rid of the spirit right away.

258
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:07,189
She must check first.

259
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:10,129
I see. That's called a preliminary inspection.

260
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:12,659
She must check if there is an unrested spirit at the house.

261
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:14,768
If Ms. Hong said she'd do a preliminary inspection,

262
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:16,669
she's going to take your case.

263
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:19,199
- Really? - Of course.

264
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,609
- You trust me. Don't you? - Yes.

265
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:25,439
But why can't I tell them that you referred them to me?

266

Well,

268

I don't know how to explain this to you.

You should try some of it. You lost a lot of weight.

commit suicide?

Who said that? He didn't kill himself.

You might believe that because you are his mother,

280
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:20,258
but the world thinks otherwise.

281
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:22,169
The police already closed the case.

282
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:23,828
- And there's also evidence. - Evidence?

00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:31,909
This is proof.

The fire that broke out on November 15 in Yongnam Village...

288
00:23:10,578 --> 00:23:12,449
was a deliberate act of arson I committed.

289

After the announcement of unexpected redevelopment,

290
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,219
I couldn't stand the thought of how I'll be kicked out...

from my house into the street without reasonable compensation.

292

319
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,498
was killed in the underground parking lot.

320

Since then, people have been seeing an unrested spirit in this building.

321
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:14,439
It's also unfortunate because she made a police report...

322
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:17,469
saying she saw a suspicious man lurking around the building...

323
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:19,578
and also said she feels the security is too lax,

324
00:25:19,578 --> 00:25:20,679

The CCTV near the elevator is the only camera that caught him.

327

But it only got the top of his head.

328

You're right.

332
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,978
Does she think she died in Bae Soo Jung's place?

333
00:25:56,978 --> 00:25:59,379
Is that why she holds a grudge?

334
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:00,978

339

We would've caught the culprit already...

340

only if the CCTV worked on that day.

341
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:40,488

367
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:41,298
She was just talking to a ghost, right?

368
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:43,508
Is that what it looked like to you?

369
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:47,409
I thought she was talking nonsense in the middle of the air.

370
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:51,719
Look at my goosebumps. This is real.

371
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:57,588
(Land, Private Properties, Commercial Buildings, Rent)

372
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:23,722
What do you have to tell me?

373
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:30,031
On the day I first came here,

374
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:33,101
I remembered something I had forgotten all my life,

375
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,272
the memories I have of this place.

376
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:40,241
Die. Die!

377
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:42,241
Uncle.

378
00:30:48,752 --> 00:30:50,151
To this day,

379
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:53,822
I lived my life without any idea...

380
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:55,951
why my uncle had to die so suddenly.

381
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,222
But on that day, it felt like I finally had a lead.

382
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,231
I thought everything would become clear...

383
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,562
once I found out what exactly happened here...

384
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:07,731
on that night 20 years ago.

385
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:12,642
Hey! Are you okay?

386
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:14,642
- Gosh! You're bleeding? - Aren't you Jung Hoon?

387
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:16,271
Why am I here?

388
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:18,312
Are you crazy? Did you do that?

389
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:20,612
You little punk. Why did you do something so dangerous?

390
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,681
Gosh, look at him.

391
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,152
Grandma.

392
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:36,092
(Our houses may be deprived, but not us!)

393
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:47,402
Uncle, I really...

394
00:31:47,402 --> 00:31:48,472
I know.

395
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,711
It's okay.

396
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:59,581
I know very well that you didn't do that, In Bum.

397
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:03,791
I believe you.

398
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:07,691
He was the only person who was on my side.

399
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:10,331
I must've wanted to have the same amount of trust in him...

400
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:11,931
as he did for me.

401
00:32:13,461 --> 00:32:15,972
Perhaps, that was why I couldn't accept the fact...

402
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,441
that he had taken so many lives...

403
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,812
and committed suicide.

404
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:25,212
Is that it?

405
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,511
Is that why you came here?

406
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:33,951
I wanted to sincerely apologize.

407
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:37,092
Had we never come here that day,

408
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,161
your mother would've still been alive.

409
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:46,161
I'm truly sorry.

410
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:49,802
I'm also sorry...

411
00:32:50,832 --> 00:32:51,842
for deceiving you.

412
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:04,821
Okay.

413
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:24,671
Are you going to stop looking into your uncle's death?

414
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:26,171
No.

415
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:30,041
There are still too many unanswered questions.

416
00:33:30,212 --> 00:33:31,242
Then what will you do?

417
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,212
I'll have to think about that.

418
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:36,212
But one thing for sure is that...

419
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:38,752
I can no longer stay at Daebak Realty.

420
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:41,851
Right.

421
00:33:42,622 --> 00:33:45,191
Does this mean we'll continue to scam people?

422
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,032
Let's look for something legitimate to do.

423
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:53,332
We should also move out.

424
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:55,631
No! We're not moving.

425
00:33:56,131 --> 00:33:58,101
- Why not? - Soo Jung is Ms. Hong's client...

426
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,571
right now.

427
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,641
What?

428
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:08,552
Assemblyman Han.

429
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,522
Thanks to your help in the Bangso-dong's redevelopment,

430
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:14,552
I truly feel so reassured.

431
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:16,092
I will do my best...

432
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:19,821
to make your future rosy.

433
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:26,062
I'm not here today to be flattered by you.

434
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:28,072
- Sorry? - I heard...

435
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:30,902
that there are still many residents who are refusing to move out.

436
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:33,041
Oh, that?

437
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,642
There aren't that many anymore.

438
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:39,481
It'll all get sorted out soon. Don't you worry about that.

439
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:41,142
What if there's a change in the market?

440
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:43,981
They can easily withdraw their permission...

441
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:45,981
on the redevelopment.

442
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:49,152
I don't want to suffer because of your mistakes.

443
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:51,092
Get this over with before the election.

444
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:54,262
In the past, you were lucky enough...

445
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:57,692
to hit the jackpot in these redevelopment cases.

446
00:35:00,202 --> 00:35:03,871
I guess your luck has run out.

447
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:11,741
(Daebak Realty)

448
00:35:11,782 --> 00:35:13,111
(Lee Hyun Ju)

449
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,251
The parking lot will be blocked off, right?

450
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:17,551
Yes, I've already talked with the landlord.

451
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:19,481
When is In Bum arriving?

452
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,121
Did you mean Hyung Sik?

453
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,462
He should be here soon.

454
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:29,192
- Hello. - Hey.

455
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:31,192
Hyung Sik!

456
00:35:31,702 --> 00:35:33,702
- Long time, no see. - Likewise.

457
00:35:34,462 --> 00:35:36,202
In Bum, get the salt...

458
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:38,501
Sorry?

459
00:35:42,311 --> 00:35:44,572
Make sure you pack plenty of salt.

460
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:47,181
This unrested spirit won't be easy.

461
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:52,022
Okay.

462
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:18,442
Hey. I'm home.

463
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:20,481
Don't be sorry.

464
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,851
Your parents came all of a sudden. I understand.

465
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,251
I'm grateful that you allowed me to stay there until now.

466
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:30,051
Okay. Good luck with your studies.

467
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:32,491
Hello?

468
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:34,262

Hello?

470
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:30,442
Now.

471
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:11,072
I apologize for the long wait.

472
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:13,501
That wench got in my way that night,

473
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:14,901
so I couldn't come to you.

474
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:18,141
Finally. It's just the two of us here.

475
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:21,582
Darn it.

476
00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:31,792
You... Darn it.

477
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:33,962
What?

478
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:09,932
Why...

479
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:35,222
Stop it now.

480
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,751
Don't move.

481
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:41,562
Drop your dagger and get up.

482
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,761
I don't have time for that.

483
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:46,062
Hey.

484
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:27,901
Who are you to come between me and Soo Jung?

485
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:58,761
Drop it and get on your feet.

486
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:00,501
The next shot is for real.

487
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,781
Hey. Are you okay?

488
00:45:13,781 --> 00:45:14,781
What?

489
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:22,751
We're the police.

490
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:25,361
Hey, get up. Get up.

491
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:27,822
My goodness.

492
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:28,962
Gosh.

493
00:45:37,432 --> 00:45:39,072
Trespass?

494
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:41,842
That's a misunderstanding. I'm really innocent.

495
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:43,442
Then, why were you there?

496
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:46,682
I went there to see Soo Jung.

497
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,241
"Soo Jung?"

498
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,491
What about you? Why did you go there?

499
00:45:56,592 --> 00:45:58,662
Bae Soo Jung is my client.

500
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:02,391
Are you saying that you are her muscle?

501
00:46:04,592 --> 00:46:07,462
Ms. Bae, is she telling the truth?

502
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,842
Of course, she should be here too.

503
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:20,111
That's the guy.

504
00:46:20,712 --> 00:46:21,812
Pardon?

505
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:25,281
- What did you say? - The guy...

506
00:46:25,722 --> 00:46:28,322
who killed the lady from Unit 702 in the parking lot.

507
00:46:29,692 --> 00:46:31,292
He's the guy.

508
00:46:32,962 --> 00:46:34,592
Are you telling me...

509
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:37,692
that he's the culprit of the parking lot murder case?

510
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,662
Gosh. Goodness.

511
00:46:41,062 --> 00:46:43,531
When I questioned you, you said you couldn't see...

512
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:45,001
his face because of the mask and the hat.

513
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:48,672
When you questioned me, I wasn't sure if it was him.

514
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:51,442
But I am certain now.

515
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:54,011
Why are you doing this to me?

516
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,312
- Sit down! - Sit.

517
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,781
Did I upset you in any way?

518
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:58,851
Sit. Sit down.

519
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:05,192
Let's separate the victim and the attacker first.

520
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:06,962
"Attacker?"

521
00:47:07,822 --> 00:47:09,761
I'm really innocent. I really am.

(Trustworthy Police)

523
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:20,702
Wait outside.

524
00:47:24,912 --> 00:47:26,481
Don't worry.

525
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:29,551
I'm going to wait right by the door until the questioning is over.

526
00:47:43,392 --> 00:47:46,031
Why would I want to harm Soo Jung?

527
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:48,801
You must've been close to Ms. Bae.

528
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:55,912
Actually, we are dating.

529
00:47:57,212 --> 00:47:58,541
What?

530
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:01,311
She told me her passcode, so I could enter when I wanted to.

531
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,811
I had never told him my passcode.

532
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:05,112
What?

533
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:08,182
Soo Jung comes to my restaurant practically every day.

534
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:09,991
Naturally, we became close.

535
00:48:09,991 --> 00:48:11,692
- I see. - I treated her like my sister.

536
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:14,222
And she treated me like her brother.

537
00:48:14,222 --> 00:48:16,432
Sir, aren't you married?

538
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:21,331
Right.

539
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:26,602
So I went there today to break things off with her.

540
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,442
But Soo Jung couldn't accept it.

541
00:48:32,311 --> 00:48:33,912
It's all my fault.

542
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:36,011
I understand why she was upset.

543
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:39,081
Ridiculous.

A real estate agency that performs exorcisms.

545
00:48:50,392 --> 00:48:52,831
Okay. Let's sum it up.

546
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:54,902
With Ms. Bae's request,

547
00:48:56,331 --> 00:48:58,132
you went to send off the spirit at the parking lot.

548
00:48:58,132 --> 00:48:59,271
You went to the parking lot,

549
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:01,241
burned the incense, scattered some salt,

550
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,612
entered Ms. Bae's house, and made a mess.

551
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:06,781
You did all of these to get rid of the spirit?

552
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,452
Fine. Did you get rid of the spirit?

553
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:19,561
I don't remember anything.

554
00:49:19,662 --> 00:49:21,962
Psychics can't remember what happens when they're possessed.

555
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:23,862
Unbelievable. Do you think this is a joke?

556
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:26,001
You'd better answer my questions!

557
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,801
You'd better do your job right.

558
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:28,831
What?

559
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,301
If you watched the elevator security footage...

560
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,001
of the day the murder happened, you would've figured out...

561
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:36,311
that Bae Soo Jung was the culprit's initial target.

562
00:49:36,771 --> 00:49:39,382
But Lee Hyun Ju who got off the elevator...

563
00:49:39,382 --> 00:49:41,011
got on the elevator again.

564
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,712
When his plan went south, he changed his target.

565
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:45,382
The culprit...

566
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,222
was extremely enraged against Lee Hyun Ju...

567
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:50,692
for messing up the dream he had for a very long time.

568
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:52,392
So the murder became a revenge killing.

569
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:56,462
He murdered her at the blind spot he spotted before the act.

570
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:00,462
Let go.

571
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:07,672
But Lee Hyun Ju didn't make it easy for him.

572
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:22,591
There was a struggle.

573
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:28,722
The culprit was severely injured that his shoulder was dislocated.

574
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,902
So the spirit told you everything?

575
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,841
You have a wild imagination.

576
00:50:39,902 --> 00:50:42,142
You don't have to believe what the spirit said.

577
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:44,672
But you must believe what I am telling you.

578
00:50:44,672 --> 00:50:47,811
Not every stalker becomes a murderer.

579
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,882
I can't investigate someone just based on suspicions...

580
00:50:51,011 --> 00:50:53,781
and treat him like a suspect. Okay?

581
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:57,051
I can't do that even if you might be right about this.

582
00:50:57,051 --> 00:50:59,321
I must follow a proper protocol to confirm my findings.

583
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,291
What's this?

584
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,061

Soo Jung, are you all right?

587
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:27,222
Are you two acquainted?

588
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:28,852
She's his girlfriend.

589
00:51:29,091 --> 00:51:30,991
I only found out after Chief Heo called.

590
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,761
I thought you wouldn't do it if I asked you to.

591
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,422
I'm sorry.

592
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,892
Let's go, Soo Jung.

593
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:03,892
Why does he get to leave?

594
00:52:04,051 --> 00:52:05,692
He broke in and entered,

595
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:07,892
but this was his first offense, and there was no damage.

596
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:09,862
Aren't first offenses also crimes?

597
00:52:10,892 --> 00:52:13,162
How much more damage does she have to suffer?

598
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:20,902
Let's go.

599
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:23,112
Ji A.

600
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:25,841
"Ji A?"

601
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,051
Are you sure you can let Ma Kang Tae go?

602
00:52:30,311 --> 00:52:32,182
What else could we do?

603
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:34,452
When you saw the footage from the elevator,

604
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:37,491
you also said it looks like Lee Hyun Ju died instead of her.

605
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:41,261
And since Ma Kang Tae is Bae Soo Jung's stalker,

606
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:43,462
it makes perfect sense.

607
00:52:43,462 --> 00:52:46,261
There's no evidence. Nothing.

608
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:48,132
We have Ms. Hong from Daebak Realty as a witness.

609
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:52,202
How are we going to tell anyone that she heard it from a ghost?

610
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,011
This is driving me crazy too.

611
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:06,452
What happened?

612
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:11,551
Soo Jung was so shocked that she won't even look at me.

613
00:53:11,952 --> 00:53:13,692
It's all because of that jerk.

614
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:16,991
What about the exorcism?

615
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:19,301
Is Ms. Hong all right? Is she hurt?

616
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:21,202
She's fine, of course.

617
00:53:21,662 --> 00:53:23,132
But Soo Jung is really...

618
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:25,231
It must've been freezing without me.

619
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,672
What are you doing?

620
00:53:31,912 --> 00:53:33,011
What do you mean?

621
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:34,581
If you're going to be like this, go work as her psychic again...

622
00:53:34,581 --> 00:53:36,182
instead of pestering me!

623
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:39,152
My head is already filled with what happened to Soo Jung.

624
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:53,602
Why won't you read my messages? You're making me worried.

625
00:53:56,331 --> 00:53:58,102
It'd be okay to pop in and see her,

626
00:53:58,672 --> 00:53:59,702
right?

627
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:03,412
No, I'm overreacting.

(Changhwa Restaurant)

630
00:54:10,952 --> 00:54:13,551
You came out here worried about Ms. Hong again.

631
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:17,722
What are you saying? I came out to get some air.

632
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:20,091
What are you so worried about?

633
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:22,162
She looked completely fine to me.

634
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:24,432
She was brutally murdered.

635
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,031
It's unbearable when you get memories like that.

636
00:54:27,662 --> 00:54:30,602
Don't you remember what happened after that water ghost?

637
00:54:33,172 --> 00:54:35,442
Yes, right. I remember.

638
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:39,071
I thought the worst might happen and got really scared.

639
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:40,382
I was scared too.

640
00:54:40,942 --> 00:54:42,652
Scared I might kill that murderer.

641
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,952
Hey, Ms. Hong.

642
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:48,551
Is Soo Jung...

643
00:54:58,432 --> 00:55:00,331
Is she still angry at you?

644
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,872
No, that's the aftermath of a ghost's possession.

Are you sure you won't give up?

662
00:59:27,962 --> 00:59:30,672
Is it because Oh Sung Sik is In Bum's uncle?

663
00:59:30,672 --> 00:59:33,271
You wanted to know the truth no matter how gruesome it is, right?
