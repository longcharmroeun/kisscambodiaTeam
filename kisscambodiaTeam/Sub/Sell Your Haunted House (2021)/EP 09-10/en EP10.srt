What are you two doing here?

3
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,142
I can explain. What happened is...

4
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:35,602
Gosh, my back hurts.

5
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:38,302
So why did you follow me?

6
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:41,849
Are you saying I got beaten
because I did something wrong?

7
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:42,978
You went out...

8
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,888
in the middle of the night
looking like you could kill someone.

9
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,019
How can I not follow you?

10
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:48,659
That idea popped into my head.

11
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:50,142
See?

12
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:54,783
But I have enough self-control.

13
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,923
"Self-control?"

14
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:01,799
Throwing anyone you come
across isn't called self-control.

15
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:04,939
My gosh. Even when you are
possessed by an unrested spirit,

16
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:07,203
you're still your violent self.

17
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,662
You could've woken me
up before I threw you down.

18
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:12,033
You said you've been
watching from the start.

19
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:15,002
That's because...

20
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:22,958
Gosh, forget it.

21
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:24,228
Who's the one that went out...

22
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,653
without any precautions as
soon as the exorcism was over?

23
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:28,798
I haven't had to deal with the
habit of an unrested spirit for a while,

24
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:30,129
so I just let my guard down.

25
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:32,722
You kept nagging at me
saying I need to make sure...

26
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,499
I stay stuck at home.

27
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:35,768
That's enough.

28
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:38,069
If it weren't for me, the guard
would've called the police.

29
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,093
Hey!

30
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:45,933

00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:12,093
I forgot to give it back to you.

35
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,108
I had the same exact necklace...

36
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,072
since when I was a kid.

37
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,713
I lived my life thinking
I got it from my uncle.

38
00:03:26,843 --> 00:03:28,159
But come to think about it,

39
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:31,683
I think it must've been your mother.

40
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:36,999
I still have no idea...

41
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:38,553
what happened 20 years ago.

42
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,993
But I could live an
ordinary life to this day...

43
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:44,993
all thanks to that necklace.

44
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,903
It's belated, but I wanted to say...

45
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,262
thank you.

46
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:56,273
To be honest, I also don't
know exactly what happened...

47
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:57,743
twenty years ago.

48
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:01,912
My memories aren't
complete, just like yours.

49
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,358
That's why I had to find you.

50
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:09,023
If I could find you and learn
what exactly happened on that day,

51
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:13,123
I thought I could find a
way to send my mom away.

52
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:19,263
We were both after the same thing.

53
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,932
I got too worked up...

54
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,073
and said things I
shouldn't have said to you.

- No, I can't. - Why not?

I have a little something
called a private life.

79

- What about me? - She asked you.

80

someone who's closer to her age.

crying out to me for help.

107
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:12,333
She asked for help. She
asked me to save her.

108
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,932
But I was too scared.

109
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:20,872
I got too scared and
pretended like I didn't know.

110
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,773
I told myself I saw something wrong.

111
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,343
I told myself that they knew each other,

112
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:29,812

She died because of me!

118
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:45,633
She'll follow me
around until the day I die.

she died trying to save you?

got back on the elevator...

because she couldn't let
you be alone with him.

It won't be easy to do anything
bad if there were two of you.

She also came before
you as an unrested spirit...

126
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,052
because she knew Ma
Kwang Tae would come back.

wasn't just a random woman
who was killed in the parking lot...

an audience for the first time.

00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,113
"M" for Ma Kwang Tae.

183
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,329
- Here. - Thank you.

184
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:37,383
My pleasure.

185
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:41,223
(Lunchbox)

186
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,802
What has the chairman been up to?

187
00:13:57,643 --> 00:13:58,873
You punk.

188
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,983
Eat up. It's on me.

189
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,138
You scumbag.

190
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:18,233
Don't be frightened.
We're not here to hurt you.

191
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:20,239
I'm telling you.

192
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:23,808
A spirit really resides at Daebak Realty.

193
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:24,873
To make matters worse,

194
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:26,979
it's Ms. Hong's mother.

195
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:29,503
That's nothing new.

196
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:33,212
Did you find out anything else?

197
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,359
Well... I do.

198
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:37,952
Of course, I do.

199
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:42,322
The mechanism of the exorcism.

200
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:43,623
It's quite simple.

201
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:45,298
She summons the spirit by lighting incense.

202
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:46,869
Then the psychic becomes
possessed by the spirit.

203
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:49,962
Lastly, she stabs the psychic. Game over.

204
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:52,662
Game over?

205
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,678
That's it?

206
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,778
Look at you guys.

207
00:14:57,802 --> 00:14:59,849
What is this? It's that simple?

208
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,243
"Simple"? Not at all.

209
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:03,903
It's extremely dangerous.

210
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:06,542
It is?

211
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:08,582
They risk their lives every time.

212
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:10,723
That's why a preliminary
inspection is a must.

213
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:12,229
A preliminary inspection?

214
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:13,388
Yes, that's right.

215
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,558
It's something they do
before the official exorcism.

216
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,223
It's like a rehearsal.

217
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:21,562
Late at night, they go
to the haunted house.

218
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:24,509
Ms. Hong and Oh In Bum.

219
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:27,609
Just them two. Gosh, it's just them.

220
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:28,702
On top of that,

221
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:33,373
this is an extremely
terrifying and dangerous task.

222
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,473
Just them two?

223
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:40,873
(From sunset to sunrise)

224
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:47,922
Ji A.

225
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,898
Are you leaving?

226
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:53,653
Can you do me a favor?

227
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:57,763
No.

228
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,110
We must.

229
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:01,839
Let's just leave this to the police.

230
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:04,733
The police won't believe me
until they have firm evidence.

231
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:06,808
We must catch him red-handed.

232
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,572
You're talking about a murderer.

233
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,942
No. I won't allow it.

234
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,473
I'm terrified too.

235
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,619
But I must do this.

236
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,788
But still, luring him
yourself is just too dangerous.

237
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,422
I can't let him roam around freely.

238
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:26,753
Sooner or later, there
will be other victims.

239
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:30,493
And some of them will be murdered as well.

240
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:32,993
My gosh.

241
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:37,202
Ms. Hong, say something.

242
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:43,302
Are you sure you won't regret this?

243
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:47,883
Yes, I am.

244
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,753
Set up the cameras as soon as you can.

245
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:52,883
Ms. Hong.

246
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:55,822
Thank you, Ji A.

247
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,102
Is this because of the
memory you've absorbed?

248
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:12,632
Once the exorcisms were over,
you never took part in anything.

249
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,602
It's because of Bae Soo Jung.

250
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:16,372
Sorry?

251
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,219
Has she grown on you already?

252
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:23,243
We need to catch Ma Kwang Tae...

253
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:27,483
for her to be free of guilt
and live her life to the fullest.

254
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:31,993
I know very well how it
feels to be tormented by guilt...

255
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,092
all your life.

256
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,193
She still has...

257
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,263
a chance.

258
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,743
(Lunchbox)

259
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,399
You have nothing to do here.

260
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:41,122
Just go back to your office.

261
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:44,832
You're much more shameless than I thought.

262
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,663
I didn't expect you to return.

263
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:50,578
I have nothing to hide anymore.

264
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:51,973
That's why I came back.

265
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:53,973
Haven't you heard?

266
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,642
Ms. Hong and I reconciled.

267
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:02,112
She gave this necklace back to me.

268
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,042
She wanted me to have it.

269
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:10,753
What?

270
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:14,292
Chief Heo, Ma Kwang
Tae has entered the lobby.

(Out on Delivery)

272
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,882
Why are you doing this?

273
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,788
Be quiet.

274
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:50,152
You and I aren't dating.

275
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,628
You snuck in here with the
passcode you secretly found out.

276
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,523
Soo Jung. I'm sure you'll like it too.

277
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,463
Why won't you just do what I say?

278
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,209
Do you want to end up
dead just like that wench?

279
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,342
Is that why you killed Lee Hyun Ju?

280
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,542
Yes.

281
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:15,812
I really hate women who don't listen to me.

282
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:20,683
I also hate men who don't listen to me.

283
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:26,822
Are you okay?

284
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,802
Oh, my gosh!

285
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:37,862
Be careful!

286
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,842
That scumbag! Oh, my gosh.

287
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:47,612
Hello. There's a trespasser.

288
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:49,983
He has a knife too. Please hurry.

289
00:22:24,983 --> 00:22:26,352
Ma Kwang Tae!

290
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,263
Hello? Is this 911?

291
00:23:44,362 --> 00:23:45,533
Ms. Hong.

292
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:58,173

294
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:23,622
What a lowlife.

295
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,493
Are you okay?

296
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:57,663
Who on earth are you guys?

297
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:03,703
Why won't you just do what I say?

298
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:06,402
Do you want to end up
dead just like that wench?

299
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,348
Is that why you killed Lee Hyun Ju?

300
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:09,402
Yes.

301
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:13,042
I really hate women who don't listen to me.

302
00:26:20,183 --> 00:26:22,453
Everything looks good.
You guys can go home now.

303
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,122
What?

304
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,929
But a man died. We can't let them go.

305
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,163
No, they can go. He died in a car accident.

306
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:34,632
I'll call you if I need
to question you again.

307
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:38,503
Let's go.

308
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,348
But still. I don't think we
should just release them.

309
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:45,642
No, they can leave.

310
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:48,173
I witnessed the scene myself.

311
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:50,882
And we got the murder weapon as well.

312
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:55,253
Let's wait until we get
the report from the NFS.

and forget everything.

Well, Soo Jung.

00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:41,533
Can I drop you off at your friend's house?

319
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,663
No. You must feel uncomfortable in my car.

320
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,533
No, Ji Chul. I would appreciate it.

321
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:49,743
Thank you. I mean it.

322
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,302
Are you sure?

323
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,382
Let's go.

324
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:10,763
- I'll drop you off. - Sure.

(Daebak Realty)

326
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:42,759
We aren't open...

327
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:45,929
The door was opened.

328
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:52,239
We found Lee Hyun Ju's DNA on Ma Kwang Tae's knife.

329
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:54,438
And on his computer,

330
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:57,138
we found many videos and photos he took of Bae Soo Jung...

331
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:59,208
and many other women illegally.

332
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:00,679
That's great news.

333
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:03,418
I thought I should let you know what happened.

334
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:04,749
All right.

335
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:07,289
Is that all you came to say?

336
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:10,018
To be honest, there's something I'd like to ask.

337
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:16,099
This is something Ms. Hong drew in the interrogation room.

338
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:20,529
And...

339
00:29:22,698 --> 00:29:25,368
this is the knife Ma Kwang Tae used to kill Lee Hyun Ju.

340
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:27,978
Only the culprit and the victim would know the mark on the knife.

341
00:29:28,478 --> 00:29:30,908
How did Ms. Hong know that so accurately?

342
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:32,649
I'm sure she already explained herself...

343
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:35,118
when she drew you this picture.

344
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:37,278
Can she really see...

345
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:40,289
the memories of a spirit through an exorcism ritual?

346
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,858
I still find it hard to believe.

347
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:50,828
You always believe only the things you can see.

348
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,269
Why did you kill them?

349
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:54,468
I didn't want them to become burdens.

350
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:57,739
Isn't it obvious?

351
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,009
Was there something I wasn't aware of then?

352
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:10,049
There is a karmic connection to everything.

353
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,759
I'll take that.

354
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:25,599
Okay.

00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:35,539

There are way too many bad people in this world.

359
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:49,289
To this day, I lived my life just hoping...

360
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:50,759
I'd never run into one.

361
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,728
But no matter how careful I am, I can always come across one.

362
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,798
So I decided to just catch them myself.

363
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:01,398
Gosh, Soo Jung. You're so cool.

364
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,668
Why do I see Ms. Hong in her?

365
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:12,048
You're going to perform an exorcism on Oh Sung Sik's spirit?

366
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:14,879
All of a sudden? What are you talking about?

367
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:18,749
It's not a sudden decision. I gave this a lot of thought.

368
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:24,358
In order to find out what happened 20 years ago,

369
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:26,529
I have to look into his memory.

370
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:30,898
You don't even know if he has memories of that day.

371
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:32,469
I never know until I give it a try.

372
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:33,728
You can't do that.

373
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:37,539
It's too dangerous.

374
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,369
Did you forget what happened last time?

375
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:43,138
When Oh Sung Sik possessed In Bum, he broke Do Hak Sung's arm.

376
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:46,779
What will you do if he ends up killing him?

377
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,219
I'll stop him so that it doesn't happen.

378
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,319
Is it because Oh Sung Sik is In Bum's uncle?

379
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:57,589
Ms. Hong.

380
00:31:57,928 --> 00:32:00,988
In Bum doesn't know his uncle is still here as an unrested spirit.

381
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:04,698
It might be better for him to live his life not knowing it.

382
00:32:04,698 --> 00:32:06,129
Do you really think so?

383
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:11,238
If you live obliviously to the truth that's out there,

384
00:32:12,768 --> 00:32:14,409
do you think that'll be it?

385
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:21,078
And it's not only because of In Bum.

386
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:24,448
I also had this thought after I met Bae Soo Jung.

387
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:27,388
That 20-year-old girl...

388
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:31,488
risked her life to catch that murderer.

389
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:34,089
But...

390
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,798
even though I said I wanted to let my mom go,

391
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:41,369
I never did anything about it.

392
00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:45,138
What do you mean, you didn't do anything?

393
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:48,239
You've done everything you could, but it simply didn't work out.

394
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:50,609
Once we find a suitable psychic...

395
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:52,809
We've never done an exorcism on Oh Sung Sik.

396
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,848
You've changed.

397
00:33:00,518 --> 00:33:03,119
I made myself clear and said you shouldn't do it.

398
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:05,658
If you really want to do this,

399
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,129
you'll need to fire me first.

400
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:20,968
This is driving me crazy.

401
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:27,208
I get what Ms. Ju is worried about,

402
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:33,788
but I need to do it.

403
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:36,088
This is the only way.

404
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:42,929
The problem is if I'm going to tell In Bum or not.

405
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:49,268
What would you do, Mom?

406
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:59,578
I have no idea. My head hurts.

407
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:04,588
It might be a better idea not to do this.

408
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:24,198
I know I dressed you up, but you look perfect today.

409
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:25,309
Really?

410
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:27,169
I have to look good today.

411
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:29,638
You do look good, like a celebrity.

412
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:31,109
Do you want to see?

413
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:34,249
You're right.

414
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:36,479
I don't look too bad.

415
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:39,648
I can't believe this.

416
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:43,588
This is my last date with her right after our first one.

417
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,198
A con artist and a police officer.

418
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:51,299
Cheer up, Ji Chul.

419
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:53,968
Boarding academies are different from the army, right?

420
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,838
They can stay out once a month,

421
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:57,468
and they can use their phones too.

422
00:34:57,468 --> 00:34:59,369
It's the army. It sounds like the army.

423
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:01,309
I can't do this.

424
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,038
I need to join an online community...

425
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:04,879
of people with girlfriends in boarding academies.

426
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:06,578
Go ahead.

427
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:09,619
Make sure you brace yourself and see her off.

428
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:12,218
Don't start bawling in front of her academy.

429
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:13,788
Can I really hold back my tears?

430
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:16,218
I don't think I can do that.

431
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:18,458
You can do it!

432
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:27,629
In Bum, get ready and come out.

433
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:29,898
- What? - I'll buy you a meal.

434
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,338
A meal?

435
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,979
Is she asking you out?

436
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:36,679
Stop talking nonsense.

437
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:53,828
(Changhwa Restaurant)

438
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:17,319
How do I look? I wanted to go with black and white.

439
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:19,018
Are you playing a game of go?

440
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,888
Whatever.

441
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:50,549
What do you want to say? You look serious.

442
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:55,819
Just say it.

443
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,058
Do you remember the time...

444
00:37:02,058 --> 00:37:04,398
when Do Hak Sung caught you and hung you upside down?

445
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:07,068
How can I forget?

446
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,298
Hey, wait!

447
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:15,609
The unrested spirit on him suddenly possessed you...

448
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,438
and attacked him.

449
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:21,079
We both know that. Why are you telling me this again?

450
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,648
That unrested spirit is...

451
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:25,989
your uncle.

452
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:32,288
- What? - Your uncle, Oh Sung Sik,

453
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:36,229
became an unrested spirit and remained next to Do Hak Sung.

454
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:39,028
Stop joking around.

455
00:37:41,768 --> 00:37:43,369
Stop joking!

456
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:57,079
When did you find out?

457
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:01,489
From the moment I saw him.

458
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:06,129
I've never forgotten the face of my mom's last client.

459
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,068
Had I revealed who I was early on,

460
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:16,138
you would've told me this sooner.

461
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:22,438
Let's help him find peace.

462
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:23,609
Why are you hesitating?

463
00:38:30,548 --> 00:38:31,989
For this exor...

464
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,089
No.

465
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:36,688
This time,

466
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:38,888
I don't want you to get involved.

467
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:42,259
He was your uncle.

468
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:47,129
Absorbing a stranger's memories is painful enough.

469
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,739
A beloved's memories...

470
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:53,568
will be excruciating.

471
00:38:53,908 --> 00:38:56,138
You promised you'll give us an apartment unit.

472
00:38:56,138 --> 00:38:57,908
- What? - I set the place on fire...

473
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,579
and killed people.

474
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:00,979
Give me the apartment.

475
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,949
He may not be who you think he was.

476
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,459
I even considered hiring another psychic without you knowing.

477
00:39:11,658 --> 00:39:13,629
Perhaps, I may be able to find out...

478
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:18,099
how to send my mom away by reading his memories.

479
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:21,168
That's why...

480
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:23,699
I must absorb them myself.

481
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,138
But remember what you said?

482
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:30,908
- "No matter..." - No matter how gruesome the truth,

483
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:33,308
I wanted to find out.

484
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:38,888
Frankly, I'm terrified.

485
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:40,989
Like you said,

486
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:44,589
I'm scared I'll find out that he was a worthless man.

487
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:48,129
But I've been in the dark, suspecting him and feeling afraid...

488
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,928
for the last 20 years.

489
00:39:50,898 --> 00:39:52,798
I'm done with that.

490
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:56,969
So don't worry.

491
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,908
After all, I'm a special psychic.

492
00:40:05,648 --> 00:40:08,548
Unrested spirits stuck on people are different from ones in houses.

493
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:11,048
Do Hak Sung must cooperate or the exorcism won't work.

494
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:13,619
But will he?

495
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:15,288
We'll make him.

496
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:16,888
Any ideas?

497
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:18,928
That's our specialty.

498
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:20,759
Right. Scamming people.

499
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:24,199
We're professionals.

500
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:26,229
Scammers.

501
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,869
I'll meet him myself.

502
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:34,839
Chief Heo, you do the rest.

503
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:37,278
Will he agree to see you?

504
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:39,079
He will.

505
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:41,408
I'll say I'm here to talk about selling Daebak Realty.

506
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:00,528
I'm here to clean.

507
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:02,999
Is anyone here?

508
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:29,558
Sit down.

509
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,609
(Chairman Do Hak Sung)

510
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:43,538
I heard you're here about selling Daebak Realty.

511
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,349
Did Ms. Hong finally make up her mind?

512
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,579
Yes.

513
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,219
Oh, is that so?

514
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:05,869
Gosh.

515
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:13,339
She has decided...

516
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,579
never to sell to you.

517
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:17,979
What are you talking about?

518
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:22,318
I had a question.

519
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:27,648
I knew you wouldn't meet with me, so I had to be sly.

520
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,418
You must have a death wish.

521
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:33,058
Please. Of course not.

522
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:42,898
Okay.

523
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:47,209
You.

524
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,408
You've met my uncle before, haven't you?

525
00:42:52,648 --> 00:42:53,879
And who's he?

526
00:42:54,808 --> 00:42:58,648
Oh Sung Sik.

527
00:42:59,888 --> 00:43:00,888
Oh Sung Sik?

528
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:03,888
Oh Sung...

529
00:43:05,158 --> 00:43:07,788
Oh, that shantytown arsonist?

530
00:43:13,268 --> 00:43:16,668
I heard you came to him right before he died.

531
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:18,938
Why?

532
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,668
Do you not know?

533
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,438
If I did, would I be asking you?

534
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:26,379
I didn't look for him.

535
00:43:26,379 --> 00:43:28,518
He called me over and asked for some money.

536
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:32,418
- What? - He demanded an apartment...

537
00:43:32,418 --> 00:43:34,089
since he set the place on fire...

538
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:35,788
and ultimately got the area chosen for redevelopment.

539
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:38,788
He threatened to tell the police that I had ordered him to do so...

540
00:43:38,928 --> 00:43:41,459
if I didn't abide by his demand.

541
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:42,658
Don't you dare lie.

542
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:44,329
My uncle...

543
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:47,129
was never the type who'd do something like that for money.

544
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:51,839
Actually,

545
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:55,438
people do all sorts of things for money.

546
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:20,469
Come in.

547
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:30,709
How's it going?

548
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:32,548
We've already hired some actors.

549
00:44:32,548 --> 00:44:34,579
- Get it over with. - Yes, sir.

550
00:44:58,138 --> 00:44:59,408
It's been a while since we scammed someone.

551
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:01,209
It was thrilling and exciting.

552
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:05,079
Why the long face? Were you not able to set the camera?

553
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:07,849
Never mind. Let's go.

554
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:14,648
There are three key places.

555
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:17,888
First, the large meeting room. Second, the emergency stairs.

556
00:45:17,888 --> 00:45:19,658
And third, the chairman's office.

557
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:22,999
But oddly enough, the last one's not working.

558
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:26,398
What do you mean? I did my job.

559
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:28,329
Is that so?

560
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,339
Then why isn't the camera working? It was brand new.

561
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:31,939
Don't worry about his office.

562
00:45:31,939 --> 00:45:33,768
An unrested spirit already lives there.

563
00:45:34,169 --> 00:45:35,838
Oh, right.

564
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:39,679
Okay. We're done setting up everything.

565
00:45:39,878 --> 00:45:41,979
Just a little push,

566
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:43,778
and the rumors will spread like wildfire.

567
00:45:43,778 --> 00:45:47,048
First, the intranet will go nuts.

568
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:50,788
After that, it'll rank first place in ghost story websites.

569
00:45:50,788 --> 00:45:54,288
Once the rumors are posted in tabloids...

570
00:45:54,288 --> 00:45:56,229
Do Hak Sung will hear about it.

571
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:00,169
And this actually works?

572
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:07,169
Just trust us and be patient.

573
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:09,709
This worked every single time.

574

I'll be seeing them tomorrow.

582
00:46:37,768 --> 00:46:39,439

583
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:41,909
This is how good we are.

584
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:44,108

A strange rumor has been going around our company lately.

594
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:44,939
People are claiming to have witnessed a ghost.

595
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,308
I heard you're an expert in this field.

596
00:47:47,308 --> 00:47:49,409
I need the help of a professional.

597
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:52,749
So what's your take on this?

598
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:54,679
Based on the amount of energy I'm getting,

599
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:56,149
I'm sure you felt it too.

600
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:57,778
What?

601
00:47:59,788 --> 00:48:03,389
An unrested spirit is lingering around you.

602
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:07,628
- And? - I'll drive it out.

603
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:10,858
An exorcism?

604
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:13,868
- How much will that cost? - I don't need your money.

605
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:16,199
I just need to do the exorcism.

606
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:22,479
That's right. You can't ask me for money.

607

Unless your scam is planned thoroughly,

608
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:37,088
you won't be able to make any money off it.

609
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:38,889
That's how the world works.

610
00:49:01,578 --> 00:49:04,278
I thought I checked all the security cameras.

611
00:49:05,378 --> 00:49:07,848
I don't know how that happened.

612
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:13,489
We can't change what already happened.

613
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:15,288
Let's go with plan B.

614

Don't look at me like that. Just hear me out.

615

Don't we just need Do Hak Sung to perform the exorcism?

616
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:26,469
So what? Are you suggesting that we should kidnap him?

617
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:27,969
Bingo.

618
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:31,878
Do Hak Sung kidnapped us, hung me upside, and beat me up.

619
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:34,249
- Why can't we do the same? - Yes. He has a point.

620

I'll pretend that you never said that.

621

- Ms. Hong. You have a visitor. - Okay.

628
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:09,318
Gosh. My heart is breaking.

629
00:50:09,749 --> 00:50:12,649
But how come we're keeping this from Ms. Ju?

630
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:15,919
I'm not sure.

I need the money urgently for my business.

632

So I want to sell the factory that closed down quickly.

633
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:23,229
But everyone who came to see the factory...

634
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,628
saw a ghost there, so no one wants to buy the place.

635
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:27,499
It's driving me crazy.

636
00:50:27,729 --> 00:50:29,669
So you didn't see the ghost yourself?

637
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:31,899
Yes, I did. I saw it myself.

638
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:33,338
That's why I'm here.

639
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:44,749
The electricity is cut off there, and I locked up the warehouse.

640
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:46,318

Then, I don't remember what happened next.

645

Did someone die at the factory?

647
00:51:20,389 --> 00:51:23,489
Gosh, no way. I'm the owner there. I would know if someone died there.

Only when I have a definite lead.

656

If I tell her without a lead, she'll just nag me.

657

668
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,558
in this cold storage warehouse?

669
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:44,358
I knew it. Is it because of the unrested spirit?

670
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:47,429
No. There's no unrested spirit.

671
00:53:48,028 --> 00:53:50,268
This place doesn't have any traces of unrested spirits either.

672

What? Then, why is it so cold in here?

673
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:57,108
Naturally, the warehouse is in the middle of the mountain,

674
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,509
so it's bound to be cold here.

675
00:53:58,509 --> 00:54:01,308
That's probably why people said that this place was haunted.

00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:03,479
Gosh. Seriously?

677

It's time.

723
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:13,459
If I went this far, In Bum has to believe me.

724
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:17,358
What the heck is that brat up to? I need to see this for myself.

725
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:19,469
That's my only condition.

726
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:21,999
Do you think you're the only one Oh Sung Sik met with...

727
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:23,239
at Ilsung Hospital right before he died?

728
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:24,499
I'm in my right mind.

729
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:26,368
This is something that has to be done.

730
00:59:26,368 --> 00:59:28,969
Wait, you didn't call another psychic, did you?
