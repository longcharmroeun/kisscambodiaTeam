What happened to you?

25
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,717
That unrested spirit's memory came into my head,

26
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,576
so I thought everything ended well.

27
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:58,986
It's my mistake.

28
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:02,212
I didn't make a visit beforehand, so I missed another spirit.

29
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,081
That unrested spirit bewitched me.

30
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,381
Bewitched?

31
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:09,826
As in how people say they feel as if they're bewitched by a spirit?

32
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,092
That's it.

33
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:14,321
When an unrested spirit passes through me,

34
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:18,092
I fall into a trance against my will.

35
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,932
So this is very dangerous.

36
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:28,302
This won't happen again. Don't worry.

37

Mom, I got bewitched today.

40
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,866
I thought there was one unrested spirit,

41
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,631
but I saw two once I got there.

42
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:34,201
I know.

43
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:37,341
It's because I failed to make a visit beforehand.

44
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,686
I'll make sure I visit the place before I do this from now on.

Seafood jjamppong. Okay.

Don't you have an appetite? That's all you're ordering?

62
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:56,657
I don't feel completely well after I was bewitched last night.

63
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,097
You were bewitched? Why?

64
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,197
That spirit of the college student didn't look very violent.

65
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:02,936
There was another unrested spirit.

66
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,666
Oh my gosh.

67
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,362
This is exactly why you make a preliminary visit.

68
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,376
You must've gone back to that night. Are you all right?

69
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,372
This time, it was different.

70
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,847
Once I got bewitched,

71
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:17,511
I went back to the same night from 20 years ago,

72
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,312
but this time, there was a child.

73
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:23,352
That man, Oh Sung Sik,

74
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:26,052
came with a child.

75
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,356
What do you mean?

76
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,091
It looks like what I remember isn't accurate.

77
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,626
It looks like the child he brought was...

78
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:38,091
this nephew of his.

79
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,007
What's weird is...

80
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,432
how the child was missing his eyes, nose, and mouth.

81
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:45,376
If you remember Oh Sung Sik's face,

82
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:48,442
isn't it weird how only the boy's face was missing?

83
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,376
You remembered that while you were bewitched,

84
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,011
so it may have been distorted.

85
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,912
Maybe.

86
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:00,552
But one thing for sure is that...

87
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:03,151
I can't trust my memory.

88
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:09,562
Why did I blindly believe that my memory was accurate?

89
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:12,606
I've been thinking about it,

90
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,562
and there are just too many questions.

91
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:20,841
Why did my mom try to perform an exorcism without a psychic?

92
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:24,672
No matter what you hear, do not come downstairs.

93
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:25,982
Understood?

94
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:29,517
And why was she possessed by an unrested spirit?

95
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,812
Do you remember what I taught you?

96
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:35,151
Stab me just as you practiced...

97
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:36,891
on that teddy bear.

98
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,726
Why did I assume that she had fallen victim...

99
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,391
to the unrested spirit because it was so powerful?

100
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:51,971
It's rather strange that I didn't question any of this.

101
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,542
I need to get to the bottom of this even though it's already too late.

102
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,017
I'll look into it.

103
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,916
You should focus on identifying the second unrested spirit.

104
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,252
That's of the utmost importance.

Just go to bed if you're going to keep yawning.

a college student who pulled all-nighters gaming.

I was the original owner of Rooftop Bakery.

after I opened the bakery.

125
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,917
But the landlord kicked me out,

126
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,312
saying that they were going to rebuild the building.

127

Business was flourishing,

128
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:15,656
so the landlord kicked out the tenant.

Finally, we've opened our own bakery.

00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,986
She tried so hard.

171
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,986
She made sure there wasn't garbage...

172
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:32,152
or cigarette butts on the streets.

173
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:34,197
She really went through a lot.

174
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:35,567
That's what they said?

175
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,562
They despised her.

176
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,067
They said she was overly eager.

177
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,062
They badmouthed her behind her back.

178
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:49,272
The other shop owners seem unhappy.

179
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,476
Let's not be so eager about fixing things anymore.

180
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:55,187
Hey, we need to take care of this area in order to flourish.

181
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:56,787
It's not about having a lot of customers.

182
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:59,652
They need to want to keep visiting. Don't you think so?

183
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,827
I know you're right.

184
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:05,256
But people don't like those who are always righteous.

185
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,491
Still, someone should do the job.

186
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:12,067
Goodness. You must be busy getting ready to open today.

187
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,162
It's okay.

188
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:16,272
- How may I help you? - I'm sorry to say this,

189
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,741
but we need to reconstruct the building.

190
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:22,741
It wasn't like he wanted a higher rent fee.

191
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:26,382
Since it was reconstruction, we had no choice but to leave.

192
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,882
But the rent in that neighborhood had risen,

193
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,711
so it wasn't easy to find a new place.

194
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:35,581
Then we were walking past that building one day...

195
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:38,792
and saw that he had taken over our bakery.

196
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,766
Do you have no conscience?

197
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,837
You were lying about the reconstruction!

198
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:46,037
I didn't lie!

199
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:49,406
At times in life, plans fall through!

200
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:52,406
I'm going to sue you for using our bakery name.

201
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,302
Sue? Be my guest! Do you think that'd scare me?

202
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:01,317
- Get out. Leave! - Sir.

203
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:02,516
How dare you push me?

204
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,717
- Dad. - Hye Jung, call the police.

205
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,751
Why are you causing a scene at my store?

206
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,126
We kept getting kicked out, but Sung Sil didn't give up.

207
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:12,597
- Do you think I want to come here? - Then don't come!

208
00:13:12,597 --> 00:13:15,396
So why did you steal my bakery?

209
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,937
That's enough.

210
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:18,692
You're going to make all of us broke.

211
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,567
I thought we'd get some peace and quiet,

212
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,262
but here she goes again.

213
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:29,172
Sung Sil went through so much to revive this area.

214
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:31,012
We felt completely betrayed.

215
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:32,711
You're going there again today?

216
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:34,481
Sung Sil.

217
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:36,682
Let's just forget about everything.

218
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,687
It's for the best.

219
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,682
I'm disgusted by those people.

220
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:42,052
No.

221
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:44,422
We need to right what's wrong.

222
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:47,262
If we don't, they'll do it again.

223
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:49,491
Thanks for the coffee.

224
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:59,376
That was the last time I got to see her.

225
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:01,106
(Missing, Lee Sung Sil)

226
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,071
I shouldn't have let her go all by herself.

227
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,971
I should've tagged along.

228
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:10,611
I should've stood my ground alongside her.

229
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,562
Excuse me.

230
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,567
Who's in charge of missing persons?

231
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:25,892
Him over there.

232
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,632
Thank you.

233
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,646
I have some questions regarding a missing individual.

234
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:37,741
Sure.

235
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:40,282
A month ago...

236
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,522
Hello, sir.

237
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,396
Hello.

238
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:55,626
A month ago, Ms. Lee Sung Sil had gone missing.

239
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,432
I'd like to hear some updates regarding her case.

240
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:01,132
She's not missing.

241
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,177
What do you mean? Have you located her whereabouts?

242
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:05,902
No, she's just not missing.

243
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,476
It's not linked to any crimes,

244
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:09,071
so we've concluded that she has run away.

245
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,077
She went missing after going to Cheonha Building.

246
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,217
She didn't run away.

247
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:15,682
She did go there that day.

248
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:18,457
But the CCTV caught her leaving after an hour.

249
00:15:18,457 --> 00:15:20,621
She must've gone somewhere to cool off.

250
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,327
In most of these cases, they eventually come back.

251
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:25,422
By the way,

252
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,667
why would a realty look for a person?

253
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,662
You're not a detective agency.

254
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,831
Excuse me.

255
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,302
Ma'am.

256
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:45,246
This is the footage that Park In Sook received...

257
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:46,812
from the police.

258
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:51,251
Lee Sung Sil did indeed leave Cheonha Building.

259
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:54,682
Oh, dear. Where could she have passed away?

260
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,491
(Missing, Lee Sung Sil)

261
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:01,562
Now that we've confirmed her name and face, let's get on with it.

262
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,062
(Lee Sung Sil)

263
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:19,146
Doesn't having an unrested spirit in this building mean...

264
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,646
that she had died here?

265
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,557
That's none of your business. Don't play detective.

266
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:24,812
And In Bum.

267
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:27,087
You startled me.

268
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,351
Forget whatever memory you absorb tonight.

269
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:33,192
How can I possibly control that?

270
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,991
Of course, I want to forget it.

271
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,562
Just do it.

272
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,262
What's wrong with her?

273
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,571
Come to think of it, I never heard a thank-you from you.

274
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:55,012
What nonsense are you spewing this time?

275
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,386
You know that I deserve a thank-you from you.

276
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,427
If I hadn't been there that night, you would have died in here...

277
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,486
after getting possessed by the spirit.

278
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:05,352
You ought to thank the man who saved your life.

279
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:09,491
You never answer me when you know I'm right.

280
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:11,837
I told you that not answering people is a nasty habit...

281
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,231
Thank you.

282
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:20,942
Pardon?

283
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,172
Thank you.

284
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,372
Are you complaining even after I gave you what you wanted?

285
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,981
No. I just couldn't hear you well.

286
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:33,781
What did you say? What was that?

287
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,981
What? What did you say?

288
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,622
I know you heard me.

289
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,521
How much longer will you take? Will we be here all night?

290
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:43,362
I'll finish it.

291
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:52,432
You are grateful to your psychic.

292
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,281
How will we lure out the unrested spirit today?

293
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,551
- You. - Pardon?

294
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,527
A psychic in the water...

295
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,051
is the best bait for a spirit staying in the water.

296
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:13,767
- You want me to go in there? - Yes.

297
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,297
Do you know how much this suit cost me?

298
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,892
I don't know. Go in.

299
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:21,501
You thanked me without a fuss because you need me in the water.

300

Goodness. I don't know much about it.

303
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,567
Go talk to my husband.

304
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,007
He's not answering my calls right now.

305
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:30,406
My gosh. Don't you know what time it is? Why are you here?

306
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:32,902
When I came during the day, you said I was disrupting your business.

307
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,406
That's why I came back here at this hour.

308
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:37,247
Gosh. Whatever!

309
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:40,582
You can stand there all night if you want. Gosh.

310
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,487
Seriously. You can just run that small bakery somewhere else.

311
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,311
"That small bakery?"

312
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,652
What does it say about you people who stole that small bakery?

313
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,297
"You people?"

314
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:56,426
I know you stole it for your daughter.

315
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:59,037
I'll make sure your daughter never runs that bakery again!

316
00:19:59,037 --> 00:20:00,902
I'll do whatever it takes!

317
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,837
- Are you done? - Watch me.

318
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,106
See if I can do it or not.

319
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:08,442
I'll give you a fight if that's what you want.

320
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:10,842
You!

321
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,616
You'd better stay away from her! If you don't, I'll kill you!

322
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,822
That bakery meant everything to me!

323
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:23,221
You crazy wench!

324
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,751
You'll have to take the bakery over my dead body!

325
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,827
I will not let her run that bakery!

326
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,237
How can you do that? What will you do?

327
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:32,791
- What will you do? - That's mine!

328
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:50,781
Die!

329
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:54,051
Die. Die!

330
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:43,332
You're okay.

331
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:45,971

Forget it.

What?

338
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,461
I told you.

00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:19,201
Whatever memories you get from here,

340
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:21,102
you must forget everything.

Was she murdered as we expected?

I had a feeling that she was murdered...

351
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,142
because of her thirst to kill when she possessed my body.

352

But she was full of hatred even until the last moment.

I told him to forget it,

I can at least call the police. A woman was murdered.

I'll make an anonymous tip.

What will you say to the police?

Will you tell them you heard it from the dead woman?

- Well... - Do you have evidence?

396

Or do you at least know where the body is?

397

Then should I just sit on my hands?

It's not that you won't. You can't.

You helped out with the Green Villas case.

Why did you help out back then?

You should use a lie detector or whatever and find out.

No, that's not the case. I...

If you keep framing an innocent man without evidence,

424

00:35:00,496 --> 00:35:03,821
Hello? Hey, I'm very sorry.

500
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:07,296
Well... Could you come in just an hour earlier?

501
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:09,261
I'm not feeling so well.

502
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:11,500
Yes, okay. Thanks.

503
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:17,670
Ms. Kim Song Yi?

504
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:21,440
You know who the deceased Lee Sung Sil is, right?

505
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:26,810
I don't have anything to say.

506
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:30,525
I just said someone deceased, even though she's still missing.

507
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:32,021
Yet you aren't surprised.

508
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:35,620
Did you already know that?

509
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:41,136
I don't know what you're talking about.

510
00:35:41,136 --> 00:35:43,865
How would I know if she's dead...

511
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:46,501
or just missing?

512
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:55,411
You're too much of a coward to go in there and fix the faucet.

513
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:57,816
But I guess you're brave enough...

514
00:35:57,816 --> 00:36:00,150
to live under the same roof with a ghost.

515
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:03,621
Who are you?

516
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:06,991
Why are you doing this?

517
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:11,130
I'm giving you a chance.

518
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,836
A chance to come clean...

519
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:16,130
and ask for forgiveness.

520
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,741
Goodness.

521
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:33,351
I have no idea why you're doing this.

522
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:37,026
The police have already checked the CCTV.

523
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:39,520
I have no idea where she is.

524
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:42,960
I have nothing to do with her.

525
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:47,431
What a weird woman. I can't believe this.

526
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:48,700
Goodness.

527
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:03,245
In Bum, that's enough.

528
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:05,611
You've been watching this all day.

529
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:13,190
I swear she died in the pool.

530
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:18,760
So how did she exit the building?

531
00:37:24,235 --> 00:37:27,330
Ji Chul, isn't she limping?

532
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:28,570
What?

533
00:37:29,975 --> 00:37:31,440
You're right.

534
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,355
This isn't her. It's the landlord's wife.

535
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:40,851
She wore Ms. Lee's clothes...

536
00:37:41,285 --> 00:37:42,456
to make her own alibi.

537
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:44,450
She wore the deceased woman's clothes?

538
00:37:44,756 --> 00:37:46,721
What a scary woman.

539
00:37:46,956 --> 00:37:48,421
But how can we prove it?

540
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:53,361
The only way to do that is by locating her body.

541
00:37:53,495 --> 00:37:54,700
Ms. Hong.

542
00:37:56,805 --> 00:38:00,205
Gosh, what a killer view.

543
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:02,170
- I'll take a photo of you. Get up. - Sure.

544
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:05,516
All right. Look here.

545
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:06,971
Look at the camera.

546
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:08,945
No, go over there.

547
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:12,150
Do you really think the body is inside the building?

548
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:18,695
It would've been very difficult for her to carry the body outside...

549
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:21,721
and dispose of it when she doesn't even have a driver's license.

550
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:23,925
(Cheonha Sauna)

551
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:26,896
Gosh, saunas are the best when your body feels stiff.

552
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:28,361
But her husband has a car.

553
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:30,335
They could've done it together.

554
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:32,906
It feels good to go to a sauna.

555
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:36,040
(Restricted Area, Authorized Personnel Only)

556
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:50,150
Okay.

557
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:57,221
Was she the one who spread the ghost rumor?

558
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,961
I knew it.

559
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:02,835
No.

560
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:05,300
The landlord didn't even know that she was dead.

561
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:07,841
He could've played dumb.

562
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:10,246
If An Chang Sub knew,

563
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:12,810
he wouldn't have asked me to perform an exorcism.

564
00:39:14,116 --> 00:39:16,415
Since they continued to run the sauna and the bakery,

565
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:18,150
she couldn't have hidden her there.

566
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,156
If a body had been stored indoors for a month,

567
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:25,156
it would've reeked. She would've gotten caught.

568
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:27,020
Then where could it be?

569
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:32,665
- Here. - Why?

570
00:39:32,665 --> 00:39:34,630
Do you see the unrested spirit?

571
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:37,530
You saw something that night, didn't you?

572
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,335
Only this material is different.

573
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,535
She had recently blocked this area.

574
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:43,101
You're right. It looks brand new.

575
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:45,841
What? It was a guess.

576
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,280
Don't be ridiculous. It was a reasonable inference.

577
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:51,581
Don't get close.

578
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,310
Cheonha Building's basement? Yes, I constructed it.

579
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,481
Why do you ask?

580
00:39:56,955 --> 00:39:59,256
Did you happen to see...

581
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:02,321
what was underneath the stairs?

582
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,121
Underneath the stairs?

583
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:07,430
There was nothing.

584
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:12,071
There were clothes and blankets. Just a bunch of garbage.

585
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,601
Garbage?

586
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:17,146
So you want me to block this?

587
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:18,441
Yes.

588
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:23,680
I understand. Throwing garbage away also requires money.

589
00:40:25,386 --> 00:40:26,780
Let's see.

590
00:40:27,315 --> 00:40:29,455
430mm.

591
00:40:29,455 --> 00:40:31,951
Do people often do that?

592
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:34,691
Not often, but it does happen.

593
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:36,396
It's going to be blocked off anyway.

594
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:38,191
You have to pay to get rid of garbage.

595
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:42,101
Garbage...

596
00:40:49,545 --> 00:40:50,701
Okay.

597
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:52,510
We're done.

598
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,441
Do people really get fooled by your lousy tricks?

599
00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:58,880
Lousy?

600
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:03,386
(Cheonha Sauna)

601
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:06,191
My gosh! Go away!

602
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,461
Do you still think it's lousy?

603
00:41:13,695 --> 00:41:14,831
Sir.

604
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:17,736
A... A ghost.

605
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:18,776
- Are you okay? - No!

606
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,900
Sir!

607
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:22,270
Look at me.

608
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:24,170
You're okay.

609
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,910
Let's go inside.

610
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:29,581
- It's okay. Follow me. - No.

611
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:36,226
(Cheonha Sauna)

612
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:38,856
I... I saw it.

613
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:41,591
It... It was a ghost.

614
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:42,961
I knew it.

615
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:44,795
You knew it?

616
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,731
Didn't you already perform an exorcism?

617
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:49,935
I apologize. We actually came to confirm it.

618
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:51,731
But I guess you witnessed it yourself.

619
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:54,471
- You must've been startled. - Confirm what?

620
00:42:01,945 --> 00:42:04,341
Wait. Confirm what?

621
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:21,030
What is that?

622
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:23,900
Through our research,

623
00:42:23,906 --> 00:42:26,400
we found out that the student had a lover.

624
00:42:26,606 --> 00:42:31,146
On the day of his death, he had lost his matching ring here.

625
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:34,571
We believe he's still looking for it.

626
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:36,180
Ring?

627
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,711
Why would it be here?

628
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:40,150
That night...

629
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:58,471
My heart is broken.

630
00:43:07,746 --> 00:43:11,016
Didn't the construction take place after his death?

631
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:13,981
You're right. It's been a month.

632
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:16,451
I knew it.

633
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,451
Then what should we do?

634
00:43:21,695 --> 00:43:24,226
We just need to find that ring.

635
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,731
We need to tear down this wall.

636
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,805
Come on. He can't tear down a perfectly fine wall.

637
00:43:29,805 --> 00:43:31,335
Or he can just let...

638
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:33,736
the unrested spirit haunt him until the day he dies.

639
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,900
Come on.

640
00:43:37,246 --> 00:43:38,871
What should I do?

641
00:43:39,276 --> 00:43:41,780
(Cheonha Sauna)

642
00:43:44,386 --> 00:43:45,751
Here I go.

643
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:50,380
Goodness. Wait.

644
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:54,121
- What are you doing? - Honey.

645
00:43:54,656 --> 00:43:57,790
No. Stop this at once! I mean...

646
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,496
Who gave you permission to do this?

647
00:44:00,496 --> 00:44:02,006
He said...

648
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,736
Calm down. I'll explain.

649
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:05,971
Forget it. Stop this.

650
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:07,976
Stop it right now!

651
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:09,545
My gosh.

652
00:44:09,545 --> 00:44:11,445
Honey, listen to me.

653
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:14,815
A ring that belonged to the deceased student is in there.

654
00:44:14,815 --> 00:44:17,581
That's why his spirit still lingers.

655
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:19,486
Are you a fool?

656
00:44:19,486 --> 00:44:20,886
Do you actually believe that?

657
00:44:20,886 --> 00:44:22,656
I saw him myself.

658
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:24,756
And they're paying for everything.

659
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:27,026
They'll block it up again after.

660
00:44:27,026 --> 00:44:28,425
If not, why would they waste money...

661
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:30,325
on tearing down a wall that's full of garbage?

662
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:32,491
Because there's something else back there!

663
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:40,400
In that case,

664
00:44:41,006 --> 00:44:43,006
is it something you want to hide?

665
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:44,140
Perhaps,

666
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,010
a body?

667
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:48,481
What on earth are you talking about?

668
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:58,010
What? You said the body was here.

669
00:45:58,516 --> 00:46:00,156
You said it was a logical deduction.

670
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:01,410
Shut it.

671
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,851
Honey, what's wrong?

672
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:11,861
I'm so sorry.

673
00:46:12,295 --> 00:46:15,060
No. I...

674
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,530
I didn't do it on purpose.

675
00:46:19,675 --> 00:46:22,170
Don't. Don't come near me.

676
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:24,300
Don't come near me.

677
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:27,071
What's gotten into you?

678
00:46:33,386 --> 00:46:35,651
I didn't do it on purpose.

679
00:46:45,465 --> 00:46:47,695
How did you know that the victim's body was there?

680
00:46:47,695 --> 00:46:49,906
Gosh. How would I possibly know that?

681
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:53,030
I went there to find the dead college guy's ring.

682
00:46:53,235 --> 00:46:56,406
Then, did you break the wall to find the ring, Ms. Hong?

683
00:46:56,406 --> 00:46:59,070
By nature, I must follow through when I start something.

684
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:02,280
I was just trying to help him as a way to work out.

685
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:13,225
If you're done questioning her, I'll take her with me.

686
00:47:13,225 --> 00:47:15,520
It's not over yet.

687
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:19,231
Why are you keeping her here for hours?

688
00:47:19,665 --> 00:47:20,790
Why?

689
00:47:20,896 --> 00:47:22,235
She's not a murder suspect.

690
00:47:22,235 --> 00:47:24,901
Must you intimidate her while questioning her?

691
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:32,116
(Kind, Present, and Swift Police)

692
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:35,241
I've been to the station more than when I used to scam people.

693
00:47:35,415 --> 00:47:37,241
And who do you think is responsible for that?

694
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:39,951
Chief Heo!

695
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:45,451
Why did you help him?

696
00:47:46,955 --> 00:47:49,491
You even staged the wall to look like it was haunted.

697
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:53,165
You know the side effect of being possessed by a spirit...

698
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:54,891
who was brutally murdered.

699
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,770
A series of nightmares where you always die...

700
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,770
and the vivid fear and rage.

701
00:48:03,106 --> 00:48:05,610
I was supposed to be going through that.

702
00:48:07,975 --> 00:48:10,441
So in the end, you did it for him.

703
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:14,985
I knew that given his personality, he'd do something for sure.

704
00:48:14,985 --> 00:48:17,086
I couldn't let him fail.

705
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:19,090
I didn't want him to experience what I went through.

706
00:48:20,955 --> 00:48:23,760
But you deliberately left me out.

707
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:26,491
And I am quite saddened by that.

708
00:48:27,636 --> 00:48:30,065
No. About that...

709
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:33,201
I felt like I was bothering you too much lately.

710
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,840
I am very disappointed.

711
00:48:38,106 --> 00:48:39,610
Ms. Joo.

712
00:48:40,775 --> 00:48:42,241
Ms. Joo.

713
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:51,020
By the way,

714
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,221
what did the building owner's wife see to get that scared?

715
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:56,826
Is it possible for the unrested spirit...

716
00:48:56,826 --> 00:48:58,836
to show up even after an exorcism?

717
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,435
I don't know why she acted like that,

718
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:02,636
but there was no unrested spirit.

719
00:49:02,636 --> 00:49:05,300
In other words, we got lucky this time.

720
00:49:06,205 --> 00:49:09,300
Our teamwork was perfect, and the universe was on our side.

721
00:49:09,675 --> 00:49:14,010
No. There's no guarantee that we'll get lucky every time.

722
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:16,481
Next time, don't be rash.

723
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:19,451
Rash? Gosh. Don't put it like that.

724
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:22,525
It seems you two are getting along better now.

725
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:25,790
Right? We make a good team.

726
00:49:25,925 --> 00:49:29,664
But Ms. Hong will not admit that.

727
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:30,991
Don't exaggerate things.

728
00:49:31,566 --> 00:49:34,790
Our late-night food is here.

729
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:38,870
It smells good.

730
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:41,205
Why are we having bread? Thanks, anyway.

731
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:42,546
In Bum made it.

732
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,275
What? I did?

733
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:45,846
Yes. Don't you remember?

734
00:49:45,846 --> 00:49:47,475
You probably don't.

735
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:50,215
You made the dough in the morning, fermented it,

736
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:51,685
and baked it. But you didn't clean up.

737
00:49:51,685 --> 00:49:53,886
So the lady scolded me for the mess.

738
00:49:53,886 --> 00:49:55,656
She said that was way too much food for anyone.

739
00:49:55,656 --> 00:49:58,350
That's all right. I understand it was the side effect.

740
00:49:58,525 --> 00:49:59,656
I'm used to it now.

741
00:49:59,656 --> 00:50:01,796
Ms. Hong, try some. It's really good.

742
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:04,461
- No. - Gosh.

743
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:10,530
Did you know?

744
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:13,501
In the States, when people put their houses on the market,

745
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:16,245
they bake bread around the time for the open house.

746
00:50:16,245 --> 00:50:17,600
Why?

747
00:50:20,275 --> 00:50:23,346
When people smell bread, they feel at ease and comfortable.

748
00:50:23,346 --> 00:50:25,610
I see. It's a psychological marketing trick.

749
00:50:27,715 --> 00:50:29,685
When people go to the open house,

750
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:32,725
they think the house feels cozy thanks to the smell of the bread.

751
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:34,721
That way, people sell more houses.

And...

767
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:41,651
this isn't much. But it's a reward.

768
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:44,961
Gosh. You could have wired the money to me.

I knew it. You're still a fraud.

You were after the money, weren't you?

776
00:52:14,025 --> 00:52:17,020
Ms. Hong, rewards aren't money.

exactly where the body would be and tear down the wall?

That puzzles me the most too.

794

I'm telling you. It's the spirit.

- It's not a regular agency. - Okay.

796
