00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:08,716
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,917
(Who is the redevelopment for? Wake up, stop the redevelopment!)

3
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:12,951
(Resident Dissolution Committee for the redevelopment of Zone B)

4
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:15,481
(Stop the redevelopment from destroying my fortune!)

5
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:18,422
The world has become way more generous.

6
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:20,621
Long ago,

7
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:23,431
we would've demolished them and built the apartment by now.

8
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:25,467
- No, wait. - Ms. Hong!

9
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:27,161
- You can't pull that on me. - Ms. Hong!

10
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:28,832
Move aside.

11
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:34,272
How dare you block my way to eat?

12
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:37,511
Hey.

13
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:39,772
What?

14
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:43,982
Those two.

15
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:46,982
We still have something left to discuss.

16
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,181
- Ma'am! - Go ahead.

17
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:52,592
We don't have anything left to talk about. Sir.

18
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:56,592
It's the chairman.

19
00:01:06,906 --> 00:01:08,641
Attention, greetings.

20
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:10,712
- Hello, Chairman. - Hello, Chairman.

21
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:13,486
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:14,982
You're supposed to be at the realty office.

23
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:20,111
It's just... She is CEO Hong of Daebak Realty.

24
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:28,762
(Taejin Service)

25
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,172
Please help me.

26
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,821
You're younger than I thought.

27
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:36,062
Who are you?

28
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:42,362
How bold of you.

29
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:46,902
You probably had no idea who I, Do Hak Sung, was...

30
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:48,707
when you messed with Britium.

31
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:51,441
I see. Dohak Construction.

32
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:54,612
But you see,

33
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:57,617
why would someone like you, who's brave and skillful,

34
00:02:57,617 --> 00:03:00,112
do something so lowly as toying with redevelopment?

35
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,856
Don't you know...

36
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,552
that doesn't get you much money anymore?

37
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:06,726
If you need money, how about you work for me instead?

38
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:10,592
I sure love your gaze.

39
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:14,161
I don't work with just anyone.

40
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,201
Anyone?

41
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,221
How cute.

42
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:36,522
I'll give you a few days...

43
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:39,256
to decide whether to be my friend or foe.

44
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,267
If you choose the latter,

45
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,161
you can look forward to what'll await you.

46
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,661
I won't wait long.

47
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:56,971
(Changhwa Restaurant)

48
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:01,587
Your hands are ice-cold.

49
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:03,652
There was an unrested spirit here, wasn't there?

50
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,451
Are they still here?

51
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,751
Not anymore.

52
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:12,191
What? I just held her hand on goodwill.

53
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:14,927
Hey, how did Kim Tae Jin find us?

54
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:15,997
Should we move?

55
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:17,667
Didn't you see him just now?

56
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,931
He was completely intimidated by Ms. Hong.

57
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:24,072
Let's stick close to her.

58
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:28,272
Did they leave?

59
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:29,902
- Yes. - Yes.

60
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:32,371
(Changhwa Restaurant)

61
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,551
Ma'am, are you okay?

62
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,851
I was terrified...

63
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:45,797
that they'd barge in here again and cause a scene.

64
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,721
Have they been doing that?

65
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:50,291
They come at least once or twice every month.

66
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:52,167
They want me to sell this land.

67
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,262
Ma'am.

68
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:56,367
Instead of enduring all this then eventually getting kicked out,

69
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:58,336
maybe you should just receive the compensation.

70
00:04:58,336 --> 00:04:59,471
Chief Heo.

71
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:01,902
What?

72
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:09,181
Do you know why she named the restaurant Changhwa?

73
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:10,551
What?

74
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:13,882
It's the name of her son who left home 12 years ago.

75
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:16,952
She can't leave this place...

76
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,692
in case he comes back.

77
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:27,402
You want me to investigate your mother's final client?

78
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,032
Yes.

79
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:31,332
I want to know why he died.

80
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:33,741
He's dead?

81
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:37,272
I ran into his unrested spirit.

82
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:38,816
Are you sure it was him?

83
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,646
You only saw him once 20 years ago. You could be mistaken.

84
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:42,782
No.

85
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:47,012
I still remember every little detail about that day.

86
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:52,592
Okay. I'll look into it and let you know.

87
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:57,592
Hello.

88
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,231
What?

89
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:02,506
It's still early evening. Why do you look so down?

90
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,376
Seeing how you're all hyped up,

91
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,506
you must've found something.

92
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,047
I told you.

93
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:09,471
I noticed a world star couple just through a shadow...

94
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:12,541
Let's begin the briefing.

95
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:24,051
After 15 hours of investigation,

96
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:27,221
using the cutting-edge method of social media,

97
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,466
I've looked into every single person...

98
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:33,762
who was even slightly connected to the Green Villas fraud.

99
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:37,371
There were three people who lost their lives.

100
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:42,506
You see...

101
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:44,741
It's the third photo. The mom.

102
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,946
- How are you so sure? - Because I saw her.

103
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:49,082
I see.

104
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:53,551
Her name is Joo Kyung Hee. She's 60 years old.

105
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,551
She died of myocardial infarction.

106
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:05,132
I've never seen her so elated before.

107
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,971
That's why I couldn't stop her even though I was concerned.

108
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:13,231
She looked extremely happy.

109
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:17,842
I should've dissuaded her back then.

110
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,747
We don't even know when this house will sell.

111
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:21,247
Why did you sign the contract already?

112
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:23,311
You don't have to hurry.

113
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:26,851
I can cover the down payment with the money I've saved up.

114
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:29,586
The sales agency will also help us...

115
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:32,421
receive a loan.

116
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:35,126
- Loan? - Don't worry about anything.

117
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:37,497
This is the very 1st house I've purchased in 60 years.

118
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:40,466
I made sure to be thorough.

119
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:43,066
Look at you. You never wanted a house.

120
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,907
What has gotten into you?

121
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:49,002
I should have a house to my name before I die.

122
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:55,586
You cannot go there alive

123
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:58,282
- Are you that happy? - What? Yes.

124
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:02,987
Gosh. I love it.

125
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:05,026
Hey, had I known it'd feel this great,

126
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,322
I would've purchased a house much sooner.

127
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:11,667
Goodness.

128
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,731
You guys should just move in here...

129
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,361
even before your house gets sold.

130
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:19,402
- We'll think about it. - Gosh.

131
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,576
Honey. Mother. Look here.

132
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,506
Sure. Come here.

133
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:27,076
All right. 1, 2, 3.

134
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:29,342
I love you.

135
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:33,152
Every day, she cleaned and wiped the house...

136
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:36,581
even though there wasn't much to clean.

137
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:40,797
Who is it? Goodness.

138
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:43,096
But she couldn't even last a week in her cherished house.

139
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:44,836
What do you mean?

140
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:46,566
This house isn't mine?

141
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:49,331
I'm illegally residing here?

142
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:51,807
What's wrong with you?

143
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:52,976
This is my house!

144
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:55,902
You can't come in here with your shoes on!

145
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,071
Don't do this!

146
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:01,382
Don't do this! Stop!

147
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:05,911
This is my house!

148
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:14,496
You should've checked! What is this?

149
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,196
So what do you expect me to do?

150
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,866
I had no idea either!

151
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,591
I'm so frustrated.

152
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:27,402
- Mom. - Mother.

153
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:30,811
She died...

154
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:35,041
of anguish, not myocardial infarction.

155
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,512
She was heartbroken and furious.

156
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:40,252
It got the best of her.

157
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:41,782
Those people...

158
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,951
are murderers, not frauds.

159
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,907
Green Villas, Block B has stairs in the middle,

160
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:04,671
and eight houses in total.

161
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:07,917
Our client in Unit 302 doesn't live there anymore.

162
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,512
But we need approvals from the rest of the families.

163
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:14,757
The unrested spirit is obsessed with Unit 302...

164
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:17,022
and won't leave that place.

165
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:20,291
We can carry out the exorcism tonight without their approval.

166
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:24,167
We'll perform it at 3am when everyone's fast asleep.

167
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,262
Okay.

168
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:31,571
Gosh. No way.

169
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:38,116
How are we going to lure out the spirit this time?

170
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:39,441
Will you threaten the spirit?

171
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:54,191
I thought the other houses wouldn't be affected.

172
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:56,892
I'm just preparing myself for a possible variable.

173
00:10:57,397 --> 00:11:00,461
A certain fraud and psychic jammed me up a bit lately.

174
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,602
Don't tell me you're talking about me.

175
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:06,772
What?

176
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:11,112
Not answering questions is a bad habit.

177
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:50,482
- Don't take off your shoes. - Pardon?

178
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,051
Keep your shoes on.

179
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,427
This is my house!

180
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:03,622
You can't come in here with your shoes on!

181
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,372
What?

182
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,541
Gosh. What's going on?

183
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:28,581
Oh In Bum!

184
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:49,742
Now. Take it off!

185
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,122
Get out!

186
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,961
- Get out of my house. - Get out of my house.

187
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,732
- This is my house! - This is my house!

188
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:32,311
- This is my house. - This is my house.

189
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:35,421
- I bought it for my daughter. - I bought it for my daughter.

190
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:37,482
- My house. - My house.

191
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,561
Gosh.

192
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:47,392
Here's a warm drink for you.

193
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,461
Okay. Thank you.

194
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:56,246
My daughter's family and I want to move in together...

195
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:57,917
- to a deposit-based house. - Gosh.

196
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,517
No one wants to rent out deposit-based houses.

197
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:01,242
They all want monthly rent.

198
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:05,352
Well, that will be quite difficult for our finances.

199
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:10,187
Then, why don't you buy the house instead?

200
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:11,427
If you have enough for a deposit,

201
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:13,551
it's better to just buy the house with a mortgage plan.

202
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:16,627
Oh, right. We have some cheap units for a small apartment...

203
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,267
because they weren't sold when they were on the market initially.

204
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,392
Please wait.

205
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:22,536
How big is the house?

206
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:24,976
There are 2 options. One is 79.2m², and the other, 105.6m²

207
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:27,801
- Those are nice units. - Take a look at them.

208
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,446
No. Just call me...

when you have a nice listing for a deposit-based house.

00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,382
Gosh. Sure. I'll do that.

211
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:42,127
Oh, right. Just in case.

212
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:45,122
Why don't you take this home and read it through at home?

very solid.

There's nothing for you to worry about.

You can just live happily in that house.

This house isn't mine?

00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,017
I'm illegally residing here?

- Hey, take everything out. - What are you doing?

229

Even if you sue them for fraud,

230
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,022
it will be hard to get all of your money back.

231
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:52,496
You didn't wire the money to the designated trust account.

232

So legally speaking, this house doesn't belong to you.

How can we live with her in that small studio?

I can't let her stay at her friend's house forever!

I know that. But let's try to find another way to help her. Okay?

237
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,086
Even if it's a small studio, she'll be better off with me.

00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:47,671
sorry.

(Daebak Realty)

249
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:30,222
She bought that house...

250
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:33,097
after working at restaurants and as housekeepers.

251
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:36,522
She worked so hard for that money. Gosh, those scumbags.

252
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:40,091
How did you have this job for 10 years?

253
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:42,462
I would have killed a few people already.

254
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:45,276
What's the point?

255
00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:47,532
I would just have more unrested spirits for me to get rid of.

256
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:51,412
I didn't know you made jokes.

257
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:54,371
I wasn't joking.

258
00:17:57,187 --> 00:18:00,782
The duty of an exorcist ends after sending the spirits off.

259
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:04,522
That's where the job ends.

260
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,196
I see.

261
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,791
You want me to try to pretend that I watched a sad movie again?

262
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:19,702
You know what? My parents passed away when I was very young.

263
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:21,841
So I have no memories of them.

264
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:24,611
And I had never missed them either.

265
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,111
I must know them to miss them.

266
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:33,212
But earlier, this crossed my mind.

267
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:38,922
When my parents had to leave me in this world alone,

268
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:43,391
did their hearts break just as much as this?

269
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,032
And I hoped that it wasn't the case.

270

271
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:15,522

275

Is that why you are still here? Because you can't leave me?

No matter what you hear,

278
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:49,162
do not come downstairs. Understood?

279
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:52,532
Promise me.

280
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,206
- I promise. - You must keep that promise. Okay?

281
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:58,032
Okay. I got it.

282

Pick up that needle.

Stab me just as you practiced on that teddy bear.

289
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:42,101
No.

Get your mind straight, and do it.

292
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:49,942
I can't do that, Mom.

293
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:52,956
You can. You have to.

294
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:54,651
I don't want to do it, Mom.

295

00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:37,222
Oh Sung Sik.

303
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:40,196
He killed himself?

304
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:42,397
Yes, 20 years ago,

305
00:23:42,397 --> 00:23:44,791
two days after he came to Daebak Realty.

306
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:49,107
Does this have something to do with my mother's last exorcism?

307
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:50,262
That's not the case.

308
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,577
There were lots of conflicts between the residents...

309
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,101
and real estate developers in the squatter area.

310
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:58,942
The residents were to get kicked out for petty cash and no compensation.

311
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:01,472
He set the town on fire out of anger,

312
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:03,817
but a total of seven people died in the fire.

313
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,212
He couldn't deal with the guilt, then committed suicide.

314
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:09,857
Then why is he haunting the chairman of Dohak Construction?

315
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:12,256
Golden Properties was the contractor for the redevelopment,

316
00:24:12,256 --> 00:24:13,791
the former entity of Dohak Construction.

317
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,762
Do Hak Sung pushed ahead with redeveloping the squatter area.

318
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:20,367
He probably became an unrested spirit to haunt him.

319
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:21,702
That could be a possibility.

320
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:24,637
How's the lawsuit for Green Villas coming?

321
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:28,401
They haven't located President Hwang of the design company. No progress.

322
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:31,611
Why do you suddenly ask?

323
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:33,841
I was reminded of my mother.

324
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:38,282
Can you find all the properties which President Hwang owns?

325
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:39,581
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:45,551
The evicted resident union is...

327
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:48,891
making an issue out of the joint owners' agreement?

328
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:53,061
The committee gave their approval. There's nothing to make an issue of.

329
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,502
The thing is...

330
00:24:55,637 --> 00:24:59,432
they bring in other civic groups and put up a fight together.

331
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,677
They also bring reporters...

332
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:03,341
from independent media or something.

333
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:05,341
So did you get scared...

334
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:08,581
as the head of the borough and want to revoke the agreement...

335
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:12,851
for the redevelopment of the joint-owned area?

336
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:16,621
Things aren't like the way it was in this day and age.

337
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:21,051
Come in.

338
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,871
I got farmed ginseng for 49 dollars to abide by the Anti-bribery Act.

339
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:40,772
But you should still feel a little burdened.

340
00:25:56,927 --> 00:25:59,097
Goodness.

341
00:25:59,097 --> 00:26:01,962
All redevelopment projects suffer from conflicts against evictees.

342
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:04,532
Don't worry about it, Chairman Do.

343
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:08,232
Anyway, that's that.

344
00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:11,746
What's happening with Assemblyman ﻿Han Eui Sub?

345
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:14,347
I already mentioned it to him...

346
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:16,012
to set up a date for us.

347
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:19,857
Good. All right.

348
00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:22,081
- Have a drink, sir. - All right.

349
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:28,962
This is my home!

350
00:26:31,427 --> 00:26:32,591
No.

351
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:34,532
This is my home.

352
00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:48,881
You need to get up.

353
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,012
Five more minutes.

354
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:53,317
How can you sleep right now?

355
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:55,321
I couldn't sleep at all because I was too heartbroken.

356
00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:58,081
Forget it. I need to sleep.

357
00:27:00,726 --> 00:27:02,696
I said wake up!

358
00:27:02,696 --> 00:27:04,391
Mom, come on.

359
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:07,032
Hey.

360
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:09,502
You sounded just like my mom right now.

361
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:13,331
Man, I hate it too.

362
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:15,641
Is this the aftereffect of that unrested lady spirit?

363
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:22,647
So please find President Hwang for me.

364
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:25,111
I need to find him and take my precious money back...

365
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,611
for me to live in peace.

366
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:30,056
That's not exactly your money.

367
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,182
What?

368
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:32,891
Darn it.

369
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:35,591
I have no idea what's going on.

370
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:39,262
Living as a psychic seems really stressful.

371
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:41,962
So we just need to find President Hwang?

372
00:27:42,506 --> 00:27:43,601
Yes.

373
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:50,942
Goodness.

374
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:53,412
Hey, look.

375
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,516
No way. President Hwang is a guy.

376
00:27:56,516 --> 00:27:57,847
I know that.

377
00:27:57,847 --> 00:28:00,111
This is his younger sister, Hwang Ji Yeon.

378
00:28:00,617 --> 00:28:03,427
On her call history, I saw a number she has been calling often...

379
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:06,851
ever since her brother went missing, and it's a burner phone.

380
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:09,022
Of course, it has to be President Hwang.

381
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:12,932
Hey, I knew you'd do it, Chief Heo.

382
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:15,532
Anyway, did you locate the phone?

383
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,907
I'm almost done with that too.

384
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,272
(Your violation of the traffic regulations...)

385
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:22,401
Don't be so cheap about food.

386
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:25,117
Go eat cup noodles.

387
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:26,677
We shouldn't treat him too nicely.

388
00:28:26,677 --> 00:28:28,641
- Eat up. - Okay.

389
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:31,742
What is this?

390
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:33,617
What the heck is this smell?

391
00:28:33,617 --> 00:28:35,486
- Your foot? - Speeding?

392
00:28:35,486 --> 00:28:36,986
When did I get caught?

393
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:38,621
Pharming completed.

394
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:42,922
We just have to wait until he calls someone.

395
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:44,492
Nice job!

396
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:49,932
That lady must be here again. You're cleaning.

397
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:55,401
But it's great. Everything looks neat.

398
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,647
(Daebak Realty)

399
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:00,246
The rumors went on for about two years...

400
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:03,512
that President Hwang is the main guy for Do Hak Sung to secure funds.

401
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:06,087
The police tried to investigate,

402
00:29:06,087 --> 00:29:08,012
but there was no evidence, so it came to nothing.

403
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:11,551
Then there's a high possibility Do Hak Sung took the money...

404
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:14,127
for selling the apartment units, instead of President Hwang.

405
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:18,061
If that isn't the case, Do Hak Sung wouldn't have let him live.

406
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:20,397
Is this all President Hwang owns?

407
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,867
Hwang Ji Yeon is listed as a joint owner for most of these.

408
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:24,137
Yes, that's his sister.

409
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,232
What's the current market price for these properties?

410
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:29,502
It has been ages since it dropped by half or less.

411
00:29:29,907 --> 00:29:32,347
It looks like he was fooled by another real estate agent.

412
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:34,841
The con man has been conned.

413
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:36,182
Let's go with this.

414
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:48,621
My goodness, what's going on?

415
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,321
Did I just clean this place?

416
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,061
I don't know.

417
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,966
Things don't look much different from the ordinary.

418
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:57,667
What do you mean?

419
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,532
This place was full of dust.

420
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,432
It wasn't that bad.

421
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,012
My gosh, a man's hands are what defines him.

422
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:08,111
I didn't even put on rubber gloves.

423
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:10,242
Ms. Hong.

424
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:12,811
I talked to them. Let's get going.

425
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:14,182
Okay, I'll be there.

426
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:18,252
Where are you going?

427
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:22,762
To eat.

428
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,137
At this odd hour?

429
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:27,061
I eat whenever I want.

430
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:38,228
If the sales have been made...

431
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:47,169
Go.

432
00:30:56,414 --> 00:30:57,779
What were you doing?

433
00:30:57,824 --> 00:30:59,723
You put me up for work, then went to her office?

434
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:01,254
I'll explain it to you later.

435
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:03,823
And remember. Don't let Ms. Hong catches you.

436
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:05,124
I don't want to die either.

437
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:07,834
Ms. Joo, Oh In Bum or Chief Heo can't know about my involvement...

438
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:10,458
- with President Hwang. - I'll keep it a secret.

439
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:13,804
They might not know when to butt in if I give them a chance...

440
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,103
to get involved.

441
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:17,539
I hate cleaning up after them too.

442
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,609
Goodbye.

443
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:45,604
I'll give you 70 percent of the price...

444
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,428
you paid for the property three years ago.

445
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:50,844
I know that...

446
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:53,398
the current value is well below 50 percent of the original price.

447
00:31:53,604 --> 00:31:55,368
That's why I'm looking to buy it.

448
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:58,408
It's my job to make an investment for its future value.

449
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:04,118
If you're keeping it for a reason, then it's fine.

450
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:07,648
I thought you wanted to sell it.

451
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:11,324
My brother and I are joint owners of this property,

452
00:32:11,324 --> 00:32:13,059
so I have to ask him.

453
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,758
One second, please.

454
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:33,038
Hello? Jae woo.

455
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:35,949
(My Love)

456
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,779
Oh, hey.

457
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:40,579
Hey, we found President Hwang's location.

458
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,398
Then when do you want to seal the deal?

459
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,468
As soon as possible.

460
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,539
I'm willing to sign the paperwork along with Mr. Hwang Jae Woo today.

461
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:01,509
Well, actually...

462
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:04,083
He's at work right now.

463
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,514
I can get his power of attorney and sign for him.

464
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:08,208
I can't do that.

465
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:11,724
I don't make deals unless I meet the title-holder in person.

466
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:14,248
Gosh, why do you do that?

467
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:16,718
If you can't do that, let's call this off.

468
00:33:18,224 --> 00:33:19,618
Wait.

469
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:35,474
Once you see who President Hwang is,

470
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:38,938
you'll report him to the police, then get out. Okay?

471
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,329
Who is it?

472
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:03,268
- Parcel delivery. - Leave it in front of the door.

473
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,843
I need a signature.

474
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,173
Could you come out for a second?

475
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:10,474
I'm not expecting any delivery, so just take it back, then.

476
00:34:10,474 --> 00:34:12,409
Aren't you Mr. Hwang Jae Woo?

477
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:15,079
This is from Ms. Hwang Ji Yeon.

478
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,518
Where do I sign?

479
00:34:25,423 --> 00:34:27,164
I need the receiver to sign it himself.

480
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:28,928
I am the receiver. Where do I sign?

481
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,329
It's not you.

482
00:34:37,803 --> 00:34:39,268
What the heck is wrong with you?

483
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:42,039
Hey. Are you crazy?

484
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,338
It's you. You jerk! Hey!

485
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:57,089
Who are you? Why are you here?

486
00:34:57,523 --> 00:35:00,219
I'm working part-time. You wanted me to pay you back.

487
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,833
I need to make some to do that.

488
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,959
What are you trying to pull?

489
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:10,938
Darn it.

490
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,659
So Mr. Hwang Jae Woo is here.

491
00:35:33,994 --> 00:35:36,864
Oh In Bum. Hey, In Bum.

492
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:38,799
In Bum! You idiot.

493
00:35:39,864 --> 00:35:41,004
- Gosh. - You do it.

494
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:43,229
Take this. You idiot.

495
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,643
You idiot.

496
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,299
- Hey. You idiot. - Hey!

497
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:51,378
Stop making a scene out there, and do it inside.

498
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,808
Okay.

499
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:55,508
You're ordering me around again.

500
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,578
Don't you get tired?

501
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,019
It's tiring. Let's go inside.

502
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:08,459
Come here, you idiot.

503
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,733
- Come! - Why are you trying so hard?

504
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:13,498
Why can't you drag him back?

505
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,539
Jae Woo.

507
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,219
Ms. Hong?

508
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,519
Ms. Hong!

509
00:36:59,543 --> 00:37:01,954
In this quarter, we are looking to promote...

510
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:04,223
premeditated and systematic control...

over our real estate businesses...

512
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:08,988
President Hwang was arrested by the police.

513
00:37:09,554 --> 00:37:12,188
That dimwit.

514
00:37:12,824 --> 00:37:14,219
Which station?

515
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:16,258
Call the chief there.

516
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,159
Yes, sir.

517
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:23,229
Continue.

518
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,244
We didn't confine or assault anybody, officer.

519
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,174
Officer, look at our faces before you say anything like that.

520
00:37:30,174 --> 00:37:33,508
Those two beat us up! Especially the woman!

521
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,713
She's a total thug.

522
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,948
Please stop shouting.

523
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:40,479
Why did you get into a fight?

524
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,694
- Are you two acquainted? - It wasn't a fight.

525
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,264
I'm the only one who got beaten up.

526
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,959
And this guy. He's on the wanted list,

527
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:48,888
so will you please look him up?

528
00:37:49,194 --> 00:37:51,733
Mr. Hwang, you are on the wanted list.

529
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:53,058
See that?

530
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:57,198
Let me call my attorney.

531
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,068
Are we all done? May I go?

532
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:02,273
Not yet.

533
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:05,244
Why not? It was self-defense.

534
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:07,109
They hit me first!

535
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:09,583
That's why I told you to stay quiet.

536
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,353
My blood boils...

537
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:13,353
whenever I think of that con man. How can I not do a thing?

538
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:15,893
Do you finally understand how all of your victims felt...

539
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,488
when you conned them?

540
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,333
That's different from this one.

541
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,928
All of my victims deserved it.

542
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:28,469
Speak for yourself.

543
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:31,273
What about you?

544
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:33,704
You told me not to do a thing. So why were you there?

545
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:35,213
You should speak for yourself.

546
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,469
Will you all be quiet?

- Come here. - Hey, bring that over.

550
00:39:03,304 --> 00:39:05,503
- Darn it. - What is this?

551
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:07,404
Tofu. We have to eat this.

552
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:10,208
Man, what tofu?

553
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:12,009
Hey, make sure you eat some tofu.

554
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:17,149

Good luck.

00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,068
This isn't right!

Darn it!

561
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:43,544
Did I get beaten up for no reason?

562
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:45,644
Kim Tae Jin was at President Hwang's place.

563
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:47,513
That means Dohak Construction and President Hwang...

564
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:49,013
were both in on the fraud.

565
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:50,483
There's only circumstantial evidence.

566
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:52,324
Without any proof,

567
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:54,249
they'll either get probation or a fine.

568
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:56,848
And they would rather pay a fine...

569
00:39:56,924 --> 00:39:59,289
than compensate the victims.

570
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:01,794
How did you track President Hwang?

571
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:03,763
I used pharming on his phone.

572
00:40:03,763 --> 00:40:06,458
Can you also hack his phone and retrieve a file?

573
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,098
It is possible but...

574
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:10,698
It's a burner phone, so you won't find anything.

575
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,468
Just give it a try first.

576
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:15,869
Scumbags like him...

577
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:18,743
often make sure they have a way out.

578
00:40:18,743 --> 00:40:21,678
What is this? Why are you singing a different tune?

579
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,178
Didn't you tell me not to do anything before?

580
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:28,818
We should always finish what we've started.

581

There really was something.

Did you ask the chairman to allow me to fly abroad?

590
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:03,654
He's currently talking about it with the old man, so be patient.

President Hwang Jae Woo of Mirae Design...

595
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:14,233
and Secretary Choi of Dohak Construction's call...

596
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:17,228
went viral and caused a commotion.

597
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:18,944
It's proof...

598

that the two companies had joined hands in this fraud.

599
00:41:21,574 --> 00:41:25,243
Despite this concrete proof, the police aren't investigating.

600
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:26,414
This just shows that the police and the judicial system...

601
00:41:26,414 --> 00:41:28,213
are all on the same side.

602

I am deeply heartbroken that our company had a part...

617
00:42:08,353 --> 00:42:09,519
in causing...

618
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:12,194
unforgivable scars on the victims...

at least a bit of peace to the victims.

Did you find who posted the call online?

631
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:53,863
I believe the people who were at his apartment...

632
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,972
that day were behind this.

633

Ms. Hong Ji A, the CEO of Daebak Realty and Oh In Bum.

You've met them once.

Why would they do that?

636
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:06,314
The prosecution demanded the court to sentence...

637
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:08,012
Mirae Design's President, Hwang Jae Woo,

638
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:09,684
to seven years in prison...

The call recording...

641
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,324
The real mastermind behind this is Dohak Construction.

642
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:15,889
But they'll only take away his money?

643
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,058
How can a paper company give back that much money?

644
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,733
That just means that they won't compensate the victims.

645
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,259
Was it just a pipe dream of ours?

646
00:43:24,463 --> 00:43:26,363
I hope they give a big sum for the condolence money.

647
00:43:26,363 --> 00:43:28,598
They ought to compensate the victims, not console them.

648
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:30,769
How shameless! What? He'll give them condolence money?

649
00:43:30,904 --> 00:43:33,873
Among the victims, they entrusted the agency...

650
00:43:33,873 --> 00:43:37,338
to oversees the sales...

651
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:39,678
Ms. Hong.

652
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:41,708
Did you see...

653
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:05,499
The client will be here at 8pm.

654
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,753
Oh, my. She ripped it apart.

655
00:44:23,753 --> 00:44:25,218
When did she start punching it?

656
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:29,188
As soon as that shameless Do Hak Sung...

657
00:44:29,463 --> 00:44:31,763
started to babble about the condolence money.

658
00:44:31,763 --> 00:44:33,928
So she just lost it and started punching it.

659
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,769
It's been over an hour.

660
00:44:41,544 --> 00:44:43,269
I'm glad she didn't beat up anyone.

661
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,549
That sandbag is saving a lot of lives.

662
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,619
The exorcism was complete.

663
00:44:55,824 --> 00:44:58,889
Then, you just have to find a buyer, right?

664
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:01,458
Actually, that's why I wanted to meet with you.

665
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:03,688
Is there a problem?

666
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:10,204
You should find a tenant, not a buyer.

667
00:45:10,204 --> 00:45:12,739
A tenant? Why would I do that all of a sudden?

668
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,708
There will be a light rail station in your neighborhood soon.

669
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,843
If you sell it now, it will be a big loss on your part.

670
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:21,013
Are you sure they'll build a light rail station there?

671
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,454
I did hear something about that.

672
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:26,119
Yes. Trust me and don't sell the house for five years.

673
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,119
Okay.

674
00:45:35,394 --> 00:45:36,558

Peekaboo.

677
00:45:40,934 --> 00:45:42,674
You are so beautiful.

678
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:43,828
Let me get that for you.

679
00:45:44,204 --> 00:45:46,198
I'm Hong Ji A of Daebak Realty.

680
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,509
The house is on the market?

681
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:57,708
But I can't buy that house.

682
00:45:57,853 --> 00:46:00,119
Even with that condolence money,

683
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,889
after I pay the medical bills and the interests on the mortgage...

684
00:46:03,524 --> 00:46:06,694
The landlord decided to rent it out as a deposit-based house.

685
00:46:06,694 --> 00:46:09,759
The deposit isn't that high. I am sure it'll be within your budget.

686
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:11,664
But why are you offering me this listing?

687
00:46:11,664 --> 00:46:15,934
My job is to find the perfect tenant.

688
00:46:15,934 --> 00:46:19,568
I've been thinking and you are the perfect tenant for the house.

689
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:23,944
Think about it and call us.

690
00:46:23,944 --> 00:46:25,314
If you want the house,

691
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:27,613
we can proceed with the contract electronically.

692
00:46:27,613 --> 00:46:30,578

694
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:47,503
You rarely see a south-facing house like this one nowadays.

695
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:48,603
Doesn't the house get a lot of sunlight?

696
00:46:48,603 --> 00:46:51,639
People say small apartments are built poorly, but that's outdated.

697
00:46:52,404 --> 00:46:55,674
Fire-resistant materials were used for this house.

698
00:46:55,674 --> 00:46:58,684
And it was designed to endure earthquakes as well.

699
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:00,639
You have nothing to worry about.

700
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:03,348
Oh, right. The master bedroom is the wow factor of this house.

701
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:06,619
I like that the mountain is so close.

702
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,289
You like listening to the birds in the morning.

703
00:47:10,554 --> 00:47:14,718
The thing I love the most about this house is the elevator.

704
00:47:16,294 --> 00:47:18,129
With the elevator, when your baby is born,

705
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:22,169
you can easily go down with your stroller.

706

Why are you smirking like that? It's creepy.

709
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:12,418
How did you come up with the idea of sweet-talking him to find a tenant?

710
00:48:13,983 --> 00:48:15,124
That was the perfect move.

711
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:17,348
"Sweet-talk"? I'm not you.

712
00:48:17,823 --> 00:48:19,624
I was merely reminding my client to consider...

713
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:21,394
the property value as his real estate agent.

714
00:48:21,394 --> 00:48:22,789
Anyway,

715
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:25,699
you did what the deceased wanted to do for her daughter.

716

What are you doing in here?

720
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:23,049
I asked, what are you doing?

My goodness. What just happened?

722
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:28,959
Why am I here?

723
00:49:29,694 --> 00:49:32,463
No way. Was I cleaning here again?

724
00:49:32,463 --> 00:49:35,529
Goodness. Darn this side effect after being possessed. Gosh.

725
00:49:37,533 --> 00:49:39,098
Do you have a death wish?

How dare you act as if you don't know what you are doing here?

727
00:49:42,674 --> 00:49:45,108
- Let's talk after you let go. - Get out.

728
00:49:46,813 --> 00:49:48,084
It was foolish of me...

729
00:49:48,084 --> 00:49:50,878
to think for a second that you actually might be a good guy.

730
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:53,618
I was just trying to study.

731

whenever you get a chance.

733
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:02,793
And I can't handle the emotions from the spirits...

734
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:04,189
after the exorcism.

735
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:07,128
You know,

736
00:50:07,803 --> 00:50:09,434
it was my first time hating someone so much...

737
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:11,128
that I wanted to commit murder.

738
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:12,973
And I realized for the first time...

739
00:50:12,973 --> 00:50:14,799
what it meant to have your heart broken out of sorrow.

740
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:18,338
But after doing the exorcism,

741
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:22,209
it made me feel like I was helping people.

742
00:50:22,654 --> 00:50:24,249
So it made me feel good.

743
00:50:26,454 --> 00:50:29,219
That's why I was trying to find a proper solution.

744

I'm not talking about punching the sandbag or drinking to forget.

I wanted to find a proper solution that I could accept.

746
00:50:36,963 --> 00:50:38,729
After the contract,

747
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:43,269
you can just live an ordinary life like before. That's the solution.

748
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:45,699
Besides, there are no solutions.

756
00:51:33,283 --> 00:51:34,983

that a perfectly fine building is haunted.

no one would want to rent out the lots in my building.

My building is the only one that has vacant lots.

If I could, I just want to sell it.

Given the nature of our job, we must ask this question.

You don't recognize this guy? You don't?

785

Name, Han Dong Hee. He was 23 when he died.

His story made the headlines three months ago.

787
00:53:27,934 --> 00:53:29,204
He played games in the PC cafe...

788
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:31,334
which is in the basement for two days without any sleep.

789
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,444
And he came outside late at night for a brief moment.

790
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,709
Then, he dropped dead due to a heart attack.

791
00:53:35,844 --> 00:53:38,939
- A life in vain. - One could be that exhilarated.

792
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:42,013
But is it possible for spirits to be filmed on cameras like this?

793
00:53:42,013 --> 00:53:44,013
It's not common, but this happens from time to time.

794
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:47,184
Well, for us, we get to identify him without making the trip,

795
00:53:47,184 --> 00:53:48,354
so it makes things easier for us.

796
00:53:48,354 --> 00:53:50,588
Can we find out the time of death?

797
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,523
Around 4am.

798
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:54,719

And his daughter runs a bakery on the rooftop.

803
00:54:04,834 --> 00:54:07,039
And the lots on the rest of the floor are vacant.

Should we start it now?

805
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:12,144
I know his face and name.

806

Salt.

813

I see. This is salt.

814
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:54,654
By the way, why are we scattering it?

815
00:54:54,654 --> 00:54:56,624
It's a way to block the unrested spirit...

816
00:54:56,624 --> 00:54:58,489
from running away after possessing your body.

817
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:01,618
I see.

818
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:06,104
Wait. Then, what if this shield breaks?

819
00:55:06,104 --> 00:55:07,529
What happens?

820
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:09,098
You saw it yourself.

821
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:11,429
When we first met.

822
00:55:28,223 --> 00:55:29,894
Will you do that all night long?

823
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:32,094
Gosh. My life depends on it.

824
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:33,888
I can't do a half-hearted job.

825
00:55:40,934 --> 00:55:42,868
Do you have plans this late at night?

826
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,299
Why do you keep checking the time?

827
00:55:45,503 --> 00:55:48,143
The unrested spirit will show up soon.

828
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,709
How do you know that?

829
00:55:52,013 --> 00:55:53,983
This unrested spirit is endlessly repeating...

830
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,749
what happened right before he died.

831
00:55:55,914 --> 00:55:58,384
He will show up at the exact location...

832
00:55:58,384 --> 00:56:00,679
where he died at the exact same time.

833
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:17,969
Get your necklace ready.

834
00:56:18,704 --> 00:56:20,299
How close is he?

835
00:56:22,473 --> 00:56:23,908
Take it off now.

836
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,489
Oh In Bum.

837
00:57:12,694 --> 00:57:14,719
Put your necklace back on.

838
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:31,439
(Basement Level 1, Sauna, Red Clay Sauna)

839
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:03,209
There's one more unrested spirit?

840
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,049
I'm possessed.

841
00:58:22,793 --> 00:58:24,529
This is not real.

842
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:28,229
Hong Ji A. Open your eyes.

843
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,868
Come to your senses, Hong Ji A!

844
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,469
Mom.

845
00:58:40,414 --> 00:58:43,878
Mom. Help me wake up.

846
00:58:44,414 --> 00:58:46,418
I'm sorry.

847
00:58:47,384 --> 00:58:48,878
Hong Ji A.

848
00:58:49,723 --> 00:58:53,289
It's dangerous to stab everywhere like that.

849
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:57,029
You have to stab it in the heart, in one go.

850
00:58:57,463 --> 00:58:58,729
Let's try again.

851
00:59:00,364 --> 00:59:01,858
Help me.

852
00:59:02,063 --> 00:59:03,729
Wake up.

853
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:05,469
Ms. Hong.

854
00:59:06,104 --> 00:59:07,499
Ms. Hong!

855
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:10,239
Hong Ji A!

856
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:19,749
Are you okay?

857
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:21,949
Are you all right?

858
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:37,828
Help me.

859
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:44,568
A child.

860
00:59:46,743 --> 00:59:48,378
There was a child.

861
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:33,789
(Sell Your Haunted House)

862
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,634
There are too many oddities.

863
01:00:35,634 --> 01:00:36,934
Why did my mom...

864
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:39,003
try to do an exorcism ritual without a psychic?

865
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:41,563
You remembered that while you were bewitched, so it may be distorted.

866
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:43,233
I need to know what exactly happened on that day.

867
01:00:43,233 --> 01:00:46,573
I found everything on the internet regarding Cheonha Building.

868
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:48,144
We're a great team.

869
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,213
You want me to go in here?

870
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:50,573
No matter what kind of memories come into you,

871
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:51,644
forget them right away.

872
01:00:51,644 --> 01:00:53,483
Was that unrested spirit murdered as we expected?

873
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,954
Even this morning, he swore to kill that murderer, and his eyes were...

874
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,454
As soon as Oh Sung Sik died, he took the nephew and...

875
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:00,454
Oh In Bum?

876
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:01,684
It's about Oh In Bum.

877
01:01:01,684 --> 01:01:03,918
I don't think it's too late to call off your contract.
