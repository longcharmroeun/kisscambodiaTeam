2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,378
When a dead person...

3
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:12,879
remains in this world as a soul
without a body,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,979
it's like standing outside
in your underwear...

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,820
in the midst of a snowstorm
in midwinter.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,760
Please help me.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,259
No matter what you hear,
do not come downstairs.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,530
Understood?

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,199
Hwa Jeong, listen carefully.

10
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,099
A child possessed
by an egg ghost is here.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,609
But I cannot perform
an exorcism ritual on an egg ghost.

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,938
Killing the person
that's been possessed...

13
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:44,109
is the only way
to dissipate the spirit.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,310
In Bum, let's go.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,959
I heard what you said on your phone.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,189
Move.

17
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:04,029
If I don't perform the exorcism,
more people will die.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,100
To stop that disaster,

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,929
we must sacrifice the boy.

20
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,098
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,909
I don't care about that disaster.
You cannot kill In Bum!

22
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,549
You will never understand.

23
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,310
No.

24
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,439

25
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,709

27

The needle.

33
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,659
Stab the heart accurately.

34
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:19,870
Stab...

35
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,199
the heart accurately.

36
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,840

43

was killed.

45
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,889
No.

46
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,120
Ms. Hong! Wake up.

47

Hong Ji A!

48
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,189
Visitation hours are over.
We need to go.

49
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,990
No.

50
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,629
I need to keep her warm.

51
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,860
You've done enough.

52
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,660
What do you think...

53
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:08,629
she was doing?

54
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,060
I think she was possessed by her mom
several times.

55
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,930
Isn't it dangerous for the exorcist
to be possessed?

56
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,470
Not once,

57
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,339
but many times at that.

58
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:21,939
An exorcist hallucinates...

59
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,180
when they're possessed
by an unrested spirit.

60
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,549
In Ji A's case, she hallucinates...

61
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,749
about the day her mom died.

62
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,779
But...

63
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,019
when she was possessed
by that water ghost last time,

64
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,790
she told me that she remembered
a forgotten piece of memory.

65
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,060
Are you saying...

66
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,529
that she was trying to retrieve
her lost memory from 20 years ago?

67
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,870
I think...

68
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,769
she wanted to find out the truth.

69
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,769
Even if her life was at stake.

70
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,439
Have you still not located
Kim Tae Jin?

71
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,250
I'm sorry, sir.
We're currently searching for him.

72
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,749
How could you still not find him...

73
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,850
when he had promised to hand over
the memorandum?

74
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,289
He was recently spotted
at an employment agency,

75
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,019
so I've sent some men over.

76

77
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,928

78
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:56,668
some sweet and sour pork for me as well.

for your return, so hurry over.

91

If I could have it my way,
I'd drag you there.

92

But I can't do that.

93
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,049
Never mind. Give me your phone.
Let's call her.

94
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,289
Do you not have one?

95
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,360
Do you even remember her number?

96
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,370
Hey, give me a piece of paper and a pen.

97
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Here.

98

all my sins.

You little scumbag.

if you break your parents' hearts.

105
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,740
- Hey.
- Yes?

106
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,250
Kim Tae Jin is here, isn't he?

107

No, sir.
We haven't been in touch recently.

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,960
there's no point in hiding it.

everything I had to do.

(The deceased, Hong Mi Jin,
was stabbed by a sharp hairpin...)

180
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,410
By the time I arrived at the scene
after getting a phone call,

181
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,578
your mother had already passed away.

182
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,848
And you, Oh In Bum,
and Oh Sung Sik...

183
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,819
were unconscious.

184
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,049
The cause of death was...

185
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:36,088
excessive bleeding after getting
stabbed by a sharp hairpin.

186
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,719
And the fingerprints found
on the hairpin...

187
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,758
belong to you and your mother.

188
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,598
And after analyzing the angle
and depth of the wound,

189
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,829
the person who stabbed the victim...

190
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
was you, Ji A.

(Crime Scene Photos)

193
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,470
That's why she stayed with me.

194
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,579
A mother was stabbed to death
by her own daughter.

195
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,579
Of course, she'd hold a grudge.

196
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,019
Then, what should I do, Mom?

197
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,599
For this to end,
I have to disappear, right?

198
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,400
Right?

199
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,589
I think she wanted to find out the truth.

200

My mom...

202
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,160
was killed.

203
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:30,069
- Ms. Hong.
- Sorry. It's me.

204
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,839
You haven't found
Ms. Hong yet, right?

205
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,549
I searched around the neighborhood,
but I didn't see her.

206

You should stay here and call me
if Ms. Hong comes back.

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,910
Okay.

208
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,119
Where are you going?

209
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,220
You know, don't you?

210
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:51,390
I'm talking about the truth...

211
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:54,460
behind the day Ms. Hong remembered.

212
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:57,400
By any chance,

213
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,430
did I kill Ms. Hong's mother
20 years ago when I was possessed?

214
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,000
Did I?

215
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,609
It's the opposite.

216
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:12,710
Ji A's mother tried to kill you.

217
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,160
Then, this necklace...

218
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,740
isn't probably from Ms. Hong's mother.

219
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:40,910
She wouldn't give a necklace
to the kid she tried to kill.

In Bum. In Bum...

221
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:57,390
It's... It's all my fault.

222
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:04,000
You can't die, In Bum.

224
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,769
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

225
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,049
He said he would give me
an apartment unit.

226
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:26,048
I must have gone mad. I'm sorry.

227
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,490
It's you who created the egg ghost.

228

The spirits of the seven people
who died in a fire you set...

229
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,629
became an egg ghost.

230
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,959
And Mi Jin died when
she tried to get rid of the ghost.

231
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,129
Eight people died
all because of your greed.

232

It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.

234
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,669
If you really think it's your fault,

235
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,038
turn yourself in.

236
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,939
Turn yourself in and pay for your crime.

237
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,180
Yes. I'll do that.

238
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:55,579
I was going to turn myself in.
I'm telling the truth.

239
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,250
And this.
Put this necklace on your nephew.

240
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,490
With that necklace,
something like this will never happen.

241
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,900
Whatever happens,
make sure he never takes it off.

242
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,230
Okay. Thank you.

243
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,069
Thank you so much.

244
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,549
I hated your uncle for what he'd done.

245
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:36,549
But you were innocent in this.

246
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,730
And I did my best
in the situation I was given.

247
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:44,160
For you...

248

and for Ji A.

249
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,009
Your best...

250
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,608
Are you telling me that trying
to hide the truth forever...

251
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,108
and deceiving Ms. Hong
was doing your best?

252
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:02,578
Don't patronize me.

253
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:05,319
Ji A had to distort and forget...

254
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,588
her memories of that day
on her own to survive.

255
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,390
When she was trying to survive,

256
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,589
should I have told her this mighty truth?

257
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,329
I once asked Ms. Hong...

258
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,700
about you, Ms. Ju.

259
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,339
Ms. Ju is...

260
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,640
the only person I trust
in this world.

261
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,710
You betrayed...

262
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:31,940
her only trust.

263
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,450
Thank you very much...

264
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,990
for this necklace.

265
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:46,160
Thanks to this necklace,

266
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,250
I could live without much trouble.

No touching.

269

Why not?

270
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,278
I just have to put this in, right?

271
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,779
No, that's not right.

272
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:32,059
I heard your new psychic
has amazing psychic powers.

273
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,299
He quit.

274
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,599
What a shame.

275

Secretary Ju said
he was good-looking too.

276
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,109
No? Was she exaggerating?

277
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:43,369
No, she wasn't.

278
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,009
I see.

279
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,779
So? Are you allowed to be away
from your office for so long?

280
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:50,879
I'm quitting my job as an exorcist.

281
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,619
Is that so?

282
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,450
I sold the realty office too.

283
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:01,859
This time, you actually mean it.

284
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,499
How will you make a living
if you quit working as an exorcist?

285
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,828
I'm going to travel.

286
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,970
You're a homebody.
Where will you go?

287
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,670
You hate traveling.

288
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,369
I can't stay home forever.

289
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,339
I don't think you'll be able to quit.

290
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:20,710
I can too.

291
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,219
Do you really think
you've taken up this job...

292
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,819
and worked to this day
just because of your mother?

293
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,819
You say you're sick of them
and never want to see them again,

294
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,588
but I doubt you can turn a blind eye
to unrested spirits...

and living in pain.

You took after her.

298
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:54,779
Don't be so hard on yourself.

299
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,750
She was bound to find out someday.

300
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,349
If possible,

301
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,619
I never wanted her to find out.

302
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,359
Ji A is an adult too.

303
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,529
She can deal with this on her own.

304
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,000
Detective Kang had been
helping me out...

305

in re-investigating Do Hak Sung.

between Mr. Hwang and Do Hak Sung...

308
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,279
was you, wasn't it?

309
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,519
Could I listen to the original file?

310
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:36,920
How could I trust this man?

311
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,690
Someone once said,

312
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,859
"There's more than meets the eye."

313
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,059
That there's another side...

314
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,359
to everything.

(Changhwa Restaurant)

316
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:19,960
Ms. Hong should be here.

Are you the psychic for Daebak Realty?

319
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,569
How did you know?

320
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,309
I made that.

321
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:11,150
Where is Ms. Hong?

322
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,490
I think she just went
into the bamboo forest.

323
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,018
You can come in and wait.
She'll return before the sun sets.

324
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,660
I'll go catch her.

325
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,599
He's as good-looking as she said.

326
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,390
- I need to talk to you.
- I have nothing to say.

327
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,360
But I do. So please listen.

328
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,959
I heard everything from Ms. Ju.

329
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:17,130
It wasn't your fault.

330
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,499
It was just as you said.

331
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,900
If my uncle and I hadn't come,

332
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,209
your mother wouldn't have passed away.

333
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,009
So let's not be sorry.

00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,850
I'm not going to feel sorry
for what happened with my uncle,

335
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,019
so please don't feel sorry for me
for what happened with your mother.

336
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,259
After all, I'm still alive.

337
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,830
But my mother is dead.

338
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,670
I...

339
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,209
killed my mom with my hands.

340
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,049
That's how you're still alive.

341
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,819
Whenever I see you,

342
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:11,450
I'm vividly reminded of the fact
that I killed my mother.

343
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:15,630
That's why it's impossible
for me to see you.

344
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,410
I'm going home.

345
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:11,809
I know you're not sleeping.

346
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,950
I don't expect you to show your face,
but you should at least say bye.

347
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,090
Darn it.

348
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,800
Do you want to know how to avoid
becoming an unrested spirit?

349
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:38,539
Sorry?

350
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:41,979
When you're thankful,
express your gratitude.

351
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,248
When you've done wrong, apologize.

352
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:46,819
And show affection to those you love.

353
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,049
We could die at any given moment.

354
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,288
We shouldn't hesitate or be afraid.

355
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:54,718
What if you die
of a car accident today?

356
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,090
Won't you feel bitter?

357
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,199
Say what you want or must
if you don't want to turn...

358
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,759
into an unrested spirit.

359
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:05,840
Hold on. Or will that prevent
the other person from becoming one?

360
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:07,539
I don't know.

361
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,069
(Blue Salt)

362
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,130
It's me.

363
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:39,269
I came...

364
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,910
to tell you something
for the last time.

365
00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:45,170
You're the one...

366
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,509
who saved me 20 years ago.

367
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,549
Thank you.

368
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,659
Also, you were the first person...

369
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,019
to tell me that I was special...

370
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:06,330
and that I was a good person.

371
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,900
Thank you for that as well.

372
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:16,469
Eat your favorite dishes,

373
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:18,170
watch your favorite shows,

374
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:20,309
and buy whatever you like.

375
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,610
Try to take your mind off of it.

376
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,609
Going for a walk?

377
00:35:02,149 --> 00:35:03,189
Let me join you.

378
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:10,129
Oh, right.

379
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,299
Did you make up
with that handsome psychic...

380
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:15,000
last night?

381
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:19,799
Gosh, you refused to see him,
didn't you?

382
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:21,939
I told you I'm retiring.

383
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:24,569
What's there to talk about
with a psychic?

384
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,879
Don't push away someone
who likes you.

385
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,680
It's not like that.

386
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,219
What do you mean?
I didn't mean anything romantic.

387
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:37,649
This is just a piece of life advice.

388
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,718
If you keep pushing people away
due to trivial reasons,

389
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,520
you'll eventually be all alone.

390
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,029
I don't care.

391
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,930
So? Will you cut ties
with Secretary Ju as well?

392
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,000
If you're going to live all alone
your entire life,

393
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,939
how's that any different
from becoming an unrested spirit?

394
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,619
I see. So Tae Jin said
this is the ledger...

395
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,489
from that employment agency?

396
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:17,489
He said he'd tell me
if he ever saw Chang Hwa.

397
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,299
One minute.

I'm looking for this man.

402
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:49,460
His name is Kim Tae Jin.

403
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,060
I don't know him.

404
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,830
Oh, is that so?

405
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,029
All right.

406
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,839
"I don't know him."

407
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:05,609

What? That's his little gofer.

410
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,589
Okay. I got you.

411
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,330
Someone came here just a while ago,
looking for Tae Jin.

412
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,298
- Who was it?
- Beats me.

413
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:35,259
But I don't think he was
one of Do Hak Sung's men.

Why are you being annoying
and tailing me?

416
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,468
I want to meet with Tae Jin.

417
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:04,068
And why is that?

418
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:06,299
I want to buy the memorandum.

419
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,769
- What?
- Tell him, and he'll know.

420
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,439
Tell him I want to buy it...

421

for 135,720 dollars.

- Yes.

424
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,849
- Sorry?
- I'll tell him and let you know,

425
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,149
- so give me your number.
- Yes, sir.

It may not have been a townhouse,

428
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,629
but I wanted to get her
an apartment.

429
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:37,069
Fine.

430
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,299
I can always make more money.

431

What about Ms. Hong?
Did she not come with you?

436
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:15,870
I understand.

437
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:18,009
Every time she sees me,

438
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,709
she'll be reminded
of the painful past...

439
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,350
that she had desperately wanted
to forget.

440
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,049
The only thing I can do for her...

441
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,549
is to disappear.

442
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,960
What should we do?

443
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,370
I resent my uncle.

444
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:47,370
He shouldn't have started the fire.

445
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,409
He shouldn't have taken those lives.

446
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,910
Don't despise him.

447
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:54,278
Do Hak Sung is to blame here.

448
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:56,179
Let's be frank.
If it wasn't for him,

449
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,180
do you think your uncle
would've done such a thing?

450
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,960
In Bum,
let's find that memorandum...

Are you sure it's Chang Hwa?

Yes. I found this
in your son's pocket.

Gosh. Whenever
you were at my restaurant,

529
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:35,910
you always reminded me of my son.

to see me here.

what I did was best for you.

00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,680
But I was arrogant.

You don't need to make me
feel better.

I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

I don't want you to do that.
