Hey, get up.

00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:23,035

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,915
Homes where you feel a chill
at the height of summer.

10
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,690
Homes where you see spirits
during sleep paralysis.

11
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,029
Homes in which every resident...

12
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,124
goes either mad or dead.

13
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,400
In other words,
even if it is a haunted house,

14
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
we don't care.

15
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,169
Daebak Realty will work
quickly and accurately...

16
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,200
to sell your house
at a satisfactory price.

17
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,109
We promise a one-stop-shop
for services.

18
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:53,109
By "satisfactory price", you mean...

19
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:55,408
Of course, it's the market price.

20
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,675
So to conclude,

21
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,820
you're saying that you hear
footsteps every night at midnight...

22
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,985
on a deserted rooftop, yes?

23
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,384
Yes, it gives me goosebumps.

24
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,084
Did anyone die in the building
recently?

25
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,529
She is the CEO of Daebak Realty,
Ms. Hong Ji A.

26
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:53,965
I see.

27
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,805
Have you ever killed anyone before?

28
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,940
Excuse me?

29
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,810
It's a standard question
for our process.

30
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,049
When we perform an exorcism,
the most important thing is...

31
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,745
is to confirm the identity
of the unrested spirit.

32
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,349
To be honest,

33
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:14,620
there was one new tenant
who was evicted last year.

34
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,715
Whom I heard was...

35
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,055
killed in a car accident.

36
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,739
But how does an exorcism work?

37
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:29,838
Should I prepare food and such
like for a rite?

38
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,334
What's the point of giving food
to bodiless spirits?

39
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,934
To mock them?

40
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,644
Let's go.

41
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,219
What?

42
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,675
You're going right now
to do the exorcism?

43
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:47,055
Before that, I need to confirm
there really is an unrested spirit.

44
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,384
Even the sound of a cat...

45
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,155
can sound like a vengeful spirit...

46
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,124
to a guilty person.

47
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,764
Our CEO tends to be impatient.

48
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,374
She doesn't like to waste time.

Who are you?

00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,624
Why are you taking photos
of someone else's house?

54
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,124
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,524
Why are you hiding what you took?

56
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:07,969
What is this?

57
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:10,605
Are you perhaps the owner
of this house?

58
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,805
Yes.

59
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:16,279
Recently, have you noticed
electronic appliances flickering...

60
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,479
or turning off for no reason?

61
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,650
That's true.

62
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,014
Just a week ago,
there was a blackout for no reason.

63
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,384
With this much energy,

64
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,915
I'm sure you heard
some strange noises as well.

65
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,754
Every night, I hear a man weeping.

66
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,390
I'm too terrified to sleep,

67
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,454
and I can't tell anyone about it
because the house price may drop.

68
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,324
Let's go inside.

69
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,705
It's more serious than I thought.

70
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,634
Do you have any idea
whose spirit it could be?

71
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,174
Right.

72
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,650
The former landlord...

73
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,044
committed suicide
after this house was auctioned off.

74
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,115
I knew it.

75
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,784
So you're saying his spirit
lives here.

76
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:04,355
I've only read about these cases
in research papers.

77
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:05,624
It's amazing.

78
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:06,924
Research papers?

79
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,365
Actually,

80
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,799
I'm a researcher
from Stanford University,

81
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,240
studying scalar energy.

82
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,169
I'm sure you've heard
that there's a close connection...

83
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:17,764
between electromagnetic field
and health.

84
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:19,809
I'm studying the correlation
between that theory...

85
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,579
and spiritual phenomena.

86
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:22,709
Simply put,

87
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,150
I emit energy into places like this
where spirits lurk,

88
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,245
to cast them away.

89
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,245
So you'll cast the spirits away?

90
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:32,745
Correct. However,

91
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,754
we must install
the equipment we've developed.

92
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:41,760
- How much is it?
- No, we should pay you instead.

After all, you're offering a place
for us to do our research.

What do you say to 500 dollars?

97
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,735
You'll cast the spirit away
and pay me as well?

We have a limited amount.

Red ginseng.

104
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,919
It's more expensive
than when I bought it.

106

great for everyday wear.

Unrested spirits don't have bodies,

166

after they enter a psychic's body.

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,130
Is it not dangerous?

00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,140

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,845
Salt.

182
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,054
Please step over the salt.

183
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,245
What a pity.
You've used up your energy already.

184
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,620
Those whose salt has changed color
may stay.

185
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,390
The rest of you, please leave.

186
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,250
I'll wire you the interview fee.

187
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,554
Goodbye.

188
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,315
Goodbye.

189
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,254
Nice.

190
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:55,394
All right.

191
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,965
This is the last test.

192
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,980
Climbing all the way
up the stairs is...

193
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,405
your final test.

194
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,044
Really?

195
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,519
I'll be paid 1,000 dollars
for just going up these stairs?

196
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,390
You bet. You'll be paid extra
for succeeding.

197
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,784
Extra?

198
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:41,735
Hyung Sik, you're next.

199
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,475
Okay.

200
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,754
I can do it.

201
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,764
Who's going to get rid of them?

202
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,175
We both will.

203
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,044
I guess the psychic
we're looking for isn't here today.

204
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,614
I wonder if there is such a psychic.

205
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,245
That didn't get rid of
the spirit for good?

206
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,810
As I told you the other day,

207
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,985
the device only emits energy
to cast away the spirits.

208
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,784
I see. It can only cast them away.

209
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,415
I was happy the spirits went away
with the device.

210
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,284
But without the device,
the spirit will come back, right?

211
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,395
Unfortunately, probably.

212
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,830
Leave it here.

213
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,969
I'll let you collect data
from my place for free.

214
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:17,840
Well, as I explained before,
this is for my research.

215
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,735
So I need data
from a wide array of locations.

216
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:22,175
I am very sorry.

217
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,179
Doctor, I'll disassemble it now.

218
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,504
Wait!

219
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,445
Sir.

220
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,614
Doctor.

221
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,125
Okay.

222
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,625
All right.

223
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,264
- Bye.
- How trustworthy.

224
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,844
Ta-da!

225
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,080
Gosh. He mobilizes thugs...

226
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,850
to buy properties at a cheap price
from the poor,

227
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,050
and yet he's scared of spirits.

228
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,519
He's terrified because he's done
a lot of shady stuff.

229
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,320
Why don't we go
and spend our hard-earned cash?

230
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,485
Okay.

231
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,864
(Joeun Bank)

232
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:33,245
Oh, my.

233
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,679
How much is the daily rental fee?

234
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,245
Is that important right now?

235
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,820
Think about how happy
this baby can make me for the day.

236
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,860
That's important.

237
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,620
You are born to be a fraud.

238
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,860
You are born to be an average Joe.

239
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,800
- Come on.
- You are the only fraud...

240
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,229
who saves money in a bank.

241
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:52,800
You never know how happy it is
to see your money pile up.

242
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,165
- I don't.
- Gosh.

243
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:55,864
Get in.

244
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:59,064
- Please get in.
- Thank you.

245
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,574
- I'll close the door for you.
- Okay.

246
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,050
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

247
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,175
Let's go!

248
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,419
This is it.

249
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:20,084
Put your hands up!

250
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:21,929
Come on!

251
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,560
Hey, hop in!

252
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,225
Hey, there's an empty seat. Get in!

253
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,550
- This is nice.
- Oh, my.

254
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,875
Who is this?

255
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:41,044
(Kim Tae Jin)

256
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,019
Come on.

257
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,145
What is it?

258
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,344
It's Mr. Kim from Taejin Nightclub.

259
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,719
He's being so petty
over 50,000 dollars. Gosh.

260
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:52,189
I didn't even like his face
to begin with.

261
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:54,225
He ruined my mood.

262
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,554
(Taejin Nightclub)

263
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,625
What?

264
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,909
- What is it?
- In Bum!

265
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:07,610
In Bum, answer your phone!

266
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,004
Answer your phone, please!

267
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,880
- Oh In Bum!
- What do we do?

268
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,044
- In Bum!
- I don't know.

269
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,445
What? Look at that punk.

270
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:22,290
- Act cool.
- Block his car!

271
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,554
Come on, step on it!

272
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,435
Hey, step on it! Faster!

273
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:42,774
If you miss him,
you're not going home tonight.

274
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,004
Go!

275
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:47,309
Darn it.

276
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,645
Hey, what do we do now?

277
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,215
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

278
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,084
Step on it. Come on, man.

279
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,354
- Hey.
- We got him.

280
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,754
Hey! Watch out!

281
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,199
- Hey! My goodness.
- Come on!

282
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:11,165
Hey, pull over! Pull over now.

283
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:14,334
Hey! No!

284
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:42,794
In Bum!

285
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,935
Oh In Bum!

286
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,774
I'll see you again.

287
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,975
Oh, my. Goodness.

288
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,475
Amazing!

289
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,019
Gosh. I told you to buy it
at the convenience store earlier.

290
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:03,955
You always drink
that expensive stuff.

291
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:08,094
Come on.
That won't look cool, you know.

292
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,465
This is it.

293
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:15,695
"Carpe diem." Seize the day.

294
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,304
What's the point of tomorrow's
dream car or dream house?

295
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,935
I might not even survive the night.

296
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,905
That's life.

297
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,445
Seriously.
Kids these days are so weak.

298
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,290
I understand
that their spiritual energy is weak.

299
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,044
But how come
no one can climb up the staircase?

300
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:39,685
Why are you sighing
as if it's the end of the world?

301
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:41,360
Hang in there.

302
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,225
We've always had trouble
finding the right psychic.

303
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,965
We are running out of time.

304
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,870
They will redevelop
this neighborhood pretty soon.

305
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,570
We can't stay here forever.

306
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,604
And I can't leave
my mom here all alone.

307
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,645
Did the thugs come back again?

308
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,614
Please don't tell me...

309
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,554
that you lost your temper
and beat them up.

310
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:13,524
- Ms. Joo.
- Right.

311
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,554
You are old enough.
You wouldn't be so reckless now.

312
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:25,004
What if there isn't any psychic
that can send my mom away,

313
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,604
What do I do?

314
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:41,290
Staying in this world...

315
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,784
as a spirit without a body is...

316
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,729
equivalent to standing outside
only in underwear...

317
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:49,655
when there's a snowstorm
in the middle of winter.

318
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,530
If it's that cold,
why wouldn't they just leave?

319
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,729
That sounds foolish.

320
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:56,469
They are so upset
and were unfairly treated...

321
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:57,735
that they couldn't leave.

322
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,804
We can help them forget
about their grudges,

323
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,375
so they can be happy
in a warm place.

324
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,254
Mom, you must be cold.

325
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:24,864
I'm sorry.

326
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:27,499
Gosh.

327
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:32,135
I'm really good at sending away
poltergeists in other houses.

328
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,804
But I can't seem to help you, Mom.

329
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,405
Sorry.

330
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,885
But don't forget that...

331
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,489
I'm Hong Ji A.

332
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:51,284
The daughter
of the great Hong Mi Jin.

333
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,425
I...

334
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,695
I will find the strongest psychic
and help you leave here.

335
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,995
You trust me, right?

336
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,405
I promise.

337
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:13,705
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

338
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,434
Gosh, you scared me.

339
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,505
This is so embarrassing.

340
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:28,904
Was it a dream?

341
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,315
A nightmare.

342
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:36,255
In Bum.

343
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:40,354
Never take this off.

344
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,985
Do you understand?

345
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,894
No, my poor son.

346
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:48,825
No.

347
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,964
There's no way our Sung Sik
committed suicide.

348
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,634
There's something wrong here.

349
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:59,505
Sung Sik!

350
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,589
Is that your goal?

351
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,589
I'm not even close yet.

352
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,854
I'm sure you're not.

353
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,630
There's no way to buy a house
in Korea without a loan,

354
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,364
no matter how hard you save.

355
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,269
Besides, there's no one...

356
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:26,305
who would lend us money
except for loan sharks.

357
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:27,569
I see.

358
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,569
Just go back to sleep.

359
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,680
Keep on sleeping
and having nightmares.

360
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,374
Why are you ruining my healing time?

361
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:38,414
So for our hardworking Chief Heo
to buy his house soon,

362
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,015
I found a big job.

363
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,359
- A big one?
- Yes.

364
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:47,624
- How big?
- This big.

365
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,285
Dream Officetel.

366
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,559
Last year, the construction company
building it went bankrupt,

367
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,069
so it is unfinished.

368
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:55,130
Two victims who had bought
lots in the building...

369
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,795
committed suicide...

370
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,410
from the roof of that building.

371
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,369
I said I'll give you
a discount on your rent.

372
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:02,980
The current building owner
bought the building...

373
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,104
- and finished the construction.
- Can you even say that?

374
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,250
But there are rumors
that everyone who moves in...

375
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,944
either goes mad or gets killed
by a spirit.

376
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:13,345
It's perfect for our work.

377
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:15,819
This is our goal.

378
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:18,289
This is the room purchased
by the investors who died.

379
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:19,654
Room 401.

380
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:22,485
Okay.

381
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,869
(Commercial Space for Rent)

382
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,295
Fourth floor.

383
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:36,275
You said you were coming,
why aren't you here?

384
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:38,305
What is it?

385
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,575
What? A spirit?

386
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,144
Fine, tell him not to bother.

387
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,654
I told you we should request
an exorcism from Professor Oh.

388
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:55,059
As soon as they install
the device invented in the U.S...

389
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,960
You think spirits
are like mosquitos?

390
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,725
How can you catch them
with an electronic device?

391
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,525
My goodness.

392
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,140
- Where are you going?
- To take a dump.

393
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,434
All this worthless chatter is
giving me a stomachache.

394
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,640
Great, we've now set the mood.

395
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,035
Once the building owner is out,
let's add the sound and wrap it up.

396
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,434
Okay.

397
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,250
An exorcism, of all things.

398
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,614
Where does my wife think
I'll get the money for that?

399
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,250
What's going on now?
The maintenance is terrible.

400
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,315
They haven't even
replaced the lights properly.

401
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,555
What?

402
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,944
Who's there?

403
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,835
Honey?

404
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,735
- What's wrong with him?
- He's not supposed to be out yet.

405
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,975
Honey?

406
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,720
What?

407
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,055
What did you do?

408
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,954
- I didn't do anything.
- Then what's going on?

409
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,894
This was the important part.

410
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:46,664
- This shouldn't be happening.
- Fix it, quickly.

411
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,235
Honey, what's wrong?

412
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:59,374
Honey, what's wrong?

413
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,444
Honey, what are you doing there?

414
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:12,089
- What's going on? What's happening?
- Honey...

415
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:13,755
What happened?

416
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:16,654
Get down from there.

417
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:22,495
- Are you insane?
- What just happened?

418
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,404
I wasn't trying to die.

419
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,780
Then why were you up there?

420
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,404
I don't know why I ended up there.

421
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,975
What's going on.

422
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,075
It's working.

423
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,889
What happened?
Did you deploy the hologram?

424
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,845
I don't think so.

425
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,185
Gosh.

426
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:46,984
It's the owner's wife.

427
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,725
Yes, hello.

428
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:54,769
It's not difficult to install
those devices, no,

429
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:56,900
but you said your husband
was opposed to them earlier.

430
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,940
It doesn't matter.

431
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,440
Please install them right away.

432
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,035
All right. Okay.

433
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,605
It's an okay.

434
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,245
All right.

435
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,444
What do you mean, an exorcism?

436
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,845
Isn't that just a ploy to scam me?

437
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,355
The exorcism is free.

438
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,719
Like other realty firms,

439
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,254
we ask only for a commission
once the sale has been completed.

440
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,524
You're telling the truth, right?

441
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,294
You'd better not say something else
later on.

442
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,234
Did you see the spirit yourself?

443
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,834
No.

444
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:43,645
Wait, I think I did.

445
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,979
Did you?

446
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,745
I suddenly saw my wife...

447
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:49,855
throwing herself off the building.

448
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:52,555
But when I came to,
I was the one standing on the edge.

449
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,030
It was like I was possessed
by a spirit.

450
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,325
You were possessed.

451
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,530
Right?

452
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,099
Is there anything suspicious
about the building?

453
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:04,395
Honestly, I bought it at auction.

454
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,134
Later, I found out that two
investors fell to their deaths.

455
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,205
If you don't buy this,
you'd be a fool.

456
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:18,719
I've never seen such a good site
for sale in my entire career.

457
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,690
I don't have the money to buy
a commercial building.

458
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,119
It's not a matter of money.

459
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,090
No one uses their own money
to invest these days.

460
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,754
Everyone gets a loan.

461
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,230
A loan?

462
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,800
But what about the interest?

463
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,000
You're so frustrating.

464
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,199
If you get a year's worth
of commercial rent,

465
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,435
you can make back your money
with extra more.

466
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:41,409
Remember that naive kid, Jae Hoon?

467
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,340
Everyone said he was a fool
when he bought his house.

468
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,774
But look what's happened now.
It rose 300,000 dollars in a year.

469
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,375
The Korean real estate market is
invincible.

470
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,590
They said I can pay back interest
and the original investment...

471
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,590
after getting just a year's rent
from the commercial spaces.

472
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,860
If it were that easy to make money,

473
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,789
everyone in the world would be rich.

474
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,495
Father, this is how everyone
makes money these days.

475
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,599
If they all decide to die,
will you do the same?

476
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,294
Why are you swayed by others?

477
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,495
Is it wrong to want to live
like others?

478
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,570
I...

479
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,570
While my friends in university
didn't worry about their tuition...

480
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,935
and focused on their study,

481
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,734
I worked three part-time jobs.

482
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:23,674
Had you given me just as much
as the other parents did...

483
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,289
Young Do, what's going on?

484
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,349
- Bankrupt?
- I'm sorry.

485
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,159
- I'm sorry!
- I don't know. I'm a victim too.

486
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,725
Oh, gosh! I'm done for!

487
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,230
Goodness!

488
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,125
What should I do?

489
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,400
- No!
- What should I do?

490
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,869
- Goodness.
- What about my money?

491
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:47,440
Goodness!

492
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,369
Selling your soul, being in debt,

493
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,975
a negative account,
and panic buying.

494
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,710
Believing that Korean real estate
was invincible,

495
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:00,384
what made these two youngsters
commit suicide?

496
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,355
This happened last year.

497
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,619
(Dream Officetel Case)

498
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,519
The construction industry
went bankrupt,

499
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,855
leaving the two victims
to lose ownership.

500
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,030
They jumped off
the half-built building together.

501
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,464
They were Yang Woo Jin
and Nam Young Do.

502
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,225
These 30-year-olds were friends.

503
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:19,400
If they jumped to their deaths,
then it's similar to how...

504
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,570
the building owners attempted to do
the same when they were possessed.

505
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,710
The police concluded
that they had committed suicide...

506
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,139
because they couldn't pay
the interest...

507
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:27,605
after selling their souls
to the devil to get a loan.

508
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,904
Selling souls to the devil?

509
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:34,845
They have no idea
what that even means.

510
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:38,214
It just means
that they were that desperate.

511
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,960
What's important is identifying...

512
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,555
whose unrested spirit
is wandering around.

513
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,654
Let me check his face.

514
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,435
(Commercial Space for Rent)

515
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,955
Fourth floor.

516
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,464
How long will you keep this up?

517
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,814
I know you're still roaming around
because you feel resentment.

518
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:23,325
I'm sure you hate
the person responsible...

519
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,325
for your death
and those who ridiculed you.

520
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,234
You can kill everyone on this earth,
and still, nothing will change.

521
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,364
You'll be the only one in pain.

522
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,725
Two revengeful spirits are
tied to each other.

523
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:02,369
Secretary Joo, I've checked.

524
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:04,935
We'll get to work tomorrow midnight,
so look for a buyer.

525
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,205
What's her deal?

526
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,245
Is she insane?

527
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:22,345
You were here already.

528
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,185
I inspected the device
before disassembling it.

529
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,289
What? Disassemble?

530
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:29,825
Thanks to your device,
I could get a good night's sleep.

531
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,455
How much is it? I'll buy it.

532
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:35,024
This is why I called you.

533
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,199
It's for research only, so...

534
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,495
- What are you doing here?
- Honey.

535
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,004
This is Doctor Oh In Bum.

536
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,510

Honey. Come here.

00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,754
I've put this building
on the market already.

542
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:01,325
They're going to get rid
of all the spirits.

543
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:04,254
What kind of realty performs
exorcisms?

544
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,429
You got scammed.

545
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:07,630
How much more do they want?

546
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,924
What do you take me for?

547
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,665
They've confirmed that
they'll only get the commission.

548
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:14,610
Let them do whatever they want
to get rid of the spirits.

549
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,869
They promised to sell it
at the same price...

550
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,234
as other buildings in this area,
so let's wait.

551
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,334

552
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,475
- Same price?
- That's right.

00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,685
Sure.

- You heard, right?
- They'll sell it at market price?

559
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,380
That realty is great at their job.

560
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,075
They're not selling anything.

561
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,944
They'll probably bail after
receiving a heavy pre-payment.

562
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,614

in this world.

an exorcism.

to see.

Of course.

691
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,530
I must stuff myself,

692
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,165
so I feel less cold
during the exorcism later.

693
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,134

694
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:42,834

your body temperature...

697
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,975
it drops because...

698
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,515

Did you come up with a plan
for the tied-up spirits?

701
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,294
It will be hard to separate them
before they take up bodies.

702
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:12,400
So after I put both of them
into Hyung Sik's body,

703

I need to stab him
twice consecutively.

704
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,309
Will you tell him
that you will stab him twice?

705
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:19,674
Why would I?

706
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:21,475
Right.

707
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,044

00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:41,670
The building owner promised
the fourth floor will be empty.

714
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,199
The elevators and staircases will...

715
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,665
be sealed off
from 11:30 p.m. to 1 a.m.

716
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:17,125
Okay. Looking good.

717
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:20,134
Let's make sure
the sounds come out on time.

718
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:24,875
(Yang Woo Jin)

719
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:39,714
(Nam Young Do)

720
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,864
(Yang Woo Jin)

721
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:18,400
Should I pack extra rock salt?

722
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,125
I already did.

723
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:25,535
Let's go.

724
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,694
Okay.

725
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,969
Don't salt the door.
The spirits must enter.

726
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:03,935
Gosh. I've been doing this
for six months now.

727
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,395
I salted all over here
except for the door.

728
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,395
- Okay.
- What are they doing?

729
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,199
Gosh.
Are they trying to catch a raccoon?

730
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:33,039
Oh, my. No one is watching.
They even lit an incense.

731
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:34,309
And she's got
a cool incense burner too.

732
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:37,535
Hey, be quiet.
Let's start with the sounds first.

733
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:45,814
I told you to start with the sounds.
Why are you changing the lights?

734
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,214
Chief Heo.

735
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,915
Mr. Oh, In Bum.

736
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:53,714
Why isn't he answering?

737
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:59,095
What? What's wrong with this now?

738
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,765
What is he doing?

739
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,564
Hey. Ji Chul!

740
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,064
Can't you hear me?

741
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,444
Why is it so chilly in here?

742
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:26,714
Fourth floor.

743
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,334
There's no point in struggling.

744
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:14,964
Let's not drag this out
and end it quickly.

745
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,605
Hyung Sik, take it off.

746
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,895
You.

747
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,134
What was that?

748
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,305
Why are they fighting
all of a sudden?

749
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,114
Hey.

750
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:07,584
Stay still, you crazy fool.

751
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,884
I'll kill them all.

752
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,564
Young Do.

753
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:26,000
Please stop this now.

754
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,095
Don't try to stop me.

755
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:29,869
I'll burn this building down,

756
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:31,039
and then I'll kill myself.

757
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:32,674
Don't you feel how unfair it is?

758
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,205
Unfair?

759
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,714
How can you say that to me?

760
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,050
If it weren't for you,

761
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,884
I wouldn't be in this mess.

762
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,325
Darn it!

763
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,699
You and I were both too greedy
for our own good.

764
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:57,030
We didn't invest, we gambled.

765
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,595
But why are you blaming others?

766
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,000
I'm going to quit now
and start over.

767
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,864
You should come to your senses too.

768
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,105
Shut up.

769
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:08,205
You're the one who needs to wake up.

770
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,845
No matter how hard I struggle,

771
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:14,785
I'll end up repaying my debts
for the rest of my life.

772
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:19,190
You might be happy working
in manual labor forever,

773
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,484
but not me.

774
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:21,984
I'd rather die...

775
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,225
than live like that.

776
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,225
Nam Young Do.

777
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:34,234
You're so pitiful.

778
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,964
Pitiful?

779
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:03,895
Do you think I'm pitiful?

780
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,599
Who do you think you are,
calling me pitiful?

781
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:07,734
Darn.

782
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,274
What?

783
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:20,314
Hey.

784
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,084
You're not dead, right?

785
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:25,785
Woo Jin?

786
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:28,384
Hey, Woo Jin.

787
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:31,455
Woo Jin, Woo Jin!

788
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,884
I didn't do anything wrong.

789
01:01:57,519 --> 01:01:59,084
I don't know anything.

790
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,084
I didn't do anything wrong.

791
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,225
You came here alone,

792
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,694
all by yourself.

793
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,165
Then you drank alone...

794
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,904
and fell off.

795
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,654
(To my father, from Woo Jin.)

796
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:43,395
Young Do.

797
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:44,834
Let go.

798
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:46,739
You're going to make me fall too.

799
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:48,710
Young Do, please.

800
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,309
- Let go!
- Please, Young Do.

801
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,510
Please save me.

802
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,605
- Please, save me.
- No.

803
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,349
Please.

804
01:02:56,349 --> 01:02:58,714
No!

805
01:03:08,429 --> 01:03:09,625
It's so unfair.

806
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:12,625
I didn't do anything wrong.

807
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:14,754
I...

808
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:19,095
This is why I hate this work.

809
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,444
Ms. Hong! It's me.

810
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,415
Where did Yang Woo Jin go?

811
01:03:55,769 --> 01:03:56,864
Hey Fraud.

812
01:03:58,179 --> 01:03:59,605
You were a psychic?

813
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:49,090
(Sell Your Haunted House)

814
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,489
What, a psychic?

815
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:53,130
That's what we call people
easily possessed by spirits.

816
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,000
I knew I got a bad feeling
from that woman. She's insane.

817
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,199
Is something wrong?

818
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:59,269
I keep thinking of
that fraud psychic.

819
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:00,340
Did you fall for him?

820
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,710
The biggest private art museum
in Korea.

821
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:05,110
They had a new construction
planned in Yongin,

822
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,380
but it isn't proceeding because
of rumors of a spirit appearing.

823
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,179
I hate people saying
stuff about spirits.

824
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:11,210
It's that ghost.

825
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,250
It disappeared into the museum,

826
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,719
but I'll need to come back
during the day to confirm.

827
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:15,719
Installation complete.

828
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:16,719
Oh In Bum.

829
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:19,420
Don't move a single step
until I say it's all right.

830
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,625
It'll cause me more trouble
if something happens to you already.
