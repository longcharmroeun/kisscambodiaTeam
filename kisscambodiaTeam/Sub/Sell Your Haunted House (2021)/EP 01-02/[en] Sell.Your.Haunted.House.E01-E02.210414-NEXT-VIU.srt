Hey, get up.

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,053

00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:32,933
Homes where you feel a chill at the height of summer.

10
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,708
Homes where you see spirits during sleep paralysis.

11
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,039
Homes in which every resident...

12
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,134
goes either mad or dead.

13
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,409
In other words, even if it is a haunted house,

14
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,018
we don't care.

15
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:47,188
Daebak Realty will work quickly and accurately...

16
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:49,219
to sell your house at a satisfactory price.

17
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:51,119
We promise a one-stop-shop for services.

18
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,119
By "satisfactory price", you mean...

19
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,428
Of course, it's the market price.

20
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,694
So to conclude,

21
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,828
you're saying that you hear footsteps every night at midnight...

22
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:03,993
on a deserted rooftop, yes?

23
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:09,404
Yes, it gives me goosebumps.

24
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:12,103
Did anyone die in the building recently?

25
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:52,549
She is the CEO of Daebak Realty, Ms. Hong Ji A.

26
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:53,983
I see.

27
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,814
Have you ever killed anyone before?

28
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,958
Excuse me?

29
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,828
It's a standard question for our process.

30
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:06,059
When we perform an exorcism, the most important thing is...

31
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,764
is to confirm the identity of the unrested spirit.

32
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:12,369
To be honest,

33
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:14,638
there was one new tenant who was evicted last year.

34
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:15,733
Whom I heard was...

35
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,074
killed in a car accident.

36
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,748
But how does an exorcism work?

37
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:29,848
Should I prepare food and such like for a rite?

38
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:33,353
What's the point of giving food to bodiless spirits?

39
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,954
To mock them?

40
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,654
Let's go.

41
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:40,229
What?

42
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,694
You're going right now to do the exorcism?

43
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:47,064
Before that, I need to confirm there really is an unrested spirit.

44
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,404
Even the sound of a cat...

45
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,173
can sound like a vengeful spirit...

46
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:56,144
to a guilty person.

47
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,783
Our CEO tends to be impatient.

48
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,384
She doesn't like to waste time.

Who are you?

53
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,634
Why are you taking photos of someone else's house?

54
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,144
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:04,543
Why are you hiding what you took?

56
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:07,989
What is this?

57
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,613
Are you perhaps the owner of this house?

58
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,814
Yes.

59
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:16,289
Recently, have you noticed electronic appliances flickering...

60
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,498
or turning off for no reason?

61
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,659
That's true.

62
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:22,024
Just a week ago, there was a blackout for no reason.

63
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,394
With this much energy,

64
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,933
I'm sure you heard some strange noises as well.

65
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:29,764
Every night, I hear a man weeping.

66
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,409
I'm too terrified to sleep,

67
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,474
and I can't tell anyone about it because the house price may drop.

68
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,344
Let's go inside.

69
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,713
It's more serious than I thought.

70
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:48,654
Do you have any idea whose spirit it could be?

71
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,183
Right.

72
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:51,659
The former landlord...

73
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,063
committed suicide after this house was auctioned off.

74
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,124
I knew it.

75
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,793
So you're saying his spirit lives here.

76
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:04,374
I've only read about these cases in research papers.

77
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:05,634
It's amazing.

78
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:06,933
Research papers?

79
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,374
Actually,

80
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:12,818
I'm a researcher from Stanford University,

81
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,249
studying scalar energy.

82
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,188
I'm sure you've heard that there's a close connection...

83
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,783
between electromagnetic field and health.

84
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,818
I'm studying the correlation between that theory...

85
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,588
and spiritual phenomena.

86
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:22,728
Simply put,

87
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,159
I emit energy into places like this where spirits lurk,

88
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,264
to cast them away.

89
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,264
So you'll cast the spirits away?

90
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:32,764
Correct. However,

91
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:36,764
we must install the equipment we've developed.

92
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,779
- How much is it? - No, we should pay you instead.

93

After all, you're offering a place for us to do our research.

What do you say to 500 dollars?

97
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:53,754
You'll cast the spirit away and pay me as well?

Red ginseng.

104
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:38,938
It's more expensive than when I bought it.

No way.

This is a unique brand.

112

Psychics are absolutely needed when exorcists are doing their work.

Unrested spirits don't have bodies,

166

after they enter a psychic's body.

168
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:40,937

169

00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,279
Excuse me.

174
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,149
Is it not dangerous?

175
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:54,149
Such as...

176
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,318
side effects?

00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,228
What's the best ingredient worldwide...

180
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,033
for casting away spirits?

181
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:13,864

00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,629
Those whose salt has changed color may stay.

185
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,399
The rest of you, please leave.

186
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,269
I'll wire you the interview fee.

187
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:47,563
Goodbye.

188
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,333
Goodbye.

189
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,274
Nice.

190
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:55,404
All right.

191
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,974
This is the last test.

192
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:09,989
Climbing all the way up the stairs is...

193
00:17:09,989 --> 00:17:11,423
your final test.

194
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,054
Really?

195
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,529
I'll be paid 1,000 dollars for just going up these stairs?

196
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:19,398
You bet. You'll be paid extra for succeeding.

197
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,794
Extra?

198
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,753
Hyung Sik, you're next.

199
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:44,483
Okay.

200
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:55,763
I can do it.

201
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,784
Who's going to get rid of them?

202
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:15,253
We both will.

203
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:26,134
I guess the psychic we're looking for isn't here today.

204
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,703
I wonder if there is such a psychic.

205
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,324
That didn't get rid of the spirit for good?

206
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:53,898
As I told you the other day,

207
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:58,064
the device only emits energy to cast away the spirits.

208
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,864
I see. It can only cast them away.

209
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,503
I was happy the spirits went away with the device.

210
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,374
But without the device, the spirit will come back, right?

211
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,473
Unfortunately, probably.

212
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,918
Leave it here.

213
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,049
I'll let you collect data from my place for free.

214
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,918
Well, as I explained before, this is for my research.

215
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:19,814
So I need data from a wide array of locations.

216
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:22,253
I am very sorry.

217
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:24,259
Doctor, I'll disassemble it now.

218
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:25,594
Wait!

219
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:28,523
Sir.

220
00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:30,693
Doctor.

221
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:43,203
Okay.

222
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:45,713
All right.

223
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:49,344
- Bye. - How trustworthy.

224
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,923
Ta-da!

225
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,158
Gosh. He mobilizes thugs...

226
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,928
to buy properties at a cheap price from the poor,

227
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:04,128
and yet he's scared of spirits.

228
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,598
He's terrified because he's done a lot of shady stuff.

229
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:10,408
Why don't we go and spend our hard-earned cash?

230
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:11,574
Okay.

231
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:17,943
(Joeun Bank)

232
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,324
Oh, my.

233
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,769
How much is the daily rental fee?

234
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,324
Is that important right now?

235
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,898
Think about how happy this baby can make me for the day.

236
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:40,939
That's important.

237
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,709
You are born to be a fraud.

238
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,939
You are born to be an average Joe.

239
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,878
- Come on. - You are the only fraud...

240
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:50,309
who saves money in a bank.

241
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,878
You never know how happy it is to see your money pile up.

242
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,243
- I don't. - Gosh.

243
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:55,943
Get in.

244
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,154
- Please get in. - Thank you.

245
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:02,654
- I'll close the door for you. - Okay.

246
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:09,128
- Let's go. - Let's go.

247
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,263
Let's go!

248
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:17,509
This is it.

249
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,173
Put your hands up!

250
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,009
Come on!

251
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:23,648
Hey, hop in!

252
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:26,314
Hey, there's an empty seat. Get in!

253
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:37,628
- This is nice. - Oh, my.

254
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:38,953
Who is this?

255
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,124
(Kim Tae Jin)

256
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:43,098
Come on.

257
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:44,223
What is it?

258
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:46,433
It's Mr. Kim from Taejin Nightclub.

259
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:49,809
He's being so petty over 50,000 dollars. Gosh.

260
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,279
I didn't even like his face to begin with.

261
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,304
He ruined my mood.

262
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,644
(Taejin Nightclub)

263
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:00,713
What?

264
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,989
- What is it? - In Bum!

265
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:07,689
In Bum, answer your phone!

266
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:10,084
Answer your phone, please!

267
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,959
- Oh In Bum! - What do we do?

268
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:15,124
- In Bum! - I don't know.

269
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:18,534
What? Look at that punk.

270
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,368
- Act cool. - Block his car!

271
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:24,634
Come on, step on it!

272
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,513
Hey, step on it! Faster!

273
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,854
If you miss him, you're not going home tonight.

274
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,094
Go!

275
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:47,397
Darn it.

276
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:49,723
Hey, what do we do now?

277
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:54,294
- Hold tight. - Okay.

278
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,163
Step on it. Come on, man.

279
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:01,433
- Hey. - We got him.

280
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,844
Hey! Watch out!

281
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:08,289
- Hey! My goodness. - Come on!

282
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:11,243
Hey, pull over! Pull over now.

283
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:14,413
Hey! No!

284
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,884
In Bum!

285
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:45,013
Oh In Bum!

286
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,854
I'll see you again.

287
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,054
Oh, my. Goodness.

288
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:56,564
Amazing!

289
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:02,108
Gosh. I told you to buy it at the convenience store earlier.

290
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,034
You always drink that expensive stuff.

291
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,173
Come on. That won't look cool, you know.

292
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,544
This is it.

293
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:15,784
"Carpe diem." Seize the day.

294
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,384
What's the point of tomorrow's dream car or dream house?

295
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:23,023
I might not even survive the night.

296
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,993
That's life.

297
00:24:26,158 --> 00:24:28,523
Seriously. Kids these days are so weak.

298
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,368
I understand that their spiritual energy is weak.

299
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:34,134
But how come no one can climb up the staircase?

300
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,773
Why are you sighing as if it's the end of the world?

301
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,439
Hang in there.

302
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,304
We've always had trouble finding the right psychic.

303
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:47,044
We are running out of time.

304
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,949
They will redevelop this neighborhood pretty soon.

305
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,658
We can't stay here forever.

306
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,683
And I can't leave my mom here all alone.

307
00:24:56,658 --> 00:24:58,723
Did the thugs come back again?

308
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,693
Please don't tell me...

309
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,634
that you lost your temper and beat them up.

310
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:13,604
- Ms. Joo. - Right.

311
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,644
You are old enough. You wouldn't be so reckless now.

312
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:25,084
What if there isn't any psychic that can send my mom away,

313
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:27,683
What do I do?

314
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:41,368
Staying in this world...

315
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:43,864
as a spirit without a body is...

316
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:46,809
equivalent to standing outside only in underwear...

317
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:49,743
when there's a snowstorm in the middle of winter.

318
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:52,618
If it's that cold, why wouldn't they just leave?

319
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:53,818
That sounds foolish.

320
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,549
They are so upset and were unfairly treated...

321
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:57,814
that they couldn't leave.

322
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:02,884
We can help them forget about their grudges,

323
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:05,453
so they can be happy in a warm place.

324
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:21,334
Mom, you must be cold.

325
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,943
I'm sorry.

326
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:27,578
Gosh.

327
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:32,213
I'm really good at sending away poltergeists in other houses.

328
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:35,884
But I can't seem to help you, Mom.

329
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,493
Sorry.

330
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:46,963
But don't forget that...

331
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,568
I'm Hong Ji A.

332
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,364
The daughter of the great Hong Mi Jin.

333
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,503
I...

334
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:59,773
I will find the strongest psychic and help you leave here.

335
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,084
You trust me, right?

336
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,383
I promise.

337
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:13,694
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

338
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,024
Gosh, you scared me.

339
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:27,333
So embarrassing.

340
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:29,064
Was it a dream?

341
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,303
A nightmare.

342
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:36,244
In Bum.

343
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:40,343
Never take this off.

344
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:41,983
Do you understand?

345
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,883
No, my poor son.

346
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:48,824
No.

347
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:52,953
There's no way our Sung Sik committed suicide.

348
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:55,623
There's something wrong here.

349
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,494
Sung Sik!

350
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:11,578
Is that your goal?

351
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:13,589
I'm not even close yet.

352
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,843
I'm sure you're not.

353
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:19,628
There's no way to buy a house in Korea without a loan,

354
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:21,354
no matter how hard you save.

355
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:24,259
Besides, there's no one...

356
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:26,294
who would lend us money except for loan sharks.

357
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:27,569
I see.

358
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,569
Just go back to sleep.

359
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:30,668
Keep on sleeping and having nightmares.

360
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,363
Why are you ruining my healing time?

361
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:38,404
So for our hardworking Chief Heo to buy his house soon,

362
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:42,003
I found a big job.

363
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:44,349
- A big one? - Yes.

364
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,613
- How big? - This big.

365
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,283
Dream Officetel.

366
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:51,559
Last year, the construction company building it went bankrupt,

367
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,059
so it is unfinished.

368
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,128
Two victims who had bought lots in the building...

369
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,794
committed suicide...

370
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,399
from the roof of that building.

371
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,369
I said I'll give you a discount on your rent.

372
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:02,968
The current building owner bought the building...

373
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,093
- and finished the construction. - Can you even say that?

374
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,239
But there are rumors that everyone who moves in...

375
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,934
either goes mad or gets killed by a spirit.

376
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:13,343
It's perfect for our work.

377
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:15,809
This is our goal.

378
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,278
This is the room purchased by the investors who died.

379
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:19,644
Room 401.

380
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:22,484
Okay.

381
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:28,859
(Commercial Space for Rent)

382
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:30,293
Fourth floor.

383
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,264
You said you were coming, why aren't you here?

384
00:30:37,098 --> 00:30:38,293
What is it?

385
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:41,563
What? A spirit?

386
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:46,133
Fine, tell him not to bother.

387
00:30:47,908 --> 00:30:51,644
I told you we should request an exorcism from Professor Oh.

388
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:55,049
As soon as they install the device invented in the U.S...

389
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:57,959
You think spirits are like mosquitos?

390
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,714
How can you catch them with an electronic device?

391
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:02,524
My goodness.

392
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:06,128
- Where are you going? - To take a dump.

393
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:08,424
All this worthless chatter is giving me a stomachache.

394
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:37,628
Great, we've now set the mood.

395
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:40,024
Once the building owner is out, let's add the sound and wrap it up.

396
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:41,424
Okay.

397
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,239
An exorcism, of all things.

398
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,603
Where does my wife think I'll get the money for that?

399
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,248
What's going on now? The maintenance is terrible.

400
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,313
They haven't even replaced the lights properly.

401
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:05,554
What?

402
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,933
Who's there?

403
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:18,824
Honey?

404
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:24,733
- What's wrong with him? - He's not supposed to be out yet.

405
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:32,973
Honey?

406
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:37,719
What?

407
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:39,043
What did you do?

408
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:41,944
- I didn't do anything. - Then what's going on?

409
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:43,884
This was the important part.

410
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,654
- This shouldn't be happening. - Fix it, quickly.

411
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,223
Honey, what's wrong?

412
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,363
Honey, what's wrong?

413
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:08,444
Honey, what are you doing there?

414
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,078
- What's going on? What's happening? - Honey...

415
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:13,743
What happened?

416
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:16,654
Get down from there.

417
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:22,483
- Are you insane? - What just happened?

418
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:26,394
I wasn't trying to die.

419
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,768
Then why were you up there?

420
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,394
I don't know why I ended up there.

421
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:34,964
What's going on.

422
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,074
It's working.

423
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,878
What happened? Did you deploy the hologram?

424
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,843
I don't think so.

425
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:44,173
Gosh.

426
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:46,983
It's the owner's wife.

427
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:50,714
Yes, hello.

428
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:54,758
It's not difficult to install those devices, no,

429
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,898
but you said your husband was opposed to them earlier.

430
00:34:56,898 --> 00:34:58,929
It doesn't matter.

431
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,429
Please install them right away.

432
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:03,024
All right. Okay.

433
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:04,593
It's an okay.

434
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,233
All right.

435
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:11,433
What do you mean, an exorcism?

436
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,843
Isn't that just a ploy to scam me?

437
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:17,343
The exorcism is free.

438
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:18,719
Like other realty firms,

439
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,243
we ask only for a commission once the sale has been completed.

440
00:35:22,148 --> 00:35:23,514
You're telling the truth, right?

441
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:27,283
You'd better not say something else later on.

442
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,223
Did you see the spirit yourself?

443
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:38,834
No.

444
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,634
Wait, I think I did.

445
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,978
Did you?

446
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:47,743
I suddenly saw my wife...

447
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,843
throwing herself off the building.

448
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:52,543
But when I came to, I was the one standing on the edge.

449
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,018
It was like I was possessed by a spirit.

450
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:57,314
You were possessed.

451
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,518
Right?

452
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:01,088
Is there anything suspicious about the building?

453
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:04,394
Honestly, I bought it at auction.

454
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:08,124
Later, I found out that two investors fell to their deaths.

455
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:12,194
If you don't buy this, you'd be a fool.

456
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:18,708
I've never seen such a good site for sale in my entire career.

457
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:21,679
I don't have the money to buy a commercial building.

458
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,109
It's not a matter of money.

459
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:25,078
No one uses their own money to invest these days.

460
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:26,743
Everyone gets a loan.

461
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,219
A loan?

462
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,789
But what about the interest?

463
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,989
You're so frustrating.

464
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:35,188
If you get a year's worth of commercial rent,

465
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:37,423
you can make back your money with extra more.

466
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:41,399
Remember that naive kid, Jae Hoon?

467
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,328
Everyone said he was a fool when he bought his house.

468
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:46,764
But look what's happened now. It rose 300,000 dollars in a year.

469
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:50,374
The Korean real estate market is invincible.

470
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:55,578
They said I can pay back interest and the original investment...

471
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:57,578
after getting just a year's rent from the commercial spaces.

472
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:59,848
If it were that easy to make money,

473
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:01,789
everyone in the world would be rich.

474
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,484
Father, this is how everyone makes money these days.

475
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:08,659
If they all decide to die, will you do the same?

476
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,354
Why are you swayed by others?

477
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:12,553
Is it wrong to want to live like others?

478
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:13,629
I...

479
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:15,629
While my friends in university didn't worry about their tuition...

480
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:16,994
and focused on their study,

481
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:19,793
I worked three part-time jobs.

482
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:23,734
Had you given me just as much as the other parents did...

483
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,348
Young Do, what's going on?

484
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:29,409
- Bankrupt? - I'm sorry.

485
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:31,218
- I'm sorry! - I don't know. I'm a victim too.

486
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:33,783
Oh, gosh! I'm done for!

487
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,289
Goodness!

488
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,183
What should I do?

489
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:43,458
- No! - What should I do?

490
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:45,929
- Goodness. - What about my money?

491
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,499
Goodness!

492
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,429
Selling your soul, being in debt,

493
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:52,033
a negative account, and panic buying.

494
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:55,769
Believing that Korean real estate was invincible,

495
00:37:55,769 --> 00:38:00,443
what made these two youngsters commit suicide?

496
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,404
This happened last year.

497
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:04,679
(Dream Officetel Case)

498
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,578
The construction industry went bankrupt,

499
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:07,913
leaving the two victims to lose ownership.

500
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:11,088
They jumped off the half-built building together.

501
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,514
They were Yang Woo Jin and Nam Young Do.

502
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:16,283
These 30-year-olds were friends.

503
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:19,458
If they jumped to their deaths, then it's similar to how...

504
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,629
the building owners attempted to do the same when they were possessed.

505
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:23,769
The police concluded that they had committed suicide...

506
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,198
because they couldn't pay the interest...

507
00:38:25,198 --> 00:38:27,663
after selling their souls to the devil to get a loan.

508
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:28,963
Selling souls to the devil?

509
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,904
They have no idea what that even means.

510
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,274
It just means that they were that desperate.

511
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:41,019
What's important is identifying...

512
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,614
whose unrested spirit is wandering around.

513
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:45,713
Let me check his face.

514
00:38:53,328 --> 00:38:54,494
(Commercial Space for Rent)

515
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:18,014
Fourth floor.

516
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:00,524
How long will you keep this up?

517
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,874
I know you're still roaming around because you feel resentment.

518
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:23,384
I'm sure you hate the person responsible...

519
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,384
for your death and those who ridiculed you.

520
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:30,283
You can kill everyone on this earth, and still, nothing will change.

521
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,423
You'll be the only one in pain.

522
00:40:51,218 --> 00:40:54,783
Two revengeful spirits are tied to each other.

523
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:02,429
Secretary Joo, I've checked.

524
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:04,994
We'll get to work tomorrow midnight, so look for a buyer.

525
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,264
What's her deal?

526
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:15,303
Is she insane?

527
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:22,404
You were here already.

528
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:25,244
I inspected the device before disassembling it.

529
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:27,348
What? Disassemble?

530
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:29,884
Thanks to your device, I could get a good night's sleep.

531
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:32,514
How much is it? I'll buy it.

532
00:41:32,988 --> 00:41:35,083
This is why I called you.

533
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:36,259
It's for research only, so...

534
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,553
- What are you doing here? - Honey.

535
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,063
This is Doctor Oh In Bum.

536
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:43,568
Remember him?

537
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,933
He's the researcher from Stanford University.

538
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,734
Hello, I'm Oh In Bum, a Doctor of the Paranormal.

539
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:51,073
Hello.

540
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,043
Honey. Come here.

541
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:59,813
I've put this building on the market already.

542
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:01,384
They're going to get rid of all the spirits.

543
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:04,313
What kind of realty performs exorcisms?

544
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,488
You got scammed.

545
00:42:06,488 --> 00:42:07,688

00:54:57,808 --> 00:55:00,979
Don't salt the door. The spirits must enter.

726
00:55:00,979 --> 00:55:03,943
Gosh. I've been doing this for six months now.

727
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:24,393
I salted all over here except for the door.

728
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:27,403
- Okay. - What are they doing?

729
00:55:27,808 --> 00:55:30,209
Gosh. Are they trying to catch a raccoon?

730
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:33,048
Oh, my. No one is watching. They even lit an incense.

731
00:55:33,048 --> 00:55:34,308
And she's got a cool incense burner too.

732
00:55:34,308 --> 00:55:37,544
Hey, be quiet. Let's start with the sounds first.

733
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:45,824
I told you to start with the sounds. Why are you changing the lights?

734
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,223
Chief Heo.

735
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:50,923
Mr. Oh, In Bum.

736
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:53,723
Why isn't he answering?

737
00:55:56,538 --> 00:55:59,104
What? What's wrong with this now?

738
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:01,774
What is he doing?

739
00:56:03,808 --> 00:56:06,574
Hey. Ji Chul!

740
00:56:07,608 --> 00:56:09,074
Can't you hear me?

741
00:56:12,848 --> 00:56:14,443
Why is it so chilly in here?

742
00:56:25,068 --> 00:56:26,723
Fourth floor.

743
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:12,344
There's no point in struggling.

744
00:57:12,709 --> 00:57:14,973
Let's not drag this out and end it quickly.

745
00:57:15,118 --> 00:57:16,613
Hyung Sik, take it off.

746
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:43,903
You.

747
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:47,143
What was that?

748
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:49,314
Why are they fighting all of a sudden?

749
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:02,123
Hey.

750
00:58:05,499 --> 00:58:07,594
Stay still, you crazy fool.

751
00:59:13,128 --> 00:59:14,893
I'll kill them all.

752
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:21,574
Young Do.

753
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:26,009
Please stop this now.

754
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:27,104
Don't try to stop me.

755
00:59:27,378 --> 00:59:29,878
I'll burn this building down,

756
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:31,048
and then I'll kill myself.

757
00:59:31,048 --> 00:59:32,683
Don't you feel how unfair it is?

758
00:59:34,088 --> 00:59:35,213
Unfair?

759
00:59:37,889 --> 00:59:40,723
How can you say that to me?

760
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:43,058
If it weren't for you,

761
00:59:43,058 --> 00:59:44,893
I wouldn't be in this mess.

762
00:59:46,828 --> 00:59:48,334
Darn it!

763
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:54,709
You and I were both too greedy for our own good.

764
00:59:54,709 --> 00:59:57,038
We didn't invest, we gambled.

765
00:59:57,038 --> 00:59:58,604
But why are you blaming others?

766
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:01,009
I'm going to quit now and start over.

767
01:00:01,009 --> 01:00:02,873
You should come to your senses too.

768
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:06,113
Shut up.

769
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:08,213
You're the one who needs to wake up.

770
01:00:08,389 --> 01:00:10,854
No matter how hard I struggle,

771
01:00:12,028 --> 01:00:14,784
I'll end up repaying my debts for the rest of my life.

772
01:00:15,858 --> 01:00:19,199
You might be happy working in manual labor forever,

773
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,494
but not me.

774
01:00:20,669 --> 01:00:21,994
I'd rather die...

775
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:24,234
than live like that.

776
01:00:30,139 --> 01:00:31,234
Nam Young Do.

777
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:34,244
You're so pitiful.

778
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:01,973
Pitiful?

779
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:03,903
Do you think I'm pitiful?

780
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:06,608
Who do you think you are, calling me pitiful?

781
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:07,744
Darn.

782
01:01:15,189 --> 01:01:16,284
What?

783
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:20,324
Hey.

784
01:01:21,128 --> 01:01:23,094
You're not dead, right?

785
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:25,794
Woo Jin?

786
01:01:26,729 --> 01:01:28,393
Hey, Woo Jin.

787
01:01:29,298 --> 01:01:31,463
Woo Jin, Woo Jin!

788
01:01:55,259 --> 01:01:56,893
I didn't do anything wrong.

789
01:01:57,528 --> 01:01:59,094
I don't know anything.

790
01:02:00,128 --> 01:02:02,094
I didn't do anything wrong.

791
01:02:08,009 --> 01:02:09,234
You came here alone,

792
01:02:10,509 --> 01:02:11,703
all by yourself.

793
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:16,174
Then you drank alone...

794
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:18,913
and fell off.

795
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:39,663
(To my father, from Woo Jin.)

796
01:02:40,938 --> 01:02:43,404
Young Do.

797
01:02:43,478 --> 01:02:44,834
Let go.

798
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:46,748
You're going to make me fall too.

799
01:02:46,748 --> 01:02:48,719
Young Do, please.

800
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,318
- Let go! - Please, Young Do.

801
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:52,519
Please save me.

802
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,614
- Please, save me. - No.

803
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,358
Please.

804
01:02:56,358 --> 01:02:58,723
No!

805
01:03:08,438 --> 01:03:09,634
It's so unfair.

806
01:03:10,298 --> 01:03:12,634
I didn't do anything wrong.

807
01:03:13,608 --> 01:03:14,763
I...

808
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,104
This is why I hate this work.

809
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,453
Ms. Hong! It's me.

810
01:03:34,088 --> 01:03:35,424
Where did Yang Woo Jin go?

811
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:56,873
Hey Fraud.

812
01:03:58,179 --> 01:03:59,614
You were a psychic?

813
01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:49,099
(Sell Your Haunted House)

814
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:50,498
What, a psychic?

815
01:04:50,498 --> 01:04:53,139
That's what we call people easily possessed by spirits.

816
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:56,009
I knew I got a bad feeling from that woman. She's insane.

817
01:04:56,009 --> 01:04:57,208
Is something wrong?

818
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:59,278
I keep thinking of that fraud psychic.

819
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:00,349
Did you fall for him?

820
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:02,719
The biggest private art museum in Korea.

821
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,119
They had a new construction planned in Yongin,

822
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,389
but it isn't proceeding because of rumors of a spirit appearing.

823
01:05:07,389 --> 01:05:10,188
I hate people saying stuff about spirits.

824
01:05:10,188 --> 01:05:11,219
It's that ghost.

825
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:13,259
It disappeared into the museum,

826
01:05:13,259 --> 01:05:14,728
but I'll need to come back during the day to confirm.

827
01:05:14,728 --> 01:05:15,728
Installation complete.

828
01:05:15,728 --> 01:05:16,728
Oh In Bum.

829
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:19,429
Don't move a single step until I say it's all right.

830
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:21,623
It'll cause me more trouble if something happens to you already.
