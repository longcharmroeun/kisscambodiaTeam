00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,209
Where did Yang Woo Jin go?

3
00:00:28,389 --> 00:00:29,560
Hey Fraud.

4
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,299
You were a psychic?

5
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,550
It's all over now.

6
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,220
Just go.

7
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:29,589
No.

8
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,089
Please.

9
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,109
(To my father, from Woo Jin.)

10
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,739
What was that?

11
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,579
What did I just see?

12
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,620
What are you talking about?

13
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,460
Did you see something?

14
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,220
What?

15
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,590
You just said you saw something.

16
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,100
Ms. Hong, help me.

17
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,370
(Episode 2)

18
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,650
Are you this patient's guardian?

19
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,180
No, she's the perpetrator.

20
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,979
I see.

21
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,190
Just stop by the admin desk
before you leave.

22
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,759
Thank you.

23
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh In Bum, we need to talk.

24
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,939
I don't have anything
to talk to you about.

25
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,239
Just pay for my treatment.

26
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,038
I did everything they asked for,

27
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,039
- so it's not on me.
- Of course.

28
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,409
Ms. Hong, it's all over now, right?

29
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,048
You're going to sell the building
at full price, right?

30
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,049
Yes.

31
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,049
How's Hyung Sik?

32
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:35,879
Thankfully, he doesn't need surgery.

33
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,560
He only needs to wear a cast
for six weeks.

34
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,650
But who is this
and why was he at the scene?

35
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,159
I'm a researcher
at Stanford University.

36
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,229
- I have a doctorate...
- He's a lead shaman.

37
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,899
My wife called him.

38
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,500
I see, a lead shaman.

39
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:00,769
No, I'm a doctor.

40
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,449
Gosh, when are they coming out?

41
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,889
Oh In Bum.

42
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,929
- Oh In Bum?
- I'll just ask you one thing.

43
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,998
When you came to the roof,

44
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,499
you said you saw something.

45
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,039
What did you see?

46
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,340
What was that?

47
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:35,239
What did I just see?

48
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,048
What are you talking about?

49
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:41,580
You keep asking if I saw something.
Should I have?

50
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:47,450
When I exorcise spirits,
I see a part of their consciousness.

51
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,188
The regrets, obsessions, and things
they couldn't let go of...

52
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,288
right up until their death.

53
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:55,058
- Just a moment. Out of the way!
- That's why...

54
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:58,400
- Hurry!
- Will he be okay?

55
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,269
This time, those memories
didn't come to me.

56
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,798
They went to you, didn't they?

57
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,710
Memories? What are you talking...

58
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,890
(To my father, from Woo Jin)

59
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,169
I'm sorry, Father.

60
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,549
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

61
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,850
Do you want me to explain again?

62
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,558
Usually, when I exorcise spirits...

63
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,090
Stop it, I get it.

64
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
But I didn't see anything.

65
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Is that true?

66
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,929
You can choose to believe me or not.

67
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,270
Oh, right.

68
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,140
This time, it's my turn.

69
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,809
Before...

70
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:21,280
This is so embarrassing to say
out loud.

71
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,149
You did something to me earlier,
didn't you?

72
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,688
I remember dragging
that big guy up with you,

73
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:34,530
but when I came to,
that guy had a broken leg,

74
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,429
and I was on the ground.

75
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,999
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

76
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,169
Wow, you're looking down at me.

77
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,808
I didn't want to brag about this,

78
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,840
but I was even accepted
to Seoul University.

79
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,108
Don't worry about whether
I'll understand or not...

80
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,850
and just explain
why my memory is gone.

81
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,520
Because you're a psychic.

82
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,319
What? A psychic?

83
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,220
That's what we call people
easily possessed by spirits.

84
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,259
I exorcise spirits
by trapping them...

85
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,829
inside the body of a psychic,
then release them onwards.

86
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,600
Yesterday, you were my psychic.

87
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,030
That's all.

88
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,099
I was wondering what kind
of excuse you'd come up with.

89
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,878
But this is absurd.

90
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,938
You really are a psychic.

91
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,009
The fact that your memory is gone
is proof of that.

92
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,179
A psychic cannot remember
the events while possessed.

93
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,889
That's enough.

94
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm not a psychic
or anything like that.

95
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,779
You're the one who should stop lying
to yourself.

96
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:44,059
If you were born a psychic,
this must've happened often.

97
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,629
Why are you feigning ignorance?

98
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,168
Whatever.

99
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,010

101

What were you two talking about
for so long?

102
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,340
I have no idea.

103
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,210
I knew I got a bad feeling
from that woman.

104
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,710
She's insane.

105

106
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,979
What? My necklace.

107
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,479
It's gone.

108
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,449
Your necklace?
The one your uncle gave you?

109

I'm sure I dropped it somewhere
around here.

116
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,999
It's totally smashed.

00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,279
You know that old man?

184
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,319
He begged me
to take out the commission fee...

185
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,488
and caused a scene.

186
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,720
It was unbelievable.

187
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:48,989
Ms. Hong.

188
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,460
Is something wrong?

189
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,999
I keep thinking of
that fraud psychic.

190
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,139
Oh, dear.

191
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:58,670
Are you in love?

192
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,769
What?

193
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,940
Never mind.
He was handsome, that's all.

194
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,019
Then why is he on your mind?

195
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,950
Come to think of it,

196
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,690
I even took off my coat that night.

197
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,628
You know I never take it off...

198
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,269
during an exorcism
because of hypothermia.

199
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,229
But I never put it back on again
that night...

200
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,780
because I didn't feel cold.

201
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,670
So you're saying that the fraud...

202
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,539
absorbed
the unrested spirit's memory...

203
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,108
and raised your body temperature
as well?

204
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,139
Yes, but I'm not completely sure.

205
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,778
I didn't know
such a powerful psychic existed.

206
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,779
With that much power,

207
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,519
I can't help but think
that he could put my mom to rest.

208
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:49,619
I should've dragged him here
against his will.

209
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,858
I'll ask a cop that I know.

210
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,830
Since he's a fraud,
he must have a record.

211
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,629
Was his name Oh In Bum?

212
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,959
No.

213
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,470
I should've beat him up
and brought him here.

214
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,979
(Hong Mi Jin, Hong Ji A)

215
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:31,159
(Record of Exorcism)

216
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,509
Instant coffee is the best.

217
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,220
Have you eaten dinner yet,
my dear baby?

218
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,460
What are you thinking about?

219
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,879
Didn't you say Yongdoori coffee
tastes best when it's still hot?

220
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,499
This doesn't feel right.

221
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:14,440
The coffee?

222
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:23,419
I'm also drinking Yongdoori coffee.

223
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,419
I'll brew some for you next time.

224
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,290
When I exorcise spirits,
I see a part of their consciousness.

225
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,258
The regrets, obsessions, and things
they couldn't let go of...

226
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,489
right up until their death.

227
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,729
They went to you, didn't they?

228
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,509
Coffee. Yes.

229
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,220
(To my father, from Woo Jin)

230
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm sorry, Father.

231
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,280
- What is it?
- I'm here right now.

232
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:28,509
What?

233
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,320
I'll burn this building down,

234
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,989
and then I'll kill myself.

235
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,389
Young... Nam Young Do.

236
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,800
What?

237
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,340
Where am I?

238
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,990
Ji Chul.

239
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:09,790
Ji Chul...

240
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,909
(To my father, from Woo Jin)

241
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,560
What? It...

242
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,790
It wasn't a dream?

243
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,290
You heartless brat.

244
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,139
(Our condolences for your loss.)

245
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:48,719
You heartless brat.

246
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:10,309
Where are we?

247
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,480
- Ji Chul.
- Yes?

248
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,979
When a family member
commits suicide...

249
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,119
Yes?

250
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,820
Do you know what happens
to the rest of the family?

251
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:24,159
That came out of nowhere.

252
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,629
Why do you ask?
Did you dream about your uncle?

253
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,699
Whatever.

254
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,399
Why should I care?

255
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,149
(Personal Information on Oh In Bum)

256
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,019
As you can see,
I found two ex-convicts...

257
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,790
under the name of Oh In Bum.

258
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,729
One of them is in his 60s.
And the other one is a teenager.

259
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,060
The age doesn't match.

260
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,529
They'll look into reports
regarding shamanic scams.

261
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,300
So we have to be a bit more patient.

262
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,109
I shouldn't have let him
go that day. Gosh.

263
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,138
Please stop drinking.

264
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:16,369
What do you mean?

265
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:19,609
(With This Alcohol)

266
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,219
Darn this habit
of the unrested spirit.

267
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,090
Last time, you were a chain smoker.
This time, you're an alcoholic.

268
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,809
I'll book an appointment
for your health checkup.

269
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:01,949
I think I know where Oh In Bum is.

270
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,320
How?

271
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,289
When you absorb
the memories of unrested spirits,

272
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,129
their habits remain with you too.

273
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,829
I'll be able to find him
once I check places...

274
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,300
where Yang Woo Jin would go.

275
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,500
Don't drive. Take a cab.

276
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,469
Okay?

277
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,448
Gosh.

278
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:36,760
Here again?

279
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,010
- Why is that woman here?
- Who is it?

280
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:03,520
You are Yang Woo Jin's father,
right?

281
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,350
Didn't a strange man come to you
and do weird things recently?

282
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,358
A strange man?

283
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,530
He has a face of a sly fraud,

284
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,500
but he might have behaved
just like your late son.

285
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:20,398
Like coming into your yard
and sitting there.

286
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,070
Did you lend money to Woo Jin too?

287
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,240
Pardon?

288
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,009
If that's why you are here,
you wasted your time.

289
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,408
I don't know
how much money you lent him,

290
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,679
but I don't have the means
to pay it back.

291
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:35,850
And he broke my heart...

292
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:37,879
when he took his own life.

293
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,659
So please go back home.

294
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm sorry.

295
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,760
Wait.

296
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,730
Your son...

297
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,540
didn't commit suicide.

298
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,719
Is it wrong to want to live
like others?

299
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,330
I...

300
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,759
While my friends in university
didn't worry about their tuition...

301
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,829
and focused on their study,

302
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,868
I worked three part-time jobs.

303
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:29,969
Had you given me just as much
as the other parents did...

304
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,369
Darn it.

305
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,590
And throw out those glasses
and buy a new pair.

306
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:52,459
I'll make a lot of money
and buy you an expensive pair.

307
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,439
(To my father, from Woo Jin)

308
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,199
Dad, this is Woo Jin.

309
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,570
I'm writing this letter
because I am ashamed to face you.

310
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:39,139
I wanted to make you proud of me.

311
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,169
I am sorry that I disappointed you.

312
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:46,340
I didn't mean it
when I talked back to you.

313
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,949
Wanting to live like other people...

314
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,250
Hey, hurry up!

315
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,850
Not worrying about money
when choosing what to eat...

316
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,349
- Come here.
- Or when meeting my friends...

317
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,188
I would be lying
if I didn't want that.

318
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,760
But I never resented you.

319
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,059
- Hey. Didn't you eat?
- Dad.

320
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,530
I'm going to start over.

321
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,899
Please believe in me
and be patient one last time.

322
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:15,769
I'll come see you
on your birthday this year.

323
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,209
Let's go and have pork ribs,
your favorite.

324
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:42,800
Your son...

325
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,600
didn't commit suicide.

326
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:48,570
I'm sorry.

327
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,459
You scared me!

328
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,459
I got you.

329
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,959
You said
you didn't absorb his memories.

330
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,060
But how did you find this place?

331
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:13,199
Who were you again?

332
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,629
Hey.

333
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,638
Hey. Oh In Bum.

334
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,639
Hey, let's talk. Hey!

335
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,009
Hey!

336
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,509
- Why is she following me?
- Hey.

337
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,118
I need to talk to you.
Get out of the van.

338
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,949
Hey!

339
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,760
Hey! Get over here!

340
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,089
- What?
- What's wrong?

341
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,359
Another nightmare?

342
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:16,359
What is that? Isn't that Ms. Hong?

343
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,398
- Why is she chasing us?
- I don't know.

344
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,959
It will be a headache
if she gets to us.

345
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,699
Hey, what's up with her?

346
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,868
Why won't she stop?

347
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:27,368
- Look where you're going.
- Pipe down a second.

348
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:28,369
Hey!

349
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,259
We're good, right?

350
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,070
But In Bum, why did she do that?

351
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,699
I don't know.

352
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:33,670
Did you lose him?

353
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,039
I almost had him.

354
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,640
Calm down.

355
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,940
No need to worry.
He's a fraud exorcist.

356
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,608
We're bound to meet sooner or later.

357
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:46,880
Either when he's sued or arrested.

358
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,819
I hope he doesn't go clean
and stop with his scams.

359
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,220
Shoot.

360
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,680
(Open Temple Free Offerings Event)

361
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,319
Thank you for the food.

362
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,429
There's not much to temple food
but it's so tasty anyway.

363
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,799
Maybe because it's all natural?

364
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,969
It's just because you're hungry.

365
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,639
It would be weirder
if it didn't taste good...

366
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,670
- after this hike up the mountain.
- Is that so?

367
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,268
Lee Eun Hye.

368
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:47,140
Director of Britium, the biggest
private art museum in Korea.

369
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:50,209
They had a new construction
planned in Yongin.

370
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,808
But it isn't proceeding...

371
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,549
because of rumors
of a spirit appearing.

372
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,359
Why would such educated people
believe in spirits?

373
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,630
Of course, people like us are
grateful if they do.

374
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,159
According to rumors
in the stock exchange,

375
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,299
they say that Director Lee
poisoned her husband.

376
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,568
Her husband was in a coma
for a whole week,

377
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:14,900
but she didn't show up
at the hospital even once.

378
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:17,768
Publicly, she said it was...

379
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:20,609
because she was preparing
for an exhibit by a famous artist.

380
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:23,879
So that's why there are rumors...

381
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
that the museum is haunted
by Kwon Moo Jin.

382
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,880
That's right.

383
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:46,299
But do you think Director Lee
even believes in spirits?

384
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:49,539
She will when her husband's spirit
appears right in front of her.

385
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:52,009
We're great at making them
look real.

386
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,079
That's true.

387
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,809
But if that still doesn't work,
there is a Plan B.

388
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,420
Honestly, I think this one
might be more effective.

389
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:08,160
So Kwon Moo Jin's wife is
the museum director.

390
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,690
A sibling from a different mother,

391
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,959
a nephew,

392
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,529
and a cousin.

393
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:16,999
They are all executives
of the Britium Museum Board.

394
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,599
I'm sure the rumor
of the spirit was...

395
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,368
fabricated by Kwon,
the sibling from a different mother.

396
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:24,409
Why? Because if they ruined
an important exhibit...

397
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,609
and caused significant damage
to Britium,

398
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:28,709
Director Lee's position
would be endangered.

399
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,980
Giving Deputy Director Kwon
a shot at Lee's position.

400
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,579
And then what?

401
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,219
If we can find evidence...

402
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,220
that Deputy Director Kwon
started those rumors,

403
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,659
we can use that to blackmail him...

404
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,690
or hand over the evidence
to Director Lee.

405
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,359
Either way, we win the lotto.

406
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,229
Nice one, In Bum.

407
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,430
- Would you marry me?
- I really don't want to.

408
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,140
Don't abandon me.

409
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,460
- Really.
- This is a winning lottery ticket.

410
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,308
This used to be a factory,

411
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:05,409
but it doesn't smell at all.

412
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,848
See how big the windows are?

413
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:10,150
There's great ventilation,
and it gets a lot of light.

414
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,318
It's a quiet neighborhood,

415
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,119
so it's perfect for work.

416
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,889
What do you do again?

417
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,098
We're reporters.

418
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,430
This place would be perfect!

419
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,039
This is the bathroom
on the first floor.

420
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,939
The second floor is...

421
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,778
being used by an artist.

422
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:38,209
Even that artist loves
this building so much,

423
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,920
that they've been using it
for several years now.

424
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,989
What's wrong?

425
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,690
Wasn't someone there just now?

426
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,660
What?

427
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,599
What's this smell?

428
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:01,769
What's wrong?

429
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,079
What was it he saw?

430
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,950
Excuse me, I'm the landlord.

431
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,779
My gosh, the smell...

432
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,389
Goodness.

433
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:51,309
What's going on?

434
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,678
It's a wandering spirit.

435
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:55,578
A wandering spirit? People who die
away from home turn into them.

436
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,860
Why would someone who died
inside his house turn into one?

437
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,348
He probably didn't consider
this place as home.

438
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:02,618
Or a wandering spirit
from another area...

439
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,789
could've moved
into this vacant spot.

440
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,630
I think I'll find a lead
once I follow him.

441
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,440
Yes, check that once more.

442
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,139
Isn't this better?

443
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,309
- Please set the lights soon.
- Yes, ma'am.

444
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,059
It's done.

445
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:56,468
Check. I can see now.

446
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:58,039
Let's wrap it up.

447
00:37:58,369 --> 00:37:59,380
Okay.

448
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,719
Goodbye.

449
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,119
Goodbye.

450
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,059
Wait.

451
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:18,889
Yes?

452
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,530
Please turn off the ceiling lights
before you go.

453
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,500
Oh, sure.

454
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:08,309
Okay.

455
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,179
I swear I saw a spirit downstairs.

456
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:16,888
What are you talking about?
I'll go check.

457
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,119
(Exhibit Hall 4)

458
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,989
Nice. I'll be leaving now.

459
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,170
Why aren't the lights turning on?

460
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,699
Good work.

461
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,569
Did you check?

462
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,670
It disappeared into the museum,

463
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:15,349
but I'll need to come back
during the day to confirm.

464
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,110
Let's see.

465
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,820
Nice.

466
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:35,760
You startled me.

467
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,500
What? What is it? Don't come out.
Go back inside.

468
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,428
This isn't new.

469
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:46,269
I bought it on sale last year.

470
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:48,939
Unbelievable.

471
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,710
She always knows
when I buy new clothes.

472
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,650
New trainers?

473
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,408
New shoes as well?

474
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:00,750
They're not new.

475
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,119
At least take the price tag off.

476
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,828
You know wandering spirits are
hard to track and locate.

477
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:17,229
I needed activewear.

478
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,000
I never asked.

479
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:21,940
After all, you bought them
with your own money.

480
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,170
Exactly.

481
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,940
I'll be off.

482
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,139
Goodbye.

483
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,250
(Britium)

484
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:06,719
Oh In Bum

485
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,119
Who were you again?

486
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,949
What was that for?

487
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,480
Don't move a single step
until I say it's all right.

488
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,440
It'll cause me more trouble
if something happens to you already.

489
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,289
How dare you keep trying
to scam a fraud?

490
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,929
What was that?

491
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:23,130
(Self-portrait, Marvin Gaye)

492
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,809
I couldn't see his face
because of you!

493
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,250
What a feisty way of expressing
your gratitude.

494
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,519
What?

495
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,559
Come on.

496
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,119
Gosh.

497
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:05,199
Excuse me.

498
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,739
Excuse me!

499
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,769
Do you know...

500
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,309
that you look like a pervert
right now?

501
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,489
Gosh.

502
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:28,820
Check the pieces.

503
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,229
- Who are you?
- This isn't good.

504
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,530
I'm Hong Ji A from Daebak Realty.

505
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,730
Ms. Hong?

506
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:46,069
I'll give you the chance to explain
before we check the CCTV.

507
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,440
You won't find anything
on the CCTV anyway.

508
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:51,149
Whenever there's an unrested spirit,

509
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,719
most electrical devices malfunction.

510
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,349
Unrested spirit?

511
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:58,389
Are you talking about ghosts?

512
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,019
Let me explain.

513
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,889
I hate to break it to you,

514
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,559
but there's an unrested spirit
full of resent in your museum.

515
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,300
You're an exorcist?

516
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,368
Ghost Story Cleaner is
a start-up company...

517
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:18,509
that has patented the technology
of using electromagnetic waves...

518
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,669
to cast out unrested spirits.

519
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,139
- Are you his partner?
- No.

520
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:30,190
Excuse me.

521
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,519
- Oh In Bum speaking.
- It is your real number.

522
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,130
Please leave.

523
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:45,799
Call me if you change your mind.

524
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,170
And be careful of this woman.

525
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:49,840
She can be very violent...

526
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,769
and is nowhere near sane.

527
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,710
I'll show myself out.

528
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:01,779
Ms. Hong.

529
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,289
I'd like to talk to you about
selling my art museum, Britium.

530
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,558
Ms. Hong, I'll wait for you outside.

531
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,260
Talk to her well for me.

532
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,349
Right after my husband's funeral,

533
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:37,919
a rumor
that my art museum is haunted...

534
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,150
started to spread.

535
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,429
And there's another rumor
that I poisoned my husband too.

536
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,699
Did you murder your husband?

537
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:59,570
You are straightforward,
just as I heard.

538
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:05,780
You know Chairman Han of
the investment firm in Masan, right?

539
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,049
He told me that you handled
the sale of the building...

540
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:12,219
that gave him headaches.

541
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,159
I'm sure you saw it on the news.

542
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,260
My art museum, Britium, will move
to a bigger place.

543
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,029
I already bought the land
for the new location.

544
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,729
The negotiation to sell
this building was in place.

545
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,598
But I was offered
a ridiculous price...

546
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,479
because of the rumor
that the museum is haunted.

547
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:33,009
I apologize, but if this regards
the sale of the building...

548
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,710
I already have a case,
so I cannot accept another client.

549
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,379
I ended up here today...

550
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,679
because I was following
the unrested spirit of that case.

551
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:43,789
An unrested spirit.

552
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,659
You don't believe me.

553
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,190
If so, why are you asking me
for my help?

554
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:58,369
The most important job
for me as the director is finding...

555
00:48:58,429 --> 00:49:01,500
the best solution
that can keep our image intact...

556
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,909
and minimize our monetary losses.

557
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,449
Deputy Director Kwon is here.

558
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,928
Unless you demand...

559
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:26,590
the client to believe in exorcisms,

560
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:30,429
please call me as soon as
you are done with your current case.

561
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,199
Call me directly.

562
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,980
Hey, hurry up. Hurry.

563
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:51,820
Hey, that's crooked.
Level it properly. Okay?

564
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:55,589
Hey, let's get the angle right.

565
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,190
That's it.

566
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,400
Look at this mess, Eun Hye.

567
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,110
There was a minor commotion.
It's nothing.

568
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,269
It's nothing?

569
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,178
You are the director. But obviously,
you don't act like one.

570
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,749
So even tabloids think...

571
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,780
they can belittle us
and get away with it.

572
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,119
You're diminishing our class.

573
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,419
Responding to such tabloids...

574
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,760
would diminish our class even more.

575
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,329
Is that so?

576
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:35,399
I wonder
if the board will agree with you.

577
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,899
There are rumors
of how you poisoned my brother...

578
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,598
and that the museum is haunted.

579
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:39,869
Gosh.

580
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,069
Will they reappoint you
as the director...

581
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,269
when you are
the root of all these rumors?

582
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,848
Why did you run into her here again?

583
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:56,579
Are you guys ill-fated or something?

584
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,249
What do we do? Should we give up?

585
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,718
Why would we give up?

586
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:01,719
We can't let her steal
two cases in a row.

587
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,090
Hey, she's coming. Bye.

588
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,469
What should I say?

589
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,469
He'll turn me down again
without giving it a second thought.

590
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,809
Gosh. What should I say?

591
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,809
She'll really beat me up
if I don't sound sincere.

592
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,920
"Not being intimidated
by the mighty Lee Eun Hye."

593
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:29,380
"I learned something new today."

594
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:31,849
No.

595
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,889
If I cave in right away,
it won't look cool.

596
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:37,590
"Be my psychic just once."

597
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,130
That sounded so selfish.

598
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:45,198
"You can't steal two of my cases
which I worked hard on."

599
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:47,070
"Let me take this one."

600
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:50,670
As if. She would never.

601
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:53,249
Why am I racking my brains for this?

602
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,738
He's a fraud. He'd say yes to money.

603
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:58,379
Right. Not looking cool isn't
important right now.

604
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,949
Money is.

605
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,559
- We...
- Let's do a case together.

606
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:12,189
- No, I...
- I don't mean it permanently.

607
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,829
Just one case. That's it.

608
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:21,340
Hold on.

609
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,039
I did it.

610
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,339
Okay.

611
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,710
Let's do that then.

612
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:33,549
We keep running into each other.

613
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,719
So we must be destined
to cross paths.

614
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:53,800
I'm going to Ms. Hong's place.

615
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:57,738
No way. Is she interested in you?

616
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:59,579
Otherwise,
she wouldn't bring you to her house.

617
00:53:02,139 --> 00:53:04,549
I'm not going to her house.
I'm going to her office.

618
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,230
She said I had to take a test
or something.

619
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,718
That's an excuse.

620
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,519
She lives alone on the second floor
of the same building.

621
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:21,800
Gosh.

622
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,670
I see.

623
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,070
What?

624
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,079
Nothing.

625
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,980
I saved her life earlier.

626
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:41,619
That must have been it.

627
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,219
Even I thought I was pretty amazing.

628
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,018
When did you save her life?

629
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:49,489
When there was a commotion
in the gallery earlier.

630
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:54,300
A commotion in the gallery?
What do you mean? When?

631
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,760
So this is how it looks inside.

632
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:26,429
It's just a regular office.

633
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:42,739
What is it?

634
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:45,610
Nothing.

635
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:47,380
Go to the second floor.

636
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:50,489
- What's up there?
- My room.

637
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,489
She's making it too obvious.

638
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,928
If this is about work,
let's talk here.

639
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,630
Go upstairs. That's the test.

640
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:05,570
Okay.

641
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:13,440
Are you okay?

642
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,610
What do you mean?

643
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,079
Isn't your heart beating fast?

644
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,079
Aren't you experiencing
shortness of breath?

645
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,889
Or do you feel dizzy?

646
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:27,359
I'm not climbing Mount Everest.

647
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,118
Why would I be out of breath
for climbing up a few steps?

648
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,629
I might not look like it,
but I've been working out regularly.

649
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:34,300
As long as you're okay,
keep going up.

650
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,230
Okay.

651
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:50,079
He really climbed all the way up.

652
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:02,690
Why is it so dark in here?

653
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,829
Are you allergic to sunlight?

654
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,099
Gosh, it's cold in here.

655
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:13,969
What's that?

656
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:18,010
Stay right there
until I tell you it's okay to move.

657
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:29,619
Isn't this what you did
at Dream Officetel the other night?

658
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,849
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

659
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:35,459
The smoke from the incense burner
calls a vengeful spirit.

660
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,860
I see. A vengeful spirit.

661
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,170
I bet it does.

662
00:56:51,869 --> 00:56:52,940
It's my mother.

663
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,610
She's quite beautiful.

664
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,210
She passed away 20 years ago.

665
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,559
Mom!

666
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:30,110
Now, she's here.

667
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:33,820
She's been haunting
this house for 20 years.

668
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,319
I see.

669
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,320
So she's not a fraud,
she's just delusional?

670
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,460
The one exorcism I asked for...

671
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,099
is for my mother.

672
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:53,900
I think you might have
misunderstood.

673
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:56,840
I only came thinking
we were going to work on Britium.

674
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,370
I'll give you 10,000 dollars.

675
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,440
- Money's not the problem.
- 20,000.

676
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:06,380
Last time, you had a strong-looking
man working with you.

677
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,719
Why are you asking me?

678
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,219
My mother is a special case.

679
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,449
She can't be exorcised
by an ordinary psychic.

680
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,789
Then what about me?

681
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:18,489
You're special.

682
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,429
(Hong Mi Jin)

683
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,190
Step outside the circle.

684
00:58:57,269 --> 00:58:58,900
Should I run away now?

685
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,570
Step outside.

686
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,538
No, if I just do as she says,

687
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,840
I'll get 20,000 bucks
and the Britium job to boot.

688
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,409
I'll give it a go.

689
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,289
Mom?

690
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,110
Oh In Bum?

691
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,389
Oh In Bum.

692
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,530
Oh In Bum!

693
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,539
Help me.

694
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,750
I'm... I'm sorry...

695
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:19,449
Die.

696
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,780
Die!

697
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,880
You should die too!

698
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:26,420
Uncle.

699
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,329
Have you come around?

700
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,639
Isn't that something you use
when your heart stops?

701
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:46,769
Did I...

702
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,308
die just now?

703
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:51,679
I prepared this
in case of emergency,

704
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:54,249
but thankfully
your heart didn't stop.

705
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,279
Thankfully?

706
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,678
Are you saying
that I was supposed to die,

707
01:00:56,679 --> 01:00:58,119
but thankfully didn't?

708
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:06,760
Why...

709
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,630
Why is Ms. Hong's mother
in my memories?

710
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,699
Why did Ms. Hong's mother...

711
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:13,570
try to kill my uncle?

712
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,369
I'm sorry.

713
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,440
I thought it would work with you.

714
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:28,480
Take this.

715
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:37,359
- This...
- If you wear this,

716
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,960
you won't be possessed
by most spirits from now on.

717
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,400
It's like a bulletproof vest,
so never take it off.

718
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:46,099
You can...

719
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,670
never take this off.

720
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:51,909
Do you understand?

721
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,078
What? What is this?

722
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,079
I'll pay you what I promised,
so don't worry.

723
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:13,090
Your mother.

724
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:17,000
You said she died 20 years ago?

725
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,840
How...

726
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:23,800
did she pass away?

727
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,519
Because of me.

728
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:42,519
Just go now. I'm tired.

729
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:58,909
Save me.

730
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,739
I'm sorry.

731
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,849
Twenty years ago,
my uncle and I came here.

732
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:09,750
Something happened then.

733
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:15,619
There's no way our Sung Sik
committed suicide.

734
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:18,590
Did my uncle really commit suicide?

735
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:23,630
You said I was special earlier.

736
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,110
Why don't you team up...

737
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,019
with this special psychic?

738
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:31,499
(Sell Your Haunted House)

739
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,198
I said I would never work
with a fraud.

740
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:36,138
No partners start off
on the right foot.

741
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:38,009
Ms. Hong, you need me.

742
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,009
You need this special psychic.

743
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,439
We need a psychic right now.

744
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,779
You said he even helps
get your temperature up.

745
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,780
Staying pure?

746
01:04:43,781 --> 01:04:45,448
They didn't sleep together.

747
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:47,078
Why does Ms. Hong have
the same one as your uncle?

748
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:48,819
That's what I'm trying to find out.

749
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,819
What the relationship between
Daebak Realty and my uncle was.

750
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,259
On the outside, it looks
just like a regular realty office.

751
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,359
- Ji Chul, let's form a plan.
- A plan?

752
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,360
It's by the writer Cho Yeon Seo,
the "Artist of Mullae-dong."

753
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,698
You believe me now, right?
That you're a psychic.

754
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:05,329
So being possessed by spirits
was real after all.
