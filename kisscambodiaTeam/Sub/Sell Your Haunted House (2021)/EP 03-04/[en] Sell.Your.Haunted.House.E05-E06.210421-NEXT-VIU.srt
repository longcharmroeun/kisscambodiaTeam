00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:09,950
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:18,090
Die, die.

3
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:21,629
Die, die.

4
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:23,930
Hong Ji A.

5
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:28,800
It's dangerous to stab everywhere like that.

6
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:32,469
You have to stab it in the heart, in one go.

7
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:34,169
Let's try again.

8
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:43,580
Great job, my daughter.

9
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,779
Come on. That's too boring.

10
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:52,419
Mom, I don't want to become an exorcist.

11
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:54,495
Then who'll send away the unrested spirits?

12
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:56,090
No one will.

13
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:03,034
A dead person's soul wandering...

14
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,499
in this world without a body...

15
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:08,645
is the same as...

16
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:11,439
being in the middle of a blizzard in just your underwear.

17
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:14,510
Why won't they leave when it's that freezing? What fools.

18
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:16,915
They can't leave because they're holding...

19
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:19,150
onto an extremely resentful and hurtful grudge.

20
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:22,350
That's why we need to help them leave.

21
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:25,695
We need to help them get over their grudges...

22
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,230
so that they can go somewhere warm and live happily ever after.

23
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:36,299
Help me.

24
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:44,240
How did she pass away?

25
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:46,880
Because of me.

26
00:01:49,684 --> 00:01:52,850
Just go now. I'm tired.

27
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:05,159
You said I was special earlier.

28
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:18,540
Why don't you team up with this special psychic?

29
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:24,649
Why would I?

30
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:26,250
I refuse to work with a fraud.

31
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:29,125
You asked me to join hands before.

32
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,790
And we did.

33
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:40,260
Secretary Joo, please wire Oh In Bum 20,000 dollars.

34
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,434
Tell her your bank account number.

35
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:43,970
Stop!

36
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:50,774
20,000 dollars.

37
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,185
Do you think that's chump change?

38
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,185
I'm not going to wire that.

39
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:55,810
Just do it. You didn't have to come all the way here.

40
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:01,554
Mr. Oh, we pay our psychics...

41
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:04,494
2,000 dollars per gig.

42
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:07,565
She must've been out of her mind and added another zero.

43
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:11,035
She mentioned 20,000 dollars at least three times,

44
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:14,200
and I almost died after being dragged upstairs.

45
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:21,369
- You went upstairs? - Dragged?

46
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:22,940
You went there willingly.

47
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:26,315
And don't whine about passing out for a few minutes.

48
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,149
He went there willingly? Into the room?

49
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:34,024
Like I said.

50
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,350
It may be difficult to wire all that money at once,

51
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:39,195
so I'm willing to work with you until I get all the money.

52
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,194
I said I would never work with a fraud.

53
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:44,160
Okay.

54
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,899
I understand your opinions.

55
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,905
I'll look at this favorably and call you back.

56
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,070
You should leave for today.

57
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:57,040
I hope you make a reasonable decision.

58
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,614
- You know my number, right? - I deleted it.

59
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,910
Then I'll call you. I didn't erase yours.

60
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:13,359
- Hire him as your psychic. - Are you insane?

61
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:15,234
He commits scams with spirits.

62
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,789
But he even went upstairs.

63
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:20,899
Look. Don't you see how the salt has changed color?

64
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:22,835
Have you ever seen this glow so blue?

65
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:23,835
This is a first for me.

66
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,769
So what? I still can't send my mom away.

67
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:33,114
You said he gave you warmth...

68
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:34,810
and absorbed unrested spirits' memory.

69
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:39,254
It's not easy to find a psychic who can supplement your flaws.

70
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:42,149
- I have no flaws. - You have too many.

71
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:45,959
I've been doing well singlehandedly until now.

72
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:49,535
I never said it out loud,

73
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,035
but do you know how anxious I get...

74
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,004
whenever you suffer from hypothermia?

75
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,405
Nevertheless, I was fine.

76
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,370
Have you already forgotten about Gonjiam?

77
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:02,070
You almost died there.

78
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,380
I almost died.

79
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:07,279
I didn't actually die.

80
00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:15,690
Tell me the truth. Is it me or that realty?

81
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,490
Hey, are you going to abandon me for that realty?

82
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,690
I'm not abandoning you.

83
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:27,304
I just need to look into something personal.

84
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:29,405
Aren't I your only personal matter?

85
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:30,734
You have neither parents nor siblings.

86
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,039
Personal what?

87
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:38,310
- This. - What?

88
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:41,240
How did you fix this?

89
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:43,810
- Did you glue it back? - That one's not mine.

90
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:45,880
Ms. Hong gave that to me.

91
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,994
Why does she have something that looks exactly like yours?

92
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:50,994
I thought your uncle gave it to you.

93
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,924
That's what I'm trying to find out.

94
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:55,029
What the relationship between Daebak Realty...

95
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:56,959
and my uncle was.

96
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,310
I thought it'd work this time.

97
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:27,089
You must've been startled.

98
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:29,930
I'm really sorry.

99
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:34,105
Next time, I'll find a decent psychic.

100
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:36,370
Not a fraud.

101
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:38,639
You trust me, right?

102
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:58,589
(Daebak Realty)

103
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,765
If he had that much power,

104
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:10,130
why couldn't he possess your mother's spirit?

105
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:13,599
- Maybe he isn't a virgin. - He is.

106
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:15,575
He was possessed back at Dream Officetel.

107
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:17,810
He could've found a woman after that incident.

108
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:19,709
That quickly?

109
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,779
- We should look into that first. - Yes.

110
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:30,149
Who is he?

111
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:32,519
He's the driver.

112
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,744
Make me the co-CEO.

113
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:51,070
And him, the chief.

114
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,380
Is he a plus one or what?

115
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:55,209
That won't give you a higher salary.

116
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:57,855
- Deal. - Secretary Joo,

117
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:59,579
please write the contract.

118
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:00,680
Okay.

119
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:04,155
You wanted a joint contract, right?

120
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:07,120
Yes. My name is Heo Ji Chul...

121
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,529
I'm a plus one.

122
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:21,339
What?

123
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,269
What is this?

124
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:26,479
I must maintain my purity until this contract ends?

125
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,380
Did you sleep with anyone after the Dream Officetel incident?

126
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:32,320
- What? - She's no joke.

127
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:37,820
Why must I answer that?

128
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:41,024
This is an invasion of privacy.

129
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,560
I'm not interested in your personal life.

130
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:46,700
I can only hire you as a psychic once I confirm that.

131
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:49,305
What nonsense is this?

132
00:08:49,305 --> 00:08:51,869
The harmony between yin and yang is of the utmost importance.

133
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:53,575
If the psychic's yang is tainted,

134
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,575
they can't possess...

135
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,014
an unrested spirit with strong yin energy.

136
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,874
In the worst-case scenario, they could die.

137
00:08:57,874 --> 00:08:59,509
He didn't sleep with anyone.

138
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:02,849
I've been by his side ever since that incident,

139
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:04,349
so I can confirm that.

140
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:08,349
But I wasn't there when he was with you, Ms. Hong.

141
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:10,325
- Did you two... - Have you gone insane?

142
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:11,450
Calm down.

143
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:13,920
So...

144
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:21,430
In any case, okay.

145
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:24,770
Since we've confirmed that you're a virgin,

146
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,504
stamp the contract.

147
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:27,640
A virgin?

148
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:29,969
- I'm not. - You are.

149
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,209
No, I'm not.

150
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,109
Don't say anything.

151
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:06,040
What? I didn't.

152
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,379
- Don't. - What?

153
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:10,455
I said, don't.

154
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,984
Accommodation. I found accommodations for us.

155
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:14,379
You virgin.

156
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:15,894

Go inside first.

164
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:40,209

166
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:46,979
Hey, this is the room. Look.

167

It's an ondol room.

168
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,150
Nice. Hey, come take a look.

169
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,390
Ta-da!

170
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:55,729
Well, this looks nice.

171
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:58,359

Thank you for the food.

175
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:19,849
Okay.

176
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:21,579
Wait.

177

This is for our next month's meals.

178
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,595
We're always grateful.

179
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:32,465

00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:57,849
Did you inhale that?

185
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:00,719
How can you inhale ribs?

186
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:31,489
Okay. Now.

187
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,030
Yes?

188
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:41,359
Now?

189
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:43,670
Okay.

190
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,170
Darn it.

191
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:50,170
Gosh. That was so close. She was almost there.

192
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:53,640
- Yes. - How did it go?

193
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:55,579
She didn't get to see it.

194
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,114
Should we scare the secretary one more time?

195
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:58,754
We tried that last time, but it didn't work.

196
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:00,719
Lee Eun Hye needs to see it herself for her to make a move.

197
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:02,494
Then, where are you now?

198
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:04,523
We're checking if a building is haunted or not.

199
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,619
I can't believe I'm doing something as ridiculous as this.

200
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:22,874
Why don't you just perform an exorcism?

201
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:24,540
Why do you have to check?

202
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:29,079
Hey, partner.

203
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:31,280
Ms. Hong.

204
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:35,085
I asked you a question. Why won't you answer it?

205
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:36,524
I told you earlier.

206
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,520
To perform an exorcism, I need the name of the unrested spirit.

207
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:41,989
Listen.

208
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:44,835
If you need the name, check the name on the lease.

209
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,634
Why go through this trouble?

210
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,403
It's a reasonable question to ask.

211
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:49,774
The tenant lived here without writing a lease...

212
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:52,400
and paid the rent upfront in cash for a year.

213
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,239
This tenant doesn't exist on paper.

214
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,280
A man who lived like a ghost died and became a spirit.

215
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,484
Didn't what I just said sound like a line from a poem?

216
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:05,685
Oh In Bum.

217
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,585
- I'm a CEO. - What?

218
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,894
Don't call me by my full name. Call me Mr. Oh.

219
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:11,624
We're partners. Let's show each other some respect.

220
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:13,065
Hey, Oh In Bum.

221
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:15,930
Unless you're going to keep quiet, just go home.

222
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:19,634
Gosh. The way you talk to me is quite hostile.

223
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,764
No partners start off on the right foot.

224
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:23,805
Don't you remember what Ms. Joo said?

225
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:25,705
You need me.

226
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:28,499
You need a special psychic.

227
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,514
A special psychic, my foot.

228
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:33,109
That's a load of nonsense.

229
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:35,780
What did she mean by I'm like your heating pack?

230
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,280
Why am I your heating pack?

231
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,249
I'd rather strap a heating pack on me instead.

232
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:46,560
By the way, why do you keep looking around?

233
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:49,859
Whenever spirits move around, they leave traces...

234
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:51,034
like footprints.

235
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:54,034
Gosh. To find out who that guy was,

236
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:57,200
you should go through his garbage. Goodness.

237
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:01,239
He had instant rice.

238
00:15:02,414 --> 00:15:03,770
And he also drank.

239
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:08,410
It looks like he drank alone without any friends.

240
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:10,579
Goodness.

241
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:12,920
He had a lonely life.

242
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:20,520
Why are you looking at me?

243
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,690
Well,

244
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,089
you should be careful.

245
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:27,229
You might end up dying alone too.

246
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:30,430
Look who's talking. You're a virgin who doesn't even have a house.

247
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:33,504
It's you who might die on the streets.

248
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,739
Gosh. No, I've been with...

249
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:46,780
What was that?

250
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:05,781
<font color="#8080ff">[VIU Ver] KBS2 E05 'Sell Your Haunted House'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

251
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:27,290
She must've gone crazy. What is she doing?

252
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,729
Turn around.

253
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:41,770
Show me your face.

254
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:18,469
Are you okay?

255
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,614
What are you doing?

256
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:26,719
Let me hold your hand for a bit.

257
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:10,559
What's that look on your face?

258
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:12,190
What?

259
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:15,065
What look?

260
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:18,269
It looks weird as if you have an ulterior motive.

261
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:21,469
You're unbelievable. You held my hand first.

262
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:25,170
I have my reasons.

263
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:28,309
Gosh.

264
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:31,009
- Of course, you do. - It's not what you think.

265
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:33,319
Whatever you have in mind, I assure you that's not it.

266
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:38,749
I can understand.

267
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:41,360
You held my hand,

268
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:43,259
but you don't want to admit your feelings.

269
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:46,430
It's not what you think.

270
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:48,759
When I hold your hand, my body temperature goes up.

271
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:52,999
So when you hold my hand, your body gets hot?

272
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:54,404
My goodness.

273
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:56,640
That was so bold I'm not even shy about it.

274
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,539
Let me explain this again.

275
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:02,085
My body temperature drops...

276
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:03,549
when I get close to an unrested spirit.

277
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:06,855
When I first started this job, I almost died from hypothermia.

278
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,424
That's why when I perform an exorcism,

279
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:11,025
I must bundle up as much as I can and finish as fast as I can.

280
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,719
But strangely, when I touch you...

281
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:16,160
When my body comes in contact with yours,

282
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,430
my low body temperature comes back up pretty quickly.

283
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,469
Does that only happen with me? Not with other psychics?

284
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:26,845
- Why is that? - I don't know that either.

285
00:19:26,845 --> 00:19:29,275
Anyway, to me, you are...

286
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,009
A special psychic.

287
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:34,640
Okay. Let's say I believe that.

288
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:38,350
Forget it. Let's go.

289
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:40,279
I'm exhausted today.

290
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:42,920
Yes, Ms. Joo.

291
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:44,950
I saw his face.

292
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:53,400
- Eat a lot. - Thank you.

293
00:19:58,204 --> 00:20:01,069
What about the art museum? Any progress?

294
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,775
I couldn't show the spirit of Chairman Kwon...

295
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,345
because Lee Eun Hye didn't show up.

296
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:05,880
I need to try again today.

297
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,309
Oh, right.

298
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:11,880
When I was waiting for her, I hacked into Britium's server.

299
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:14,184
Recently, someone turned off the security system...

300
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,995
and entered the exhibition hall.

301
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,719
- Who? - Lee Eun Hye.

302
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:21,924
- Lee Eun Hye? - Yes.

303
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:24,095
Something didn't feel right. So I looked into this.

304
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:25,934
There was a special clause in the insurance policy.

305
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,900
Even if the exhibition gets delayed, she makes profit, not a loss.

306
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:31,299
Do you think this whole thing could be staged?

307
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:37,840
No.

308
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:39,245
It makes no sense...

309
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:41,979
to damage the museum's reputation for some insurance money.

310
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:44,814
For now,

311
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:47,184
find all the recent CCTV footage.

312
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:50,190
If we search everywhere, I'm sure we'll find something.

313
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:54,819
What?

314
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,259
We ordered hangover soup.

315
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,630
We're out...

316
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:00,459
of cabbage leaves.

317
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:03,134
Then you should've told us when we ordered.

318
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,229
Whatever.

319
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:07,370
- Just eat it. - That's not nice.

320
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:09,714
What is this?

321
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:11,110
It's super delicious.

322
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:13,880
It really is delicious.

323
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:19,049
Good shot.

324
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,719
Nice shot, Director.

325
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:36,035
I haven't heard from you, so I thought you were very busy.

326
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:38,105
I guess you don't skip your morning exercise.

327
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:41,799
Was there a reason for me to contact you, Chairman Do?

328
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:43,809
I see.

329
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,910
I did receive a report about the Britium proposal.

330
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:51,209
I will go over it carefully and contact you.

331
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:52,924
I'm just worried,

332
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:55,279
especially now that Chairman Kwon is no longer around.

333
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:05,190
There's a time for everything.

334
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:09,430
Thank you for your concern.

335
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:24,709
Did you find out anything about Ms. Hong's mother?

336
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,920
I heard she died during a ritual.

337
00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:37,035
- A ritual? - Yes.

338
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:39,265
How did she manage to kill himself?

339
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:42,330
Isn't it usually the possessed one who dies from getting beaten?

340
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:54,840
- Incense. - What?

341
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:56,515
Ms. Hong burned an incense first...

342
00:22:56,515 --> 00:22:58,180
when she was preparing to do the exorcism.

343
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:04,454
Right, the incense in the expensive-looking bowl.

344
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:07,259
There must be something in it that causes hallucinations.

345
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:10,559
That's why I lost consciousness twice.

346
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:13,335
An exorcist who suddenly became aggravated...

347
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:14,765
while in a hallucinatory state died of a heart attack.

348
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:17,430
The client also died of side effects due to the hallucinations.

349
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:21,140
Ji Chul, we need to make a plan.

350
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:22,539
A plan?

351
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:24,370
(From sunset to sunrise)

352
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:21,400
From the outside, it looks like an ordinary realty office.

353
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:48,759
I know looks are important in this industry,

354
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:51,630
but these are really top quality for no good reason.

355
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,204
(Hanok Chicken Soup)

356
00:24:58,204 --> 00:24:59,670
Next group, please come in.

357
00:25:12,154 --> 00:25:14,549
Thank you. Next.

358
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:19,090
This helmet...

359
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:21,959
What?

360
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:24,160
She's going back home now?

361
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:33,440
Why aren't you picking up?

362
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:11,809
What's wrong with this?

363
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:15,140
I definitely charged it earlier.

364
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,444
Darn it.

365
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:41,069
(Who benefits from redevelopment? Wake up! Wake up!)

366
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,374
The phone is turned off.

367
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:48,340
- What? Why is your phone off? - Leave a message after...

368
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:37,190
I was scared for no reason.

369
00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:42,660
Why is it so chilly whenever I come here, though?

370
00:27:55,944 --> 00:27:57,049
What is that?

371
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:07,019
She should be more organized.

372
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:17,469
She has so many pairs of the same shoes.

373
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:28,239
Who is that?

374
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:52,370
What are you doing?

375
00:28:53,974 --> 00:28:56,870
It's a problem if you do this while I'm not home.

376
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:05,146
You can't make a mess just because you're unhappy with it Mom!

377
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,211
- Mom? - You just hide after doing this?

378
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:10,115
My goodness.

379
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:14,191
Why did she take everything out?

380
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,891
I know you don't like these, Mom.

381
00:29:15,891 --> 00:29:18,530
But each one has its own distinctive detail.

382
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:21,126
Why did you mix up the pairs?

383
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,996
My gosh.

384
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,005
Ms. Hong!

385
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,216
Are you in? Ms. Hong!

386
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,225
Ms. Hong!

387
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
What is it?

388
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,431
Mr. Oh... In Bum has gone missing.

389
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,566
So?

390
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,300
I was wondering if he was here.

391
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,196
He's not. Look elsewhere.

392
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,345
I love you.

393
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,616
It was love at first sight.

394
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,586
It's so sexy how cold you are.

395
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:29,996
Your violent personality is just my type.

396
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,071
Please have me.

397
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:33,565
- Are you insane? - I am, right?

398
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,970
I must've gone insane.

399
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,095
Gosh, I even have a girlfriend.

400
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,866
Please forget that, Ji A.

401
00:30:41,511 --> 00:30:42,675
I mean, Ms. Hong.

402
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,535
Then...

403
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:46,705
Goodbye.

404
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,185
Being beautiful is so tiring.

405
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,295
Darn it!

406
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:07,365
You startled me.

407
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:11,071
You should've called and let me know that she was home.

408
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:12,335
I did.

409
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,076
Anyway, where's the incense?

410
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,406
Don't you know who I am?

411
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,576
What is he talking about?

412
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,015
Take it.

413
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,416
Don't joke around. I'm not in a good mood.

414
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,455
What is that?

415
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,786
I swear I checked it before taking it.

416
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,460
It was definitely the incense.

417
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,661
Are you okay?

418
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,761
Maybe there really is a spirit.

419
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:40,865
- I couldn't even reach you. - There is no such thing.

420
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,740
What could it be?

421
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,805
(Daebak Realty)

422
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,126
Couldn't we have met somewhere else?

423
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,865
Welcome, Deputy Director Kwon.

424
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,465
- Isn't the view breathtaking? - I guess.

425
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,965
Has Eun Hye given you...

426
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:20,769
an answer yet?

427
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,610
It's only natural for her to hesitate...

428
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,175
since I offered her half the original amount.

429
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:27,710
Isn't half a bit too harsh?

430
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,251
Thirty percent,

431
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,545
and she would've resigned for sure.

432
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,585
You're more of a coward...

433
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,156
than I thought you were.

434
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,930
- What did you say? - In a redeveloping neighborhood,

435
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,400
you'll see houses...

436
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,096
that have red flags outside.

437
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,826
Do you know what they are?

438
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:51,265
They're people who are refusing the redevelopment.

439
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,835
I see.

440
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,436
Until now,

441
00:32:56,281 --> 00:33:00,376
every single one of them eventually put down their flags.

442
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:03,745
Director Lee has also put up a flag at the moment.

443
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,145
However,

444
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:09,886
that won't work against me.

445
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,696
You should relax for the time being.

446
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:30,380
He's the one we saw in Mullae-dong.

447
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,081
The autopsy result said that the cause of death was...

448
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:33,451
a cerebral concussion.

449
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:35,215
However, he was already in the final stage of lung cancer.

450
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:37,521
The approximated time of death is a month ago.

451
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:38,550
What's his name.

452
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,050
They can't identify him...

453
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,645
because his fingerprints have worn away.

454
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,620
According to the landlord, he was an artist.

455
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,430
- None of his paintings are... - Where did they get that file?

456
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,256
Even I couldn't hack into the NFS.

457
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,996
- Just in case... - I bet someone's on the take.

458
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,525
There's not much.

459
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:55,465
You two.

460
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,636
If you have something to say, come here and say it.

461
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,136
Should we?

462
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:13,750
If you give me that file, I could look into him.

463
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,915
Really?

464
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:17,955
Do it then.

465
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,731
Nice catch.

466
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:22,426
- What should I look into first? - His name.

467
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,095
Okay.

468
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,535
But how can you find something that even the police couldn't?

469
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,566
Just leave it to me.

470
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,481
Using just a shadow caught in a photo online,

471
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,940
I was the first person to find out...

472
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,246
that world stars Jung Jae Hoon and Kim Sae Hee were dating.

473
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,750
Why is he so enthusiastic about this?

474
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,176
It's the power of love.

475
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,155
What do you mean?

476
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:53,486
Beats me. What does she mean?

477
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:55,225
This is all because of you.

478
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,496
Let's end it here.

479
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,595
I'll go to Britium myself and identify him.

480
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,696
Goodbye.

481
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,835
Britium?

482
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,845
(Cho Hyun Seo's Private Exhibition)

483
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:16,120
Weren't we talking about Mullae-dong?

484
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,620
So why are we here?

485
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,046
Because it's the same unrested spirit.

486
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,291
I doubt that's true.

487
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:25,826
Why? Because you two made up the one here at Britium?

488
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:29,155
Come on. That's a bit harsh.

489
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,765
You know our plan fell apart because of you.

490
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,316
Where did I see this?

491
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,015
Where was it again?

492
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:00,025
That's Mullae-dong.

493
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,231
Judging by the accuracy,

494
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:04,296
the artist must've painted it there.

495
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:08,225
Did this artist know Cho Hyun Seo?

496
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,265
Or could it be...

497
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,076
How great are they to call me over at this late hour?

498
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,876
I'm sorry. This is important.

499
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,816
He must be the living legend of Korean art.

500
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,345
Mr. Cho Hyun Seo, it's an honor.

501
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,256
Thank you.

502
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:37,225
Gosh, you have smooth hands.

503
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:41,165
I guess you took great care of them since you're so famous.

504
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:44,335
Ma'am, who are they?

505
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,035
She's Ms. Hong Ji A, a realtor.

506
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:52,176
And as you both know, this is Cho Hyun Seo.

507
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,145
Please ask him.

508
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,915
What's the model's name in that painting of yours?

509
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,355
I know you're a realtor,

510
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,186
but don't you know what self-portraits are?

511
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,961
Cho Hyun Seo. That's me.

512
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:09,696
I'm talking about the real model.

513
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,701
What do you mean? A real model?

514
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:20,236
Do you want to get sued for defamation?

515
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:27,345
Don't get mad. I'll talk to him.

516
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:38,156
Ms. Hong!

517
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:40,625
Is she crazy? That's a priceless painting!

518
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,095
Why can't she be gentler?

519
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,135
You...

520
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,046
How dare you ruin my work?

521
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:05,885
- Do you know how much it costs? - I don't care.

522
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:08,546
Just tell me his name.

523
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:11,455
Tell me who the real painter is.

524
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:13,426
I paint my own work.

525
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,796
I'm Cho Hyun Seo!

526
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,530
Ask me that question one more time,

527
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,865
and I'll...

528
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:23,101
Twenty years of finger-painting will wear away your fingerprints.

529
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,770
Yet you claim to have painted all those paintings...

530
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,040
with these fine hands?

531
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,076
It hurts. Let me go first.

532
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:31,276
Tell me...

533
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,875
who this man is.

534
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:35,875
I don't know.

535
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,885
You saw an unrested spirit in that painting, didn't you?

536
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,245
No.

537
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,890
Do you want to be tormented by the unrested spirit...

538
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,960
for the rest of your life?

539
00:38:42,961 --> 00:38:45,186
Or do you want to tell me his name so that I can exorcise him?

540
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,926
Kim Byung Ho.

541
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:04,176
Well, you see...

542
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,505
He was a temporary assistant of mine.

543
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:10,481
I didn't know that scumbag had drawn...

544
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,615
under my painting like that.

545
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,885
I believe your assistant's painting is the best one you've had.

546
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,286
- Director Lee. - But then again,

547
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,030
that painting won't be shown to anyone.

548
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,625
Right.

549
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll take full responsibility and take care of it.

550
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,066
Of course, you will.

551
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:35,605
And as for all of my paintings in my studio,

552
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,205
I'll hand all of them to your museum.

553
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,676
Of course, you're required to do so as per contract.

554
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,245
You must retire.

555
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,615
Pardon?

556
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:49,615
What do you mean?

557
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,760
When people find out that you had a ghost artist,

558
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,260
the prestige of my museum will be destroyed...

559
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,826
as we've been sponsoring your art.

560
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:01,801
You are the fraud.

561
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:04,095
Why must my museum suffer the loss?

562
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,475
I'm Cho Hyun Seo.

563
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:12,576
How could you cut ties with me because of a mere...

564
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,546
You deceived me. This isn't a mere incident.

565
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:31,056
Just focus on your special exhibition for now.

566
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:33,465
Afterward,

567
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:35,495
you will retire...

568
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,135
quietly with your honor intact.

569
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,576
(Director Lee Eun Hye)

570
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,921
Who does she think she is? How dare she tell me to retire?

571
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:54,290
She doesn't even know what good art is.

572
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,985
She's no more than a lowly businesswoman. Darn her.

573
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:12,536
Darn it. Why isn't this working?

574
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,196
What's this? What's happening?

575
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,835
Oh, no. What's this?

576
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,416
How did you know that...

577
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,146
there was another painting behind the painting?

578
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,715
Don't tell me you could see through it.

579
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,990
- What? - Whatever I find out on the job...

580
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,186
is strictly confidential. That's my rule.

581
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:08,686
I see.

582
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:12,095
Just like how doctors and clients keep confidential information?

583
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,030
I see. So you're a professional like those people.

584
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,436
If you exploit the information you found out today,

585
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:19,735
you might die.

586
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:22,335
Why do you keep making death threats?

587
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,005
Fine.

588
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:25,875
Okay. I won't.

589
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,016
Gosh.

590
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,321
The name of the ghost artist is Kim Byung Ho.

591
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,585
Cho Hyun Seo said so himself.

592
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:38,786
Gather any evidence you can find.

593
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,156
I think we hit the jackpot.

594
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,495
Are you coming?

595
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,355
I'm coming.

596
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:50,140
- Did you look into it? - Yes. I did.

597
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,965
Cho Hyun Seo has two cell phones under his name.

598
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,365
- Two? - Yes.

599
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,910
So I tracked his phones.

600
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,640
He carries one with him.

601
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,676
And the other stays in only one location.

602
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:03,481
Yes! Hello.

603
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:05,215
- Take the food already. - Okay.

604
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,250
What? We ordered soft tofu.

605
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,790
Do you know how heavy the pots for soft tofu are?

606
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,290
You are only a few steps away from the restaurant.

607
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,691
Why did you make me deliver the food? What a hassle.

608
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,526
Wait. But...

609
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,266
She didn't say anything when we ordered our food.

610
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,066
But seriously? This smells awesome.

611
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:26,135
- All right. Let's eat. - Let's eat.

612
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,076
- Here. - Okay.

613
00:43:30,211 --> 00:43:31,536
Yes.

614
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,205
All right.

615
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:48,625
So Cho Hyun Seo has two phones under his name?

616
00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:51,030
One of the phones...

617
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,166
never left Mullae-dong.

618
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:56,896
That must be it.

619
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,536
That was the phone the ghost artist was using.

620
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:01,270
Videos were...

621
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,635
automatically backed up on the cloud from that phone.

622
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,205
(Videos)

623
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,906
There are over a hundred videos.

624
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:13,786
I don't think Cho Hyun Seo has any idea about these videos.

625
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,451
If he did, he would've deleted them. This exposes him as a fake.

626
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:16,855
He wouldn't have kept them.

627
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,860
Goodness. The ghost artist...

628
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,191
must have taken the videos to blackmail Cho Hyun Seo.

629
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:24,426
But he ended up dead before he could do that.

630
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,495
Then, I ought to fulfill the desire of the late painter.

631
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,076
This place is grand.

632
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,345
- Oh, no. - What is it?

633
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,516
I'm good. Let's go inside.

634
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,906
Darn it.

635
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:14,646
That darned jerk.

636
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:19,146
Is that it?

637
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:22,416
You will get the remaining 113 videos...

638
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:24,416
once you pay us.

639
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,396
This is odd. It seems less than I was expecting.

640
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,205
Is it just me?

641
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,465
I'll give you...

642
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,635
the rest of the money...

643
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:45,975
once you get rid of all the spirits here.

644
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,245
I heard that you guys get rid of spirits. Right?

645
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,416
I see.

646
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:57,686
That's why this place became a melting pot of religions.

647
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,625
But that's too bad.

648
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:03,361
The lady you saw the other day, Ms. Hong, handles the exorcisms.

649
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,530
Then, get her here now.

650
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,131
Call her now.

651
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,665
Call Ms. Hong now.

652
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,865
Seeing how you're changing your stance,

653
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:18,675
I guess you're okay with the videos going viral.

654
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,375
Let's go, Chief Heo.

655
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,095
He's back. He's back again.

656
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,070
Don't go. Don't leave me.

657
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,540
Do something before you leave!

658
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,471
I'll give you all of my money.

659
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,411
I'll give you all the money. Please don't leave.

660
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:50,875
Really? I should sit down, then.

661
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:54,476
What are you doing? Sit down.

Hey, In Bum.

In Bum.

669
00:47:59,061 --> 00:48:00,756
He's coming.

670
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:37,371
How did you know...

671
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:39,199
I told you if you exploit this, you'd die.

672
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,395
What?

673
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,406
Gosh. What was that?

674
00:48:57,151 --> 00:49:00,115
Gosh. What just happened?

675
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:09,666
(Yongin Police Station)

676
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:12,895
So when you arrived, the incident already happened.

677
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,740
But how did you find that place?

678
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,736
A client asked me to go there.

679
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,010
What's your client's name?

680
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,535
Director Lee Eun Hye of Britium.

681
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,946
Lee Eun Hye.

682
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:26,276
Britium?

683
00:49:27,321 --> 00:49:29,115
- Just let her go. - What?

684
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,690
You can go.

685
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,085
I spoke with Britium's legal representative already.

686
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,315
Wrap it up.

687
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,266
Wait, Ms. Hong, what about us?

688
00:49:45,331 --> 00:49:46,500
Ms. Hong, Ms. Hong!

689
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,835
Don't call after her.

690
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,406
We didn't do anything wrong, so we'll be released soon.

691
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,666
I doubt that.

692
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:55,841
Why did you hit Cho Hyun Seo?

693
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:58,406
Come on. That wasn't hitting.

694
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,020
We were negotiating well and the mood was nice.

695
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,315
Are you really going to insist when we have evidence?

696
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:05,545
Evidence?

697
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:10,285
What is this?

698
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,361
What? When did he grab that?

699
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:16,970
The woman who works there...

700
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,526
even gave eyewitness testimony.

701
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:19,696
Chief Heo,

702
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,895
say something.

703
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,206
But I passed out, so I don't remember much.

704
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,006
Why are you trembling?

705
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:47,125
Ji Chul.

706
00:50:49,061 --> 00:50:50,226
Earlier, when I...

707
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,105
I'm sorry.

708
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,206
But you were really scary earlier.

709
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,145
It was like you were someone else.

710
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,790
Oh, no.

711
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,901
Hey, are you all right?

712
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:22,700
He's bleeding. What if it's serious?

713
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,331
- What am I doing here? - Are you crazy, kid?

714
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:26,401
Did you do this?

715
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:29,411
- No, it wasn't me. - If it wasn't you, then who was it?

716
00:51:29,411 --> 00:51:31,510
- Look at him. - How dare you lie to us.

717
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,176
Where are your parents?

718
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:34,706
Why, this little...

719
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:36,776
Grandma.

720
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,095
You were a psychic?

721
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,595
If you were born a psychic, this must've happened often.

722
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,395
You're special.

723
00:51:58,931 --> 00:52:00,696
Am I really a psychic?

724
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:05,065
I was really possessed by spirits?

725
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,105
That's absurd.

726
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,716
My goodness.

727
00:52:17,821 --> 00:52:21,186
Oh In Bum. I don't care how greedy he is for money.

728
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:23,486
But how can he rush in like that without even thinking twice?

729
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,895
Once a fraud, always a fraud.

730
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,696
Heat or no heat, I'll kick him out as soon as this exorcism is over.

731
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,341
What will you do about the exorcism anyhow?

732
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:39,236
Did you find a way to do it?

733
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:42,035
I'll have to lure the spirit in with his work.

734
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:45,345
He is obsessed with his artworks, after all.

735
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:50,091
Then we'll have to do it in Cho's studio or at Britium.

736
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:52,351
Britium appears to have taken every single piece of art...

737
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,555
in Cho Hyun Seo's studio.

738
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,730
Lee Eun Hye moves fast.

739
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:00,325
So that just leaves Britium.

740
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:02,730
I'm sure Director Lee...

741
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,200
will never allow us to do exorcism in the same place as the artworks.

742
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,736
I don't need her permission.

743
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,766
The exorcism will be performed at the Mullae-dong studio.

744
00:53:11,611 --> 00:53:14,075
If the spirit has been unable to leave this place,

745
00:53:14,411 --> 00:53:17,476
it means there is another painting hidden here somewhere.

746
00:53:46,841 --> 00:53:49,341
Ms. Joo, I found the painting.

747
00:53:49,341 --> 00:53:52,145
Okay, then I'll take care of the rest.

748
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:02,986
This is Dongfang meiren.

749
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,855
It's excellent quality.

750
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:13,071
When I became Director of Britium, I received it as a gift.

751
00:54:13,071 --> 00:54:15,601
To this day, it remains my favorite tea.

752
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:17,071
I thought it would suit you perfectly,

753
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:18,605
and I was right.

754
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:23,706
How long has it been? Ten years?

755
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:28,145
I do hear news from Chairman Han once in a while.

756
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,645
Chairman Han, of the Masan investment firm?

757
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:36,361
Not only is he a VVIP of Daebak Realty,

758
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:38,585
but he's also our secret salesperson.

759
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:45,071
He appeared to have great faith in Ms. Hong's skills.

760
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:47,535
Yes, as you'll soon see for yourself, Director Lee.

761
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,710
Does that mean you will take on...

762
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,605
the sale of Britium?

763
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:59,081
It is the sale of Korea's finest art museum.

764
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:00,375
Of course, we accept.

765
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:02,746
However,

766
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,285
would you be willing to grant us just one small favor?

767
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:10,486
Out. You're being released with a warning.

768
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:15,256
Get in.

769
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,496
- I don't want to. - Thank you.

770
00:55:32,181 --> 00:55:34,216
Wait, what about me?

771
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:37,615
I'm not in the car yet.

772
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,026
What are you doing? Chief Heo didn't get in.

773
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:50,325
It's dangerous for ordinary people to be around when we're working.

774
00:55:50,831 --> 00:55:51,901
Work?

775
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:54,266
Are we going to do an exorcism right now?

776
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,906
I absolutely refuse.

777
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:01,176
Then stuff yourself on jail food for attempted murder.

778
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:03,311
Are you blackmailing me?

779
00:56:03,311 --> 00:56:04,676
Turn the car around.

780
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:06,776
I'd rather eat jail food then.

781
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,615
You believe it now, right?

782
00:56:12,351 --> 00:56:14,115
That you're a psychic.

783
00:56:19,131 --> 00:56:20,431
Please, of course not.

784
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:23,631
When we first signed our contract, you did not believe...

785
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,565
that you were a psychic, nor that unrested spirits exist.

786
00:56:26,101 --> 00:56:28,696
That's how you were able to sign the contract so freely.

787
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,906
Isn't that right?

788
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,635
That's right. I still don't believe it.

789
00:56:35,911 --> 00:56:37,506
There's no such thing as ghosts.

790
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,416
Then why are you saying you don't want to work?

791
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,520
If there are no spirits...

792
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,085
and all my exorcisms are fake,

793
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:48,656
why are you suddenly so scared to join me on an exorcism?

794
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:00,926
What are you doing?

795
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:04,795
Hostage negotiations to lure the unrested spirit out.

796
00:58:06,331 --> 00:58:07,696
Blackmail, in a way.

797
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,611
You just stand there...

798
00:58:14,611 --> 00:58:16,676
and when I say so, take your necklace off.

799
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,416
If I...

800
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:24,486
take this off...

801
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,385
I'll take care of the rest.

802
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,466
He came quickly.

803
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:52,575
Now. Take off the necklace.

804
00:58:56,891 --> 00:58:58,016
Hurry!

805
00:58:59,891 --> 00:59:01,156
Why are you trembling?

806
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:06,285
- Where are your parents? - Where are they?

807
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,456
I can't do it.

808
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,295
I don't want a spirit...

809
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,335
- to take over my body again. - Hey.

810
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,406
We don't have much time.

811
00:59:24,881 --> 00:59:26,105
You were right.

812
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,176
I've experienced this many times in the past.

813
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,516
I've finally realized...

814
00:59:33,421 --> 00:59:35,115
that I was possessed.

815
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,295
Do you know how many times I woke up with bloody hands?

816
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,196
I don't want that to happen...

817
00:59:49,171 --> 00:59:50,666
anymore.

818
01:00:26,611 --> 01:00:29,181
(Sell Your Haunted House)

819
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:31,550
This is what you made your psychics do to make money?

820
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:32,780
That's assault!

821
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,050
That's exactly why you should've taken it off.

822
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:38,020
Due to that artist's memory, I become teary-eyed all the time.

823
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,621
Ask Director Lee to return one of his paintings.

824
01:00:40,621 --> 01:00:42,121
He's already dead.

825
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:43,591
What are you doing? You're scaring me.

826
01:00:43,591 --> 01:00:44,591
No way! I just painted...

827
01:00:44,591 --> 01:00:47,500
one of Cho Hyun Seo's pictures. The greatest painter of all time.

828
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,171
Oh In Bum is here to sell the painting.

829
01:00:50,171 --> 01:00:51,871
Oh In Bum, that little...

830
01:00:51,871 --> 01:00:53,470
Are all your clients' requests stored here?

831
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:54,540
Why do you ask?

832
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,601
We're dealing with spirits here.

833
01:00:55,601 --> 01:00:58,570
Does that mean neither the client nor the exorcist is safe?

834
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,706
Mom... Mom, I'm sorry.
