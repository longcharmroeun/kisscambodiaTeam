1
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:11,442
Now. Take off the necklace.

2
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:14,772
I can't do it. I won't.

3
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:17,283
You can do it. You have to.

4
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,112
I don't want to do this, Mom.

5
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,323
Ji A, are you awake?

6
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:36,802
Auntie.

7
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:41,203
What happened to Mom?

8
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,313
Call me if you need any help. Anytime, okay?

9
00:00:56,288 --> 00:00:59,323
Mom died because of me, didn't she?

10
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:02,292
No, that's not true.

11
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:06,262
Mom told me to stab the ghost,

12
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:08,592
but I was too scared to do it.

13
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:11,268
You were right.

14
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:13,473
I've experienced this many times in the past.

15
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,333
I always thought I was sleepwalking.

16
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:20,913
I've finally realized that I was possessed.

17
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:26,913
Do you know how many times I woke up with bloody hands?

18
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,282
I don't want that to happen...

19
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,527
anymore.

20
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:34,693
You'll never wake up...

21
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,922
with bloody hands again.

22
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:40,493
I won't let that happen.

23
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,232
Trust me and take the necklace off.

24
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:32,913
Ji Won,

25
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:35,153
once the surgery succeeds,

26
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,353
we can go home.

27
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:40,792
I'll organize everything.

28
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:58,503
Ji Won,

29
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,443
how can I leave you...

30
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:06,512
all alone?

31
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:18,323
I have to go home.

32
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:22,063
I have to go home.

33
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:23,503
Home?

34
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:26,133
Why would someone who died at home become a wandering spirit?

35
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:37,612
What was it...

36
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,582
that just entered my body?

37
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:45,723
The memories that the spirit could not let go of, even in death.

38
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:09,547
Please come again.

39
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,987
Why did you tear it off when I was going to take it off?

40
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:13,517
I was getting emotionally prepared.

41
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:15,253
That's assault!

42
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:18,152
That's exactly why you should've taken it off when I told you to.

43
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:20,253
I was going to.

44
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,193
Even if you hadn't done that, I would've taken it off.

45
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,167
What is this?

46
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:29,067
What an embarrassing sight, crying like a baby.

47
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,933
What's there to cry about?

48
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,702
Hey, mister, it's not like that.

49
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,478
This isn't me crying.

50
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:40,642
I know.

51
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,673
That's a side effect.

52
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,313
A side effect?

53
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:08,838
Once the unrested spirit's memory enters your body,

54
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:10,208
even after the exorcism is over,

55
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,003
those memories and habits remain in you for a while.

56
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:16,078
You should stay home for a week instead of going out.

57
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:17,747
You should've told me that!

58
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:19,247
It's in the contract.

59
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:20,483
The contract...

60
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,022
How long did you say it lasts?

61
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,427
A week? It's not forever, is it?

62
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:34,832
The emotions gradually wear away.

63
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,962
But the memories stay.

64
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:44,873
So this painful memory will last forever?

65
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:48,012
This memory of a stranger's?

66
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:53,282
This is what you made your psychics do to make money?

67
00:05:54,257 --> 00:05:56,613
Gosh, you're really cruel.

68
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,388
You don't even pay us that much.

69
00:05:58,388 --> 00:05:59,753
The unrested spirit's memory...

70
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:02,222
shouldn't be absorbed by the psychic.

71
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,398
What are you talking about?

72
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,592
Usually, the exorcist is the one who absorbs it.

73
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,233
But whenever I perform exorcisms with you,

74
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:12,338
you absorb their memory.

75
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,873
I told you this the day we first met.

76
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,718
I see. So is that why you asked to work together?

77
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:30,927
You coldhearted woman.

78
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:32,958
You're the one who mentioned it first.

79
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,222
Do you not remember that either?

80
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:02,253
Like I said, it's best to stay home.

81
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:21,472
Oh In Bum.

82
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,743
What is it this time?

83
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:11,923
Eat your favorite dishes, watch your favorite shows,

84
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:13,952
and buy whatever you like.

85
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,162
Try to take your mind off of it.

86
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,338
Good work today.

89
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,602
have you been doing this?

90
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:35,413
Ten years.

91
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:38,013
Why?

92
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,117
It must've been tough.

93
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:44,452
I've only done it once, and it's already unbearable.

94
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:46,323
But you've been doing this singlehandedly for that long.

95
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,693
You did great today as well, Ms. Hong.

100

Oh, gosh.

102
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:42,372
Check out my reflexes. I saved the chicken.

103
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,013
You want me to carry them one by one safely?

104
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:48,913
Making several trips is a hassle.

105
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:52,323
Move aside, so I can pass.

106
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:56,452
Forget it.

107
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:00,163
I'll walk around you, my gosh.

00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:09,832
It's...

110
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:14,472
Gosh, you could've moved.

111
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:17,943
Gosh.

112
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,513
Let's eat.

113
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,783
This looks delicious.

114
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,803
- So this was why. - What?

115
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:45,143
What do you mean?

116
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:48,842
Kids from my neighborhood never played with me.

117
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:52,283
Some of them threw stones at me...

118
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:54,252
while others ran away crying.

119
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:57,053
The look on their faces...

120
00:10:58,757 --> 00:10:59,923
was the same one as yours.

121
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:06,492
It's okay.

122
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:09,033
Even my grandma said...

123
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:11,232
that I was possessed...

124
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:13,403
and that it was my fate.

125
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,832
She'd curse at me.

126
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:20,102
I thought it was ridiculous.

127
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:22,643
But she was right.

Do understand. Please?

I'll never be afraid of you ever again. I promise.

Are you still...

133
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,563
scared of me?

No.

I still don't know why my uncle had this.

139
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,132
I must find out.

And I'm crying all the time.

187
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:40,163
Gosh. I'm about to cry again.

188
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:42,732
Just give it a week.

189
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:45,338
I explained everything to you yesterday.

190
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,362
You said you would take care of it.

191
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:52,173
Take responsibility for what you said!

192
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:57,117
What? You look awful.

193
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,783
- Shouldn't you go see a doctor? - Be quiet. Just come in.

194
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,323
Go ahead.

195
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,023
Pardon?

196
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,152
You wanted a solution.

197
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:12,368
Punching the sandbag until I forget the deceased's memories is...

198
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:13,763
my solution.

199
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:16,197
Is there another solution that's non-violent?

200
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:17,908
I'm a delicate guy.

201
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,902
Then, punch it delicately.

202
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:22,902
You can't just leave like that.

203
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:29,442
Sorry. It was urgent.

204
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:39,152
Sorry. It was urgent for me as well.

205
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:44,662
Urgent? What do you mean?

206
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:47,463
I told you. When I touch you...

207
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,168
When my body comes in contact with yours,

208
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,832
my body temperature comes back to normal.

209
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:56,178
Oh, that? Then, you must be grateful to me.

210
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:59,402
You must do something to help the psychic you are grateful to.

211
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:01,247
What do you want me to do?

212
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,513
I don't know. Do something!

213
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,483
Do you know what happened to me last night?

214
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:10,082
(Administration, Prescription Pickup Counter)

215
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:40,642
Excuse me.

216
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,352
Excuse me.

217
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:47,852
Who are you?

218
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,092
- Pardon? - Pardon?

219
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:01,102
Gosh. How did I end up here?

220
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:06,203
I came here to see her, but I'm leaving now.

221
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:11,247
- Wait. - Yes?

222
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:13,582
Can you give this to Choi Ji Won's guardian?

223
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,053
He has a wife?

224
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:29,192
They didn't register their marriage, but they were practically married.

225
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,763
And his wife is very sick now.

226
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,102
She needs to get the surgery,

227
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:38,073
but the money...

228
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,277
I've given this some thought.

229
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:42,878
Let's ask Director Lee to give back one of his paintings.

230
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:44,847
Returning a painting means...

231
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:48,013
that she's acknowledging that there was a ghost painter.

232
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,953
There's no reason she would take that big of a risk.

233
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,523
- Come on! - Hey.

234
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,463
When you punched it, you pretended it was my face, right?

235
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:09,172
Given the circumstance, we should get the media involved.

236
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:12,473
If we disclose Kim Byung Ho's videos online,

237
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:15,547
Britium will be an accomplice in this grand fraud case...

238
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,813
and face a huge monetary loss.

239
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,287
And I'm sure you will be in a tight spot since you signed...

240
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,888
an NDA with her.

241
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,152
The grand fraud case.

242
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:29,323
You don't have the videos, do you?

243
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:32,468
You didn't even watch the videos, did you?

244
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:34,868
The videos? I deleted all of them.

245
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:36,668
Every single one of them.

246
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,638
Ms. Hong told us to erase all of them...

247
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,563
when she got us out.

248
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:44,003
Gosh. No way.

249
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:46,303
Do you think I'd bluff without the videos?

250
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:51,313
Gosh. Come on.

251
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:56,057
Didn't you see a yellow ginkgo tree in his painting?

252
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:58,253
He drew that in because his wife likes that.

253
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:00,283
But...

254
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,422
Just pretend that you watched a very sad movie.

255
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,168
As you can't change the plot of a movie,

256
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:07,763
there's nothing we can do.

257
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:11,132
He's already dead, anyway.

258
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:14,602
But Choi Ji Won is alive!

259
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:18,408
Performing an exorcism isn't just for the unrested spirit.

260
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:20,872
It's also for the people who are left behind.

261
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,713
They must go on their lives.

262
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,582
Say something.

263
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:37,892
Gosh.

264
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:43,192
He was incredibly talented,

265
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,402
but he only led a life of suffering.

266
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:06,287
You offered me a good deal.

267
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:09,597
I am happy to do business with you.

268
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:12,767
It's an honor that both of you are satisfied.

269
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,463
All right. I'll get going now.

270
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:18,703
Ms. Hong. I'll count on you again next time.

271
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:24,503
I'll say goodbye here.

272
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:27,273
Good luck with your business.

273
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:38,152
I made sure the backed-up videos were deleted.

274
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:40,327
It's up to you to decide if you want to delete...

275
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,122
these videos as well.

276
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,993
So you are telling me...

277
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:51,208
that the unrested spirit will no longer show up here.

278
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,463
That's right.

279
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,973
I took care of it for good.

280
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:02,142
My husband wanted to be a painter at first.

281
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:05,382
As he couldn't fulfill his dream,

282
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:09,453
Britium had a special place in his heart.

283
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:12,688
Expanding the museum was his last wish as well.

284
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:14,053
In the end,

285
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,993
he left too soon to see that.

286
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:24,932
Was your husband happy?

287
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:30,077
I know that you were hoping...

288
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,303
that the unrested spirit here would be him.

289
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:39,243
I wanted to see him one last time...

290
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:42,453
even if it was just his spirit.

291
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:44,823
But he didn't show up.

292
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:47,823
How cold.

293
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:51,253
People who led happy lives don't remain as unrested spirits.

294
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,993
The fact that you can't see his spirit proves...

295
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:59,402
that he led a happy life with you.

296
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:08,948
They didn't register their marriage, but they were practically married.

297
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:12,783
And his wife is very sick now.

298
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,358
Those paintings belong to Kim Byung Ho.

299
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:17,382
Of course, his wife deserves to have one.

300
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,723
Mr. Kim had a wife.

301
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:35,102
Mr. Kim often painted yellow gingko trees...

302
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:38,473
because that was his wife's favorite tree.

303
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,447
As for the self-portrait,

304
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,073
he painted it for himself.

305
00:24:43,478 --> 00:24:46,743
Can you at least give it back to his wife?

306
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,453
That is all you have to say to me, right?

307
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:14,047
That was embarrassing.

308
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:15,747
I never ask for favors. This is all Oh In Bum's fault.

309
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,612
Why did I embarrass myself like that?

310
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:42,478
At that price, we could have totally matched it.

311
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:44,777
You should have told me.

312
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,003
I thought...

313
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:50,372
you were waiting for the price to fall further.

314
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:55,453
I assumed you had missed your chance, Chairman Do.

315
00:25:56,918 --> 00:25:58,922
Perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.

316
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:04,892
Please have your tea before it cools.

317
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:07,122
If you don't drink it at the right moment,

318
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:10,763
you can no longer appreciate the full effect of the taste.

319
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:27,513
It's bitter.

320
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:35,192
What is this?

321
00:26:40,728 --> 00:26:43,993
In Bum, what are you doing? You're scaring me.

322
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:50,102
Hey, don't come near me. Go away.

323
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,142
What's wrong?

324
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:55,813
Did you have a nightmare?

325
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:57,942
- Blood. - Blood?

326
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:04,087
- What did you do? - Blood, it's blood!

327
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,253
What is all this?

328
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:12,963
It's a side effect of being possessed.

329
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:16,293
How can you live like this?

330
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,902
- Wait a minute. - What is it?

331
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,743
Just now, I've created a Kim Byung Ho,

332
00:27:26,648 --> 00:27:28,543
no, a painting by Cho Hyun Seo.

333
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:30,148
The greatest painter of all time.

334
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,743
- Right? - Right.

335
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:35,213
If it's a Cho Hyun Seo piece...

336
00:27:36,317 --> 00:27:37,412
That's amazing.

337
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:39,922
These side effects aren't just a bad thing.

338
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:43,122
With this, we can take care of Choi Ji Won's surgery.

339
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:45,527
Are you kidding me? Choi Ji Won?

340
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:48,023
Why would we take care of a stranger's surgery fee?

341
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:54,503
Because I feel like I have to take care...

342
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,902
of that stranger in order for me to live on.

343
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:59,842
Whenever I picture that face,

344
00:28:01,817 --> 00:28:03,573
my heart...

345
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:05,983
Here it comes again.

346
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:08,188
The tears are streaming down.

347
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:09,382
Anyway,

348
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:12,053
this is how I'll survive.

349
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,422
And as for the painting,

350
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:16,622
I can just make another one.

351
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:18,763
That's true.

352
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:21,763
If you can create more paintings with these hands,

353
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:24,902
you're a goose that lays golden eggs!

354
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:31,973
Find out who has a ton of cash at hand...

355
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,448
in this industry.

356
00:28:33,448 --> 00:28:35,213
Okay, just wait a moment.

357
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:50,257
Are you really not going?

358
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:51,862
Secretary Joo, you go instead.

359
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:55,892
So many spirits gather in places with crowds.

360
00:28:58,368 --> 00:28:59,533
Okay.

361
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:06,743
You're here.

362
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:08,672
You've come.

363
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,372
Yes.

364
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,422
Thank you.

365
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:29,463
Is Oh In Bum doing well?

366
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:30,793
No.

367
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:33,033
He went to the museum to sell a painting.

368
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:34,932
He went to sell what?

369
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,475
The mood is so classy here.

370
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,145
That's great.

371
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,651
- Look at that one. - This is from Germany.

372
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:52,156
The color is exquisite.

373
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,800
- I'll see you later. - See you soon.

374
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,236
- All right. - Goodbye.

375
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,580
- Long time no see, Hwa Jung. - Oh, hello.

376
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,181
Are you still working at that shabby shop?

377
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:19,476
- Any desire to come back? - What?

378
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,951
Work here is just so fun.

379
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:25,086
How did they manage to captivate you so much?

380
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,830
I thought you said you weren't coming.

381
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,556
- Have you seen Oh In Bum? - No.

382
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,995
What?

383
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,935
Who was that beauty?

384
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,495
The CEO of our shabby shop.

385
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:44,265
Ms. Hong, fancy seeing you here.

386
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,941
I heard you took care of Director Lee's business well.

387
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:48,306
Good work.

388
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,855
(Special Exhibit of Kim Byung Ho, the Tragic Genius)

389
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,756
The painter Kim Byung Ho had no education and no connections.

390
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:12,241
He had to live for twenty years as the ghost painter...

391
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:14,810
of the well-educated and well-connected artist,

392
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,465
Cho Hyun Seo.

393
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:26,420
What is that?

394
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,681
- What? - Isn't that?

395
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:29,620
She's saying they weren't real?

396
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,290
- What? - What is this?

397
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,685
She said she couldn't do this so cut and dry,

398
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,655
but she convinced Director Lee in the end.

399
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,965
The truth...

400
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:43,970
was only revealed...

401
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,900
- after the painter passed away. - I spent a lot of time...

402
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,641
working on my art,

403
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:49,171
and today, with this prize,

404
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:52,810
I feel I have been rewarded for the time and effort...

405
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,505
I have poured into my work.

406
00:31:55,681 --> 00:32:00,676
This piece won Cho Hyun Seo the Grand Prize at this art exhibit.

407
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,120
But before that,

408
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,785
when it was submitted under Kim Byung Ho's name,

409
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:07,685
it did not even qualify in the preliminary rounds.

410
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:11,600
Here at Britium,

411
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,095
even if we must reveal our own flaws,

412
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:16,370
we believe that revealing the truth...

413
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:20,340
would be to pay our final respects to the deceased.

414
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,965
We sincerely apologize...

415
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,905
to everyone here, as well as to artist Kim Byung Ho.

416
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:29,380
- That was shocking. - This is insane.

417
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,116
- I can't believe it. - Really?

418
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,646
Cho Hyun Seo fled.

419
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,320
It doesn't matter what country.

420
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,026
Just get one that leaves the soonest.

421
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,826
Fancy meeting you here,

422
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,030
Artist Cho.

423
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,225
Darn it.

424
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,535
Are you insane, you jerk?

425
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,970
Do you want to die? You want to die?

426
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,405
Mr. Cho Hyun Seo.

427
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,646
You're under arrest for the murder of Kim Byung Ho.

428
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,116
- Murder? - What?

429
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,280
Not fraud?

430
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,551
Do you have proof?

431
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:10,391
Yes, we have video footage of you killing Mr. Kim.

432
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:11,921
- A video? - That's impossible.

433
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:13,586
I deleted everything.

434
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:14,986
What?

435
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,826
You want 200,000 dollars? You must be insane.

436
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,255
You're not in your right mind.

437
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:22,771
Did you start gambling behind my back?

438
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:24,965
That's how much they're worth.

439
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,035
My pieces.

440
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,465
My pieces?

441
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:31,011
You think that's the value of your work?

442
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:35,451
It's the value of my reputation, the reputation of Cho Hyun Seo.

443
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:37,350
If you try to sell your work without my name attached,

444
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,481
you won't even get 200 dollars for them.

445
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:40,975
But I...

446
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,616
They said I'm in the final stages of lung cancer.

447
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,055
I'm dying.

448
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:54,196
For the sake of our relationship,

449
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:56,996
could you please buy just one of my pieces...

450
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,936
at the proper value?

451
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:04,905
I really need that money.

452
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,805
- The final stages of lung cancer? - With the time I have left,

453
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,805
I want to return to my hometown...

454
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,446
and spend it with my wife.

455
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,746
Hold on.

456
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:18,215
Lung cancer?

457
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,586
What will happen to me if you die?

458
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:23,086
What about me?

459
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:31,165
- What are you doing? - Move aside. These are all mine.

460
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,136
Move. They're mine.

461
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,276
Hold on.

462
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,710
No, not this one.

463
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,345
Move aside.

464
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:45,080
No! Please! Not this one!

465
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,020
Move! It's mine! Move!

466
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,516
I said, move!

467
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:01,996
Hey.

468
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,696
Hey. What's wrong with you?

469
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:15,646
Darn it!

470
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,200
No. Wait.

471
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,305
That's not what happened. Wait.

472
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:24,006
I'd like to sincerely thank all of you for coming.

473
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,820
She turned the worst case into something favorable.

474
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,115
She's indeed amazing.

475
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,595
Hello.

476
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:43,301
I didn't think you'd tell the truth.

477
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,425
I wasn't going to.

478
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,896
But...

479
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:49,905
Please.

480
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,006
What you said...

481
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,746
reminded me of what my husband said.

482
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,186
Every time he saw Kim Byung Ho's work,

483
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,620
he said it felt like a love letter...

484
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,155
even if the painting...

485
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:09,925
only showed scenery.

486
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:14,896
I didn't think too much of it since he was an emotional person.

487
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,396
But after speaking with you,

488
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:19,171
I thought it was only right...

489
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:22,235
to send those letters to the original recipient.

490
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:28,845
It seemed like the last favor I could do for my husband.

491
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:31,345
The reporters are waiting.

492
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,686
I hope you enjoy the party.

493
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,965
Did you know beforehand?

494
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:57,636
- Had you agreed on it? - No.

495
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,305
- Oh In Bum. - What?

496
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,281
He came here to sell the work...

497
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,051
he had painted while being possessed.

498
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:06,080
Have you seen him?

499
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,720
Oh, my gosh.

500
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,886
He's gone totally insane. How could he think of such a thing?

501
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:12,986
I might as well just kill him.

502
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,585
Where could he be?

503
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,860
Right.

504
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,990
I saw that Chairman Han from the Masan investment firm...

505
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,555
had come with an appraiser.

506
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,766
Among the videos we had found, one of them had recorded the murder.

507
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,511
How did you miss that?

508
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:30,210
There were 113 videos.

509
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,035
How could I have checked all of them?

510
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,736
We have decided to give...

511
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,051
- Kim Byung Ho's wife, - Hold on.

512
00:38:36,051 --> 00:38:38,011
- What is it? - Choi Ji Won,

513
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:41,146
all of her late husband's work without anything in return.

514
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,590
Hey, Britium just announced that they'll give Choi Ji Won...

515
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,386
all of her husband's work.

516
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:49,060
- What? - She'll be filthy rich now!

517
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,226
That means she'll finally be able to receive surgery.

518
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,825
The money I got for this painting...

519
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,165
is all ours.

520
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:03,871
You better not back out and say that your heart is breaking.

521
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:05,575
Don't you worry.

522
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,310
Check out the townhouse you wanted. The biggest one at that.

523
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,006
Oh, yes!

524
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:15,246
Living a righteous life has paid off.

525
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,116
It's authentic, sir.

526
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,825
You wanted me to pay in cash, right?

527
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,195
Correct.

528
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:03,866
Here you go.

529
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,881
(To my beloved wife, Ji Won)

530
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:19,045
Here.

531
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:23,445
- What are you doing? - Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

532
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:25,915
When did I write that?

533
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,226
Let go of it.

534
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:34,560
This is your only chance to sell this.

535
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,795
What should I do?

536
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,876
- Ms. Hong. - I'm sorry to tell you this, sir.

537
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,986
But the painting you just purchased is fake.

538
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:58,346
What are you talking about?

539
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:01,320
Didn't you purchase one of Kim Byung Ho's paintings?

540
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,386
That lunatic refused to sell it and left.

541
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:20,805
You're...

542
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,305
finally home.

543
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,776
I'm sorry, Ji Won,

544
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,415
for taking so long.

545
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:47,096
(2021 Mullae-dong 55)

546
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,165
Is this it?

547
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,976
What's wrong with me?

548
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:04,606
It was so easy to paint last time.

549
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,075
You said it was easy to paint another one.

550
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,415
You said it was a cakewalk.

551
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:12,356
So what...

552
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,055
What is this?

553
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:16,490
Do something, will you?

554
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,155
Gosh. This can't be happening.

555
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,266
Short padded jackets are in trend these days.

556
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,565
That's perfect in length. Just what I needed.

557
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,710
(Oh In Bum)

558
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,580
We won't be having another deal.

559
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,751
- What is it? - Why is the habit already gone?

560
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:39,121
You said it'd at least last a week.

561
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:41,376
You're complaining about that?

562
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:43,551
If you're done talking, hang up. I'm busy.

563
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:44,716
Wait!

564
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,185
Is there no way to retrieve the habit?

565
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,726
Perhaps, a spell or...

566
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:50,761
What is this lunatic rambling about?

567
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,555
- It's all sold out. - It's all sold out.

568
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:54,830
Great job. Congratulations to all.

569
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,771
I hope you wear them well.

570
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:58,700
Now that we've sold them all, we're going to go now.

571
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,195
- Thank you. - Thank you.

572
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:03,405
Oh In Bum, that little...

573
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,905
What? What did she say?

574
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,045
She hung up.

575
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:15,080
Let's go and ask Ms. Choi to give back the painting.

576
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,346
I'm sure she will once she hears our story.

577
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,055
She must be rich now.

578
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,521
How could I tell her that?

579
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:21,820
That her husband's posthumous painting was...

580
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,391
a fake painting that I drew?

581
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:24,590
Gosh. I can't tell her that.

582
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,261
Then, what are we going to do?

583
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:28,665
Without that, we won't be able to buy a townhouse!

584
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,935
(Daebak Realty)

585
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,415
Hello, Ms. Joo!

586
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,990
Don't act like a thug.

587
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,920
You checked that I wired the fee.

588
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:56,626
You look beautiful today as always.

589
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:02,496
You guys make a lot of money. Why don't you install a smart lock?

590
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,065
Hey.

591
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,575
Gosh. Is this where you keep all of your case files?

592
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:20,476
Why do you ask?

593
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,486
Just because.

594
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,986
They are important only to me. They aren't worth a penny.

595
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,530
Why would you say something like that?

596
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:33,026
I might be a fraud, but I don't steal from people.

597
00:45:33,401 --> 00:45:35,325
Frauds and thieves are the same.

598
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,371
They are totally different.

599
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:39,600
- How are they different? - Look them up online.

600
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,466
Both of you, stop.

601
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:44,905
- You're being childish. - I agree.

602
00:45:46,181 --> 00:45:47,435
That's enough.

603
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,476
Let's have a get-together. We just closed a big case.

604
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,675
- I won't be attending. - No.

605
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:55,815
Let's go.

606
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,726
This is some good food!

607
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,825
I should send a photo to my darling.

608
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:13,935
"Darling"?

609
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,065
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

610
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,035
- What? - "What"?

611
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,616
Everybody, raise your glasses.

612
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,220
Ms. Hong.

613
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,360
This is our first get-together. Please make a toast.

614
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,331
Is she a principal or what?

615
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:38,956
No need to make a big speech in front of three people.

616
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:42,466
When we die, let's hope we don't become unrested spirits.

617
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,726
Cheers.

618
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,946
Ms. Hong. I have a question.

619
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,055
The previous part-time psychic got injured.

620
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,730
Could something bad happen to me...

621
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,926
- even after an exorcism? - Yes.

622
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,855
Really? Are you sure?

623
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,295
Some even die.

624
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,800
Ms. Hong, stop joking.

625
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,270
He'll believe you. You'll scare him away.

626
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,171
Gosh. Why would you lie about that?

627
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:23,936
I don't lie.

628
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,736
This job requires us to handle spirits.

629
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,611
Anyone can get hurt anytime...

630
00:47:29,611 --> 00:47:32,075
because of a variable we didn't see coming.

631
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,545
Anyone?

632
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,585
Does that mean neither the client nor the exorcist is safe?

633
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,365
- I mean... - What's up with so many questions?

634
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,740
I need to know these things. We are partners.

635
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,305
We are not partners. The contract is over.

636
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:03,381
Over?

637
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,621
You wanted to work only until you saved 20,000 dollars.

638
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:06,851
Don't you remember that?

639
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:09,321
Today's dinner was a farewell party, not a welcome party.

640
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,121
What are you doing? Don't be so rash.

641
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,115
We made a good team.

642
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:14,821
Do you want to perform an exorcism,

643
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:16,831
shivering in cold without this special psychic?

644
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:18,459
What are you talking about?

645
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,426
I've been doing fine without you.

646
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,135
What about Chief Heo?

647
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,365
What?

648
00:48:33,181 --> 00:48:34,210
You know what?

649
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,676
He was so happy that he was making money with an honest job.

650
00:48:37,611 --> 00:48:39,220
Do you want him to scam people again?

651
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,345
This is the first job I never had to lie about to my girlfriend.

652
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,986
I'll work really hard, Ms. Hong.

653
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,361
Don't cry.

654
00:48:48,361 --> 00:48:49,690
They sound really desperate.

655
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,686
Let's work with them for just one more month.

656
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,026
Not you too, Ms. Joo.

657
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,026
Ms. Hong, you're not the one who has to hire a new psychic.

658
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:04,035
Hyung Sik's leg fracture will heal in a month.

659
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,276
Let's work with them until then.

660
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:12,550
Just one more month.

661
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,615
- That's perfect. - That's perfect.

662
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:19,486
Let's celebrate our extension and solemnly raise our glasses.

663
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,726
Let's not be unrested spirits after death.

664
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:27,726
- Cheers! - Cheers!

I want to put my house on the market.

668
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:02,550
I'm sorry. We don't handle regular listings.

669
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,385
Someone referred your services to me.

670
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:07,285
I heard that you guys help sell haunted houses.

671
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,825
Please take a seat.

672
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:21,595
Please tell us in detail.

673
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,071
Did someone recently die in your house...

674
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:25,976
or did you kill someone recently?

675
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:28,311
- Pardon? - Given the nature of our job,

676
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,906
we must ask this question.

677
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,375
I'm sure you'll understand.

678
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,276
I see.

679
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,750
From what I know, nothing of the sort happened.

680
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,716
But we keep seeing the spirit.

681
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,931
My wife has been having a hard time, so we want to sell it.

682
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:44,355
Nice.

683
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,931
One day,

684
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:50,496
all the cabinet doors under the sink and drawers were open.

685
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,800
That scared the wits out of me.

686
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,635
This house is new. It's nice.

687
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,710
If you sell the house not long after buying it,

688
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,710
you'll end up paying taxes twice. It'd be a loss.

689
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:01,411
We're in our 60s and this is the first house we bought.

690
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:03,446
It's so upsetting.

691
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,845
Oh, right. Where are my manners? I should serve you some drinks.

692
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,246
- Let's go. - Already?

693
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:13,990
Are you leaving already?

694
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,756
Why don't you have some drinks before you go? Please?

695
00:53:22,631 --> 00:53:23,895
That's so cold.

696
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,835
Your hand is freezing. What's going on?

697
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,236
- Is there an unrested spirit? - Why do you think I held your hand?

698
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,845
Sometimes,

699
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,516
some spirits don't even know they're dead.

700
00:54:14,081 --> 00:54:17,145
Green Villas completed sales of its apartments three months ago.

701
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,020
Before that, it was a mulberry field for a long time.

702
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,061
I saw an advertisement for that place.

703
00:54:23,061 --> 00:54:24,625
Dohak Construction?

704
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,656
Aren't they the ones redeveloping this whole area?

705
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,571
No one around the client has died recently.

706
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:31,970
That's why I looked more into the building.

707
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,341
There were some messy businesses.

708
00:54:33,341 --> 00:54:35,571
I thought our client was the first one to move in,

709
00:54:35,571 --> 00:54:37,540
but some people lived there before he did.

710
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,240
Because the apartment was vacant for so long,

711
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,911
they bought it at 30 percent off from a secondary agency.

712
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:44,651
But Dohak Construction, which was the original owner,

713
00:54:44,651 --> 00:54:49,315
said this was illegal and forcibly evicted the residents.

714
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,516
So if any of the victims died,

715
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:55,555
there's a good chance they became unrested spirits.

716
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:57,591
Logically, if we just look at which of the residents...

717
00:54:57,591 --> 00:54:58,931
received money in their accounts,

718
00:54:58,931 --> 00:55:00,101
can't we figure it out right away?

719
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:02,095
It's not as easy as you think.

720
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,071
Mirae Design says they sent money to Dohak Construction,

721
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:08,470
and Dohak Construction says they never received the money.

722
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:11,206
But President Hwang of Mirae Design disappeared,

723
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,335
and the trial has been suspended.

724
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,010
So President Hwang lied.

725
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,776
What about the victims who have to wait for the trial's verdict?

726
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:20,176
What a scumbag.

727
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,845
What about the list of victims?

728
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:26,216
There are 12 households and 50 individuals.

729
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,285
We'll have to find out if any of them have died.

730
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,426
That will only take a day, right?

731
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,795
- Me? - Why?

732
00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:38,895
Didn't you have the skill to find an all-star couple by their shadows?

733
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,696
Of course. I can do it.

Head to the redevelopment area.

736
00:56:17,871 --> 00:56:19,436
It doesn't matter how I die.

737
00:56:22,611 --> 00:56:25,851
The Chairman is coming today,

738
00:56:25,851 --> 00:56:27,916
so let's try our best!

739
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,246
Yes, boss!

00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,625
Let's get the restaurant first.

743
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,295
All right.

(Changhwa Restaurant)

745
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,535
I'm sorry.

746
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,416
Ji Chul!

747
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:05,250
Who are you?

748
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,256
Who else? It's me.

749
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,960
So you've been hiding in my area all along.

750
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,855
I'm not sure if that's bold or fearless.

751
00:57:16,071 --> 00:57:18,266
Being bold is being fearless.

752
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:21,335
You're right.

753
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:24,805
You're laughing?

754
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:29,845
Why do you keep nitpicking instead of apologizing?

755
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,375
I'm sorry.

756
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,916
What are we sorry for?

757
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:36,851
You should be sorry.

758
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,486
You scammed me so fearlessly.

759
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:40,790
What do you mean, scammed you?

760
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,055
I got rid of that ghost for you. Nice and clean.

761
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,726
That ghost?

762
00:57:46,431 --> 00:57:47,855
You're the ones who made up that ghost.

763
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,926
You should pay people more.

764
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:53,395
The one who played the ghost told me everything.

765
00:57:53,901 --> 00:57:56,141
I told you we shouldn't use a part-timer to play the ghosts.

766
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,911
I really didn't think she was that kind of person.

767
00:57:57,911 --> 00:57:59,141
Yes, sure you didn't.

768
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:01,406
- I knew it as soon as I saw her. - Hey!

769
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:05,305
If you play around in front of me from now on,

770
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,176
I'll kill you.

771
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,145
Okay.

772
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,746
I'll return the 50,000 dollars we got for that job.

773
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:14,686
- What's your account number? - What about interest?

774
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,956
How much is the interest?

775
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,456
Let me see.

776
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:21,260
300,000 dollars. Plus the original amount.

777
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,696
- That's robbery! - Robbery?

778
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,865
Some people never can accept interest terms without a beating.

779
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,770
Hey, help them accept it.

780
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,270
No, no.

Ms. Hong, Ms. Hong!

782
00:58:32,811 --> 00:58:33,906
Get out of the way.

783
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,176
How dare you block my way to eat?

784
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:42,216
Hey.

785
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:44,446
What?

786
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,016
Those two.

787
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:52,226
We still have something left to discuss.

788
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,595
- Ma'am! - Go ahead.

789
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,196
We don't have anything left to talk about. Sir.

790
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,295

It's the chairman.

Attention, greetings.

793
00:59:15,121 --> 00:59:16,815
- Hello, Chairman. - Hello, Chairman.

794
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:18,785
What are you doing here?

795
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,085
You're supposed to be at the realty office.

796
00:59:22,321 --> 00:59:23,486
It's just...

797
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:27,855
She is CEO Hong of Daebak Realty.

798
00:59:42,581 --> 00:59:43,946
Please help me.

You want me to investigate your mother's final client?

803

Are you sure that's him?

804
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,510
How did you do this work for ten years?

805
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,381
If it were me, I'd already have killed a few people.

806
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:55,351
You should finish what you've started.

807
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,651
What's this sudden change in attitude?

808
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:59,621
Are you the same Ms. Hong who told me to do nothing?

809
01:00:59,621 --> 01:01:01,591
I'm just preparing for the unexpected.

810
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,260
I did suffer a bit because of some exorcist frauds lately.

811
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,331
You're not talking about me, are you?

812
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:08,500
Being a psychic is such an extreme job.

813
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,831
More than that, you know we can't get caught by Ms. Hong.

814
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:11,871
I don't want to die either.

- Here it is. - What are you doing here?
