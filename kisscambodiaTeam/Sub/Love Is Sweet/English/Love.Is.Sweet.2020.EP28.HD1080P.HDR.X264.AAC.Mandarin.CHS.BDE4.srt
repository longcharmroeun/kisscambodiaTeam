1
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,550
Episode 28

3
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,550
What’s up?

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,550
Why can’t you say it over the phone?

5
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,960
Du Lei came to see me.

6
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
He came to see you?

7
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,960
Why?

8
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,520
It seems you really don’t know

9
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,390
I’ve been really busy lately.

10
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,240
And I haven’t been in touch

11
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
with Du Lei in a while.

12
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
He came to me to make a deal,

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,720
saying that we should fight against
Yuan Shuai together.

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,680
But I can’t help thinking

15
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,760
there’s something wrong with him.

16
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,720
What can he have problems with?

17
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
He had always regarded Yuan Shuai
as his arch-rival.

18
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,760
In order to win over Yuan Shuai,

19
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,880
whatever he did is normal.

20
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,240
So what were you surprised about?

21
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,480
I was just surprised that

22
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,760
he wanted to work with you.

23
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,240
Who told him about C Group?

24
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,960
I’m to blame.

25
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,000
When I resigned from MH to work in GE,

26
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,160
in order not to make Jiang Yaoming suspicious,

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
I handed the case of Jiangnan Flavor

28
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,160
to Du Lei.

29
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,120
It just didn’t occur to me that

30
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,440
he always thought I was taking advantage of him,

31
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,920
so I had to tell him something.

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,680
But don’t worry.

33
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,120
I didn’t say a word I shouldn’t have.

34
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,000
That’s good.

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,920
Linda, you have to understand that

36
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,880
Jiang Yaoming’s death

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
is not like anything else.

38
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,840
It will be hard for both of us

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,760
if you don’t take a firm stand.

40
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,680
What are you doing?

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,600
Pills, pills!

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,000
Pills!

43
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,680
Pills, pills!

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
Call an ambulance.

45
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,720
And

46
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,160
if you don’t keep an eye on your brother,

47
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,920
I’ll keep an eye on him.

48
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,080
He is so clever.

49
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,630
I don’t trust him.

50
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,840
Have some tea.

51
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,000
Answer the phone!

52
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Du Lei,

53
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
what the hell do you want?

54
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,840
Why did you betray my parents?

55
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,920
Why are you so serious?

56
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,920
Isn’t that to make your play

57
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,240
look more real?

58
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
What happened?

59
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,840
Jiang Jun was locked in the elevator.

60
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,680
Luckily I got there in time,

61
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,360
and she didn’t have any serious problems.

62
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,640
Who did it?

63
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
I checked the monitor.

64
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
It was an analyst in MH.

65
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,640
But I saw no reason

66
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
or need for her

67
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,440
to do such a thing to Jiang Jun.

68
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,360
It was Lin Taimo.

69
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,360
He may have thought that

70
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
the reason Jiang Jun tried to join MH

71
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
is to investigate her father’s case,

72
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,080
so he tried to kill her.

73
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,480
In that case,

74
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,760
Mr. Jiang’s death must not have been
an accident.

75
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,640
What’s on your mind?

76
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
I’ve been investigating Lin Taimo for years.

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,960
But this guy is so cunning.

78
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,200
I can hardly find anything negative about him.

79
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,760
I wanted to get hard evidence

80
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,160
and then reveal all the evidence of his guilt.

81
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,240
But I am afraid that he will do harm
to Jiang Jun again,

82
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,640
so I have to make war on him at once.

83
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,640
Lin Taimo is a man with many enemies,

84
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,440
so he must have his own men

85
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,360
in MH and CSRC.

86
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,320
If you want to expose him

87
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,880
on the basis of the information you have,

88
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,560
you may be turned back

89
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,520
before it reaches the chairman’s desk.

90
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,440
Of course I know.

91
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,760
That’s why I haven’t done anything.

92
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,120
But

93
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
it’s not so easy to

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,360
get hard evidence.

95
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,560
He trusts Linda so much.

96
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,200
Can we start with her?

97
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,880
I have fallen out with her,

98
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,600
so she won’t help me for the time being.

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
How about this?

100
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,840
We’ve been fighting for years in this circle,

101
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,320
and everyone knows it.

102
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,360
Why don’t I surrender to Lin Taimo?

103
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,480
The enemy of your enemy can be your friend.

104
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,960
Who says I can’t be friends with Lin Taimo?

105
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,560
You?

106
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,160
You think too little of Lin Taimo.

107
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
What will make him believe you?

108
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,680
So at this point,

109
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,340
we need someone unexpected

110
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,620
to cooperate.

111
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,770
Dr. Zhu of Chenxin Technology?

112
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,190
Isn’t he a client of Yuan Shuai’s?

113
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:51,910
How do you know

114
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,980
they traded power and money with each other?

115
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,070
I fought Yuan Shuai for three years.

116
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,760
Arguably, no one in the investment banking world

117
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,480
knows him better than I do,

118
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,680
except himself.

119
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,120
As for Dr. Zhu,

120
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,720
as long as we can give him

121
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,240
what Yuan Shuai can’t,

122
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,160
he will certainly be of use to us.

123
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:14,880
Are you sure?

124
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,170
Of course.

125
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Let him in.

126
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
Now that you’ve arrived,

127
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,000
I’m sure you know

128
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,280
why Du Lei asked you to come.

129
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
Yes.

130
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,040
To destroy Yuan Shuai.

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,240
You keep saying you want to destroy Yuan Shuai.

132
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,080
But where is the evidence?

133
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,560
I have the evidence.

134
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
I once borrowed some money from him.

135
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,760
That was a large amount of money.

136
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,400
I paid the money back this time
through a private account.

137
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,800
There is no documentary evidence
for this transaction.

138
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,760
That’s interesting.

139
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,800
Lin Taimo

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,280
may not have trusted me completely,

141
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,280
so he asked me to join MH.

142
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,800
I guess he’s trying to keep an eye on me.

143
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
Secretary Bai was watching my flight.

144
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,320
But in order to avoid unnecessary mistakes,

145
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,840
we should start our plan as soon as possible.

146
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,040
Here’s the information you asked for.

147
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Jia Yuanji,

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
the only son of GE’s Chairman.

149
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,040
He had been studying abroad before

150
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,880
He had been studying abroad before
<i>Personal Profile of Jia Yuanji</i>

151
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,880
and recently returned home.
<i>Personal Profile of Jia Yuanji</i>

152
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,800
<i>Personal Profile of Jia Yuanji</i>

153
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,880
He likes listening to music.\<i>Personal Profile of Jia Yuanji</i>

154
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,520
I’m told that he’s been singing
in the Bar Street lately.

155
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,720
And with his personality,

156
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,440
he’s not particularly easy to get along with.

157
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,880
There’s no one in the world

158
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,240
I can’t deal with yet.

159
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,920
Yuan Shuai,

160
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,840
I may never get used to

161
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,560
your inexplicable confidence.

162
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,520
But I’ll warn you about one thing.

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,280
In this period of time,

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
Jiang Jun should not be allowed to

165
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,000
fall into the slightest bit of danger.

166
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,240
Also,

167
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
don’t do anything inappropriate to her.

168
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,800
Otherwise,

169
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
I will not leave you alone.

170
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,880
Don’t worry.

171
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,880
I am

172
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,600
not a man to take advantage of others.

173
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,240
Besides, about Jiang Jun,

174
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
I still have confidence.

175
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,920
But

176
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,320
she’s already suspicious of me

177
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,120
because she doesn’t believe you’re corrupt.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
So, Zhu Youyi…

179
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
It seems that our little sheep
has become smarter.

180
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

181
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,120
What’s the matter, Yuan Shuai?

182
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,760
Just say it this time.

183
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,440
This time, it’s easier.

184
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,640
You only have to deal with one person.

185
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,320
She should be coming to you soon.

186
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,400
Rest assured.

187
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,760
My acting skills have become better and better

188
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,480
since last time.

189
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
I don’t even have to try.

190
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,480
You don’t have to act this time.

191
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,680
There is only one thing you need to do.

192
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
That is, you know nothing.

193
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,240
All right, all right.

194
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,360
I’m not gonna say anything.

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,560
Hope Zhu Youyi

196
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,720
can withstand the pressure of Jiang Jun.

197
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,880
<i>Chenxin Technology Co., LTD.</i>

198
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,640
Dr. Zhu,

199
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,680
someone from MH has come

200
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,240
to show you the follow-up information
on the financing plan.

201
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
Just say I’m not here

202
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,400
and give it to the finance office.

203
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,240
Dr. Zhu, are you going to appear from nowhere,

204
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,680
or just disappear from here?

205
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,280
Ms. Jiang,

206
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,320
what are you doing here?

207
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,280
You’re in a good mood.

208
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,360
Playing games?

209
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
I know why you’re here,

210
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,360
but I’m afraid I can’t answer

211
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,360
any of your questions.

212
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,400
You misunderstood.

213
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,440
I’m here to present you the newly proposed

214
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,680
supervision plan of Chenxin after financing.

215
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,520
I see.

216
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,720
Thank you very much.

217
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,440
What kind of game are you playing?

218
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,280
I’ve just developed an motion sensing game

219
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,320
for the next step of the Internet of Things.

220
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,570
I’m trying out its sensitivity.

221
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,640
It looks interesting.

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
May I have the honor to experience it?

223
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,440
Really?

224
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,600
You want to play?

225
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,640
Ok, ok.

226
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,040
Just so you can help me with the test.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,320
It’s good, Dr. Zhu.

228
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,800
You’re good at the game.

229
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,960
Just so so.

230
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,080
Chenxin has also been on the rise recently.

231
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,680
I heard you won a prize a few days ago.

232
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,880
Congratulations!

233
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,240
Thank you very much!

234
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,440
But I really didn’t expect

235
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,760
Yuan Shuai to be

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,240
so cynical and mercenary.

237
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,000
No. It’s not like that.

238
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,480
Obviously, he sees that your company
is developing well

239
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,200
and wants to get a piece of the pie.

240
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,720
He’s the scum of the investment banking world.

241
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,520
He isn’t. Don’t say that.

242
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,880
Really?

243
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,160
Could it be

244
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,000
you two acting together
for someone else to watch?

245
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,600
No. It’s not like that, either.

246
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,120
Well… I…

247
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,200
I know nothing.

248
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,200
Ms. Jiang, don’t ask anymore.

249
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,040
They won’t let me say anything.

250
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,040
They?

251
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,120
Who are they?

252
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,720
I’m busy.

253
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,320
See yourself out.

254
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,080
Well… Anyone

255
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,000
can hand me the information?

256
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,120
And my design… is…

257
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,160
Since Dr. Zhu won’t say anything,

258
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,120
I won’t ask.

259
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,240
I’m leaving.

260
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,040
But,

261
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
thank you all the same.

262
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,160
What did I just say?

263
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,760
I didn’t say anything.

264
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,120
She asked two questions.

265
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,840
But I didn’t answer either of them.

266
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,840
Li,

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,680
are you at the West World? I’ll see you there.

268
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,800
No, I’m not. Why?

269
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,280
I have an emergency.
I need to speak to Xiaochuan.

270
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:32,920
That’s ok.

271
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,800
I’ll find him myself without you.

272
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,200
No, don’t!

273
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
Li Xiaochuan

274
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,240
is a little difficult for ordinary people
to communicate with.

275
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,400
It’s not like you don’t know.

276
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,900
Well, I’ll go there with you.

277
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,730
Ok.

278
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,560
Jun has an important business,

279
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,440
so of course I will go with her.

280
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,800
But I don’t want to see that man.

281
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
Not at all!

282
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
That’s it.

283
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Xu Li,

284
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,520
why are you here?

285
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,280
It’s okay. You don’t have to panic.

286
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,240
I’m not looking for you.

287
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,080
Jun wants to see you.

288
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,600
Xiaochuan,

289
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,070
can you check for me

290
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,480
where Yuan Shuai is now?

291
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,680
Ok.

292
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,880
Xiaochuan,

293
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,600
tomorrow afternoon at 14:00 Beijing time,

294
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
help me

295
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,680
make the Internet Protocol addresses

296
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,800
of both my mobile phone and computer

297
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,680
in Tanzania.

298
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,080
Ok.

299
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,240
If Jiang Jun comes to you,

300
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,880
just say you don’t know where I am.

301
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,680
If you have

302
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,800
your virtual Internet Protocol addresses ready,

303
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,720
show them to her.

304
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,840
But why?

305
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,560
Aren’t you lying to her?

306
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,000
I can’t tell you yet.

307
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,960
I’ll explain to you when the time is right.

308
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,360
<i>Yuan Shuai, Dodoma of Africa</i>

309
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,190
Here.

310
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,280
It turns out he went to Africa.

311
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,400
It’s a long distance.

312
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,430
It turns out?

313
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
You knew he would go abroad?

314
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,200
He said he was going abroad,

315
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,320
but he didn’t tell me where.

316
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,040
That’s why

317
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,080
I said that.

318
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,960
But when I asked you this morning,

319
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,640
you clearly said he had not contacted you.

320
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,080
Yes.

321
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,680
You…

322
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,840
He didn’t contact me when you asked,

323
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,320
but he did after you asked.

324
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,760
So…

325
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,200
Your statements are inconsistent.

326
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,840
There must be something wrong.

327
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,520
Are you going to tell me or not?

328
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,800
Africa.

329
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,040
So you are not going to tell me?

330
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,080
Li, let’s go!

331
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,600
Wait!

332
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Xu Li,

333
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,920
I want to talk to you.

334
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,600
But I have nothing to say to you.

335
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,840
-Xu Li...
-Well…

336
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Well…

337
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,680
Before…

338
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,320
Before you ask me,

339
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,200
let me ask you a question.

340
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,320
Where is Yuan Shuai now?

341
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,360
If you don’t tell me, I’ll go.

342
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,600
Shanghai!

343
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,480
But…

344
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,000
Yuan Shuai is in Shanghai now!

345
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
You just betrayed your brother like that?

346
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
He just asked me not to tell you or anyone else.

347
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,920
Xu Li is no one else.

348
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,640
Where is Yuan Shuai now?

349
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,640
Li,

350
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,920
if he doesn’t want to tell me,
there must be a reason.

351
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,000
I’m leaving.

352
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I think Xiaochuan has something to say
to you in private.

353
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,560
What are you trying to say? Say it.

354
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,680
I’d like to apologize

355
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,440
for what you said last time.

356
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,160
Well, don’t apologize.

357
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
It’s not your problem that you don’t like me.

358
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,560
It’s not your fault.

359
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,080
No.

360
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,440
Then do you like me?

361
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
I thought about it for a long time.

362
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,560
You

363
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,400
have low IQ

364
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,640
and average education.

365
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,800
We grew up in a different environment.

366
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,000
Our background, personality,
and hobbies are also different.

367
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
Honestly,

368
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,440
sometimes I really don’t understand
what you’re thinking.

369
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,240
And that’s probably why

370
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,840
we’re only a one-percent match.

371
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
But, I…

372
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,400
Is that what you’re trying to say?

373
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,600
One percent.

374
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,920
One percent.

375
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,640
I know.

376
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,200
I

377
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,880
may not be

378
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,600
perfect enough

379
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,280
for you.

380
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,920
But,

381
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,560
would you mind

382
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,120
not stressing it over and over again?

383
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,440
I…

384
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,960
But…

385
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,680
Stop talking.

386
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,080
Mr. Li, I’m sorry to have bothered you.

387
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,720
I’ll never come and see you again.

388
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I…

389
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,240
But

390
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,280
I can’t seem to stop myself

391
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
to like you.

392
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,720
Can you wait for me?

393
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,560
I want us to be

394
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,480
a one hundred percent match.

395
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,560
<i>Zhendan</i>

396
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,920
Hello, everyone.

397
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,000
I’m the lead singer and lead guitarist,
Jia Yuanji.

398
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,560
We are

399
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,280
the Jixiangruyi Band.

400
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,960
Today we are going to present to you

401
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,920
a new song of ours,

402
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,840
Smash the Blue BMW.

403
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,640
♫ Want to act impulsively ♫

404
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,120
♫ And smash the blue BMW ♫

405
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,520
♫ Don’t blame me for being pompous ♫

406
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,640
♫ Smash the blue BMW ♫

407
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,240
What?

408
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,880
Mr. Jia,

409
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,240
I am begging you.

410
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,920
Please stop.

411
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,920
You see, I haven’t got any guests here.

412
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,640
I won’t allow it.

413
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,160
This is our band’s tour.

414
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,160
Yes.

415
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,120
You…

416
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Isn’t there someone?

417
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,040
It’s not that.

418
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,360
How can I do business with only one customer?

419
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,560
I think his music sounds good.

420
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,240
You… You like it?

421
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,760
Yes.

422
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,720
Jixiangruyi Band, right?

423
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,000
I think your music is

424
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,040
very expressive.

425
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,680
It is full of cries of injustice to the world,

426
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,200
especially the condemnation and indictment

427
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,560
of the owner of the blue BMW.

428
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,040
It’s very pretentious, naked,

429
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,160
and very real.

430
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,360
You get me, Sir!

431
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,640
Wait!

432
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,000
Do you know anything about music?

433
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,720
I’ve been running bars for so many years.

434
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,240
I’ve never heard such bad music.

435
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,240
How come it is expressive?

436
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,520
You’re terrific!

437
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Sir.

438
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,960
Although I don’t know much about music,

439
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,280
I think music is

440
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,880
an artistic tool to express one’s inner feelings

441
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,400
and his view of the world.

442
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,520
Jixiangruyi Band

443
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,360
is young, vigorous

444
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,160
and full of vitality.

445
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,720
We should encourage such bands.

446
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,520
Am I right?

447
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,040
Well said!

448
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
You really are my soul mate.

449
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,880
I finally found you.

450
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,640
Sir.

451
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,040
If anything happens to you in the future,

452
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,400
just let me know.

453
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,880
I’ll protect you.

454
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,000
You protect me?

455
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,720
Yes. I really like you.

456
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,440
Ok, then.

457
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,240
How about this?

458
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
You come home with me tonight,

459
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,120
and we can have a good discussion.

460
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,280
Ok.

461
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,680
Ms. Wang,

462
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,480
anything to eat? I’m starving.

463
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,360
The Chairman is on a video conference.

464
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,920
Sir,

465
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
if there’s anything you want to eat,
just tell Ms. Wang.

466
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
She is a good cook.

467
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,040
Anything will do. Thanks, Ms. Wang.

468
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,760
Ok.

469
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,440
Let’s go.

470
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,280
Are we going in now?

471
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,160
Go to my room and listen to my songs.

472
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,840
Ms. Wang.

473
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,040
Well,

474
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,560
no pepper for my midnight snack,

475
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,680
and no…

476
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,080
Keep your voice down.

477
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,720
-If my father hears us, we’re done.
-I enjoy…

478
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,240
I enjoy a light meal.

479
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,160
You know you should get your ass back?

480
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,240
Dad.

481
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,920
You are so perceptive.

482
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,120
You heard me.

483
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,680
By the way, this is my friend.

484
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,600
His name is…

485
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,440
Yuan Shuai.

486
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,520
The executive director in the investment banking department
of the rival firm.

487
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,720
What are you doing at my house at this hour?

488
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,920
Mr. Jia,

489
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,280
I want to tell you something

490
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,560
about the future

491
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,880
and reputation of GE.

492
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,920
I’m sorry to have bothered you.

493
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,120
Go back to sleep.

494
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
Dad, this is…

495
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,520
How can you…

496
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,400
I’ll stop your credit cards
if you don’t go to bed now.

497
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,880
Meet me in my room later.

498
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,960
Please have a seat.

499
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,680
I’ve got everything you said.

500
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,600
If Linda is really involved in the insider trading

501
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,640
and investment corruption,

502
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,560
cleaning house

503
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,480
and maintaining GE’s brand

504
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,640
are the right thing to do.

505
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,680
But you asked me to investigate Lin Taimo.

506
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,760
What good would it do to GE?

507
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,480
I know what you mean, Mr. Jia.

508
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,080
But now two senior executives of MH and GE

509
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,960
are committing crimes
and making huge profits together.

510
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,360
Once they are caught,

511
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
it will be a matter of honor

512
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,840
or disgrace for all of us.

513
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
Now it is already difficult

514
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,960
for the industry to regulate corruption

515
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
in the private equity investments.

516
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,560
So, it can only rely on the moral consciousness

517
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,600
and strict self-examination
of our securities practitioners.

518
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,520
So, Mr. Jia,

519
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,120
please…

520
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,720
Don’t worry, young man.

521
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,000
I agree with everything you said.

522
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,160
That’s why I admire you

523
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,960
and am willing to sit down and listen to you.

524
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,280
But I’m a businessman.

525
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,240
I can do good and uphold justice,

526
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,040
but I have to make an equivalent trade-off.

527
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
I understand that.

528
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Mr. Jia,

529
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,280
what can I do for you?

530
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,240
You have discharged yourself from MH.

531
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,720
So how about coming to GE

532
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,070
after this non-competition period?

533
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,880
Jiang Jun, your express.

534
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,880
I got it for you.

535
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,440
Thank you very much.

536
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,280
You’re welcome.

537
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,320
What did you buy?

538
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,720
Voice recorder? What do you need it for?

539
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,640
I’m afraid there will be times

540
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,800
when I can’t remember
what was said at the meeting.

541
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,080
It’ll be easier for me if I record it.

542
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,160
How considerate.

543
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,320
Come in.

544
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,640
Mr. Du, there is a document
that needs your signature.

545
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,000
Ok, let me have a look.

546
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,880
I’m sorry.

547
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,200
Done.

548
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,040
Mr… Mr. Lin.

549
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,320
Are you reporting for work?

550
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,800
I’m leaving.

551
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:23,320
<i>Du Lei</i>

552
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,640
<i>West World</i>

553
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,400
Hello.

554
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,680
I like you.

555
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,840
I really like you.

556
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,840
I really like you.

557
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,600
Who’s that?

558
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,680
How can I hear someone saying he likes me?

559
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,080
I’m hearing voices?

560
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,200
Or is he still haunting me?

561
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,560
Li, I’m here. You can go.

562
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,640
You are here.

563
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,120
Thank you.

564
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,520
I am just going to check on my niece.

565
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,760
His father disappeared.

566
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,800
His mother is exhausted because of this.

567
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,160
She’s probably still working overtime
at this hour.

568
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,520
Poor child.

569
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,600
Yes.

570
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,320
The child has a good appetite.

571
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,320
She’s probably still at home

572
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,240
with an empty stomach at the moment.

573
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,560
She is so pathetic.

574
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
How can there be

575
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,000
such a poor child now?

576
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,000
You’d better go.

577
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,360
Don’t let the child suffer any more.

578
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,480
Okay, I’m going.

579
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,720
Thank you.

580
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,400
You are a left-behind child now.

581
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,880
Do you know? Behave yourself.

582
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,080
Your parents are breaking up.

583
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
I don’t know where they are now.

584
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,200
It’s lucky for you

585
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,120
to have a kind aunt like me.

586
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,680
You should cherish me, you know?

587
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,680
Come and rest for a while.

588
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,920
Wealth.

589
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,880
Wealth,

590
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,440
do you think men are all changeable?

591
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Or is it that Jun and I
happen to have met the bad men?

592
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,920
Keep your eyes open for boyfriends
in the future.

593
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,160
You know that?

594
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,160
I’m such a good girl.

595
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,040
But he doesn’t cherish me.

596
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,280
He’s bound to regret it!

597
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,800
Wealth,

598
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,880
let’s go home for dinner.

599
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,800
There’s nothing

600
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,680
that can’t be solved with one meal, right?

601
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,280
Let’s go.

602
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,200
You are still here, Jiang Jun?

603
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,600
So are you.

604
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,440
I had to work late,

605
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,680
so I went down to buy coffee.

606
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,360
I’m going. Go back to your work.

607
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,880
Wait, Jiang Jun.

608
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,280
I’d like to have a word with you.

609
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,320
Go ahead.

610
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,760
Mr. Du replaced Mr. Yuan.

611
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,720
I know you might think there’s something wrong
with that.

612
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,440
But I think it is quite necessary for me

613
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,600
to remind you of something.

614
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,200
After all, Mr. Du is on Mr. Lin’s side.

615
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,800
If you do anything to him now,

616
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,800
it will be to your disadvantage.

617
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Mr. Lin seems

618
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,560
kind at usual.

619
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,400
In fact, it was he

620
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,160
who instigated me to trap you
in the elevator last time.

621
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,930
You mean Lin Taimo?

622
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,150
I always thought it was weird.

623
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,790
He’s the one who hired you.

624
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,150
But why would he treat you like that?

625
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,120
I think you should think about it yourself

626
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,000
and see if you’ve offended him

627
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,480
recently.

628
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,480
Okay, I get it.

629
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,440
Thank you.

630
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,640
Bye.

631
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,750
Ok.

632
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,890
Jun,

633
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,430
I know you’ve been working overtime lately,

634
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,830
so I helped you clean your room

635
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,750
and walked Wealth.

636
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,030
Take good care of yourself.

637
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,070
Eat regularly.

638
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,270
P.S.

639
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,350
Most importantly,

640
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,110
take care of yourself no matter
how busy you are.

641
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,880
You like MIHOO masks.

642
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,870
I have prepared them for you.

643
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,760
Remember to use them.

644
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,550
Always be the best of yourself.

645
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,800
Sincerely, Li.

646
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,270
Hello, Jun.

647
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,150
Hello, Li.

648
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,720
I saw the note you wrote to me.

649
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,320
You even got me face masks.

650
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,320
That’s so sweet.

651
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,200
Sure enough, you love me the most.

652
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,920
But how do you know

653
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,040
I like yogurt of this brand these days?

654
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,400
I know you’re busy these days.

655
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,280
Take care of yourself.

656
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,880
Wait.

657
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,000
What yogurt were you talking about?

658
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,710
The yogurt in the fridge.

659
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,630
Fridge?

660
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,350
I didn’t tidy your fridge.

661
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,080
Didn’t you buy me all this fruit and bread

662
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,320
and ice cream in my fridge?

663
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,560
No.

664
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Jun, I have to go.

665
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,400
I’m going to the supermarket.

666
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,080
I’ll talk to you some other time.

667
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,680
There’s something I want to tell you.

668
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,200
Ok.

669
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,680
Bye.

670
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,160
Didn’t you disappear?

671
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,560
Trying to fool me.

672
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,080
<i>MIHOO</i>

673
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,200
It seems that you do have a conscience.

674
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,960
Mr. Du, how is everything going?

675
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,680
Are you used to working in MH?

676
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,960
This is the work assigned by Mr. Lin.

677
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,160
Naturally, I will be taken care of
in all aspects.

678
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,400
How do you like the room

679
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
I’ve arranged for you?

680
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,680
You decorated it yourself. Of course I like it.

681
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,200
I’m flattered.

682
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,520
I’m glad to do this for you.

683
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,560
It satisfies both sides. Of course I’m glad.

684
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,240
It’s considerate of you.

685
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,080
However,

686
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,320
it seems that you are not

687
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,560
getting along well with her.

688
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,020
Some things can’t be hurried.
We need to take it slow.

689
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,520
Is there any news about Yuan Shuai?

690
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,640
He hasn’t taken action lately.

691
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,800
He is behaving himself.

692
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,200
You know,

693
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,360
I’ve let the whole industry

694
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,720
know about him.

695
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,760
It’s too hard for him

696
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,040
to build a new image.

697
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,800
If he did not have to get involved

698
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,880
in the case of Jiangnan Flavor,

699
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,840
I would not have embarrassed him.

700
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,480
Jiangnan Flavor?

701
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,520
Is there any news about Yuan Shuai?

702
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,120
He hasn’t taken action lately.

703
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,520
He is behaving himself.

704
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,680
You know,

705
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,920
I’ve let the whole industry

706
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,200
know about him.

707
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,200
It’s too hard for him

708
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,560
to build a new image.

709
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,960
If he did not have to get involved

710
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,680
in the case of Jiangnan Flavor,

711
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,200
I would not have embarrassed him.

712
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,670
So, you are saying that

713
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,990
Lin Taimo didn’t come back

714
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,120
for the gang rivalry,

715
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,080
but for the case of Jiangnan Flavor.

716
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Yes, that was my father’s company.

717
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,760
I’m sorry.

718
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,800
I didn’t know much about you.

719
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,200
So they were trying to get at you.

720
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,760
The reason they’re targeting Yuan Shuai

721
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,200
is that Yuan Shuai is helping you

722
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,560
with your father’s case.

723
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,520
I had always thought

724
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,800
there was something wrong with this case,

725
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,760
but I didn’t expect that
it would turn out this way.

726
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,800
But I think,

727
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,680
since Yuan Shuai doesn’t want you to know,

728
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,320
that means he knows it’s dangerous

729
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,320
to pursue this case.

730
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
He is worried about you.

731
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,840
He does everything for reasons.

732
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,400
He has set the stage.

733
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,040
I suggest we wait and see what happens.

734
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,390
But I learned from Zhu Youyi that

735
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,880
Yuan Shuai was trying to retreat
in order to advance.

736
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,400
And it looks like someone else

737
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,800
is helping him.

738
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,160
Could it be Su Chang?

739
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,760
I don’t think it’s Su Chang.

740
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
Su Chang followed him and left, too.

741
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
This person should be someone

742
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,920
who can work with him in MH.

743
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,920
Then it must be Mr. Fan, Fan Qichang.

744
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,920
Yuan Shuai was Mr. Fan’s favorite disciple.

745
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,520
Although he was suppressed by Mr. Lin,

746
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,960
he still has some influence in MH.

747
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,560
It’s not Mr. Fan.

748
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,200
If Mr. Fan takes any action,

749
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,360
the cunning Lin Taimo

750
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,600
must be aware of that.

751
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,120
It’s less likely to be Secretary Bai.

752
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,160
Secretary Bai was carefully cultivated
by Lin Taimo.

753
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,720
It is impossible for him to defect.

754
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,760
It would be too dangerous

755
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,720
for Yuan Shuai to play tricks on him.

756
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,680
Could it be…?

757
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,960
Yes.

758
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,400
I think it’s him.

759
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,680
From the beginning of the tip-off,
they are setting the stage.

760
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,440
He pretends to surrender and
then secretly works with Yuan Shuai.

761
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,720
They should be still looking for

762
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,440
the most crucial evidence against Lin Taimo.

763
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,800
Come in.

764
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,480
Mr. Lin, here’s a document.

765
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,400
I’ll have to ask you to stamp it yourself.

766
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,280
Ok. Wait.

767
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,240
Done.

768
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,200
Ok.

769
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,440
Thanks. I’ll leave you alone.

770
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,400
Ok.

771
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,320
Yuan Shuai.

772
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,200
According to the clues you provided,

773
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,800
I have investigated the information
of all the shareholders of C Group,

774
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,960
among which, Huixing Industrial

775
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,400
which accounts for 5.36 percent of the shares,
is very suspicious.

776
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,150
Five years ago,

777
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,960
it was a subsidiary of the Du Group.

778
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,800
But it was the small company that cashed

779
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,320
1.02 percent of C Group’s shares,

780
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,600
about 320 million yuan,

781
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,960
at the top of its listing price.

782
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,400
The company later went its own way,

783
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,120
but it still held shares of C Group.

784
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,160
Who is their legal representative?

785
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,960
This is the most suspicious part.

786
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,920
Its legal representative

787
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,160
is an ordinary former secretary

788
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,200
of the Du Group.

789
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,800
And it has nothing to do with Lin Taimo?

790
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,200
Temporarily no.

791
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,120
Are you sure the person behind Linda

792
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,480
is Lin Taimo?

793
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,680
I’m sure.

794
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,840
If the 5.36 percent of the shares
was all cashed,

795
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,000
the amount would exceed 1 billion.

796
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,840
Lin Taimo will not give it up.

797
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,000
Clever as he is,

798
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,560
he must have found someone
to hold the stock for him.

799
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,160
Linda is not related to him,

800
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,720
so he won’t trust her so much.

801
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,440
They must have an agreement.

802
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,400
Mr. Jia, please help me
make an appointment with Linda

803
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,600
in your name tomorrow.

804
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,400
Ok.

805
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,990
Linda,

806
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,880
you are here.

807
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,920
Mr. Jia, why are you in such a good mood today,

808
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,480
inviting me to your home?

809
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,880
I asked you out today

810
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,510
because I have a friend who wants to meet you.

811
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,600
Yuan.

812
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,950
Yuan Shuai.
