1
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,980
Love Is Sweet

2
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,200
Episode 19

3
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,860
Dear West World users,

4
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,420
good evening!

5
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,300
Thank you for your support for our beta test.

6
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,900
We’ll hold our first offline dating activity

7
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,140
at the aquarium

8
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,660
this Sunday afternoon at two o’clock

9
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,940
Hope to see you then!

10
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,660
Dating?

11
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,860
I’m not going!

12
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,820
Jun.

13
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,620
The time and the place of our offline activity

14
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,260
have been settled.

15
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,660
The app should have sent you a notice.

16
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,420
Xiaochuan, Mr. Du and I will all be there.

17
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,020
As a member of West World,

18
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,980
you’ve got to be there, too!

19
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,140
You’re fed up with your job at MH, right?

20
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,340
You want to change your job so eagerly, right?

21
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,860
It’s just a weekend activity.

22
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,380
Why don’t you go as well?

23
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,980
You can see what Xiaochuan has achieved.

24
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,660
Then maybe your opinions

25
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,380
about West World will change.

26
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,980
There’s no way I’ll go.

27
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,100
Going to an aquarium?

28
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,460
To see the fish?

29
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,700
I’m not going!

30
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,700
I’m going to sleep.

31
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,540
Your phone.

32
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,780
Have fun with it!

33
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,100
Your saliva!

34
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,140
Such a wet blanket!

35
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,340
Thank you, Mr. Du.

36
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,180
Don’t mention it.

37
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,060
Jun, here.

38
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,340
Mr. Du, Jun’s here.

39
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,420
You’re so early, Mr. Du.

40
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,860
Today’s West World’s first activity.

41
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,860
I had to come early.

42
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,660
Jun,

43
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,140
your task today

44
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,580
is to keep Mr. Du company.

45
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,780
Xiaochuan and I will go and do something else.

46
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,460
Don’t you need my help?

47
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,620
That’s ok.

48
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,620
Let’s take a look over there.

49
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,420
So beautiful!

50
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,100
These are Moon Jellyfish.

51
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,180
Their bodies are transparent.

52
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,940
But when the light reflects against them,

53
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,420
they’ll become very colorful.

54
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,260
I heard a story

55
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,340
about Moon Jellyfish long ago.

56
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,540
A long time ago,

57
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,900
the Earth had two satellites.

58
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,140
One is called Moon, and the other is called Zhou Star.

59
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,610
These two satellites loved each other.

60
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,380
One day, a meteorite was going to hit the Earth

61
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,860
and then the Moon would go out of orbit.

62
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,220
To protect the Moon, the Zhou Star

63
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,180
dashed towards the meteorite without hesitation.

64
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,940
After the Zhou Star vanished,

65
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,860
the Moon shed tears.

66
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,620
The tears fell into the sea,

67
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,340
and became Moon Jellyfish over time.

68
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,220
Sometimes, humans will do the same.

69
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,180
When you fall in love with someone,

70
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,660
you’ll protect that person at any cost,

71
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,540
just like the Zhou Star.

72
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,620
That’s right.

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
So beautiful!

74
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,660
Have you heard about Stygiomedusa gigantea?

75
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,780
Stygiomedusa gigantea?

76
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,860
What a weird name!

77
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,620
They’re called ghosts in the ocean.

78
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,580
They live deep in the sea.

79
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,620
But that dark place with high pressure

80
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,660
is like a paradise

81
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,980
for them.

82
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,940
They like to live in darkness?

83
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,500
Maybe.

84
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,980
They’ve been evolving

85
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,900
over the long course of time.

86
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,100
Maybe they got used to it long ago.

87
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,500
But I think,

88
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,020
if they ever had a chance to see the sunlight,

89
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,580
they’d no longer want to

90
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,940
live in the dark deep sea,

91
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,140
and would strive to head toward the sunlight.

92
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,860
If I were them,

93
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,300
I’d do the same.

94
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,500
Uncle,

95
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,820
what are you looking at?

96
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,700
So beautiful!

97
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,540
Like some parachutes.

98
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,740
You’ve been staring at that uncle and that aunt

99
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,140
for quite a while.

100
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,260
Go away!

101
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,140
What on earth are you doing here?

102
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,100
Wait!

103
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,140
Come back, Fatty.

104
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,980
Do me a favor

105
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,140
and I’ll buy you a lollipop.

106
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,780
How is it?

107
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,940
Ok!

108
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,420
But what favor?

109
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:43,900
Uncle!

110
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,060
Uncle!

111
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,060
Uncle!

112
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,500
Uncle!

113
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,460
-Uncle!
-Uncle!

114
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,980
Uncle!

115
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,500
Stop calling me!

116
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,340
Did I hit the right person?

117
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,260
Where’s my lollipop?

118
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,740
Lollipop? Go away!

119
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,140
Didn’t you say you weren’t coming?

120
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,540
I came to buy fish.

121
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,380
Buy fish from an aquarium?

122
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,220
You have a problem with it?

123
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,420
No.

124
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,900
There’s something I want to correct.

125
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,700
Stygiomedusa gigantea is different from others.

126
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,260
There is a speculation that

127
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,580
they already lost their light sensors

128
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,820
in the process of evolution.

129
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,580
That means,

130
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,500
the dark deep sea

131
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,460
is the only place they can live in.

132
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,340
Just like certain people,

133
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,780
living in darkness suits them very well.

134
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,900
If Stygiomedusa gigantea seeks sunlight,

135
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,300
maybe they’ll develop new life mechanisms

136
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,460
to adapt to the environment.

137
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,780
Living in darkness

138
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,340
doesn’t mean they can’t strive to
head toward the sunlight, right?

139
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,540
Seems Mr. Du knows a lot about

140
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,580
this venomous creature.

141
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
I know a little.

142
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,100
Then do you know what jellyfish

143
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,620
are the most venomous?

144
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,130
Chironex fleckeri.

145
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,420
They live in the northern coastal waters

146
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,890
of Australia and New Guinea.

147
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,340
People who touch their tentacles

148
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,300
will die immediately.

149
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,010
They’re known as the most lethal

150
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,660
jellyfish in the world.

151
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,820
Am I right, Mr. Yuan?

152
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,700
Oh, right.

153
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,420
I also want to ask you.

154
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,100
What are the world’s smallest jellyfish?

155
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,540
Irukandji jellyfish.

156
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,780
Their umbrellas are only 1.5 cm in diameter,

157
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,020
and resemble the shape of a cube.

158
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
They are mainly found at Great Barrier Reef,

159
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,180
and a hundred times more poisonous than cobras.

160
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,820
One is enough to kill a person.

161
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,700
It’s true that men with high IQ will also

162
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,900
become stupid when they become competitive.

163
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,660
Guys, are you thirsty now?

164
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,860
Do you want to drink something?

165
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,500
What would you like to drink?

166
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,980
Forget that I asked.

167
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,620
It’s all set.

168
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,580
So fast?

169
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,100
It’s about the time.

170
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,300
Is everyone here?

171
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,700
They should be here very soon.

172
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,820
After they finish the registration,

173
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,340
they’re going to watch a dolphin show first.

174
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,660
And after that,

175
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,500
they’ll start dating each other

176
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,860
in different areas.

177
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,940
What about the 100% matched users?

178
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,860
They’re going to meet each other

179
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,620
in the Beluga Whale Area.

180
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,460
Don’t worry.

181
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,620
The Lion’s Mane jellyfish are the largest in the world.

182
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,580
The Immortal jellyfish can rejuvenate.

183
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,980
What the heck do you mean?

184
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,340
Don’t you know what I mean, Mr. Du?

185
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,100
I really don’t...

186
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,980
Guys!

187
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,340
You came to root for Li Xiaochuan,

188
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,460
not to kick up a fuss, right?

189
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:54,980
Here you are.

190
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,980
Mr. Du.

191
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,340
Thank you.

192
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,140
Come closer to me!

193
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,700
Just give him the water.

194
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,020
Don’t get too close to him.

195
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,140
You’re a girl. Do you know that?

196
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,820
I’m a girl...

197
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,220
Understand? Understand?

198
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,780
Mr. Du doesn’t even want the water.

199
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,740
Hello?

200
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,860
Du,

201
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,940
Dad is in the hospital.

202
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,820
Can you come take a look at him?

203
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,540
What happened to Dad?

204
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,580
He suddenly passed out at home.

205
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,460
Now he’s receiving the emergency treatment.

206
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,700
Send me the address.

207
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,980
What happened, Mr. Du?

208
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,420
I have an emergency.

209
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,420
I need to go.

210
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,580
Please tell this to Xiaochuan.

211
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,220
Ok.

212
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,780
You can leave now.

213
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,260
This way!

214
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,420
I know.

215
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,740
Are you satisfied now?

216
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,500
Yes, I am.

217
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,740
Dear users of West World,

218
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,780
the dolphin show is about to begin.

219
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Please go to the dolphin show area now.

220
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,700
Let’s go.

221
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,820
What?

222
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,020
Watch the show.

223
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,860
This way!

224
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,900
Is she an idiot?

225
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,820
Thank you very much

226
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,540
for making time to attend

227
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,300
this one-day offline dating activity

228
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,300
of West World.

229
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,660
I wonder if you have found

230
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,740
the person that matches you the best

231
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,060
during the free time just now.

232
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,020
Seems you’re very shy.

233
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
Now be brave.

234
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,260
West World is a platform for you

235
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,060
to find your only true love.

236
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,900
Next up,

237
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,380
please go to the romantic dating areas

238
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,420
prepared for you based on

239
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,540
your different degrees of matching

240
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,260
and start your date.

241
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,620
I wish that all of you

242
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,340
can encounter the one meant for you.

243
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,020
Let’s take action now.

244
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,180
Move away!

245
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,660
I thought minors cannot

246
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,580
sign up for an account of Xiaochuan’s app.

247
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,580
Don’t tell me you’ve got a match?

248
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,620
How... How is that possible?

249
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,100
I came to help as a friend.

250
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,060
You’ve got a match?

251
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,380
You’re kidding me?

252
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,660
I haven’t even used the app.

253
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,380
I just came to take a look.

254
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,020
-I’ll go to Li then.
-I’ll go to Xiaochuan then.

255
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,100
See you later.

256
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,700
Why are you still here?

257
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,380
You owe me a lollipop!

258
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Still remembering the lollipop?

259
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,380
I don’t have lollipops.

260
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,220
No money. I only have a heating pad.

261
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,660
What? What?

262
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,540
You’re the user who’s got a 100% match,

263
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,180
Juno?

264
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,100
This is making me feel so uncomfortable.

265
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,580
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

266
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,460
What about now?

267
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,300
Of course you should go in.

268
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,700
You’re single anyway.

269
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,060
What if Xiaochuan’s app

270
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,940
has found the person

271
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,740
meant for you?

272
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,420
But I don’t want to attend a blind date.

273
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,820
What am I going to say to him?

274
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,740
Just go inside first.

275
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,180
You’re the only female user

276
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,220
that’s got a 100% match.

277
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,260
Your data is really important

278
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,180
to Xiaochuan.

279
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,340
Please.

280
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,340
You’re the best.

281
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,220
I won’t go.

282
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,500
Just go.

283
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,780
Go.

284
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,620
Jiang Jun,

285
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,980
I’ll buy that bag you saw last time for you.

286
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,620
That’s a deal!

287
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,820
What a gold digger!

288
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,540
So,

289
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,820
you’re the one that’s got a 100% match?

290
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,100
It’s me.

291
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,060
Wait.

292
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,620
You didn’t trust my app, did you?

293
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,740
I was doing this for your sake.

294
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,100
You brat.

295
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,300
Take this.

296
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,060
You can find the parts

297
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,700
where I think you can improve

298
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,100
based on my recent experience using it.

299
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,580
You can refer to them.

300
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,340
By and large,

301
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,020
there’s something good about your app.

302
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,980
Keep it up.

303
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,700
Thank you, Brother.

304
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,740
Keep it up.

305
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,060
By the way,

306
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,580
I’m not going to attend the activity

307
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,820
for the 100% matched users.

308
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,860
See you.

309
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,620
No!

310
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
You two are the only two users

311
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,740
that are 100% matched.

312
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,780
You have to go there.

313
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,780
Will you force me if I’m not willing to?

314
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,100
You’ll have to go there this time

315
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,860
even if you want to upload that video.

316
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,540
Just go!

317
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,620
Hello.

318
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,540
Dear Ms. Juno,

319
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
you’re going to be late.

320
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,020
It’s not polite to be late.

321
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,780
Hello.

322
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,780
Hello.

323
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,620
Dear Mr. Zeus,

324
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,940
being late will leave her a bad impression.

325
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,020
Don’t be timid.

326
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,020
Don’t procrastinate.

327
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,540
Don’t try to run away.

328
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,260
Please follow the rules of the game.

329
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,020
Please follow the rules of the activity.

330
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,260
Don’t leave arbitrarily.

331
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,500
Please put on the blindfold and go in.

332
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,060
Ok. Thank you.

333
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,100
Xiaochuan,

334
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,260
we’ll be able to see the scene

335
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,140
when the two 100% matched users meet

336
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,380
through here, right?

337
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,460
Xiaochuan,

338
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,620
don’t be too surprised later

339
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,020
when you see the scene.

340
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,140
I’ve already been shocked today.

341
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,780
Nothing more can surprise me.

342
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,140
Ok, let’s start then.

343
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,980
Dear users of West World, Juno and Zeus,

344
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,140
welcome to our activity.

345
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,020
Now you’re standing under the spotlight.

346
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,700
I’m going to test
if you have the tacit understanding.

347
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,290
If your answer is yes, take a step backward.

348
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,740
If your answer is no, take a step forward.

349
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,300
Are you single?

350
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,540
Do you believe in love?

351
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,180
Do you believe one can love a person forever?

352
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,700
Do you believe in destiny?

353
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,140
Congratulations!

354
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,340
You’ve passed our test.

355
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Please turn around and meet each other.

356
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,100
This...

357
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,980
-What’s going on?
-What’s going on?

358
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,060
How come it’s you?

359
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,300
Ok.

360
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,660
Let’s follow the rules.

361
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,460
Stay here for a while and then leave.

362
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,460
Ok.

363
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,060
Jun and Yuan Shuai?

364
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,220
Your app gave me a different matching result.

365
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,980
I was very surprised, too.

366
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,820
But my app can’t be wrong.

367
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,580
So just wait and see.

368
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,540
I’m sure they will be together.

369
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,020
Xiaochuan,

370
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,020
what’s your user id?

371
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,020
System Developer.

372
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,060
This really is

373
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,220
a very creative name. Great!

374
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,700
System Developer?

375
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,840
<i>System Developer Failed Match</i>

376
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,940
Pretty boy,

377
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,620
<i>West World One-day Offline Activity Feedback Hao Tiantian</i>
this is my form. Take it.

378
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,980
Hao Tiantian.

379
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,820
Just give it to me!

380
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,140
Thank you!

381
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,740
No need! No need!

382
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,900
-Just give it to me!
-Hao Tiantian!

383
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,940
-Remember me. I’m Hao Tiantian!
-Thank you!

384
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,620
Wait! Just give it to me!

385
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,980
-One by one, alright?
-West World.

386
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,540
Line up!

387
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,220
Line up!

388
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,180
Take it!

389
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,660
Like they’ve never seen a man.

390
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,660
I saw it! I saw it!

391
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,300
I saw it!

392
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,980
Li Xiaochuan!

393
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,540
I’m leaving!

394
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,740
Right! That one!

395
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,940
-Li Xiaochuan!
-I want to get a match!

396
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,100
-Li Xiaochuan!
-I didn’t sign up for an account!

397
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,700
Li Xiaochuan!

398
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,260
I’m leaving!

399
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,020
Ok. Ok.

400
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,100
Remember to add me!

401
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:09,900
Ok.

402
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,500
Ok. Thank you. Thank you.

403
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,340
Put it here. Just put it here.

404
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,940
Ok. Zhouzhou, right?

405
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,580
Are you ignoring me as well?

406
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,020
This is mine.

407
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,740
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you.

408
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,180
Bye-bye.

409
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,020
Bye-bye.

410
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,620
Xu Li,

411
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,780
you...

412
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,740
Xu Li!

413
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,940
Xu Li!

414
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,740
Sorry,

415
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,700
the number you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

416
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,220
Please redial later.

417
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,940
Sorry.

418
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,940
Mr. Du!

419
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,860
Mr. Du! Mr. Du!

420
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,740
How’s Dad doing?

421
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,420
He just had surgery.

422
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
The doctor said

423
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,380
he was treated in time.

424
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,700
Those employees at the door...

425
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,580
The news that Dad passed out

426
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,340
had come out.

427
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,460
Everyone in the company is panic-stricken.

428
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,820
Du,

429
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,940
I can’t handle this alone.

430
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,300
I’ll take care of it.

431
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,540
How’s the company going?

432
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,620
The rumor that Chairman Du is critically ill

433
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,300
has been stopped.

434
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,940
But the closing price today

435
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,300
hit another record low.

436
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,580
Move the PR press conference one day earlier.

437
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,660
After the chairman wakes up,

438
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,420
make appointments with the convincing media outlets

439
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,780
when the time is right.

440
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,140
And have face-to-face interviews with them.

441
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,660
Ok.

442
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,180
Wait!

443
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,140
Two media outlets together.

444
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,260
Got it.

445
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,220
Two together,

446
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,620
so others can’t accuse us of bribing the media.

447
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,260
Now get it done.

448
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,300
Got it.

449
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,020
Mr. Du, we’re leaving.

450
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,260
Li Xiaochuan, I hate you!

451
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,780
I’ll put your computer

452
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,460
in the bathtub

453
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,100
if you don’t come to look for me.

454
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,900
I can’t.

455
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,380
His computer seems very important to him.

456
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,220
Then I’ll remove the enter key.

457
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,260
But that can’t really vent my anger.

458
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,820
Then I’ll remove the delete key as well.

459
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,140
Xu Li!

460
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Where did you go?

461
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,780
Do you know how long I’ve been looking for you?

462
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,980
Visitors have already left.

463
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,060
It’s going to close, you know?

464
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,700
I...

465
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,700
I searched everywhere,

466
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
and I couldn’t reach you by phone.

467
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,740
I’d call the cops if I still couldn’t find you.

468
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,500
Why is your heart beating so fast?

469
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,580
I ran all the way here.

470
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,860
Let’s go back then.

471
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,380
Let’s hug for a little longer.

472
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,580
How come it was rejected again?

473
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,620
It’s been ten times!

474
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,860
Even my thesis was not rejected so many times!

475
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,220
Regarding the horizontal competition

476
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,580
and affiliate transactions,

477
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,020
you should stress that the foreign investment

478
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,900
has controlled Yuanyang Group indirectly.

479
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,180
Although part of its business overlaps

480
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,140
with the subsidiary of the distributor,

481
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,620
the horizontal competition

482
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,940
doesn’t actually exist.

483
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,620
Understand, Dr. Stanford?

484
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,420
I see.

485
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,620
Revise it then.

486
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,380
Hello?

487
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,260
Honey.

488
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,420
Hello, Honey,

489
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,420
guess where I am right now.

490
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,420
Honey,

491
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,780
why are you so fond of the guessing games?

492
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,220
I guess

493
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,540
you’re going to meet and eat with your friend?

494
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,700
Wrong.

495
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,260
I’m at your company’s entrance.

496
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,500
What?

497
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,300
You’re at my company’s entrance?

498
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,180
Honey, don’t move for now.

499
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,100
Wait a second.

500
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,020
Outsiders are not allowed to come in.

501
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,860
Just wait a moment.

502
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,900
I’ll send someone there.

503
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,700
Hello.

504
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,460
Miss, do you have an appointment?

505
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,860
Of course. I’m going to meet your boss!

506
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,900
Please sit down for a while.

507
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,900
Ok.

508
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,900
Boss! Boss!

509
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,100
Why didn’t you knock on the door? So impolite.

510
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,700
Xinxin is here.

511
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,100
How could you allow this to happen?

512
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,660
No, Boss!

513
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,260
I didn’t expect she’d come.

514
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:37,900
Can...

515
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,460
Can you help me one last time?

516
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,060
One last time. One last time.

517
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,860
Take her to my office then.

518
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,060
What are you doing?

519
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,060
Drawing the curtains.

520
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,860
Why are you drawing the curtains?

521
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,020
I don’t dare to usher her in.

522
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,420
I think you should go and usher her in.

523
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,060
After all, I’m the Executive Director.

524
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,060
I’m afraid she’d find out the truth

525
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
if I went to usher her in.

526
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,700
Come here.

527
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,740
You punk!

528
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,980
Thank you, Boss!

529
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,340
Go to the Accounting Office later

530
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,620
and get 6 months’ salary deducted.

531
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,740
Thank you, Boss!

532
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,060
A year!

533
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,060
Ms. Xinxin.

534
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,740
Yuan?

535
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,540
Hello.

536
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,140
Hello.

537
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,180
You want to see Mr. Su, right?

538
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,180
Come, this way.

539
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,620
Ok.

540
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,620
Let me help you.

541
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,580
Ok. Thank you.

542
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,900
No problem. This way.

543
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,980
Yuan, where is Mr. Su?

544
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,060
He’s in the office. Let me take you there.

545
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Oh my! What’s going on?

546
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,340
Oh my!

547
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,740
Mr. Yuan just came to

548
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,780
welcome a girl personally.

549
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,980
They’re passing by the office area now.

550
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,660
Do you know what’s going on?

551
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,100
Did you see that? Did you see that?

552
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,540
Look! Look!

553
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,460
Right. What’s going on?

554
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,660
How come Mr. Yuan is ushering a girl in?

555
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,940
What a rare scene!

556
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,860
Ms. Xinxin, this way.

557
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,260
Hello.

558
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,340
Hello.

559
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,980
Wait.

560
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,300
Where is Ms. Jiang?

561
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,500
She went to a client’s company.

562
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,900
She’ll be back later.

563
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,980
I see.

564
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,460
I also brought some food for you two.

565
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,140
Thank you, Ms. Xinxin.

566
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,340
This way.

567
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,860
Oh my! Who is this girl?

568
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,380
Mr. Yuan is so polite to her.

569
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,620
There’s only one reason for this.

570
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,260
It must be that Mr. Yuan

571
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,380
landed a key client on his own merits.

572
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,500
Not necessarily.

573
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,300
She looks so young.

574
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,980
She could be the daughter of a key client.

575
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,580
That makes sense.

576
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,940
Mr. Yuan is so handsome.

577
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,420
He should take advantage of that.

578
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,260
Seems that

579
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,540
Mr. Yuan also needs to make use of
his good appearance.

580
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,220
Cut the gossip.

581
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,140
It’d be bad if Mr. Yuan heard it.

582
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,410
Like we don’t know?

583
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,660
Mr. Su, Ms. Xinxin is here.

584
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,780
Honey.

585
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,060
Let me know in advance if you come again.

586
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,410
I got it.

587
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,740
Again?

588
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,180
No again.

589
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,740
I was wrong, Boss.

590
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,740
Mr. Su, I’ll leave if there’s nothing else.

591
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,420
Yuan...

592
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Ms. Jiang is here.

593
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,060
Ms. Xinxin is here, too.

594
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,540
The thing I wanted to tell Mr. Su

595
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,380
is actually not very urgent.

596
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,540
I’ll excuse myself then.

597
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,340
Wait!

598
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,180
I’ve also brought lunch for you.

599
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,100
Come eat with us.

600
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,260
And Yuan.

601
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,500
-Ok then.
-Ok.

602
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,500
Thank you.

603
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,380
Yuan, I’m thirsty.

604
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,700
Get me some water.

605
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,820
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

606
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,340
Ms. Jiang,

607
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,220
you and Yuan

608
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,540
are having an office romance.

609
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,460
Is it exciting?

610
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,620
Ms. Jiang, slowly.

611
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,140
Don’t get choked.

612
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,140
Not bad.

613
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,220
You’re shy?

614
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,260
Really.

615
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,660
Hurry! Eat up!

616
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,540
Ok.

617
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,460
Yuanyuan,

618
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,500
open it for me.

619
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,820
You call him Yuanyuan?

620
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,140
So sweet.

621
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,220
Of course.

622
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,140
Yuanyuan is very caring.

623
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,180
He’d separate meat and vegetables for me,

624
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,500
and I don’t eat carrots and soybeans.

625
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,540
He’d separate them for me every time.

626
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,500
Am I right?

627
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,420
So caring.

628
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,540
How come there are so many soybeans?

629
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,700
And there. There’s one more.

630
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,460
I’m not blind.

631
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,980
Ms. Jiang, enjoy your food.

632
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:39,980
Thank you.

633
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,380
I dropped my chopsticks.

634
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,020
Yuanyuan, pick them up for me.

635
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,620
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

636
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,340
Please, Ms. Jiang.

637
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,140
I don’t want to use chopsticks anymore.

638
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,500
How about…

639
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,460
You feed me?

640
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,860
It’d be my honor to feed you.

641
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,500
By the way, Ms. Jiang,

642
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,820
I heard from Su Chang that

643
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,420
he has a boss

644
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,020
who’s very difficult to handle.

645
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,180
He’s very fierce when he punishes people.

646
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,940
Right!

647
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,900
He’s very fierce,

648
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,420
narcissistic and cocky.

649
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,500
I don’t dare to mess with him either.

650
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,860
So exaggerating?

651
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,660
I heard from Su Chang that

652
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,100
he’s still single

653
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,460
even at his age,

654
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,900
and he was always envious of Su Chang.

655
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,540
He’s so evil-minded.

656
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,020
He must be very ugly-looking.

657
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,260
Maybe he’s even bald.

658
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,500
Besides,

659
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,260
since he has such a high position,

660
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,900
it’s so bizarre that he doesn’t

661
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,100
even have one woman around him.

662
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,500
So I guess,

663
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,500
could it be that he...

664
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,660
Honey,

665
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,860
the food is getting cold.

666
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,180
Hurry and have some.

667
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,700
Ms. Jiang,

668
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,500
Su Chang doesn’t really think

669
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,620
before he speaks sometimes.

670
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,700
He tends to offend people.

671
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,300
Especially when his leader bullies him,

672
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,020
I hope you can

673
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,260
do something to help him.

674
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,980
How is that possible?

675
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,180
Mr. Su is the most likable person

676
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,700
in the company.

677
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,980
His boss and subordinates

678
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,980
all like him very much.

679
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,900
He’ll never get bullied.

680
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,740
Right, Mr. Su?

681
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:06,820
Right.

682
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,100
And now with your support,

683
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
I’m sure

684
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,020
Mr. Su will take his career

685
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,300
to the next level.

686
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,820
I’m getting late.

687
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,660
I need to go to a nail salon with my friend.

688
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,940
You keep chatting.

689
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,780
I should get going.

690
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,300
Bye-bye.

691
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,180
Bye-bye.

692
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,500
Oh, Honey.

693
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,780
My friend wants to

694
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,900
eat with us tonight.

695
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,180
Her husband came back.

696
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,780
He always wanted to know you.

697
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,020
Don’t forget this.

698
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,900
I’ll be there if I’m still alive by then.

699
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,340
Nothing...

700
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,300
I’ll see you off.

701
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,100
Mr. Su!

702
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,340
I have something to tell you.

703
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,500
Let Yuanyuan see her off.

704
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,260
Yuanyuan,

705
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,460
go.

706
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,940
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

707
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,300
Ms. Xinxin, please.

708
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,340
This way.

709
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,260
Yuan, you can go back.

710
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,020
Print this and inform everyone.

711
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,780
Ok.

712
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,620
Work hard.

713
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,580
Keep it up.

714
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,540
Ok, Ms. Xinxin.

715
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,540
I’m leaving then.

716
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,540
Ok.

717
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,060
Bye-bye.

718
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,260
Hello.

719
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,980
I’m the VP of MH, Qiao Na.

720
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,940
Which company do you represent?

721
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,060
I’m not a client.

722
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,420
I came to see my boyfriend.

723
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,500
Your boyfriend?

724
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,380
Yuan Shuai?

725
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,460
No! No!

726
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,540
Please don’t misunderstand.

727
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,180
Yuan already has a girlfriend.

728
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,300
I’ve been working with him for many years.

729
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,900
How come I don’t know he has a girlfriend?

730
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,420
Can you tell me who she is?

731
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,300
Anyway, try to stay away from them..

732
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
If she knew you find out her secret,

733
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,700
she’d give me a hard time at work.

734
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,940
I... I don’t know who she is.

735
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,060
That’s just what I’ve heard.

736
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,940
I have something else to do.

737
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,100
I’m leaving. Bye-bye.
