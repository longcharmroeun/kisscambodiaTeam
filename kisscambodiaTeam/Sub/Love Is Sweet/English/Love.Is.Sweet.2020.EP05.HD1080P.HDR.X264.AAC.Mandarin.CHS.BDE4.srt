[Letter of Resignation]

00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,190
that how helpless I was
[Letter of Resignation]

7
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,850
that how helpless I was

8
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,770
at that moment.

9
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,170
Luckily, my Prince Charming

10
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,930
suddenly appeared in front of me.

11
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,970
I’m really happy.

12
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,210
Just thinking about it makes me exciting.

13
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,770
Hello, mom.

14
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,130
Jiang Jun.

15
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,730
How is your work?

16
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,650
Does everything go well?

17
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,490
Everything goes well. Everyone is friendly.

18
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,490
I’m fine.

19
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,730
That’s good.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,770
Jiang Jun.

21
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,490
Listen.

22
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,930
Don’t ever cry if you get wronged

23
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,850
and tell me about it. Got it?

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,890
Maybe you can get a boyfriend.

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,090
He can take care of you.

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,370
Then I will feel relieved.

27
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,370
Alright, mom.

28
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,370
No hurry. Just let it be.

29
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,850
Alright.

30
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,850
I won’t urge you again. Okay?

31
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,570
Jiang Jun.

32
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,170
Look,

33
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,450
you are in Shanghai alone

34
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,610
without anybody accompanying you.

35
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,890
So be careful all the time,

36
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,850
you know?

37
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,330
Please take care, mom.

38
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,450
I will return when I get a holiday.

39
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,450
Bye-bye.

40
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,490
Your mom?

41
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,090
Jiang Jun.

42
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,810
How about changing another job?

43
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,290
I’ll support you if you can’t get a proper job.

44
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,770
I’ll support you even I
have to sell instant noodles.

45
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,770
Well.

46
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,120
You don’t like the big devil, right?

47
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,250
Leaving him

48
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,290
is a good thing from another angle.

49
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,050
Don’t you think so?

50
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,250
Stop thinking of the letter of resignation.

51
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,050
You need to eat first

52
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,650
and then fight with the others.

53
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,010
Hold on, I’ll cook the instant noodles for you.

54
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,970
Taking MH as an online game,

55
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,530
which level are you at?

56
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,890
I’m being kicked out of the newbie area.

57
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,890
It seems you need a teacher.

58
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,120
I’m not

59
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,810
the top one but kind of experienced

60
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,570
in the investment industry.

61
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,730
Am I that lucky

62
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,250
to be your teacher?

63
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,770
I have no idea about it right now.

64
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,330
Maybe I can have a try

65
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,370
even there is a slim chance.

66
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,610
Teacher, please accept me as your student.

67
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,440
Seriously? You take me as your teacher online?

68
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,210
I didn’t have a meal today.

69
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,450
Would you mind treat me a meal?

70
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,610
Delicious noodles for you.

71
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,890
Li, enjoy it yourself.

72
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,730
I have to go out now.

73
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,290
No necessary to wait.

74
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,170
Eat some before leaving.

75
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,090
Where will she go alone so late?

76
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,850
You young girl,

77
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,970
why are you getting out so late alone?

78
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,610
It seems I’m caring about her too much.

79
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,130
You are out alone so late.

80
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,650
Are you trying to murder Deng Ke?

81
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,170
It’s really a good idea.

82
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,490
But seems the price is too high.

83
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,730
Don’t worry.

84
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,970
Nobody else, but you.

85
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,370
You are the first target

86
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,810
for me to assassinate.

87
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,090
Then take care and come back alive early.

88
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,490
I’d wait for dying together with you.

89
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,730
Bah!

90
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,490
Excuse me.

91
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,290
Thank you.

92
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:04,820
Thank you.

93
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,410
Mr. Du,

94
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,530
maybe we can change another place.

95
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,410
I don’t think this place

96
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,250
fits your identity very well.

97
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,050
Both steak and fried chicken

98
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,170
make people feel full

99
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,330
while let people enjoy the delicious food.

100
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,970
They both give people satiety.

101
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,250
Why do we have to care about
the lowliness or nobleness.

102
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,490
It tastes great.

103
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,490
Alright.

104
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,290
No matter if I can learn

105
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,530
the essence from you,

106
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,730
I’d appreciate you

107
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,130
helping me at the critical moment.

108
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,770
I’d show my respect.

109
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,530
Alcohol will affect your judgment.

110
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,650
Moreover,

111
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,330
it’s not about drunken boxing.

112
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,050
How have you been recently?

113
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,970
There is no room for change.

114
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,850
Is it about Kelang Pharmacy?

115
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,610
You know it?

116
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,010
They do have done many things recently.

117
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,690
M&A.

118
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,530
Joint board of directors.

119
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,610
I heard of it.

120
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,210
My mistake. I was sure of success.

121
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,970
But we got a weak teammate.

122
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,330
What do you mean by that?

123
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,850
Simply speaking,

124
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,690
we doubted that

125
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,410
one senior leader of Kelang was stained.

126
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,130
Unexpectedly, our witness

127
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,610
went wrong at a critical moment.

128
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,650
We were then defeated at last.

129
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,530
He went wrong at a critical moment.

130
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,650
You think he had important evidence?

131
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,090
Do you mean he did that on purpose?

132
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,170
Deng Ke is a person

133
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,730
good at making psychological attacks.

134
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,530
A boss like him

135
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,610
wouldn’t have a fool assisting him.

136
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,050
What does that mean?

137
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,530
Remember,

138
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,330
no matter what kind of company,

139
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,130
it will cover its shortcomings

140
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,210
and pretend everything is going well

141
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,570
at the first moment

142
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,530
when it faces huge interests.

143
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,970
You need to find out the truth,

144
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,170
but not just seeing documents they offered.

145
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,050
Documents can be feigned and deceive people.

146
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,410
While backstage and data

147
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,930
are always checkable.

148
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,850
You are right.

149
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,850
The thing shouldn’t be that simple.

150
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,330
Excuse me, Miss.

151
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,290
We are on the anniversary.

152
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,250
Every lady can have this as a gift.

153
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,170
Please take it.

154
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,450
Thank you.

155
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,490
Also please show my appreciation to your boss.

156
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,170
OK.

157
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
Surprisingly a good thing.

158
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,570
See?

159
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,290
You are getting luckier.

160
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,850
She will probably be fired,

161
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,330
but she even feels like dating a man.

162
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,770
Remember your good luck.

163
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,450
Thank you.

164
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,570
She even received a flower.

165
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,970
Drive safely.

166
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,010
Jiang Jun.

167
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,410
You asked me to rediscover you.

168
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,370
Is that what you want me to rediscover?

169
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,650
Well.

170
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,970
Wait and see.

171
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,250
I will show you how.

172
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,450
Comparisons are odious.

173
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,850
People are always different.

174
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,250
Both work in investment industry,

175
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,890
but why do they have so big gap?

176
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,570
[Total assets: 501,430 Yuan]

177
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,510
I heard you went to work in an accounting firm
[Total assets: 501,430 Yuan]

178
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,690
I heard you went to work in an accounting firm

179
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,410
after leaving my company.

180
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,050
You are just working there

181
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,850
for muddling along

182
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,810
without earning too much, right?

183
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,330
Mr. Deng.

184
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,730
Are you asking me here

185
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,850
specially to shame me?

186
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,570
Shame you?

187
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,490
Shame you.

188
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,450
Do you deserve it?

189
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,290
You must be hard up now, right?

190
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,770
500,000 yuan.

191
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,450
I will pay you 500,000.

192
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,090
Do one thing for me.

193
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,610
Who is that?

194
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,850
Why is it you?

195
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,330
What are you doing?

196
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,890
Did I allow you to come in?

197
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,010
You are drinking.

198
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,050
So in a good mood, huh?

199
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,410
You must have been bribed by Deng Ke.

200
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,130
Nonsense.

201
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,250
He’s the biggest enemy of me.

202
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,970
How is it possible?

203
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,250
You even betrayed your wife.

204
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,690
Of course you can be bribed by your enemy.

205
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,010
Listen.

206
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,090
This is my house.

207
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,810
Just leave. You are not welcomed.

208
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,930
I’m calling the police if you don’t leave.

209
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,890
Understand?

210
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,870
[Office Advanced for Management]

211
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,570
You haven’t read the books for a long time.

212
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,850
Your faith must be rusty.

213
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,210
All your passions have gone.

214
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,330
I checked your account.

215
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,410
An unknown amount

216
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,530
of 500,00 was transferred

217
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,130
to you.

218
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,850
Are you going to tell me

219
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,370
Deng Ke was feeling sorry

220
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,890
and gave it to you as a compensation?

221
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:35,970
Li Xiang.

222
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,530
You even could be bribed by your enemy.

223
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,050
How cheap you are!

224
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,890
I am

225
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,090
out of money.

226
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,410
Out of money?

227
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,490
Look, you’d better speak out

228
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,050
what you and Deng Ke did.

229
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,010
Otherwise,

230
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,090
you will have a new stain.

231
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,850
Also I’d ensure you

232
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,210
that you will

233
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,290
forfeit your career from this day.

234
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,930
You are killing me in that way.

235
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:21,970
No way.

236
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,090
Definitely not.

237
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,770
Deng Ke has something on me.

238
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,130
I can’t help you.

239
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,130
Do you think I have nothing on you?

240
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,090
You have three seconds.

241
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,170
Three.

242
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,570
Two.

243
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,010
One.

244
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,490
Hold on please.

245
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,770
Besides me,

246
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,090
there was another person.

247
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,530
Jiang Jun, are you crazy?

248
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,370
Jiang Jun?

249
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,650
Jiang Jun?

250
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,370
Jiang Jun.

251
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,890
You haven’t slept for one night?

252
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,690
You must be crazy.

253
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,090
So,

254
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,530
is it worth working overnight?

255
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,490
And this is a dismissed guy.

256
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,290
Will you give up your life for work?

257
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,530
Staying up late will cause sudden death

258
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,690
to many people, you know?

259
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,050
You can check it on Weibo.

260
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,210
There are many…

261
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,490
That’s him.

262
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,130
That’s it. I finally got it.

263
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,130
Love you, baby.

264
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,890
I gotta go to work.

265
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:33,970

266
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,770
I’m sorry.

267
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,370
We thought you are to leave office.

268
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,650
We worked up late because of you.

269
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,250
Kelang arranged people yesterday to ask for

270
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,530
signing the Intention Agreement this afternoon.

271
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,850
Or else they will contact GE.

272
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,210
Ms. Qiao arranged us

273
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,170
to collate the data of Kelang.

274
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,330
Now that you are here,

275
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,050
please help us handle the stuff

276
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:53,890
on the desk.

277
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,810
What did you just say?

278
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,370
I said

279
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,890
now that you are here, please…

280
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,850
No, the one before that.

281
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,210
Kelang will sign the Intention Agreement
this afternoon.

282
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,570
This afternoon?

283
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,610
The cooperation is settled today

284
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,770
just after the board of directors yesterday.

285
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,850
Does Mr. Yuan know it?

286
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,770
I have no idea whether he knows it or not.

287
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,970
I just know it’s Ms. Qiao’s order.

288
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:15,850
Jiang Jun.

289
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,530
Strictly speaking,

290
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,330
we three were requested to do things

291
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,890
that you originally should do

292
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,490
because you messed up Kelang’s meeting.

293
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,530
My supervisor in Stanford once said

294
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,250
people should be brave to face every challenge

295
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,930
without making any excuses.

296
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,370
That’s right.

297
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,850
Anybody who expresses his dissatisfaction

298
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,370
by complaining the colleagues

299
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,210
due to additional tasks

300
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,490
is unqualified

301
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,210
to stay in MH.

302
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,130
Mr. Yuan.

303
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,290
I’ll finish the new challenge
with quality assured.

304
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,290
Yuan Shuai.

305
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,490
Is what they said true?

306
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,970
The agreement will be signed this afternoon?

307
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,730
Yes.

308
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,050
But I’ve found out

309
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,970
the real insider last night.

310
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,450
Li Xiang was a liar.

311
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,850
He’s Deng Ke’s finished bait.

312
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,810
Deng Ke did something to the personnel file.

313
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,930
The insider was listed as the in-service staff.

314
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,410
Actually he quitted a long time ago

315
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:36,830
and now is working in an accounting firm.

316
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,510
[Staff File of Kelang Pharmacy]
and now is working in an accounting firm.

317
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:38,570
and now is working in an accounting firm.

318
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,930
You are not ridiculously stupid.

319
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,570
I thought you are just one

320
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,730
who may have fun outside with flowers at night.

321
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,890
Now you can even find it’s a shell game.

322
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,810
You knew it?

323
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,610
Deng Ke will come
for signing the agreement at 2:30 p.m.

324
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,410
You need to

325
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,290
stop him before I come back.

326
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,610
How?

327
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,250
You should give a thought to it.

328
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:01,730
No.

329
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,610
Why hasn’t he come back?

330
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,170
Man of Kelang will come soon.

331
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,570
Print the agreement.

332
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,290
Mr. Deng. This way please.

333
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,610
Print it and send it to the meeting room.

334
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,210
Deng Ke came in advance. How is it going?

335
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,090
How much time do you need?

336
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,850
Lin He.

337
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,530
I’ve told you

338
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,690
I don’t want to get involved anymore.

339
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,330
You don’t need to come for me.

340
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,290
Brake for the race. Hot melt tyre.

341
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,650
A man chasing extreme speed

342
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,290
shouldn’t just leave like this, right?

343
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,730
After leaving Kelang,

344
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,450
you got a new job.

345
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,450
But the salary is much less.

346
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,730
Let’s race.

347
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,890
Be the witness

348
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,650
if you lost.

349
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,690
Let me help you

350
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,450
return Kelang aboveboard if you win.

351
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,530
Look, you are

352
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,170
interesting.

353
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,570
Will we?

354
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,890
To betting to bear.

355
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,010
Let’s go.

356
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,050
Forget about it.

357
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,450
Mr. Deng.

358
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,850
Hello.

359
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,930
Nice to meet you.

360
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,570
Nice to meet you.

361
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,290
After signing the contract,

362
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,490
we may play golf sometime.

363
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,370
You have the final say.

364
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,450
Please sit.

365
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:20,930
Great.

366
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,930
Why hasn’t she sent the agreement?

367
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,890
I will go check it.

368
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,650
Why is she here?

369
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:38,890
Mr. Yuan

370
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,250
gave her a chance.

371
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,570
Mr. Fan.

372
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,690
MH is so tolerant.

373
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,850
You gave a chance to people

374
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,050
made such a big mistake.

375
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,250
I believe Mr. Deng

376
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,370
is also an easy person.

377
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,530
Otherwise, you won’t be here today.

378
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,490
Yeah.

379
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,930
Arranging her to send the contract

380
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,770
is letting her know better about

381
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,730
her mistake.

382
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,530
Su Chang.

383
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,130
I, I will get a new one.

384
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,090
No necessary.

385
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,530
I’m used to having two strings to the bow.

386
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,390
[Deng Ke]

387
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:33,850
Lin He.

388
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,770
Former employee of Kelang.

389
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,010
The real insider.

390
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,050
He has the evidence Mr. Deng transferring

391
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,010
corporate assets to his private bank account.

392
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,890
Seems Miss Jiang still hasn’t realized

393
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,970
her mistake.

394
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,890
You got an unregistered accountant last time.

395
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,890
Today it’s simpler.

396
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,050
You just slander venomously with the resume

397
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,210
of someone quitted.

398
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,170
Mr. Fan.

399
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,610
I can just let go

400
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,050
of the last event.

401
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,090
But your employee

402
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,370
has kept slandering me.

403
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,490
Can you explain it?

404
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,290
Mr. Deng.

405
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,370
I’m sorry.

406
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,930
It’s my dereliction.

407
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,210
Su Chang.

408
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,330
Take her out.

409
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,090
Process the dismissal procedure.

410
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,770
The company reserves the right to claim.

411
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,450
I will call the security

412
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,210
if you don’t get out.

413
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,770
You are not the one to leave.

414
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,410
Mr. Deng.

415
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,530
MH and Kelang should cooperate

416
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,210
based on mutual trust.

417
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,050
Am I right?

418
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,210
But you made us confused on purpose

419
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,210
and cheated

420
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,090
by mixing the former employee

421
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,850
in the list of in-service staff

422
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,130
to hide the evidence of transferring assets.

423
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,010
Why?

424
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,970
You didn’t think I could find out the evidence?

425
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,530
Sorry, Mr. Deng.

426
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,850
I’ve sent the evidence and documents

427
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,010
to Kelang’s board of directors.

428
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,890
Everything you’ve done

429
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,930
will be known by all.

430
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,170
I’m afraid

431
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,490
we have to cancel the contract today.

432
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,810
If

433
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,890
MH will continue the cooperation

434
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,890
with Kelang

436
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,250
you are still the president

437
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,010

438

00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,130
For thanking you.

441
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,530
You are putting me off?

442
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,530
Of course not.

443
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,090
You liked it the most in your childhood, right?

444
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,010
Uh.

445
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:43,810
Thank you.

446
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,570
I thought I would be kicked out this time.

447
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:49,770
How do you think?

448
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,810
Is it beautiful?

449
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,530
You came to MH just for sight seeing, right?

450
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,690
Of course I should

451
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,570
take you to see around.

452
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,210

454
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,570
So you took me as a visitor?

455
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,770
Then why did you help me?

456
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,010
You think I was helping you?

457
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,450
In investment circle,

458
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,290
I’ve never lost.

459
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,250
I can’t ruin my fame

460
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,170
just because of Deng Ke.

461
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,490
Why are you looking?

462
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,730
Anyway,

463
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,570
thank you for teaching me that.

464

Also, after I see the sight,

465
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,970
I will surely stay.

466

Seems you are

467
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,290
not as unfeeling as I imagined.

468
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,490
Seems you are

469
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,170
stronger than I imagined.

470
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,650
I don’t owe people any favor.
I’d treat you dinner tonight.

471

472

Users who are thinking of group buying

480
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,490
will never become their target population.

481
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:52,610
You, as an example.

482
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,610

501

Cui Lele?

Who is she?

The plump girl of our class.

505
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,210
Her dad had a sauced meat shop.

506

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,290
What?

510
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,010
Did I take it at last?

511
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,130
Yeah.

512
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,330
She accepted your proposal.

513
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,730
And you had the pig’s feet together.

514
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,650
Mouthful.

515
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,730
Your mouth was full of oil.

516
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,130
It’s really funny.

517
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,650
You remember it clearly.

518
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,090
I remember every detail.

519
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,530
Why don’t I remember it?

520
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,250
You are defaming me.

521
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,730
I’d sue you for slandering.

522
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,330
You were defamed long time ago.

523
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,010
I was just scolding you in the company

524
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,250
but not learning your personal information.

525
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,410
Giving birth to a second child?

526
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,690
Bah. I’m single now.

527
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,930
Don’t talk nonsense.

528
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,690
Does your ex-wife live an extremely good life?

529
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,970
Her new husband

530
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,570
is much better than you, right?

531
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:43,850
Sorry to tell.

532
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,850
I’m single

533
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,890
as you are.

534
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:47,890
Get it.

535
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,530
A nobody becomes rich suddenly

536
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,570
and has too many choices.

537
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,090
You are exactly right.

538
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,370
There are too many beauties in a big city

539
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,370
like Shanghai.

540
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,250
Everyone is very charming.

541
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,890
I really don’t know which one to pick.

542
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,690
Then take it easy.

543
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,170
Parking apron? Michelin?

544
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,410
Sorry.

545
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,890
So careless?

546
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,530
Come on.

547
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,010
Here you are?

548
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,170
What would you like?

549
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,210
The most expensive one for two.

550
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,570
She will pay the bill.

551
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,330
116 yuan.

552
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,250
You are a regular customer. 110 yuan is okay.

553
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,730
Turn it over and pay by scanning it.

554
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:54,570
It’s OK.

555
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,050
Well.

556
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,130
Please hold on.

557
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,690
Do we have another part?

558
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,370
Still thinking of the parking apron?

559
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,410
Let’s go.

560
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,290
We still have time.

561
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,090
No. No. No.

562
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,450
This is OK.

563
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,250
This is good.

564
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,170
A good moral.

565
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:09,970
Wealth.

566
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:10,850
Let me clean it.

567
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,970
Your rice noodles of wealth are ready.

568
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:19,570
Please enjoy.

569
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:20,690
Thank you.

570
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:21,810
Please enjoy it.

571

Have a try.

572
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,250
How is it?

573
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,450
I’ve always learnt to make it on being abroad

574
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,770
when I wanted to have Chinese food.

575
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,490
Later, I could make it almost well.

576
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,690
But I still remember

577
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,970
the rice noodles your dad made.

578
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,770
I tried many times,

579
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,890
but failed.

580
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,290
After I returned,

581
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,410
I found this restaurant unintentionally.

582
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,330
It tastes nice.

583
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,050
Of course it’s not as good as your dad’s,

584
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,090
but it’s not easy to reach this level.

585
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,170
So I take you here to try it.

586
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,970
My dad invited you to have meals

587
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,370
so that you can take care of me.

588
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,010
You were pleased with the meals.

589
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,410
But you just spared no effort to bully me.

590
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,010
You only intended to let me see the sight

591
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,810
by helping me in the matter of Kelang?

592
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,530
You want to hear the truth or lie?

593
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,010
The truth of course.

594
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,530
I intended to apologize.

595
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,490
I owe you an apology

596
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,530
about the speech.

597
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,330
How dare you mention that?

598
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,720
I was almost killed.

599
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:54,970
How can you say that lightly?

600
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,250
I know the matter of speech

601
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,210
caused serious consequences.

602
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,970
But I didn’t mean it.

603
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:07,650
Well.

604
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,010
Tell me

605
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,250
what your intention was.

606
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,730
I intended to take the love letter.

607
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,850
I didn’t expect you would

608
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,290
put it together with the speech.

609
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,090

610
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,170

Yuan Shuai, your visa formalities
have been finished.

614
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,130
I booked the airline tickets
for the day after tomorrow.

615
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,250
Mom, I don’t wanna study abroad.

616
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,010
It’s not about what you want.

617
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,730
Stop arguing about this, okay?

618
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,170
Finish the milk. Do your homework.

You called me this only once.

624

But I really like you calling me this.

625
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,450

639

Wait a moment. I’d take my speech.
