1
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,970
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,190
Episode 16

3
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,460
Is this a painting?

4
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,340
Why did you scribble on this?

5
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,340
Well...

6
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,780
Those were the marks I made during practice.

7
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,580
You’re so childish!

8
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,380
Sleep..

9
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,380
08:37 am.

10
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,060
My gosh!

11
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,660
My gosh!

12
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,290
Seriously!

13
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,700
Who’s there? Coming.

14
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,380
Your house is of poor quality. It’s leaking!

15
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,740
Leaking?

16
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,220
Hurry up.

17
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,700
Pincer pliers.

18
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,140
Do you really know how to do this?

19
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,980
Adhesive tape.

20
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,500
It’s done.

21
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,660
Thank you.

22
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,580
What’s wrong?

23
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,540
I have an upset stomach.

24
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,460
Again?

25
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,340
Are you trying to trick me
into cooking porridge and reading to you?

26
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,300
I really don’t feel well.

27
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,500
Give me some water.

28
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,180
Well.

29
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,620
I will walk you to the sofa.

30
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,740
Here.

31
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,500
But...

32
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,900
Is this

33
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,820
appendicitis?

34
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,340
It’s not that bad.

35
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,220
It’s because you don’t rest and eat on time.

36
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
Depending on medicine won’t work.

37
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,420
Get up.

38
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,940
Let’s go to the hospital.

39
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,060
I’m not going.

40
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,980
I am afraid of the pain.

41
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,060
Seriously?

42
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,660
If it is appendicitis,

43
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,100
it’s going to kill you if it’s getting worse!

44
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,660
I will ask for a leave for you.

45
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,900
No!

46
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,300
I still have important work to do.

47
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,740
I have to finish it.

48
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,820
What’s more important than your health?

49
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,940
How about this?

50
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,660
When I finish my work,

51
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,100
you send me to the hospital.

52
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,020
It’s fine. Go get dressed.

53
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,740
Let’s go to the company together.

54
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,340
I’m fine now.

55
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,420
Wait a moment.

56
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,380
Baby, the class is over?

57
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,460
Yeah, babe.

58
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,060
I have some good news.

59
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,060
I can stay with you during the winter holiday.

60
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,260
That’s great! When will you come back?

61
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Soon. I haven’t decided the specific date.

62
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,420
By the way,

63
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,500
my best friend’s husband is also
in the investment bank.

64
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,900
She got so envious

65
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,420
after hearing you’re the Executive Director of MH.

66
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,140
They would like to know you.

67
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,140
Executive Director?

68
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,900
What do you mean?

69
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,620
Yeah!

70
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,580
I’m the Executive Director.

71
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,660
I do remember it.

72
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,980
Well, baby.

73
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,860
Tell me if you come back in advance.

74
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,860
Okay, babe.

75
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,980
I’ll hang up now.

76
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,260
Love you.

77
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,740
Executive Director?

78
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,820
How can I forget it?

79
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,540
When did I brag about this?

80
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,020
Why hasn’t boss come yet?

81
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,580
Drive faster. It’s late.

82
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,820
Slow down! You’re going to tailgate!

83
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,700
You said to drive faster before,
but now you want me to slow down.

84
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,940
What do you want me to do?

85
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,100
Drive at the speed

86
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,460
you need to.

87
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,940
Do I have to teach you that?

88
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,340
I said I would drive.

89
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,420
You had to take my place.

90
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,100
Get over it.

91
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,540
How can I let a patient drive?

92
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,660
Or I would be irresponsible for others.

93
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,740
Be responsible for yourself.

94
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,940
I don’t really want to sit in your car.

95
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,100
I’m anxious!

96
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,980
So, our invincible Yuan Shuai,

97
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,100
what’s the great mission

98
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,660
that urges you to work when you’re unwell?

99
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,740
Do you remember Chenxin Technology,

100
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,860
which I told you before?

101
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,220
Yeah.

102
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,020
Their sales were poor.

103
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,380
Yet the newly-developed system
hasn’t been published.

104
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,660
People are not positive about it.

105
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,660
The leader of the project

106
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,940
is the founder of Chenxin, Doctor Zhu.

107
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,500
His team is great.

108
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,100
But the R&D needs lots of money.

109
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,540
They can’t pay their debts.

110
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,540
And the creditor doesn’t allow a loan extension.

111
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,020
So, it’s going to be purchased.

112
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,340
I want to raise money for them

113
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,900
and take back the control over the company.

114
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,340
I’ve found some potential investors.

115
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
They come to the company today.

116
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,580
So, is this the reason why

117
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,660
you don’t go to the hospital?

118
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,460
I’m positive about his project.

119
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,700
So,

120
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,820
I promised I will help him.

121
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,500
But you don’t look like

122
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,500
a man who acts impetuously.

123
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,140
He’s ready to lose everything.

124
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,180
I have every reason to help him.

125
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,180
What?

126
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,220
So, the successor of Mo-tse

127
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,180
could help the world,

128
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,140
while I’m not allowed to help someone?

129
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,620
Speak less. Rest more.

130
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,220
Your friend needs you.

131
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,900
Let’s go!

132
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,620
If I can’t persuade the new investors

133
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,740
during the meeting,

134
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,060
Chenxin will be destroyed in my hand.

135
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,940
Doctor Zhu.

136
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,060
Listen to me.

137
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,180
You’re pressuring yourself too much.

138
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,580
All of your nerves and worries
are negative energy.

139
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,580
Doctor Zhu, getting nervous

140
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,980
can’t solve any problems.

141
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,420
You have to calm down.

142
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,260
But

143
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,140
I’ll get nervous when I see many people.

144
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,020
I was the No.1 in GPA.

145
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,580
But I failed at my Graduation Thesis
Defense twice.

146
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,740
It’s because I was nervous seeing
all of them.

147
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,740
The more I think about it,
the more nervous I get.

148
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,980
Doctor Zhu.

149
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,020
Listen to me.

150
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,620
When we go to the meeting room,

151
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,380
don’t regard it as Defense or Road Show.

152
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,860
Just look at me.

153
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,180
Imagine the time

154
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,460
when you firstly introduced

155
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,260
your project to me.

156
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,340
Your status was so good.

157
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,540
You were confident, energetic

158
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
and passionate.

159
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,460
Do like that later.

160
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,980
Okay!

161
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,020
His condition is not right.

162
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,660
Yes.

163
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,620
He even asks to work when having a stomachache.

164
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,140
Work is his No.1.

165
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,180
Did he take any medicine today?

166
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,420
Anti-inflammatory, yes.

167
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,580
Pain killers, no.

168
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,780
Yeah.

169
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,180
The invincible man is also a man.

170
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,940
A man needs regular maintenance.

171
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,740
You can have two hours’ rest.

172
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,100
Now, calm yourself down.

173
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,540
Don’t be nervous.

174
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,580
Take a rest.

175
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,620
Okay?

176
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,940
Okay, I will.

177
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,500
Don’t be nervous.

178
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,780
I’ll leave now.

179
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,020
Take a good rest.

180
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,660
You can do it.

181
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,620
You...

182
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,700
Come back as soon as you can.

183
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,420
Doctor Zhu seems to be nervous.

184
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,060
It looks like he does that habitually.

185
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,260
He’s too nervous.

186
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,700
But there’s no way out.

187
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,300
He is already here.

188
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,060
It’s on him now.

189
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,700
Can you let me work on that?

190
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,820
You?

191
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,420
Okay.

192
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,820
It’s on you now.

193
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,900
Su Chang, do me a favor.

194
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,980
Thank you.

195
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,820
And lower the heat by the way.

196
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,140
Boss.

197
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,220
Why the heat?

198
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,500
In psychology,

199
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,220
lowering the temperature

200
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,620
could let people’s guard down.

201
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,260
Zhu Youyi. Zhu…

202
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,340
Hello, Doctor Zhu.

203
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,420
I’m the analyst who checks
the materials of the Road Show.

204
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,180
I’m Jiang Jun.

205
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,780
Hello.

206
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,540
March 18, 2011

207
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,940
is a Wednesday.

208
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,780
Do you remember that date?

209
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,100
I...

210
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,540
I don’t.

211
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,340
It is the day

212
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,340
when you’re awarded
the Outstanding Electrical Engineer

213
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,140
of Australian National Academy of Engineering.

214
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,020
I can’t remember the date.

215
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,100
On July 15, 2013,

216
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,300
you’re awarded the Pioneer Award

217
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,460
by the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers.

218
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,700
Is it a Wednesday, too?

219
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
What a coincidence.

220
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,860
All of them happened on Wednesday?

221
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,260
The image and video compression
technology invented by you

222
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,900
won you a big prize on Committee of 100.

223
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,500
It happened on Wednesday, too.

224
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,260
Well...

225
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,900
What day is it today?

226
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,860
Wednesday?

227
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,820
Yeah, it is.

228
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,260
It seems like Wednesday is your lucky day.

229
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,620
Yeah, the lucky day.

230
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,580
This is a cup of imported Theanine juice.

231
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,060
It helps calm you down.

232
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,300
Mr. Yuan has someone
add some traditional Chinese medicine in it.

233
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,260
You will fall asleep after finishing it.

234
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,420
But the meeting is about to begin.

235
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,700
I shouldn’t sleep.

236
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,860
No worries.

237
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,100
Time is slow.

238
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,260
It’s enough for you to take a rest.

239
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,740
Well,

240
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,300
I will check the materials for you.

241
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,420
You can take a rest.

242
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,500
Okay.

243
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
It tastes weird.

244
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,540
I turned off your cell phone, too.

245
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,740
You can take a rest now.

246
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,780
I will notify you in advance.

247
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,460
-Okay.
-I’ll go out.

248
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Is the Wednesday thing serious?

249
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,740
I lied to him.

250
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,260
I knew it.

251
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,420
He does need someone

252
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,500
to give him positive mental hints.

253
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,300
Good job.

254
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,060
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

255
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,180
I put all the fruits

256
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,420
in the juice extractor.

257
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,660
I have no idea how it tastes.

258
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,260
How can he swallow it?

259
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,460
I told him Mr. Yuan put some

260
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,860
TCM that helps sleep in the juice.

261
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,900
She did something to my hourglass, too.

262
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,140
The sand in the hourglass

263
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,820
doesn’t move at all.

264
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,140
Good job, you two!

265
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,580
There’s only one thing I care about.

266
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,300
Mr. Yuan, did you take your medicine?

267
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,500
I am now.

268
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,500
Are you going to rent this as your office?

269
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,100
Yeah.

270
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,940
This is a commercial and residential house.

271
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,700
Look.

272
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
We can work in this area.

273
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,780
When we are tired, we can go up there
to have a rest.

274
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,540
There’s a mall nearby.

275
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,180
And a subway station. It’s super convenient.

276
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,540
And we have lots of famous

277
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,620
IT companies nearby.

278
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,940
The point is...

279
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,460
Look.

280
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,460
The thing I like the most

281
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,180
is this floor.

282
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,100
Floor?

283
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,020
You do have a good taste.

284
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,420
I think the location

285
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,380
and the interior facilities are great.

286
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,260
What about the price?

287
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,380
Four yuan per square meters for a day.

288
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,940
So expensive?

289
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,340
Can you accept that, Mr. Du?

290
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,180
I don’t think the environment

291
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,260
matches with its rent.

292
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,300
Have you talked about the price?

293
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,420
Not yet.

294
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,860
I’m bad at that.

295
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,620
The three factors in a bargain.

296
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,740
Acting cute, making a comparison
and finding the flaws.

297
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,500
Hello.

298
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,420
Mr. Li. Mr. Du.

299
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,620
And this beautiful lady.

300
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,980
I’ve got the lease.

301
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,100
Are you satisfied with the house?

302
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,100
Yeah, pretty much.

303
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,700
Wait for me. I need to check the price.

304
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,900
Okay.

305
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,780
So expensive?

306
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,530
Hey,

307
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,980
we’re all college students.

308
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,860
And we’re about to start our own business.

309
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,220
We don’t have that much money.

310
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,580
Can you help us

311
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,820
and lower the price, okay?

312
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,220
Young lady.

313
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,660
You’re all going to be bosses.

314
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,140
You can’t make it difficult for a working class.

315
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,300
Again,

316
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,620
I will lose money

317
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,540
if I lower the rent.

318
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,460
To be honest,

319
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,140
we went to see the house next door.

320
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,500
It has a better location.

321
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,540
And it’s cheaper than this.

322
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,740
Without Mr. Li’s preference over this one,

323
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,700
we would have

324
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,820
rented that one.

325
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,460
Young lady, actually,

326
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,220
the house next door

327
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,700
is ours, too.

328
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,540
Please tell me who the agent is.

329
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
I will check who

330
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,300
told you the wrong price.

331
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,540
Never mind.

332
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,780
Actually, I think your house

333
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,060
has a lot of problems.

334
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,220
Mr. Du.

335
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,260
This is the best commercial

336
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,580
and residential house nearby.

337
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,620
Do tell me where the problems lie.

338
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
Like the parking space outside,

339
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,740
it’s narrow.

340
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,140
It isn’t adequate at all.

341
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,380
The mass has taken almost all the space.

342
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,540
We will solve this problem as soon as possible.

343
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,500
We will persuade the customers into
parking at the right place.

344
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,580
And

345
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,740
the property management.

346
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,220
Look at this.

347
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,460
The mop

348
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,180
is so dirty.

349
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,300
You don’t want to buy a new one?

350
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,740
It’s just the cleaning tool...

351
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,700
And...

352
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,340
And it’s leaking up there.

353
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,420
So, you know,

354
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,220
four yuan per square meters for a day

355
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,220
is too expensive.

356
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,140
Well…

357
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,620
Well...

358
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,380
No matter what,

359
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,500
you have to lower the price.

360
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,540
Yeah!

361
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,100
Please.

362
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,300
Fine, come on.

363
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,580
Let’s talk about it here. Come on.

364
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,300
This way.

365
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,220
Okay.

366
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,820
Hello.

367
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,940
Dad wants you home now.

368
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,900
I’m busy.

369
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,380
Dad is still mad at you.

370
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,380
And he knows you’re starting a business

371
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,380
with your friends.

372
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,500
If you don’t come back now,

373
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,620
you know what will happen.

374
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,300
Okay.

375
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,460
I will come back right away.

376
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,380
Xiaochuan.

377
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,300
I gotta go. You two can go on.

378
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,380
Thank you, Mr. Du.

379
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,220
Bye, Mr. Du.

380
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,620
Okay, bye.

381
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,220
He… Hello.

382
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,860
I’m one of the founders of Chenxin.

383
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,580
Not one of.

384
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,580
I’m Zhu Youyi.

385
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,020
I believe you’ve already noticed

386
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,140
the IoT assessment system

387
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,180
developed by my team

388
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,540
values 200 million yuan before it goes public.

389
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,500
What does it mean?

390
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,380
It means my R&D is valuable!

391
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,860
It’s innovative!

392
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,500
And promising!

393
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,460
I promise

394
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,940
the project will be launched

395
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,300
within two months.

396
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,660
At that time,

397
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,060
I can

398
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,420
use it in my own product.

399
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,060
I can also lower the price

400
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,540
and make it accessible to the world.

401
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,860
Then all people and enterprises

402
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,660
could purchase it and use it.

403
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,780
Please believe

404
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,220
that my team and I

405
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,020
will make it...

406
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,740
Are you okay?

407
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,980
... An important factor

408
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,660
in building the IoT social platform.

409
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,980
That’s all.

410
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,100
Please have faith in me

411
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,500
and Chenxin.

412
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,460
Please keep this project

413
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,220
alive.

414
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,060
Please!

415
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,460
Yuan Shuai, are you okay?

416
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,940
Yuan Shuai?

417
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,540
Yuan Shuai!

418
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,020
Yuan Shuai!

419
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,020
Yuan Shuai!

420
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,300
Call an ambulance!

421
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,860
Exhale.

422
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,460
Does it hurt?

423
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,740
Yeah!

424
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,060
-Here.
-Here, doctor.

425
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,300
This hurts, too.

426
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,660
Okay.

427
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,380
It hurts!

428
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,260
Get up.

429
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Come, and sit here.

430
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,340
Is it still hurting now?

431
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
Yeah!

432
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,260
Doctor.

433
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,220
Can we have the surgery today?

434
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,220
Surgery?

435
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,460
No, doctor.

436
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,460
I just need some medicine

437
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,300
and receive some conservative treatment.

438
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,180
No!

439
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,620
Only a surgery will eliminate it.

440
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,220
Listen to me first.

441
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,780
Go on, doctor.

442
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
What you have is the acute appendicitis.

443
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,940
According to the current pathological report,

444
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,340
you do need a surgery as soon as possible.

445
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,060
Okay, we will do everything you said.

446
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,580
What?

447
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,940
I won’t do it!

448
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,660
Doctor.

449
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,380
It doesn’t hurt that much anymore.

450
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,940
I think medicine is enough for me.

451
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,940
Doctor.

452
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,100
Don’t believe him.

453
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,740
It has been hurting for days.

454
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,300
My disease...

455
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,220
Young lad,

456
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
listen to me.

457
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,460
If you don’t consider a surgery now,

458
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,900
and only take medicine,

459
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,060
it’s likely to reoccur in the future.

460
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,220
And there will be more complications,

461
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,780
which make the future surgery harder.

462
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,540
Right.

463
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,020
We don’t wait. We do it now.

464
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,260
I’m not doing it.

465
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,260
You have to!

466
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,060
You’re so annoying…

467
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,860
Let’s say today!

468
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,020
Today?

469
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,300
I don’t think we can do it today.

470
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,500
Because you can’t eat food

471
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,740
in the 24 hours before the surgery.

472
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,300
Yeah, you’re right, doctor. I…

473
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,220
He can.

474
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,060
It hurts so much

475
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,100
that he hasn’t eaten from yesterday.

476
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,340
No, I can’t.

477
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,780
Young lad, you’re lucky.

478
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Your wife has considered everything for you.

479
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,260
She’s considerate.

480
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,700
I’m not...

481
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,260
Why not?

482
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,540
Are you shy?

483
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,780
You’re right, doctor.

484
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,220
She’s shy.

485
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,140
I’m not.

486
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,300
You haven’t got married?

487
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
I know.

488
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,340
She’s your girlfriend.

489
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,660
Doctor, you do know a lot.

490
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,340
When we get married, I will tell you.

491
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,380
What’re you talking about?

492
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,100
What?

493
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,540
Enough about the joke.

494
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,620
Here. Do an examination first.

495
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,380
If there’s nothing wrong,

496
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
you can do it today.

497
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
Okay, doctor.

498
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,060
Help me, honey.

499
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,380
Doctor.

500
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,180
We’re going to get

501
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,780
a premarital checkup now.

502
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,340
Premarital...?

503
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,900
Let’s go, honey.

504
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,060
Help me.

505
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,300
She’s acting like a child.

506
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,980
I’ll wait for your invitation!

507
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,180
<i>The Fifth Ward of Surgery</i>

508
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,520
That hurts!
<i>The Fifth Ward of Surgery</i>

509
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,060
That hurts!

510
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,220
Why did you say I’m your wife?

511
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,420
You were so determined to

512
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,700
make a decision for me, weren’t you?

513
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,620
Of course I need to see you as my wife.

514
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,780
Or it would be awkward.

515
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,780
That’s what comes naturally.

516
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,980
You have to sign for me anyway.

517
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,380
Why do I bother to explain so much?

518
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,660
It hurts!

519
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,140
It hurts so much.

520
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,900
Hello, we want to do an examination.

521
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,900
Which one is the patient?

522
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,100
Me.

523
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,900
Go change your clothes with me.

524
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,020
And your family should pay the bill
on the third floor.

525
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,060
The family should pay the bill.

526
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,140
Did you hear that?

527
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,900
Go, honey.

528
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,460
Where are you going?

529
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,020
Is our invincible boss being nervous?

530
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,580
It’s just a surgery.

531
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,180
Why would I be nervous?

532
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,180
You’re underestimating me.

533
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,140
Jiang Jun.

534
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,220
I will go in soon.

535
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,340
Yeah.

536
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,740
What do you think we’re doing here?

537
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,620
Play a game?

538
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,700
You know, the surgery

539
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,380
is risky.

540
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,660
But I think doctors can

541
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,220
do this surgery

542
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,300
with their eyes closed.

543
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,140
It at least is a surgery!

544
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,980
Can you be serious?

545
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,420
I am comforting you already!

546
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,660
You won’t understand

547
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,540
how I feel being sent to the operating room.

548
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,780
No worries.

549
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,060
I will pray for you out there.

550
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,460
Jiang Jun,

551
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,860
if my eyes were closed

552
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,180
when I come out,

553
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,820
please remember to

554
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,740
call my parents.

555
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,500
They’re easy to be found since their numbers
are in my phone.

556
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,420
If you can’t reach them,

557
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,260
call Li Xiaochuan.

558
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,580
And,

559
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,940
remember to feed Wealth for me.

560
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,540
If you want,

561
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,500
he can become your family.

562
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
He will be named

563
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,220
Wealth Jiang.

564
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,260
Then do you want to tell me all of your passwords

565
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
of bank accounts?

566
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,460
What else do you want to say?

567
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,140
Do it now, Wealth Yuan.

568
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,220
I don’t care.

569
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,060
You have to be there

570
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,660
when I’m done.

571
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,340
The first person I want to see is you.

572
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,580
Okay, I got it.

573
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,780
Rest assured.

574
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,980
You have to be there for me.

575
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,620
Excuse me, I’m sending the patient
to the operating room.

576
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,900
Wait!

577
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,460
I have one last question.

578
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,660
I loved you!

579
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,460
Lie down. Come on.

580
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,140
Go.

581
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,540
Go now.

582
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,620
Wait for me.

583
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,540
I got it.

584
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,300
Remember to wait for me.

585
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,100
My password is 12345678.

586
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,700
Get over it!

587
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,900
It’s true.

588
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,420
Dad.

589
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,100
Retreat without fighting for it.

590
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,500
Is it your attitude or your strategy?

591
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,940
How do you expect me to answer this?

592
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,940
Do you know why I

593
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,980
like trimming the bonsai so much,

594
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,620
Du Lei?

595
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,980
To trim a bonsai

596
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,300
with the viewing value,

597
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,540
you have to cut off some
extra branches and leaves.

598
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,860
In this way,

599
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,980
you can make a perfect artwork.

600
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,260
Likewise,

601
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,980
I have cultivated you carefully

602
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,780
and been strict at you for so many years.

603
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,380
But now I suddenly found

604
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,460
you’ve grown up.

605
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,780
You want to fly yourself.

606
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,140
I’m a human being,

607
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,140
not a bonsai.

608
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,700
Let alone the perfect artwork

609
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,780
mentioned by you just now.

610
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,260
Great!

611
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,140
My son.

612
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,900
Now I found we haven’t

613
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,340
talked to each other so honestly before.

614
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,740
With your sister’s presence,

615
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,740
I hope you can tell me your dissatisfaction

616
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,420
about me frankly.

617
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,900
Go on.

618
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,900
From today on,

619
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,300
I will be myself.

620
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,460
Be yourself?

621
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
My son.

622
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,900
I didn’t expect you to be so naive

623
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,980
since you’re already an adult.

624
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,820
Do you think you have achieved all this

625
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,260
on your own?

626
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,500
Ask your sister.

627
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,980
She knows better of it.

628
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,460
Without me…

629
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,540
You!

630
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,620
You!

631
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,700
You are nothing!

632
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,580
I’ve had enough being a substitute!

633
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,780
Okay.

634
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
You’ve had enough, right?

635
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,420
Do you have any idea

636
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,460
you will pay the price

637
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,860
by betraying me?

638
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,180
I can help you with that.

639
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,380
But I can also

640
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,260
destroy you

641
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,460
like killing an ant!

642
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,580
How?

643
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,620
I bet you will

644
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,180
take back all you gave me.

645
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,660
Wealth.

646
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,100
Status.

647
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,420
Reputation.

648
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,140
I can give them back to you.

649
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,260
Including the name of that dead kid!

650
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,780
-I can give back that name as well!
-You!

651
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,660
You!

652
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,380
How can you speak to dad like that?

653
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,820
Dad!

654
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,620
Dad! Dad!

655
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,620
Get out.

656
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,580
Dad!

657
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,540
Get out!

658
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,300
Get out!

659
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,940
Get out!

660
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,900
Get out!

661
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,020
I’ll get him back.

662
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,260
Don’t be angry.

663
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,340
Ignore him.

664
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,740
Tell him to get away.

665
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,580
Wait.

666
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,820
Du!

667
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,900
Wait!

668
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,700
Do you know what you were talking about?

669
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,980
Dad said that for your good!

670
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,580
For my good?

671
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,620
He planned my life step by step.

672
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,060
He told you to instill in me

673
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,580
his so-called way of survival.

674
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,340
I can’t have my own emotions.

675
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,860
I can’t have my own sentiments.

676
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,620
Since my childhood,

677
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,660
I’ve been like a puppet
whose soul has been taken away!

678
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,060
That’s “for my good”?!

679
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,860
I actually envied you when I was little.

680
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,780
It’s true.

681
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,580
You can act freely

682
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,060
and do whatever you want.

683
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,340
So,

684
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,260
I tried so hard to become you.

685
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,780
But after I did it,

686
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,820
I found that’s not what I want.

687
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,020
We’re born to be different.

688
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,340
Your last name is Du.

689
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,460
But mine isn’t.

690
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,700
Du.

691
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,940
Sister,

692
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,700
do you still remember what my name is?

693
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,820
It’s okay.

694
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,180
I forgot it as well.

695
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,680
<i>In Operation</i>

696
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,350
<i>Operating Room</i>

697
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,850
Hello.

698
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,660
How long will he wake up?

699
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,890
It takes two hours normally.

700
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,100
But it may be longer for your boyfriend.

701
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,100
He’s so scared.

702
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,900
He asked for a general anesthesia.

703
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,700
It may take him four to five hours.

704
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,180
Is he...?

705
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,020
Never mind. Thank you.

706
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
But...

707
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,780
Aren’t you invincible?

708
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,220
Now you’re defeated by the appendicitis

709
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,420
and lying there.

710
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,980
Your physical health sucks.

711
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,100
You have to eat on time.

712
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,580
Your health is everything.

713
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,660
Alright,

714
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,660
now you can only

715
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,020
lie here quietly and be a beautiful man.

716
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,940
Now that I look at you carefully,

717
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,900
you really have a high nose bridge.

718
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,180
When I was little,

719
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,700
why didn’t I find that you look pretty?

720
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,460
The face is as small as my palm.

721
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,820
This is so unfair.

722
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,300
You know, you’re so mild

723
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,500
when you are quiet,

724
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,820
are not angry and don’t bicker.

725
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,420
Why do you like to pull a long face?

726
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,140
Isn’t it nice to be harmonious?

727
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,180
But it’s so hard

728
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,380
to see you to be quiet and obedient like now.

729
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,740
From now on,

730
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,060
you need to eat on time and can’t stay up late.

731
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,580
Listen to Jiang Jun.

732
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,500
A consent reached.

733
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,740
Sealed.

734
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,380
My biggest regret is that

735
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,100
I didn’t get to meet my dad

736
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,980
before he passed away.

737
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,260
Yixianqian Noodles, founded by my father,

738
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
suffered a hostile takeover.

739
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,740
He was busy with the company,

740
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,140
and hadn’t slept for days.

741
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,060
He passed away

742
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,260
when he had a recurrence of an old illness.

743
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,580
It was late after I ran over from school.

744
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,500
Be yourself?

745
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,620
Do you think you have achieved all this

746
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,740
on your own?

747
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,860
Ask your sister.

748
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,780
She knows better of it.

749
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,060
Without me…

750
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,100
You!

751
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,180
You!

752
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,340
You are nothing!

753
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,740
It’s here.

754
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,940
Mr. Du.

755
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,420
Are you sure he was born

756
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,220
at 6:15 am, December 10?

757
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,460
Yes.

758
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,240
<i>BIRTH CERTIFICATE</i>

759
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,740

00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,100
-What’s your name?
-Speak.

761
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,060

00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,380
Come here.

763
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,180
Go. Go.

764
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,100
Kid.

765
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,980
Remember.

766
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,820
Your name is Du Lei!

767
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,660
And you’re my biological son!

768
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,220
Remember that?

769
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,140
Do you know that?

770
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,820
My son,

771
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,860
welcome back.

772
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,180
I just hope you can remember one thing.

773
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,820
From today on,

774
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,220
get rid of all your old stuff

775
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
and memory.

776
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
Okay?

777
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,460
Do you understand that?

778
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,780
You don’t understand either?!

779
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,540
Come back. Come back.
