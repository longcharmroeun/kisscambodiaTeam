1
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 11

3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,039
Tang Xin dropped the case herself.

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,479
Do you have any evidence?

5
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,759
Do you have

6
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,759
evidence?

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I can prove that.

8
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,560
Mr. Fan.

9
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,880
You’ve been through a lot.

10
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,200
As a temporary

11
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
CEO,

12
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,840
I’d like to extend my gratitude

13
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,079
to you for your trust.

14
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
But this time...

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,200
Wan Shan’s personal behavior

16
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,520
can’t decide the direction of our business.

17
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,560
I

18
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,600
will show Wanxing Entertainment’s

19
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,040
resolution to maintain the order

20
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,880
of this industry

21
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
to everyone as soon as possible.

22
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,440
Yuan Shuai and Jiang Jun

23
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,760
did a lot to dismiss Wan Shan.

24
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,680
Sure,

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,560
I also need extend my gratitude to Mr. Luo.

26
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,880
Mr. Fan, goodbye.

27
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,480
Okay.

28
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,600
You punk.

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
I thought you were screwed.

30
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,200
I was thinking about how to
fix it for you.

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,920
What a day!

32
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,520
But it turned out right.

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,040
Hear, hear,

34
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,520
when did I let you down, Mr. Fan?

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,560
This is Jiang Jun that you told me, right?

36
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,720
You did well today.

37
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,120
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,040
Wan Shan must have been helped
by someone.

39
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,680
Or he couldn’t have

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,520
responded so quickly by himself.

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,640
Even if he was assisted by someone,

42
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,200
the good would triumph over evil ultimately.

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,640
He’s just humiliating himself.

44
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
But Mr. Fan,

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
to compensate what we went through,

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,640
you have to give us some reward.

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
You punk.

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,600
Don’t worry about that.

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,760
Oh, yeah.

50
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,040
I have an appointment.

51
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,880
I need to go now.

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,510
Okay.

53
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,160
Mr. Fan, bye.

54
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,040
Mr. Fan, bye.

55
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,280
You did well this time.

56
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,480
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,080
Shouldn’t you buy me a coffee?

58
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,680
Jiang Jun.

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,920
Thank you.

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,280
Thank you, too.

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,520
I thought you wouldn’t come.

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
I came here because of you.

63
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,240
You don’t want to let
those who believe me down.

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,159
Although nothing changed

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,520
after I made this step,

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,800
I still want to

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,159
help those girls who

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,960
are troubled like me.

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,360
You did well.

70
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,800
I told you.

71
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,640
Don’t get hurt by your own knife.

72
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,840
You’re too presumptuous.

73
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,640
No matter I succeed or fail,

74
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,960
it’s my choice.

75
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
I will take all the consequence.

76
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Take all the consequence?

77
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,800
On what?

78
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
Your passion?

79
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,480
Yuan Shuai has become the one
you can’t defeat.

80
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,480
You have to listen to me.

81
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Come back.

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,200
There’s a lot of work to do.

83
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,200
Only GE and I could help you
defeat him.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,720
It’s my own business.

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
If you still think I’m the kid

86
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,080
who can’t do anything without you,

87
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,960
I will leave GE.

88
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,160
I’ve got work to do.

89
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,040
Gotta go.

90
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,880
Here.

91
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,920
Tang Xin is so unlucky,

92
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
meeting a bad guy right after
she graduated.

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,960
I believe Wan Shan

94
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,560
will be punished by law this time.

95
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,320
After the application

96
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,120
of IPO,

97
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,040
can I have a good sleep?

98
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Sleep? You can.

99
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,320
You can also take a leave.

100
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,920
But before that,

101
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,920
you should reexamine yourself.

102
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,440
What mistake did you make

103
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
in this case?

104
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,440
I know.

105
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
MH almost lost a big client because of me.

106
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
It’s more than that.

107
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,600
Seriously?

108
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,640
Are you going to record a demerit again?

109
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,400
I have only been happy for like 3 seconds.

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
Now you’re reexamining my mistakes.

111
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,640
It’s right you upheld justice for Tang Xin.

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,560
You have a strong sense of justice.

113
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,920
But this is not like that.

114
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,760
How could you secretly went there
recording a video?

115
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,200
Do you know how dangerous that was?

116
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,880
You rejected me at first.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,280
I had to go there alone.

118
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,760
The reason why I didn’t tell you is

119
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,280
because I don’t want you
get involved in this.

120
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,840
You know Wan Shan is a bad guy.

121
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,120
So, you mean

122
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,560
you believed me

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
at first.

124
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,760
I...

125
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,400
Of course I know

126
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,480
there’s something wrong with Wan Shan.

127
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,640
You’re bragging.

128
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,600
You...

129
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,960
You just can’t

130
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,000
think it straight, can you?

131
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
You’re unreliable.

132
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,440
You just want to pick gold coins

133
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,030
carrying a box behind me, right?

134
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
You know

135
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,000
carrying a box?

136
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,360
Well...

137
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,240
I heard a story

138
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,840
about carrying a box of money two days ago.

139
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,120
I was inspired.

140
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
What sound is that?

141
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,000
The sound of SOS.

142
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
I didn’t sleep yesterday night.

143
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
I didn’t eat today.

144
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,560
I finally know what being a workaholic
is like.

145
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,440
Since my employee is working so hard,

146
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,960
I should treat you as your boss.

147
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,120
Name it.

148
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,200
What do you want to eat?

149
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,560
Really?

150
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,920
I can eat a bull now.

151
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,480
But only delivery food is available now.

152
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,200
How about this?

153
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,280
Let’s go to my place.

154
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,880
What do you want to do?

155
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
What do I want to do?

156
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,760
It’s time to show my real technique.

157
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,240
What technique?

158
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,800
Cooking.

159
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,800
You even know how to cook?

160
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,840
I found two movie tickets by accident.

161
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,640
Are they yours, Xiaochuan?

162
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,600
No.

163
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Li Xiaochuan.

164
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
I have two movie tickets.

165
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
I heard it’s a good movie.

166
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,000
I want to ask you for a movie.

167
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,520
Do you have time?

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I’ve seen it.

169
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,320
Okay.

170
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,800
Okay.

171
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,200
I shall decide my own destiny.

172
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,720
I have to ask you out anyway.

173
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,800
Come on!

174
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,400
Honey.

175
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,480
What’re you doing?

176
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,480
I heard there’s a horror movie lately.

177
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,480
Are you available?

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,240
Why does he ignore me?

179
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,600
Is there a girl around you?

180
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,560
Yeah.

181
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,520
There’s a worker in the convenience store.

182
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,680
Do you think she’s pretty?

183
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
It’s you, right?

184
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,200
I...

185
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I...

186
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,440
I want you to see the difference

187
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,680
between a real man and AI technology.

188
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,920
Like Turing Test?

189
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,320
What test?

190
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,120
Do you know

191
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,920
how did the term for “AI”
come into being?

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,360
Turing had a theory...

193
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,720
...Be upgraded into AI.

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,720
So...

195
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,480
This is a good idea.

196
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,480
Gosh,

197
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,040
a geek is so different

198
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,920
from normal people.

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,440
Why did it take she so long?

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,080
Is she wearing a night gown?

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
I would lose face if I open it too soon.

202
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,720
One, two, three. Coming.

203
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,920
Come in.

204
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,480
What took you so long?

205
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,600
I’ve brought all the food

206
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,840
I have.

207
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,360
Seriously?

208
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,440
You don’t need to bring gifts.

209
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,200
It’s nothing.

210
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,480
I hope you can use some of it.

211
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
No, no.

212
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,160
It’s the thought that counts.

213
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,960
I, Yuan Shuai,

214
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,840
have always attached importance to

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
those who send me gifts.

216
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,240
You have my respect.

217
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,160
These are all snacks.

218
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,760
Ms. Jiang.

219
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,800
This is our glee feast.

220
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,280
This?

221
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,880
Seriously?

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,040
The most important thing

223
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,840
in life is to be happy.

224
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
Are you hungry?

225
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,080
I will cook some noodles for you.

226
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,360
We can eat whatever we have today

227
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,360
and dine out later.

228
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,520
Enough.

229
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,480
Just wait there

230
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,400
for my food.

231
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,400
Are you cooking?

232
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,640
You really know how to cook?

233
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,480
Your smell’s so great.

234
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,960
You’re so cute.

235
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,200
It will be finished in a minute.

236
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,840
Okay.

237
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Here they are.

238
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
They are still kept by him.

239
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,480
Yeah.

240
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,160
I’m the owner.

241
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
I should be responsible for it.

242
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
Why did you paint on it?

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,640
Well,

244
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,600
it’s the mark I made during the practice.

245
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,920
You haven’t changed a bit

246
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
for all these years.

247
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,440
You did not progress at all.

248
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,560
You tell me.

249
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,840
If it weren’t you,

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,280
who made a story and took my stuff,

251
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,680
I should have been able to

252
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,360
join in an international match.

253
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,360
It’s hard to say.

254
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Sometimes, you can’t learn to be talented.

255
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,280
But...

256
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,480
Given that you’re the old owner,

257
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,600
I can teach you something.

258
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,400
Look.

259
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,120
When you solve a magic cube,

260
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,880
you have to put back one face.

261
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,200
For example, you can put back
all the yellows together.

262
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,800
You have to get a cross

263
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,880
first.

264
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,280
How?

265
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,400
Find the piece in the center.

266
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,560
Turn in up there.

267
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,310
It’s done.

268
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,589
This is how it works.

269
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,280
Take it back home and do it yourself.

270
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,440
I’ll keep working on my noodles.

271
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,480
Wash your hands and be ready to eat.

272
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,320
Okay.

273
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,200
I can’t believe you cooked

274
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,120
a table of food.

275
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,440
If you don’t want to starve yourself abroad,

276
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,920
you have to learn how to cook.

277
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,560
Give me the wine glass.

278
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Be gentle!

279
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
They’re just glasses.

280
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Two thousand dollars each.

281
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,240
From Switzerland.

282
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,120
Seriously? So expensive.

283
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,760
Seriously?

284
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,240
Take a bite.

285
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,600
It’s delicious.

286
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,040
Right?

287
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,800
This is delicious, too.

288
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,360
Enjoy it.

289
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,920
Even the dog knows the manner.

290
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,600
You like to teach others, right?

291
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
You were so determined

292
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,080
about wearing the red polo to school.

293
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,160
I did not give a negative comment.

294
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,480
What was I wearing?

295
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,680
I do not remember that.
I didn’t do that.

296
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,560
Even if you’re Mr. Yuan of MH now,

297
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,880
you can’t erase the history.

298
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,320
Listen.

299
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
If you make it hard for me,

300
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,880
I will reveal

301
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,440
what you did at that time.

302
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:05,920
Jiang Jun!

303
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,120
I still remember

304
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,760
you, now a well-dressed
Mr. Yuan of MH,

305
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,680
were mad about the chubby girl

306
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,920
because of a braised pork feet

307
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,520
that year.

308
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,400
Eat your eggplant.

309
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,120
Eat it!

310
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,440
It’ll fill your mouth.

311
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,760
You’re being talkative.

312
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,560
Smells good.

313
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,540
[Du Lei]

314
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,600
Are you available?

315
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,720
Work?

316
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,600
A scam phone call.

317
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,280
Try this! It’s so delicious.

318
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,400
Yeah?

319
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,560
Of course, I cooked it.

320
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,520
Good?

322
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,320
Eat.

323
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,400
Good?

324
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,360
Do you dare to eat this?

325
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,840
Try it.

326
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,920
It’s a pity.

327
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,360
So close.

328
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,400
It doesn’t matter.

329
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,840
It’s not important.

330
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,880
What do you feel being the adviser to Wan Shan?

331
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,640
I should have thought of it.

332
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,400
If it weren’t you,

333
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,680
Jiang Jun wouldn’t have been so impulsive.

334
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,720
Going there for Tang Xin without me.

335
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,920
She trusted you

336
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,560
and saw you as her true friend.

337
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
But you used her to deal with me.

338
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,440
Are you that afraid that you would lose to me?

339
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,560
Mr. Yuan,

340
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,200
I’m flattered.

341
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,560
I already resigned.

342
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,920
You came here just to tell me this?

343
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,560
Not exactly.

344
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,480
I want to

345
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,160
practice racing with you.

346
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,560
Also,

347
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,160
I want to tell you

348
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,920
I can take a step back

349
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,520
sometimes.

350
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,240
But I can’t

351
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,240
on something particular.

352
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,160
What do you mean?

353
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,880
She sent this to me.

354
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
You saw this, too.

355
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,600
Jiang Jun.

356
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,240
She’s a good girl.

357
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,480
I promised her.

358
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,560
Du Lei.

359
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,160
I’m warning you.

360
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,560
Stay away from her.

361
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
I said

362
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,240
I can take a step back sometimes.

363
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But I can’t

364
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,400
on something particular.

365
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,400
Funny.

366
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,160
You want me to ask Li Xiaochuan for a movie?

367
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,880
Seriously,

368
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,840
I’ve tried everything,

369
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,720
and used all my brain.

370
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,680
It just doesn’t work.

371
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,920
So,

372
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,760
I can only turn to you now.

373
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,680
There’s no point in it.

374
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,560
I don’t know him that well.

375
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,280
It’s okay.

376
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,360
I already made an excuse for you.

377
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,200
He fixed your phone before.

378
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
You can use that

379
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,080
and tell him you want to thank him,

380
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,160
and ask him to go to a movie.

381
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,760
Then, you can take me with you.

382
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
But it was Yuan Shuai who asked him for a favor.

383
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,480
Jiang Jun, you’re so kind, lovely and beautiful.

384
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,320
It’s huge to me.

385
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,360
You’re the only one there for me.

386
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,800
Please. Okay?

387
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,600
Fine, I will do it for you.

388
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,560
Really?

389
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,080
What’re you doing?

390
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,600
You’re back.

391
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,400
What’re you doing here?

392
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,080
I...

393
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,120
I brought some food

394
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,000
for you.

395
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,160
That’s all?

396
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Nothing else?

397
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,440
I want to ask Li Xiaochuan
to see a movie.

398
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,480
Li Xiaochuan?

399
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,320
It’s the expert you told me to look for.

400
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,680
He’s been using the Wi-Fi

401
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,640
in the convenience store
in our apartment blocks.

402
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,040
Li was so attracted to him.

403
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,240
Wi-Fi?

404
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,480
Convenience store?

405
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,720
He...

406
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
Why are you so surprised?

407
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,640
No wonder he came back so fast

408
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,720
when I asked him to return for the phone.

409
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,360
Wait.

410
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
Why are you asking him for a movie?

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,240
What’s going on between you two?

412
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,240
I...

413
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
It’s not me.

414
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,160
It’s Li who wants to see him.

415
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,160
I’m trying to help her.

416
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,560
I only saw him once.

417
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,840
How could I do that since we’re not familiar?

418
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
I was thinking

419
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,800
you asked him a favor once.

420
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,960
You should be familiar with each other.

421
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,040
Li Xiaochuan and I?

422
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,040
Yeah, we’re close.

423
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,760
Never mind.

424
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,600
You won’t make it.

425
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,960
I can make it within one call.

426
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,000
He must come if I ask him.

427
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,640
Really?

428
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,560
Never mind.

429
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,880
Okay! Please!

430
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah?

431
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,200
Yeah!

432
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,880
Four tickets.

433
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,960
Four? Why?

434
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,760
I can buy five tickets if you help me!

435
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,000
Five!

436
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,920
I just need four.

437
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,200
Deal.

438
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,240
Deal.

439
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,760
Li Xiaochuan. Xu Li.

440
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,800
Love you.

441
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,000
I will get dressed

442
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,200
and go see Li Xiaochuan.

443
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,160
Does this look pretty?

444
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,320
Yeah.

445
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,800
The dress?

446
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,800
No.

447
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,880
How about the trousers?

448
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,640
You’re a fairy lady.

449
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,080
Your mouth is so sweet.

450
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,480
What about this? Look.

451
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,880
It’s so pretty.

452
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,400
You said pretty for every piece.

453
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,120
Which will make me the prettiest?

454
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,600
Today is important.

455
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,400
I know.

456
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,960
You’ve been standing in front of
a mirror for 3 hours.

457
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,320
Do you want the truth?

458
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,880
Give me that.

459
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,680
This piece makes you prettiest.
Seriously.

460
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,360
Really?

461
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,360
I’m wearing this then.

462
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,960
You see, it’s pretty and lovely.

463
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,520
Xiaochuan will like it.

464
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,120
Why is your face so dry?
Didn’t you wash your face?

465
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,280
I was thinking about the date today.

466
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,400
I didn’t sleep.

467
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,560
Seriously?

468
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Here.

469
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Wear a face mask and moisturize your face.

470
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,960
The movie is about to begin.

471
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,080
Yeah.

472
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,840
I should moisturize my face
before doing the makeup.

473
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,840
Thank you, my best friend.

474
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,360
I’ll get going.

475
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,960
I’ll hold it.

476
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,040
Want to eat it?

477
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,000
Is Xiaochuan still coming?

478
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,720
Don’t worry.

479
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,520
He won’t be late.

480
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,000
Brother.

481
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,320
He’s here.

482
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200
Brother?

483
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,960
Half brother?

484
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,640
They don’t look alike.

485
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,880
I’m his cousin.

486
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,120
He’s younger than me.

487
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,480
We’re cousins.

488
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,600
You...

489
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,080
No wonder you came to my place
to get your phone

490
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,640
so fast last time.

491
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,400
Didn’t you come back for study?

492
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,320
What’re doing everyday?

493
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,040
Why haven’t you come up and say hi

494
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,640
since you’re in my apartment blocks?

495
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you know

496
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,560
there’s optical network where you live?

497
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,600
The network speed is so fast.

498
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,720
I went there

499
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,040
because the network speed at my school
is so slow.

500
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,880
Why don’t you just come to my house?

501
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,120
Why should I hurt myself?

502
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,160
What?

503
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,520
I’m afraid I would interfere you.

504
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
If you want to use the network,

505
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,000
just come to me.

506
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,840
Did you copy that?

507
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,400
Yes, brother.

508
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,520
Such a manipulative bother.

509
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,600
The movie is about to begin in 2 minutes.

510
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,120
Let’s go.

511
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:07,920
Yeah.

512
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,720
I bought movie tickets for you.

513
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,840
This is yours.

514
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,680
This is yours.

515
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,880
Thank you.

516
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,760
Well,

517
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,280
aren’t we in the same hall?

518
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,200
Jiang Jun,

519
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,880
didn’t you say you want to watch this movie?

520
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,000
I forgot to tell you.

521
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,960
For the triumph,

522
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,920
I bought tickets for two movies.

523
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,480
Take care.

524
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,720
Yours is about to start.
Go in now.

525
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,720
Hurry.

526
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,640
You’re really...

527
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,560
You do know me well.

528
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,200
Let’s go.

529
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,640
So, we’re watching this?

530
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,200
Why?

531
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Do you have a problem?

532
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,680
Watch your movie carefully.
You two.

533
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,760
Let’s go.

534
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,920
Why?

535
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,720
Nothing.

536
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,680
I’m fine.

537
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,840
This... This is mine.

538
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:28,960
Mine.

539
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,640
He avoided it successfully every time.

540
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,440
Did he do it on purpose?

541
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,680
Never mind. I will do it one more time.

542
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,520
I’m scared.

543
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,440
I’m so scared.

544
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,760
Well...

545
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,400
If you’re scared,

546
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,680
you can

547
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,160
wait outside.

548
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
I want to finish it.

549
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,360
There was a goat.

550
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,840
He’s counting among a crowd of goats.

551
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,160
One, two,

552
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,440
three...

553
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,560
Finally he went asleep by counting numbers.

554
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,760
Hey,

555
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,000
can you lower your voice?

556
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,880
We’re trying to watch a movie.

557
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,040
If you puckered your lips more,

558
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,200
I can place the cola on them.

559
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,360
Has it passed?

560
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,760
Not yet.

561
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,520
I can’t watch this kind of thing

562
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,520
about parents.

563
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,760
I just can’t hold my tears back.

564
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,480
Close your eyes.

565
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
The trick you played when we were little

566
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,800
was so effective.

567
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,720
It’s still working.

568
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,320
Thinking about it,

569
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,800
I haven’t come to theaters for a while now.

570
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,320
Why?

571
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,840
Because Li cried so bad every time

572
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,560
and she can’t console me.

573
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,670
I can watch movies with you

574
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,920
later.

575
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,920
Okay.

576
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,670
But you can’t charge me.

577
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,320
Okay.

578
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,150
And you can’t ask me to buy you popcorn.

579
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,150
Okay.

580
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,880
Suddenly you’re so nice.

581
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,560
Am I being mean now?

582
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,480
Fine, the tickets are on me.

583
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,190
Okay.

584
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
Sir. Ma’am.

585
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,200
Can you play the show at home?

586
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
I’ve been here for 10 minutes.

587
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,120
My movie is about to start.

588
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,960
I’m sorry.

589
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,960
You look like Luo Yunxi.
He’s so handsome.

590
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,800
It’s a steal! Ma’am.

591
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,960
Ma’am?

592
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,920
Girl, see me clearly.

593
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,040
I look like Bai Lu.

594
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,280
You know Bai Lu?

595
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,280
Ma’am!

596
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,600
-Sir!
-Ma’am!

597
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,200
Ma’am!

598
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,760
Sir!

599
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,160
Ma’am!

600
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,760
Sir!

601
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,960
Eat your popcorn.

602
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,160
Wealth,

603
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,320
you’re here.

604
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,960
Why are you looking at me in wonder?

605
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,720
Look at me.

606
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,080
You don’t believe?

607
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,000
I’m telling you.

608
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,720
She will show up definitely.

609
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,080
You see?

610
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,040
Mr. Yuan,

611
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,640
are you posing for the magazine cover?

612
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,920
Wrong. I’m acting a painting

613
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,880
by Van Gogh.

614
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,800
The Drinkers.

615
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,960
It has another name - The Drunk.

616
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,160
But,

617
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,960
did you solve the magic cube?

618
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,600
Don’t force yourself if you can’t.

619
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,160
You can turn to its owner.

620
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,440
It’s not that difficult.

621
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,680
Don’t look down upon me.

622
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,280
I’m so close to success.

623
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,520
Didn’t you look for the formula?

624
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,840
I won’t. I will solve it myself.

625
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,800
Wait and see.

626
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,400
I don’t believe you can make it

627
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,320
if you don’t use the formula.

628
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
Don’t you dare to throw stuff to my house!

629
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,720
Don’t you dare!

630
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,240
Jiang Jun.

631
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,750
Coming.

632
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,630
Ms. Jiang, hello.

633
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,670
I’m from the Property Management.

634
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:27,750
As for the water supply shutdown incident
last time,

635
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,070
we didn’t top up for you in time.

636
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,470
We’re so sorry for the inconvenience.

637
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,510
Our leaders sent me to

638
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,110
bring you some gift.

639
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,750
Thank you.

640
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,470
Yeah,

641
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,190
if you have any problems from now on,

642
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,150
you can turn to the house owner.

643
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,510
He can top up for you any minute.

644
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,070
But I don’t know him.

645
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,270
Really?

646
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,030
You’ve lived here for a long time.

647
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,590
You haven’t seen him?
Your rooms face each other.

648
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,470
Room 701?

649
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,110
Yeah, he’s Mr. Yuan, Yuan Shuai.

650
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,070
He’s very nice.

651
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,110
[Pingmen Second Village]

652
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,550
I win by one’s own draw!
[Pingmen Second Village]

653
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:01,670
[Pingmen Second Village]

654
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,310
All of the same suit?
[Pingmen Second Village]

655
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:03,490
[Pingmen Second Village]

656
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,350
Why have you won all the time?

657
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,950
You’re so lucky.

658
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,990
I’m not lucky as you.

659
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,790
You earn a lot from

660
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,830
the room you rent out on the 3rd floor.

661
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,030
And he basically doesn’t live in it.

662
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,430
You’re free from worry.

663
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,070
You don’t say.

664
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,750
I’ve checked it.

665
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,110
Since he paid the rent,

666
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,670
he hasn’t lived in it yet.

667
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,110
So,

668
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,750
I want to rent it out to someone else.

669
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,510
Yeah, I can earn more money.

670
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,390
Ms. Zhang.

671
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,070
You’re here.

672
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,830
Long time no see.

673
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,270
Long time no see.

674
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,550
Hey,

675
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,950
play one turn for me.

676
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,430
It’s been a long time.

677
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,590
I want to check on you.

678
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,750
Where’s your son?

679
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,910
And your daughter-in-law?

680
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,350
My son?

681
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,390
That punk said to me

682
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,870
life is all about fighting for a life career.

683
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,430
I left the house to him.

684
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,510
But he doesn’t live in it.

685
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,790
So, I have to rent it out.

686
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,630
Really?

687
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,670
I have a friend who wants to rent a house.

688
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,950
Ms. Zhang, how much do you charge?

689
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:07,870
Really?

690
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,790
That’s easy.

691
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,030
I hope it’s a good lessee.

692
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,150
How’s him?

693
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,270
An elite working for Investment Banks.
And he’s single.

694
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,430
He has no bad habits as well.

695
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,790
That’s too good

696
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,550
to believe.

697
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,910
You can meet him.

698
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,590
Look,

699
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,430
I have a photo of him. You can take a look.

700
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,550
Good.

701
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,790
Here.

702
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,910
He...

703
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,030
He...

704
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,470
What’s wrong?

705
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,550
He’s ostentatious.

706
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,390
I want to rent it to those who’re unpretentious.

707
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,670
Ostentatious? Let me see.

708
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,310
Don’t.

709
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,510
Isn’t this man

710
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,350
who rented your house?

711
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,270
Why’re you everywhere?

712
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,750
Go play mahjong.

713
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,950
I’m sorry.

714
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,070
So, your lessee’s name is Yuan Shuai.

715
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,910
Well,

716
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,270
why do you ask me since you knew it?

717
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,830
It will hurt our relationship.

718
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,310
I’m just joking.

719
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,990
Since I took his rent,

720
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,110
how would I rent it to someone else?

721
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,110
Right?

722
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,710
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

723
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,510
I should leave now.

724
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,270
Okay.

725
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,550
Come here often.

726
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,630
Ms. Zhang! Ms. Zhang.

727
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,510
See you.

728
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,550
Go wash your clothes.

729
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,670
I’m here. Go now.

730
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,510
A good tile!

731
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:34,750
Go on.

732
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,910
It’s my turn.

733
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,510
It’s my turn.

734
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,950
Yuan Shuai, wait and see.

735
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,230
Boss.

736
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,430
Did you see what I sent you?

737
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,590
You thought right.

738
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,070
Du Lei was part of this.

739
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,550
They have called each other many times.

740
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,390
I knew it’s him.

741
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,310
And there’s one thing else.

742
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,310
Mr. Luo sent a letter of appreciation
to the headquarters.

743
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,830
He praises you and Jiang Jun.

744
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,870
It will be released officially soon.

745
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,110
And Jiang Jun will become a full member
in advance.

746
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,350
Are you happy?

747
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,990
Why should I be happy?

748
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,430
It’s her who should be happy.

749
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,110
Everybody, stop what you’re doing.

750
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,470
I have an announcement.

751
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,830
Mr. Luo from Wanxing Entertainment
wrote a letter of appreciation.

752
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,590
He highly appreciated MH.

753
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,510
Of course,

754
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,510
Mr. Yuan contributed to it a lot.

755
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,950
And we have a coworker who did great.

756
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,710
Jiang Jun,

757
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,550
due to your excellent performance,

758
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,870
you have become a full member of us

759
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,110
ahead of time.

760
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,910
You will keep following

761
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,550
Wanxing’s case.

762
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,830
Congratulations!

763
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,750
Welcome to MH.

764
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:11,910
Thank you.

765
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,350
I’ll keep working hard.

766
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,310
Congratulations

767
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,910
on passing the first level.

768
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,830
Keep working.

769
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,830
Why does she get to be promoted

770
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,070
since she did so bad?

771
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,390
If we hadn’t fixed it for her...

772
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,830
Jiang Jun.

773
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,310
Congratulation!

774
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,550
As the first one who got promoted
among us four,

775
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,790
you should treat us.

776
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,310
How about tomorrow?
I have work to do today.

777
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,710
Okay, a deal.

778
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,710
I won’t show courtesy anyway.

779
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:21,710
Go to the rooftop.

780
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,670
You still have to thank me.

781
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,110
You don’t have to thank me officially

782
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,910
since it’s my job to help a newbie.

783
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,910
Yeah?

784
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,910
So is there a free house in the world?

785
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:04,630
Jiang Jun,

786
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,390
what’re you doing?

787
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,870
Can I see it?

788
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,750
You have to promise you will give it back to me.

789
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,070
Sure, I will give it back after I see it.

790
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:16,470
Jiang Jun.

791
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,470
Do you know why it’s called a magic cube?

792
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,310
No.

793
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,270
It’s because

794
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,270
there’s an elf who knows magic

795
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,950
living in the magic cube.

796
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:29,910
An elf?

797
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:30,510
Yeah.

798
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,150
Each elf in the magic cube

799
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,470
has lived in it for hundreds of years.

800
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,710
They’re waiting for

801
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,630
the one who can solve

802
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,030
the magic cube.

803
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,070
They only get to show themselves

804
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,550
when the magic cube’s solved.

805
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,310
Only the real owner of the magic cube

806
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,030
knows how to solve it

807
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,230
and release them.

808
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,950
Release them?

809
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,550
Were you dealing with it for a while?

810
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,670
But you didn’t solve it, right?

811
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,910
When you were trying to solve it,

812
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,110
did you hear

813
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,990
the click-clack?

814
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,470
I think

815
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,830
perhaps you’re not the real owner of it.

816
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,990
Because the click-clack is their

817
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,550
cry of pain.

818
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,030
Do you know that?

819
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,230
If you torture them too hard,

820
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,030
you might have a bad dream at night.

821
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,510
What do I do?

822
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,310
I think I should try to solve it

823
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,070
for your safety.

824
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,630
I will bring this magic cube home temporarily.

825
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,350
And we will look for its owner tomorrow,

826
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,110
okay?

827
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:40,750
Okay.
