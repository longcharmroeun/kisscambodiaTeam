00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,490
Episode 35

3
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,320
How do you think about

4
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Yingchi Motor’s stock hitting the decline limit?

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,160
Three days ago,

6
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,800
Yingchi recalled all the new cars

7
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
that were launched this year.

8
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
The stock value of Yingchi

9
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,600
will hit the bottom

10
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,920
But I think before long

11
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,840
its stocks will start to soar.

12
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,360
Because Baylor Energy will take over Yingchi.

13
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,800
Are you sure?

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,160
Both Yingchi’s debt ratio

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,680
and cost remain high.

16
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,040
Why would Baylor Energy take over it?

17
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,040
Although Baylor Energy has

18
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
billions of dollars on paper,

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
its equity is dispersed with low valuation.

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,270
It’s facing the risk of the hostile takeover.

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,760
Purchasing Yingchi

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,480
will be their poison pill.

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,760
You are Shen Xin from MH?

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,440
Hello? Shen Xin.

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,720
How was your interview?

26
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,920
Jiang Jun,

27
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,320
I passed the interview in GE.

28
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,480
I’ll start working there next week.

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,320
Really?

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,200
Congratulations!

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,640
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,880
I’m thankful that you and Mr. Yuan
vouched for me.

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,960
By the way, are you free tonight?

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,280
I want to invite you, Mr. Yuan and Ms. Qiao

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,590
to a dinner to thank you guys.

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,320
And we can also

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,000
take this chance to get together.

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,640
Of course. I’ll be there.

39
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,560
Bye.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,640
Come in.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Jiang Jun!

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,120
Oh, sorry.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Ms. Jiang!

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,680
Shen Xin passed the interview in GE.

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,480
Have you heard that?

46
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,640
I have.

47
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,800
Congratulations!

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,840
Now you don’t have to worry anymore.

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,320
By the way, I need you to do me a favor.

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,440
Of course.

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,280
Go to the IT Dept. after work

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,240
and send me all the files regarding

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,590
Huanyu Group after Mr. Du took charge of it.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,720
Remember,

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,560
wait till everybody’s left.

56
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Mr. Du?

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,520
Is there a problem?

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,590
I’m not sure.

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
I just suspect

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,590
that it has something to do
with Shen Xin and Xiang Ding’s dismission.

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,280
Remember, you’ve got to keep it a secret.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,720
Got it.

63
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,160
<i>TOWER 2</i>

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,040
Jiang Jun!
<i>TOWER 2</i>

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,820
<i>TOWER 2</i>

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,320
I was drunk last night. I’m sorry.

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,120
Mr. Du.

68
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,440
It wouldn’t be genuine

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,600
if I told you it’s okay.

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,520
But don’t worry.

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,560
I will do my best to calm myself,

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,640
and maintain our

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
boss-subordinate relationship

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,520
before I resign.

75
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,240
You are still determined to leave MH?

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, I am.

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,040
Do I really mean

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,200
nothing to you?

79
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,760
Okay.

80
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,600
I see.

81
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,200
Then I’m leaving.

82
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,480
<i>West World</i>

83
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,400
Honey.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,440
Where are you going?

85
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Honey?

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,440
What? You’ll also run away from home like I did?

87
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,640
I’ll go on a business trip.

88
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,280
A business trip?

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,200
For how long?

90
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,120
I’ll be back tomorrow.

91
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,840
But,

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,920
tomorrow is a very important day.

93
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,840
It is.

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,670
I’ll meet the investor.

95
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,960
That’s it?

96
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,080
Think again.

97
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,480
Is there another important thing?

98
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,360
No.

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,360
Li Xiaochuan!

100
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,280
Aren’t you even curious about yesterday?

101
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,520
What do you want me to ask?

102
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,800
I’ve seen it myself.

103
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,600
Congratulations!

104
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Your willfulness has reached a new level.

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
But,

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,360
I’ve told you that I’d leave.

107
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,920
So of course I’d do what I was intended to do.

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,440
But I don’t want you

109
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,080
to be with that man.

110
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,600
You don’t know who he is

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,960
and what kinda person he is.

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Besides,

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,240
he knows that you are married,

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,760
but he’s still going after you.

115
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,800
He’s not to be trusted.

116
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,080
Not really.

117
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,800
I think he’s a nice person.

118
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,600
He plays the guitar,
and he’s humorous and funny.

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
Unlike you,

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
he can also drink with me.

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
So you mean

122
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,670
you enjoy his company, right?

123
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,040
I guess.

124
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,960
Anyway, our love has passed

125
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
its most exciting time.

126
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,800
Somebody doesn’t think

127
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,760
I’m that attractive anymore.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,840
And I

129
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,440
happen to find

130
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,240
that I’m no longer

131
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,920
attracted to you either.

132
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,520
Fine.

133
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,960
Whatever.

134
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,680
Then go ahead and hang out with him.

135
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,320
Li Xiaochuan!

136
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,680
I was just kidding.

137
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,680
Why

138
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,440
did you take it so seriously?

139
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,200
I just want you

140
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,480
to care about me more.

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,280
Are you done?

142
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Xiaochuan,

143
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,720
I understand

144
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,520
that a lot of things in your world

145
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,080
are more important than love.

146
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,360
But to me,

147
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,840
Xu Li,

148
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,560
love always comes first.

149
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
You are the only light

150
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,640
in my world.

151
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
If you don’t love me anymore,

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,040
or,

153
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,080
you don’t love me as much as before,

154
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,520
I’ll get lost in life.

155
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,040
I know

156
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,120
it’s a little selfish saying so,

157
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,920
but this is my real thought.

158
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,280
I really hope you can care about me

159
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,640
as much as I care about you.

160
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,920
At least let me feel it once.

161
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
Sometimes, humans will do the same.

162
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,560
When you fall in love with someone,

163
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,920
you’ll protect that person at any cost,

164
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,800
just like the Zhou Star.

165
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,240
It’s a small gift to show my gratitude.

166
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,320
Hope you’ll like it.

167
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,480
Looks like

168
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,640
I need a new suit to go with it.

169
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,320
They’ve been evolving

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,680
over the long course of time.

171
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,720
Maybe they got used to it long ago.

172
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,160
But I think,

173
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,480
if they ever had a chance to see the sunlight,

174
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
they’d no longer want to

175
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,440
live in the dark deep sea,

176
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,320
and would strive to head toward the sunlight.

177
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,320
If I were them,

178
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,040
I’d do the same.

179
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
Sorry.

180
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,520
It was thoughtless of me
to make you misunderstand.

181
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,240
You guessed right.

182
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,560
I want to get married.

183
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,200
So, you should realize

184
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
I will not respond to your feelings.

185
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,760
You really can’t wait to leave me?

186
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,840
Fine.

187
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,160
I’ll help you.

188
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
Hello?

189
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,240
I just sent an email to you.

190
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Release it right now.

191
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
The more sensational, the better.

192
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
I haven’t sung like this for a long time.

193
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,200
What a great way to relax.

194
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,000
Here!

195
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,040
Cheers!

196
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,520
Cheers!

197
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,480
Shen Xin,

198
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,960
good luck on your new job in GE.

199
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,880
I know you can do it.

200
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,840
No worry, Ms. Qiao.

201
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,040
I will do my best

202
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,440
and work hard.

203
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,840
By the way, did Xiang Ding go back home?

204
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
Yes. He did.

205
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,840
He told his parents about it.

206
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,320
If he didn’t go,

207
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,280
his parents would be very sad.

208
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,760
I think everybody has right

209
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
to choose his own path.

210
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,840
Perhaps he thinks

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,160
that having a decent job in a big city

212
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,640
is unnecessarily the only option.

213
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,400
Mr. Yuan, welcome!

214
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,160
Long time no see.

215
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,080
You are here.

216
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,800
I brought a friend here.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,680
Hope you won’t mind.

218
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
Of course, not.

219
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,040
Come in.

220
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,400
Yuanji, it’s you!

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,120
What are you doing here?

222
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,080
Qiao, don’t get me wrong.

223
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
I’m here because of Yuan’s warm invitation.

224
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,120
Take a seat.

225
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,920
Then, I’ll

226
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,840
sit here.

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
Yuan Shuai,
can you discipline your brother here?

228
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,760
I can’t.

229
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,800
He’s in charge.

230
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
Qiao, I only listen to you.

231
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
Why isn’t Chen Yicheng here yet?

232
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,320
I asked him to help me with something.

233
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,120
He’ll be here later.

234
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,720
Okay. Then let’s start without him.

235
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,920
Today, I invited you over

236
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,080
to extend my gratitude to all of you.

237
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,000
Ms. Qiao, thank you for your encouragement.

238
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,720
Jiang Jun, thank you for your trust

239
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
and all your effort

240
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,120
in helping Xiang Ding and me.

241
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Most importantly, I want to thank Mr. Yuan

242
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,440
for providing me with the opportunity

243
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,840
so that I can get the job in GE.

244
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,080
Here, cheers!

245
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,200
Here!

246
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,640
Shen Xin.

247
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Don’t mention it.

248
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,680
You can get the job in GE mainly because

249
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,360
of your own capabilities and experience.

250
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,120
Right?

251
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,800
Congratulations!

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,480
Here, cheers!

253
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,000
Congratulations!

254
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Thank you!

255
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,480
Take it slowly.

256
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,640
I know.

257
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,120
Sorry! Sorry

258
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,920
that I’m late!

259
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,080
I’m sorry!

260
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,680
You are back.

261
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,400
There you are.

262
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,280
Oh, here,

263
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,200
Jiang Jun.

264
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,080
This is what you asked for.

265
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,120
Thank you.

266
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,440
What is it?

267
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,200
The stuff you reminded me of.

268
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,600
I’ll tell you later.

269
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,600
Since we are all here now,

270
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,160
I have something to tell you guys.

271
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,680
I’m going to resign.

272
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,080
What?

273
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,920
Why… Why so sudden?

274
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,400
Is it because we got you in trouble?

275
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,150
He approved?

276
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,720
Seems like it.

277
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,680
By the way,

278
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,520
I resign

279
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,560
because I think there are

280
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,240
more important things to do.

281
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,520
It has nothing to do with you guys.

282
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,000
Don’t think I’m doing it for you.

283
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,160
I think Ms. Jiang is going to show us

284
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,400
how to invest when it’s a bear market
and how to take a break when it’s a bull.

285
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,160
I’m sure she has a strategy

286
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,640
carrying out her career development plan, right?

287
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,960
Good for you, Mr. Chen!

288
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,280
What a smart way to mock me.

289
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,600
I didn’t mean that.

290
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,140
You’ve made your decision?

291
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,560
I have.

292
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,280
I’ll toast to all of you!

293
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,080
Together or not,
we are always the brightest stars.

294
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,680
Cheers!

295
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
Ms. Jiang

296
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,920
is a delicate girl.

297
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,280
I will drink

298
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,200
on her behalf tonight.

299
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,080
I suddenly feel like

300
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,640
my body has become delicate, too!

301
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,320
What should I do?

302
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,320
Qiao, I’ll drink it for you!

303
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
-Stop it! Here!
-Cheers!

304
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,680
Now, watch me!

305
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,600
That’s amazing, Mr. Yuan!

306
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,080
Mr. Yuan, good for you!

307
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,400
You know that I can drink.

308
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,200
I really miss the days

309
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,960
when we first got in MH.

310
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,840
Back then, the four of us didn’t know anything.

311
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,920
Every day when we got to work,

312
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,160
Ms. Qiao would encourage us

313
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,600
and Mr. Yuan would inspire us.

314
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,560
And on top of that,

315
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,600
Jiang Jun, as the most outstanding one,

316
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,320
always led us to go higher and further.

317
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,560
When thinking about it,

318
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,440
I can’t believe time flew by this quickly.

319
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,120
Tell me about it.

320
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,960
After today,

321
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,960
we’ll all start a new chapter in life.

322
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I think it’d be

323
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,000
really hard for us

324
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,440
to get together again.

325
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,880
So,

326
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I think we should drink

327
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,720
as much as we can tonight,

328
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,360
okay?

329
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay!

330
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,520
Alright!

331
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,080
Let’s drink it up!

332
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,600
Come on!

333
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,000
Fill the cup!

334
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,720
Fill the cup!

335
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Here!

336
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
Let me drink one more cup, okay?

337
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,840
Go ahead.

338
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,960
Here.

339
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,000
Cheers.

340
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,000
Here, let’s toast to our glorious time in MH!

341
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,480
Cheers!

342
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,760
You know what?

343
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,880
Shen Xin got the job in GE

344
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,960
because of Ms. Jiang’s recommendation letter.

345
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,640
There’s a lot of hard evidence in this post.

346
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,920
It’s Ms. Jiang who leaked the offer of SKL.

347
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,040
Is she really running a “family business” now

348
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,440
with Mr. Yuan of GE?

349
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,360
Ms. Jiang,

350
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,120
something happened.

351
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,800
What is this?

352
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,160
Mr. Du.

353
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,560
Come to my office.

354
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,440
<i>MD Yuan Shuai</i>

355
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,320
Boss, look.
<i>MD Yuan Shuai</i>

356
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,300
<i>MD Yuan Shuai</i>

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,160
This person has posted this rumor

358
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,380
on a dozen of industry BBS and groups

359
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,120

<i>Investment bank couple conspired to

362
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,920
within two hours.

363
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,240
He claims that he’s from GE

364
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
and he knows a lot of inside information.

365
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,640
He said that you and Jiang Jun

366
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,440
poached the team in secret,

367
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,520
exchanged confidential files

368
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,040
and disclosed clients’ information.

369
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
He also said that you two are malignant tumors
in the investment banking industry,

370
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
and he has Jiang Jun’s recommendation letter
as the hard evidence.

371
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,080
What a bunch of lies!

372
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
If I find out who did this,

373
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
I will kill him myself!

374
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,120
Hello? Chairman.

375
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,200
Yuan Shuai,

376
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,480
what’s going on with the recommendation letter?

377
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,000
Chairman, I’m dealing with it right now.

378
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,600
The directors

379
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
have been calling me since this early morning.

380
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,560
Listen,

381
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,560
you’ve got to solve this problem A.S.A.P.!

382
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
Don’t worry. I will.

383
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,360
Apparently,

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
someone did this on purpose.

385
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,720
The HR Dept. wouldn’t dare release

386
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,920
the recommendation letter you gave them.

387
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,120
Besides,

388
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,440
this person knows you and GE quite well.

389
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,680
Chances are that this person

390
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
is one of us.

391
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,240
Unnecessarily.

392
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,800
It could be someone

393
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,880
who used to work in GE.

394
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,200
Is there anything I can help with?

395
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,680
No.

396
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,280
As long as you ask,

397
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,040
I will make all your trouble go away.

398
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,400
Thanks. But I can take care of it myself.

399
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,640
How will you do that?

400
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,960
Listen to me.

401
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,280
If you can’t solve this problem,

402
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,720
you’ll lose everything

403
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,360
you own!

404
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,560
At this moment,

405
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,560
why can’t you just ask for my help?

406
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,160
I admit that I got anxious.

407
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,760
That’s why I wrote
a recommendation letter to Yuan Shuai.

408
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,080
But I promise we never did any

409
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,480
of the other things that the post accused us of!

410
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
You think people would trust you

411
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,600
at this point when you claim

412
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,680
that you are innocent?

413
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,200
I will make a statement in front of the Board.

414
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,240
Even if I’m going to resign,

415
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,280
I won’t leave with guilt,

416
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,960
and I will definitely not get others involved.

417
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,960
As for you, Mr. Du,

418
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,760
how are you going to explain to the Board

419
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
about the false financial report of Huanyu Group?

420
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,360
You investigated me?

421
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,400
There’s a problem indeed.

422
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,840
It started from the Q4 income statement

423
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,280
and balance sheet two years ago.

424
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,320
There’s no way that Du Lei couldn’t find out

425
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,880
that there was a deviation of more than 30%
between the gross margin

426
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,240
and the annual average gross margin.

427
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,720
And the accountant wouldn’t have been able

428
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,160
to cheat during the field visit

429
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,400
and notice submission.

430
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,400
The three parties are all involved
in this fraud.

431
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,680
I guess

432
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,160
this is what Shen Xin overheard.

433
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,280
If Du Lei is really involved,

434
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,960
what are you going to do?

435
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Deal with it in a professional way.

436
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,080
You thought Shen Xin overheard

437
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,600
that Huanyu Group bought you off

438
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,280
to forge their financial reports,

439
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,880
so you created trouble on purpose

440
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,240
to get rid of her.

441
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
I don’t know what you are talking about!

442
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,400
Rules can be broken for interests.

443
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,040
It’s okay to find a shortcut.

444
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,920
Is that what you taught me that

445
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,320
one should always fight for his own interests?

446
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,080
Mr. Du!

447
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
Aren’t you afraid I’d report you to the CSRC?

448
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
Sometimes, a small sacrifice is worth it

449
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,720
for the long-term benefit.

450
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,360
Not everybody would

451
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,240
protect themselves by sacrificing others.

452
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,400
At least it wouldn’t happen
when Yuan Shuai was here!

453
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,560
Let me warn you!

454
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,960
I call the shots in MH now,

455
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,320
not Yuan Shuai!

456
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,760
Don’t compare him with me.

457
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,240
Even if I don’t report you,

458
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,840
you’ll sooner or later pay for what you did.

459
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,920
I hope you can confess to the headquarters

460
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
about your wrongdoings.

461
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,680
I have my way of doing things.

462
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,120
I don’t need you to lecture me.

463
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,840
Besides,

464
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,240
you and Yuan Shuai are also
having a difficult time, aren’t you?

465
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,280
You are the one

466
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,920
who disclosed the recommendation letter?

467
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,540
<i>Recommendation Letter</i>

468
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,080
Mr. Du, what do you want me for?

469
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,720
When did you become

470
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,640
this kinda person?

471
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,960
When?

472
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,400
I have never changed.

473
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,360
Let me tell you,

474
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,200
I approached you

475
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,640
because I wanted to use you!

476
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,000
I lied to you about Wan Shan’s matter.

477
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,480
I also set a trap to get rid of Shen Xin.

478
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,380
I was even involved in your father’s accident!

479
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,840
I have also used you.

480
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,600
But the only thing that’s changed is

481
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,000
that I’ve cared about you more and more!

482
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,760
Do you know that?

483
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,800
But in the end…

484
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,200
In the end, I found

485
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,200
that I actually meant

486
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,920
so little to you.

487
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,600
So, I…

488
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,040
So you want to destroy me!

489
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,240
Right?

490
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,920
Jiang Jun,

491
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
why don’t you just understand?

492
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,400
I just don’t want you to leave me.

493
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,360
Do you know that?

494
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Do you remember
when you first celebrated my birthday for me?

495
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,800
It was the first time I’ve found

496
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,160
birthday celebration was a happy thing.

497
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,840
You are the one who gave me hope to start over.

498
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,760
I’ve loved you

499
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,320
for three years.

500
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,360
I’ve been waiting for you and protecting you.

501
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,240
I just hoped that one day

502
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,280
you could turn around and take a look at me,

503
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,000
even just one glance!

504
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,400
Do you think it’s fair to me?

505
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,240
For the past three years,

506
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,080
I only saw you as my teacher,

507
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,480
friend,

508
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,120
and supervisor.

509
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,560
I’ve never had any other thought about you.

510
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,400
Our feelings to each other

511
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,200
were never the same.

512
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,160
How could I make it fair to you?

513
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,280
Du Lei,

514
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,080
I hope you can stop

515
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,120
wasting your energy on me.

516
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,720
Either good or bad,

517
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,200
please just stop.

518
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,920
This is the fairest answer

519
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,960
I can give you.

520
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,840
Sorry.

521
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
It’s been three years.

522
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,400
A “sorry” is all I’ve got from you,

523
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,320
right?

524
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,280
Just leave.

525
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
You can investigate me

526
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,120
or report me.

527
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
Whatever.

528
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,880
Mr. Du, my teacher.

529
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,200
This is the last time I call you like this.

530
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,320
I think there’s no need

531
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,880
for us to see each other again.

532
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Leave!

533
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,080
Jiang Jun,

534
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
due to your excellent performance,

535
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,080
you have become a full member of us

536
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,400
ahead of time.

537
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,800
Ms. Qiao asked me to sort these files out

538
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,880
by tomorrow.

539
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,920
Jiang Jun.

540
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,240
Let me do some for you.

541
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,240
You helped me

542
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,360
on the day of interview.

543
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,880
I owe you one. But after this,

544
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,680
we are even.

545
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,840
The valuation report is done.

546
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,920
Really? Already?

547
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,400
You are both novices at this.

548
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,720
I knew you’d have a hard time to do it.

549
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,680
Thank you very much.

550
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,480
It’s such a miracle

551
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,720
that I can get this task done.

552
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,120
Hello?

553
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,480
You called me here

554
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
to show off your victory

555
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,000
or to insult me?

556
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,520
Victory is the result of a real competition.

557
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,840
You slipped yourself.

558
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Why would I be happy about that?

559
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
Without your reminder,

560
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,200
Jiang Jun wouldn’t have thought
about investigating me.

561
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,680
Wrong is wrong.

562
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,960
It doesn’t matter who found it out.

563
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,240
You still think it’s okay to constantly

564
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
break the rules?

565
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,560
This world is never perfect.

566
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,880
A rational desire

567
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,360
may get more benefits in return.

568
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,280
Because of me,

569
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,280
hundreds and thousands of shareholders
and employees are benefited

570
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,560
or about to be benefited.

571
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,760
You think which one of us

572
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,000
is the bad person in their eyes?

573
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,480
You? Or me?

574
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,760
Never mind.

575
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,280
I’m not here to discuss the value ranking between

576
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,240
desires and rules.

577
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,240
I just want you to know

578
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
that Jiang Jun is soft-hearted.

579
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,840
Even though she called you out,

580
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,160
she wouldn’t go report you.

581
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,840
I, on the other hand, am different.

582
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,720
I don’t have any patience

583
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,680
for wrongdoings.

584
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,160
So,

585
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,960
I hope you can stop

586
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
all your illegal operations

587
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,920
and leave MH right away.

588
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
Otherwise,

589
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,840
I will hunt you down,

590
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,720
till you lose everything.

591
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
That’s it?

592
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,840
You are pitying me?

593
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,320
Why would I pity you?

594
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,840
For one, MH

595
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,520
means a great deal to me.

596
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,880
I don’t want the company’s

597
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,480
reputation to suffer because of you.

598
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,520
For two,

599
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,880
you helped me

600
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,760
and Jiang Jun.

601
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,680
I owe you one.

602
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,320
So,

603
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,840
as long as you stop right away,

604
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,160
I’ll pretend nothing

605
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,720
has happened.

606
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,480
Then I think I should thank you, huh?

607
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,880
You are welcome.

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,600
Xiaochuan?

611
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,600
Sorry.

612

The subscriber you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

613
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,280
Please redial later.

00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,080
Sorry. The subscriber…

615
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,400
He forgot just as I thought.

616
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,640
Xu Li,

617
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,440
what are you expecting anyway?

Happy first anniversary.

630
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Do you still

631
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,320
want to celebrate it with me?

632
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,560

633
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,000
you forgot.

635
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,000
I want to sincerely

636
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,400
apologize to you.

637
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,960
For all this time,

638
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
I’ve been

639
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,400
selfishly taking the care and love

640
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,640
you gave me.

641
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,480
You know that I’m not good

642
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,200
at expressing my feelings.

643
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,800
If that bothers you,

644
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,920
I will change for you.

645
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,680
And

646
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,520
about that 72-hour theory,

647
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,320
actually I want to tell you

648
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,920
that in love,

649
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,680
I think what really matters is

650
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,960
when all the passion’s gone,

651
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,640
we are still willing

652
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,440
to spend the rest of our lives together.

653
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,360
I’m not

654
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,680
a humorous person,

655
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,400
but I can play the guitar,

656
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,320
and I can be your drinking partner.

657
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,880
Li,

658
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,040
I want

659
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,080
to be with you forever.

660
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,640
That’s the most sincere promise I can give you.

661
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,600
Will you accept it?

662
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,500
<i>West World</i>

663
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,160
You don’t have to do anything.

664
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,000
I only want you to love me.

665
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,840
By the way,

666
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,760
when…

667
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,520
When did you learn how to play the guitar?

668
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,200
That’s easy.

669
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,920
There are only six strings.

670
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,360
Did you learn it for me?

671
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,400
I was worried that my wife
would be stolen away by another guy.

672
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,960
I just don’t understand

673
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,000
what’s so glamorous about playing the guitar.

674
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,720
Of course, it is!

675
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,440
When the spotlight

676
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,400
shone on you just now,

677
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,320
it literally lit up my heart.

678
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,480
I’m afraid our “72 hours”

679
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,320
will start over now.

680
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,160
Did you

681
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,840
prepare a gift for me?

682
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,920
I did.

683
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,080
And I just gave it to you.

684
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,480
What?

685
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,680
That’s it?

686
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,000
My kiss

687
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,400
is an invaluable gift, okay?

688
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,120
Not everybody gets to enjoy it.

689
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,320
Since it’s invaluable,

690
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,120
I think I need to enjoy it more.

691
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,880
What’s wrong?

692
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,480
Are you okay?

693
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,720
What is it?

694
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,800
I’m fine.

695
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,800
Just feel a little sick.

696
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,120
Could it be…

697
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,720
Are you…

698
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,560
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

699
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,400
About the recommendation letter,

700
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,480
the Compliance Department

701
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,080
has asked for all your work files
for investigation.

702
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,080
You need to get ready for a hearing.

703
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,160
Okay.

704
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,200
I will give the company my full cooperation.

705
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,720
Hold on!

706
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,800
I have a question.

707
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,200
Due to my personal reasons,

708
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,360
I submitted an application for resignation.

709
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,000
Is it following the procedures now?

710
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,000
We haven’t seen

711
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,120
your application yet.

712
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,600
You haven’t?

713
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,240
No.

714
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Maybe I remembered wrong.

715
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,720
Okay.

716
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,720
Alright.

717
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,120
Bye.

718
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,080
How is it going with you?

719
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,800
What do you think?

720
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,280
No salaries for the second half of this year
and no year-end bonus.

721
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,800
I’ll need you to support me now.

722
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,640
Poor baby.

723
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,600
Don’t worry.

724
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,160
I promise that you will be well-fed.

725
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,000
One more thing.

726
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,800
I met Du Lei today.

727
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,120
He’s decided to resign.

728
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,360
And he won’t

729
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,600
step into the investment banking industry again.

730
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,160
Really?

731
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,680
It’s good.

732
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,440
For him, and for the company.

733
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,400
Jiang Jun.

734
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,760
Actually,

735
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,760
if there’s something you like to do,

736
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,520
or something you are

737
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,960
reluctant to change,

738
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,800
then you should follow your heart

739
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,360
and continue to do it.

740
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,040
Why do you say that?

741
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,960
Although it’s your idea to resign,

742
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,720
I pressured you

743
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,360
more or less,

744
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,760
making you come up with that idea.

745
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,960
No matter how much we love each other,

746
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,880
we don’t have

747
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,400
to change who we are.

748
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,640
So,

749
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,280
whether

750
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,920
you want to resign

751
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,160
or continue to work in this industry,

752
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,840
no matter you want to stay in MH or come to GE,

753
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
I will always respect your decision.

754
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,400
You are so nice.

755
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,920
So, are you still going to resign?

756
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,600
I thought I’ve thought it through,

757
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,520
but I guess

758
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,720
I’d rather keep fighting.

759
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,120
I just knew it.

760
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,880
Wealth, daddy is so nice.

761
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,160
Right?

762
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,800
Do you remember

763
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,600
how old she was

764
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,880
when we first adopted her?

765
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,120
Of course, I do.

766
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,200
She was only this big.

767
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,560
No more than two months old.

768
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,680
Yep.

769
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,440
And now she’s already 13 years old.

770
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,720
Wealth.

771
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,520
Thank you for being daddy’s company

772
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,240
when mommy was not around.

773
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,880
We will take good care of you in the future.

774
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,240
No worry.

775
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,160
The three of us have never
taken a picture together.

776
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,560
Let’s take one.

777
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,560
Let’s take a picture.

778
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:26,990
Now.

779
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,400
One, two, three!

780
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,680
One more.

781
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,640
Three, two, one!
