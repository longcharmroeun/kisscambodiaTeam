Love Is Sweet

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 9

3
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,200
Miss.

4
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,080
Where are you going?

5
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,440
Who are you?

6
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,000
Why do you care where I’m going?

7
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,240
I don’t really care.

8
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Give me your cell phone!

9
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,920
Wait!

10
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,240
Do you want money?

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
I can transfer you money,

12
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
no matter how much you want!

13
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,120
Give me your phone!

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,880
Shut your mouth!

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,600
What…

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,520
Give me!

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,960
What are you doing?

18
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,760
Stop it!

19
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,360
Give me!

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
I’m robbed!

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
Stop!

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Stop!

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,800
Hey, stop!

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,480
Hey,

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,360
stop!

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,600
Hey,

27
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,360
will you just stop chasing me?

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,720
Is it worth it just for a phone?

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
I told you I’d give you money!

30
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,000
Give my bag back!

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,920
No way!

32
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,680
Get out of my way!

33
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,880
No way?

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,200
Give it back to me!

35
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,040
Let go!

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,840
Give it back to me!

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,440
Let go!

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,000
Give it back to me!

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,800
Let go!

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
Don’t cry! Don’t cry!

41
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,000
Still not home?

42
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,520
Jiang Jun!

43
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,320
What happened?

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,280
Are you alright?

45
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,360
Don’t…

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,440
Don’t look at me!

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,480
I tried so hard to hold my tears back!

48
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,760
If you look at me, I’ll cry!

49
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,200
Does it hurt?

50
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,840
Let me see your hand.

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,150
The other one.

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,680
It’ll sting.

53
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,920
The other one.

54
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,720
Better?

55
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,040
Much better.

56
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,480
I really don’t know what to say.

57
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,600
Let me see.

58
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,080
Still hurt?

59
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,320
Why are you looking at me this way?

60
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,000
So you mean

61
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,920
Wan Shan used his authority

62
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,920
and harassed Tang Xin sexually.

63
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,360
And the crime scene

64
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
was the resting room with a combination lock

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
in Wan Shan’s office?

66
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,480
Where is the evidence that Tang Xin gave you

67
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
and the video you took?

68
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,160
In my cell phone,

69
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
which was robbed just now.

70
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
From now on,

71
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,200
just stay at home and rest.

72
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,360
I’ll help you ask for a leave from the company.

73
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,080
Most of all,

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,800
stay away from Wan Shan

75
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,000
and Tang Xin.

76
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,960
How can I do that?

77
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,120
Why not?

78
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,240
You can’t even take care of yourself!

79
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,760
How can you handle such a dangerous matter?

80
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,040
Of course I can take care of myself!

81
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,840
That robber got hurt, too!

82
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,440
Jiang Jun!

83
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,960
Are you stupid or what?

84
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,400
What kinda robber would

85
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,800
rob people on the street nowadays?

86
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
It’s obvious that the robber

87
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
was sent by Wan Shan!

88
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,560
Wan Shan must have put you

89
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,360
and Tang Xin under his watch.

90
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,880
If you approach Tang Xin again,

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,960
you’ll only get yourself in greater danger.

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,360
But,

93
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,200
I can’t just turn my back

94
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,120
on this thing!

95
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,520
It’s not your job to deal with it!

96
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,360
And it’s not your job to stop me!

97
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,800
I’ll find the evidence back!

98
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,440
Jiang Jun!

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,680
It’s already late! Don’t go out!

100
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,360
Just stay at home!

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,240
I’ll help you find your phone, okay?

102
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,120
Don’t you hear me?

103
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,880
No!

104
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,800
You…

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,640
What should I say to him?

106
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,320
I’m here to thank him for giving me the slippers?

107
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,400
Or for the western meal?

108
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
I’ll go for the slippers.

109
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,840
But how am I supposed

110
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,040
to find him in such

111
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,560
a big campus like this?

112
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,640
I read it somewhere before.

113
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
It’s said you can find anybody

114
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,000
in this world

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
through six people.

116
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,080
I should give it a try!

117
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Hi! Excuse me, beauty.

118
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,160
Do you by any chance know Li Xiaochuan?

119
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,200
Sure.

120
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,440
He’s the prince charming of our school!

121
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,960
Prince charming?

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,200
So,

123
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,920
there must be a lot of girls who are into him?

124
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Of course.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
Not only the girls in our school,

126
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,240
but also the girls from other schools.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,440
Such as…

128
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,640
Then do you know

129
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,660
where he’d

130
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,280
usually stay?

131
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,360
I do.

132
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,480
Really?

133
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,240
So, can you take me there?

134
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,000
Xiaochuan.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,560
The professor is looking for you! Come with me!

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,080
Hurry!

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,720
Gosh! It’s so messy!

138
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,240
Being organized

139
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,160
is my comparative advantage!

140
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,600
“Sweetheart,

141
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,160
do you miss me today?

142
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,080
There’ll be a dating activity at the Bund tonight.

143
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,920
Can I ask you out?

144
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,800
I’ll take it as yes

145
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,240
if you don’t reply!

146
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,560
See you then!”

147
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,680
Convenient Store Girl.

148
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,800
What?

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,720
I don’t even deserve a decent name?

150
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,040
What “Convenient Store Girl?”

151
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,760
Too sweet!

152
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,680
Xu Li!

153
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,800
Stop daydreaming!

154
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,840
He’s already got a girlfriend!

155
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,640
Listen up, Xu Li,

156
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,680
just stop daydreaming!

157
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,560
He doesn’t even

158
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,000
know your name!

159
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,080
Convenient Store Girl? Convenient Store Girl?

160
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,280
What’s wrong with being a convenient store girl?

161
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,560
It’s much better

162
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
than that “Sweet!”

163
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,760
What kinda stupid cyber-name is that?

Hi, beauty!

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
May we ask you something?

168
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,400
Do you know Li Xiaochuan?

169
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,200
No! I don’t!

-We haven’t finished!
-What’s the matter with her?

Coming!

-Then I’ll go first!

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,280
Come on in.

178
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,320
What?

179
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,440
Someone actually did that?

180
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,760
He can’t just play his phone?

181
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,240
He doesn’t have siblings?

182
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,200
His parents don’t love him?

183
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
And also, how could Yuan Shuai

184
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,040
just walk away from this matter,

185
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,720
even make you get hurt?

186
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,600
You’ve got to tell him

187
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
that I despise him!

188
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,080
Enough about me.

189
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,160
What happened to you?

190
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Jiang Jun,

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,200
I feel like I’ve been dumped!

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,000
Wait. What are you talking about?

195
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,400
You confessed your love to him?

196
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,120
No.

197
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
How would I dare?

198
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,000
I just went to his school yesterday

199
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,600
and saw his WeChat messages by accident.

200
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,120
A girl named “Sweet”

201
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
texted him

202
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,680
and asked him to go to
a dating activity at the Bund.

203
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,400
You don’t have to think too much.

204
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,680
Maybe her WeChat ID is “Sweet.”

205
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,720
Perhaps she is just trying to date him

206
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,440
but has no luck yet.

207
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,440
But,

208
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,280
he named me “Convenient Store Girl!”

209
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,040
Think about it!

210
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,720
If you are interested in someone,

211
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,400
would you name the person like that?

212
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,880
That does make sense.

213
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,760
Well…

214
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
As the saying goes,

215
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,960
there are plenty of fish in the sea.

216
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,160
No need to focus only on a place nearby,

217
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,240
where it’s poor in both

218
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,240
quantity and quality.

219
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,200
If you can’t get him, then find someone else.

220
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,560
Don’t be sad.

221
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,000
It’s not worth it.

222
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,720
He doesn’t even know.

223
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,000
I’ll turn grief into appetite!

224
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,600
Let’s go eat something!

225
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,280
It’s my treat!

226
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,440
I’ll go change.

227
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,280
Mr. Yuan, I’ve done some research.

228
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,120
In Wanxing Entertainment, the people who have

229
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,640
the qualifications for the CEO position
are as follows.

230
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,880
Cao Dong,

231
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,480
who’s been with Wanxing for 30 years,

232
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,560
the longest among them all.

233
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,200
He’s too old.

234
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,720
He won’t be able to deal with the fierce

235
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,400
market competition either mentally or physically.

236
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
The shareholders won’t vote for him.

237
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
Chen Hai, one of Wanxing’s Directors.

238
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,800
Aside from Wan Shan, he has the best chance

239
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
in terms of qualifications and reputation.

240
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,320
I met him before.

241
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,360
He’s quite sophisticated and crafty.

242
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,560
However,

243
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
he is such an opportunist.

244
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,320
He wouldn’t take action

245
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,800
unless he’s 100% sure.

246
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,040
So, considering the above…

247
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,320
Luo Sheng,

248
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,560
the youngest Vice President in Wanxing,

249
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,680
in charge of Brokerage Department.

250
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,600
He’s just as influential as Wan Shan.

251
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
The problem is

252
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,680
that Wan Shan is like a mentor to Luo Sheng,

253
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,280
so Luo might not be willing to turn against him.

254
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,840
As long as he’s ambitious enough,

255
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,280
I can be the best trainer he could ever ask for!

256
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
Schedule an appointment for me.

257
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,640
I wanna meet him in person.

258
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,360
You got it, boss!

259
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,200
Oh, by the way,

260
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,200
this is the cell phone you asked me to find.

261
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
It’s already smashed.

262
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,600
Will it still work?

263
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,320
Buy me a latest cell phone

264
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,880
and give it to me before you leave work.

265
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,840
Okay.

266
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,560
Hello?

267
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,160
Hello?

268
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,820
I need you to recover a cell phone’s data.

269
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,720
It’s the cell phone you located yesterday.

270
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,720
Alright.

271
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,640
The thing you did last night

272
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,440
is way over the line!

273
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,310
Some small fish and shrimps

274
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
are easy to be tempted by bait,

275
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,360
which to them is fine food.

276
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
However,

277
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,560
it’s just a trap to make them the prey.

278
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
Since they overestimate themselves

279
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,320
and they are quite

280
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,280
ignorant,

281
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,360
they deserve to be punished.

282
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,400
Mr. Wan, the small fish and shrimps
in your eyes

283
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,880
may be considered

284
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,560
gold fish to the others.

285
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,040
This kinda thing

286
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,440
had better not happen again!

287
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,440
As it goes,

288
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
“keep your eye on the accessible joy,

289
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,120
yet aim your ambition at bigger cause.”

290
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,440
Have you heard of that?

291
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,480
Instead of taking time to mock me,

292
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,760
why don’t you

293
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,560
think about

294
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,960
your own situation?

295
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Excuse me.

296
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
You are the one who started it.

297
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,080
Who do you think you are to lecture me?

298
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Gross!

299
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,500
[Jiang Jun]

300
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,040
Sorry,

301
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,120
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

302
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

303
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,120
Sorry…

304
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,400
Mr. Du.

305
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,320
What are you doing here?

306
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,080
It’s

307
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,800
none of your business.

308
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,200
Let me warn you,

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,200
stay away from Jiang Jun!

310
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,640
Otherwise,

311
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,480
you’ll be sorry!

312
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,440
Don’t you care too much

313
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,160
about your subordinate?

314
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,200
I’m worried that she’d disclose the confidential
information of the company!

315
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,160
Really?

316
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,560
Interesting!

317
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,520
You’ve never been fired up like this ever since

318
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,120
we started competing with each other.

319
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
So, how can I not

320
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
be interested in that girl?

321
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,960
I’m warning you! Don’t go too far!

322
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,760
Since you care about her this much,

323
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,120
I’m so curious about

324
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,480
and looking forward to seeing

325
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
how you’ll react

326
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,920
when you see she’s

327
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,280
in another man’s arms.

328
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,000
You bastard!

329
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,760
Yuan Shuai! What are you doing?

330
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,440
What am I doing?

331
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,480
He’s such an eyesore!

332
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,400
Mr. Du, are you alright?

333
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,080
I’m fine.

334
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,960
I don’t care if he’s your rival,

335
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,760
but he’s also my friend!

336
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,520
He’s your friend?

337
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
Listen to me, Jiang Jun.

338
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,320
Du Lei

339
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,680
is up to something.

340
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,600
You’d better steer clear of him!

341
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,640
Everybody is suspicious in your eyes,

342
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
whether it’s me or him!

343
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,880
Will you stop blaming others
for your own problems?

344
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
My problems?

345
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
You’d better watch your own herd first.

346
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,400
A wolf already got in,

347
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,440
yet all you do is to feed it!

348
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,840
Once there’s a problem,

349
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,680
you’ll come to me for help again!

350
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,520
You’d better do the right thing!

351
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Everybody is suspicious in your eyes,

352
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
whether it’s me or him!

353
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,280
Will you stop blaming others
for your own problems?

354
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,600
Sorry.

355
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
My supervisor is quick-tempered.

356
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,360
You didn’t hit me. Why did you apologize?

357
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,960
But, what brought you here today?

358
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,480
The book you asked has arrived.

359
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,920
I called you, but no answer.

360
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,600
So I brought it to you in person.

361
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,640
Sorry for the trouble.

362
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,160
My phone was smashed by a robber.

363
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,840
So…

364
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,400
A robber?

365
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,200
Are you alright?

366
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,200
I’m fine.

367
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,680
I just got some bruise.

368
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,160
Can’t believe such a crazy thing

369
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,320
would happen in a law-based society.

370
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,560
Because someone asked him to do it.

371
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,960
Did you offend someone

372
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,040
or get in the way of someone’s interests?

373
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,120
Don’t get me wrong.

374
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,000
I just wanna tell you

375
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,480
that you should sometimes

376
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,280
act tough

377
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,240
when working in an investment bank.

378
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,480
Because that’s the only way

379
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,840
to protect yourself better.

380
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,280
Act tough?

381
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,160
Yes.

382
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,160
I’m just speaking from experience.

383
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,920
Remember,

384
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,800
when you come across

385
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,480
a tough guy holding a cashbox,

386
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,880
you have to be tougher.

387
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,440
I’m afraid I won’t be able to do that.

388
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,720
Do you have another solution?

389
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,920
If you can’t act tough,

390
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,160
then you should try

391
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,080
to replace the cashbox holder!

392
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,440
But I’m just a tiny ant.

393
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,640
How can I remove a big rock?

394
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,000
That’s true.

395
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,720
How can a tiny ant

396
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,120
remove a big rock

397
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,720
on even ground?

398
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,280
But it’ll be another story

399
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,600
if it’s on the edge of a cliff.

400
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,400
You are back!

401
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,000
What are you doing here?

402
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,360
I’m just stopping by.

403
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,120
What’s with your face?

404
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,480
I’m fine.

405
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,520
It was an accident that was unexpected.

406
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,280
It’s okay.

407
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,400
Let me help you.

408
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,600
No need.

409
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,520
I’m not a child anymore.

410
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,800
So, what’s up?

411
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,200
Though Wan Shan appears to be calm,

412
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,640
I’m sure he’s wrong-footed already.

413
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,800
It’s a good opportunity for GE to make a move.

414
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,640
Got it. Don’t worry.

415
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,880
I’ve got everything

416
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,280
in control so far.

417
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
Looks like you’ve changed.

418
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,640
You’ll do whatever it takes to achieve your goal.

419
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,440
You taught me that.

420
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,920
I thought you’d help Jiang Jun,

421
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,040
but now I see

422
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,400
that she’s just a pawn to you.

423
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,280
I’m wondering

424
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,840
how she’d look like when she realizes

425
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,680
you’ve been using her.

426
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,800
She’s just a pawn.

427
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,640
Who cares how she’d look like?

428
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,720
Moreover,

429
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,720
she’s become

430
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,600
a dagger with which I’ll stab
into the rival’s heart.

431
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,960
Really?

432
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,800
Then you should be careful.

433
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
Don’t let the dagger

434
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
hurt yourself.

435
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Understood.

436
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,800
I’m leaving.

437
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,400
Good luck on your plan!

438
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,720
See you tomorrow at work!

439
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,320
Keep an eye on Du Lei from now on.

440
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,000
Report to me his whereabouts

441
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,320
and the people he meets!

442
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
Wait for me!

443
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,680
Wait!

444
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,720
Jiang Jun.

445
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,720
Get in.

446
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,320
Thank you! I’ll wait for the next round.

447
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,640
Boss,

448
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
you guys fought again?

449
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,840
A moment of discord

450
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,120
may lead to a lifetime regret.

451
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,600
So funny!

452
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,680
It hurts so bad!

453
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,520
Mr. Yuan!

454
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,960
Seriously! You know?

455
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
-When I recall it…
-I’m telling you…

456
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,120
My…

457
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,800
You two enjoy your conversation a lot, huh?

458
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,680
Is it because you don’t have enough work to do?

459
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,360
Recheck all the data

460
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,280
and give it to me in five minutes!

461
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,420
[Enter]

462
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,840
Yum!

463
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,400
Right?

464
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,240
It took me a long time to finally get them.

465
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,920
You’ve got to enjoy it slowly.

466
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,920
Boss,

467
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Jiang Jun bought macaroons.

468
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,480
Have a taste!

469
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,440
Go get fat!

470
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,080
Boss, you won’t mind, will you?

471
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,200
Choke on it!

472
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,160
Boss,

473
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
this is Mr. Luo.

474
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,320
Mr. Luo, nice to meet you!

475
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,760
I’m Luo Sheng. Nice to meet you!

476
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,600
Yuan Shuai.

477
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,800
This way, please.

478
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,680
Please.

479
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,400
Sorry,

480
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,040
I was dancing and lost track of time.

481
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,920
Sorry to let you wait.

482
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,720
Never mind.

483
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,000
What happened to your wrist?

484
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,480
It’s okay.

485
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,720
I twisted it when I danced.

486
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,600
It’s to steady it.

487
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
Why do you work so hard?

488
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,800
I started learning to dance when I was four.

489
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,440
I can overcome all kinds

490
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,640
of injuries and pain,

491
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,120
because my dream is to let everybody

492
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,760
watch me shine on the stage.

493
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,680
Although I don’t have a favorable background

494
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
or goodfortune,

495
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,920
I can work hard to make my skills

496
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,000
impeccable!

497
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,280
So how could a dozen of years of my hard work

498
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,880
go in vain just because of one single person?

499
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,200
That’s the dream of my life!

500
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,040
But in his eyes, it’s just a dirty deal.

501
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,600
I think

502
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,880
I owe you an apology.

503
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,400
I once suspected you before I knew clearly

504
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,840
what kinda person he was.

505
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
But now I know how despicable he is.

506
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,640
It’s okay.

507
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,680
Thank you for choosing to trust me again!

508
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,040
Miss Jiang,

509
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,920
why do you wanna see me today?

510
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,080
I want to tell you

511
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,440
to be more careful

512
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,480
when you go out.

513
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,600
Not long after we met last time,

514
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,440
Wan Shan sent someone to follow me.

515
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,960
My phone was even smashed.

516
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,400
Then, we…

517
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,960
At this point,

518
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,520
the harder they try

519
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,960
to bury their evildoings,

520
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,640
the more we should expose the truth

521
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,160
and have them nowhere to hide.

522
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,440
So,

523
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
you’ve got to learn

524
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,120
to protect yourself with the weapons of law.

525
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,260

[Chengtian Law Firm Lawyer Lin Moran]

529
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,080
He’s quite experienced

530
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,320
in dealing with cases like this.

I’m sure he can help you.

532

The IPO is just in a few days.

533

Where can I find a cashbox holder?

534
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,560
Where’s the gust that’ll blow the rock
over the cliff?

535
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,640
Jiang Jun,

536
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,400
you can’t get it done even if

537
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,720
you don’t eat and sleep this week!

538
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,120
If you can’t file in time,

539
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,320
the man next door will double the punishment!

540
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,840
Why can’t you just give in?

541
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,600
Hasn’t he made you suffer enough in childhood?

542
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,360
And he’s your boss now.

543
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,640
If he wants you to suffer,

544
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
he’d have multiple ways to do that!

545
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,720
It’s too difficult!

546
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,080
No.

547
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,400
I need to take a shower to clear my head!

548
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,800
What’s going on?

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,880
if I can pay the water bill.

569
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,280
Sorry, it’s too late.

570
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,400
The one who’s in charge of that
has got off work.

571
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,000
You can come over tomorrow.

572
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,560
Tomorrow?

573
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,440
I can’t wait till tomorrow.

574
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,120
I have an emergency.

575
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,000
Could you please make an exception?

576
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,640
I’m really sorry, Miss,

577
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,080
but we already got off work.

578
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,280
Okay.

579
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,520

580
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,280
I’m sorry, Miss.

Closed?

584
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,150
So

585
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,120
what am I supposed to do
as I work during the weekends?

586
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,630
The people live in this community

587
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,840

588
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,600

Why do all the weird things
have to happen to me?

You think I don’t have any water?

595
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,360
I don’t believe it!

596
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,190
There must be some in the fridge!

597
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,800
I guess I was wrong.

598

Do you know when you’ll come back?

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,000
I’m not sure.

607
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,600
