00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 8

3
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,479
When you were little, you were even

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,640
confused about the speech topic.

5
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,360
How dare you bring it up again?

6
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,720
I am sorry.

7
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,720
I forgot to knock on the door.

8
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,480
Mr. Yuan.

9
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
Ms. Qiao, I need to go now.

10
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,320
Hello.

11
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,520
Happy birthday!

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,040
Thank you.

13
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,240
Happy birthday, Mr. Du!

14
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,640
Thank you.

15
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,880
Mr. Du, a toast to our cooperation.

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,160
Thank you.

17
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,880
Here, to Mr. Du!

18
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,880
Dad.

19
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
I wish you good health

20
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
and happy birthday!

21
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,480
All right, thank you.

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,960
Dad,

23
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
happy birthday!

24
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,240
I thought you were not coming.

25
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,760
It seems your sister was thoughtful.

26
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,760
No, dad.

27
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,080
He is very busy lately.

28
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,160
Did I ask you?

29
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Don’t come over if you’re busy.

30
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,560
Why did you force yourself,

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,360
if you don’t really mean it?

32
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,400
Hypocrite.

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,680
But since you are here,

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,840
remember, it’s my birthday dinner.

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
You may leave now,

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,000
if you put on that poker face.

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Got it.

38
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,240
Please take care.

39
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,040
I am sorry.

40
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,120
No problem.

41
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Mr. Du.

42
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,760
Is that your daughter?

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
What a beautiful girl!

44
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,920
Why don’t you introduce her to us?

45
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,760
Linda.

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,720
Come here.

47
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
Come on.

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,280
Let me introduce you to

49
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,200
Mr. and Mrs. Zhai.

50
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,680
Nice to meet you.

51
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,560
This is their son.

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
This is my daughter Linda.

54
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,269
Linda is so beautiful.

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,000
She looks like at the same age as my son.

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,680
Linda.

57
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,440
Linda.

58
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,520
Linda!

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,680
Mrs. Zhai is talking with you.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
I thought you have left.

61
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,360
If I had left like this today,

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
would you spare me the next time?

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
Next year,

64
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,960
it will not be just a birthday gift.

65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,680
I may need to give a talent show before I leave.

66
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,120
You are making a joke.

67
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,560
So it means it’s not too bad.

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,640
I know you didn’t want to come at all.

69
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,480
But dad treats you like a son of his own.

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
Please be more understanding.

71
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
A son of his own?

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Is that so?

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,640
I’m just a substitute.

74
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,880
I’ve never treated you like a substitute.

75
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,600
In my heart,

76
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,800
you are who you are.

77
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,080
Really?

78
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,240
25 minutes.

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,120
A new record!

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,800
Congratulations, Mr. Wan!

81
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,320
Thank you.

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,280
I may ask favors of you two,

83
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,120
all right?

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,280
Let’s scratch each other’s back.

85
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,520
Sure.

86
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,080
Mr. Wan.

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,480
Congratulations, your dream has come true!

88
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,040
The new CEO of Wanxing!

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,960
Excuse me,

90
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,120
let’s catch up next time.

91
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,640
OK.

92
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,440
I’d like to introduce myself.

93
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,800
I am Du Lei, Executive Director of

94
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,720
Investment Banking Department at GE.

95
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Like father, like son.

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,920
Thank you.

97
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,680
I just took the office at a critical time

98
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
thanks to the trust of the company.

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,360
I’m just doing my job,

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,640
so it’s not my dream has come true.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,960
I picked the wrong words.

102
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,200
After the talent show, Wanxing’s

103
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,960
estimated assets are at the peak now.

104
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,240
And your taking the office

105
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,280
is a very good news for

106
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
the IPO.

107
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,120
Mr. Du is such a veteran banker.

108
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,480
You’re very sensitive.

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,440
But unfortunately,

110
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,160
when the late Chairman was alive,

111
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,360
MH has been our trusted partner.

112
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
So….

113
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,920
I think you misunderstood…

114
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,880
I’m not here for business.

115
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
I just want to remind you that

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,400
I know Yuan Shuai well.

117
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,200
He can’t be fooled easily.

118
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,520
You are not talking about cooperation,

119
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,440
but giving me some tips.

120
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
Then I have to say,

121
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,920
thanks, but no need.

122
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
Mr. Wan,

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,440
I believe you will come to me soon.

124
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,420
[FamilyMart]

125
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,400
Li,

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,760
give me a cup of coffee.

127
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,440
Skip the coffee.

128
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,760
Take this, here.

129
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,240
How do you like my new slippers?

130
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
A gift from my Prince Charming.

131
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,800
Nice.

132
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,520
Good for work, leisure,

133
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,320
beach and shower.

134
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Jiang Jun,

135
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
what’s wrong?

136
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,440
Is it karma when it comes to Yuan Shuai?

137
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
Did I owe him in my last life?

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
Again!

139
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,920
Did he bully you again?

140
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,480
Let me help you out!

141
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,600
No.

142
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,040
It’s just some misunderstanding

143
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,800
in the office today.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We were studying on a case

145
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
when Ms. Qiao broke in.

146
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,280
At that time,

147
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
our postures were

148
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,360
a little embarrassing.

149
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,080
Jiang Jun.

150
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,160
What?

151
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,120
You may have triggered a love triangle.

152
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,800
The typical plot in chick-lit

153
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,280
urban office fiction.

154
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,640
What’s that?

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is she stunning

156
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
and bossy?

157
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,680
Does she often go to Yuan Shuai’s office,

158
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
and never knock on the door

159
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,520
when she enters?

160
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
So, what’s the conclusion?

161
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,600
There is only one truth.

162
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
You are doomed.

163
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,360
You may have become a throne in her side.

164
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,040
So out-dated?

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,760
So,

166
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,240
what will be the next?

167
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
Give me some clues to get out of this.

168
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,560
Next, she’s going to pull her rank on you,

169
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,960
and

170
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,960
keep an eye on you

171
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,880
until she gets a hold over you.

172
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,840
Then strike out at you

173
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
with full force.

174
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,080
Good morning.

175
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,360
Morning.

176
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,400
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

177
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,520
The difference between a solider and a bandit

178
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
is a sense of ritual.

179
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,080
It means a sense of ritual is important.

180
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,800
It is necessary for working here, too.

181
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,640
Stop showing up in the office in these

182
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,720
tacky IT girl clothes.

183
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,560
IT girl…

184
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Next, she’s going to pull her rank on you

185
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
and

186
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,200
keep an eye on you

187
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,240
until she gets a hold over you.

188
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,560
Then

189
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,720
strike out at you with full force.

190
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,480
It can’t be so dramatic.

191
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,440
I’ve read your reports.

192
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,600
Chen Yicheng,

193
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,560
well done.

00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,600
How do you explain it

384
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,560
to his face

385
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,800

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,240
None of my business.

391
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,560
You may leave now.

392
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,920
Why aren’t you leaving?

393
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,960
I’ve got something for you.

You’re laughing, Yuan Shuai.

Stop being mad at me.

I know you care about me,

399
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,440
but why can’t you be nicer?

400
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,520
Why so serious?

401
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,360
Seriously.

402
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,960
So now you intend to call your boss

403
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,720

404
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,960
I’m sorry, Mr. Yuan.

405
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,360
Get out now.

406
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,200
All right.

414
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,320
just now.

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,480
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

Shen Xin,

417
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,200
Mr. Yuan asked you to get in.

418
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,360
Ms. Qiao,

419
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,520
we’re leaving now.

420
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,640
Ms. Qiao, I’m leaving, too.

Why does Wan Shan have

422
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
a resting room in the office.

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,960
Why did a girl come out of it at midnight?

The bullied girl was also acting weird.

425
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,520
She was bullied at such a big company.

426
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
It’s not like shooting a movie.

427
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,920
How could she live with it?

428
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,240
She did not go to the police either.

429
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,280
It’s like she wants to keep it quiet.

430
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,760
There must be something going on.

431
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,560

I came here to look for it.

453

It’s a gift from grandma asking my cousin

I’m fine.

Honestly,

517
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,200
since I helped you out last time,

518
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,160
I’ve felt there’s obviously something odd.

519
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,200
Why was everyone

520
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,280
quiet about the bully against you?

521
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,480
Then I found

522
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,160
someone with a senior position

523
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,160
is working against you.

524
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,160
And considering your status quo,

525
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,760
I guess this senior officer

526
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,840
is Wan Shan, right?

527
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,800

528
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,680
stop holding it back.

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,360
If you keep silent now,

530
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,040
then I can’t help you with anything.

531
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,000
But what’s the use of speaking it out.

532
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,080
I can’t take him down.

533
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
How do you know if you haven’t tried?

534
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,160
If you keep it quiet,

535
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,000
it may happen to you again.

other people, too.

538
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,920
What I can assure you is

539
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,320
if it’s proved his wrongdoing

540
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,360
may affect Wanxing’s IPO,

541
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,560
other shareholders will surely

542
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
force him to step down.

543
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,680
Not long ago,

544
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,040
I attended the contest of “Come on, sisters”,

545
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
I was eliminated.

546
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,960
But right before the repechage,

547
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,400
Wan Shan came to me.

548
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I watched your performance.

549
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,680
It’s a good show,

550
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,280
but lacks popularity among the audience.

551
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,360
So the company decided

552
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,240
to give you another chance.

553
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,400

As long as you sign on this contract,

558
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
you have my word.

559
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,960
I will ask the program crew

560
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,240
to bring you back in the repechage.

561
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,600
Then you can be part of the idol group

00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,640

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,800
But first,

572
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,320
we need to sign this contract tomorrow.

573
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,880
Besides,

574
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,720
it’s up to you if…

575
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,360
You want to be my sweetheart.

576
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
Mr. Wan!

577
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,880
-Why don’t you get it?
-Mr. Wan!

578
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,320
Tang Xin...

579
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,200
What’s wrong?

580
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,960
Water... Water...

581
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,040
Water... What’s wrong with the water?

582
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,840
Are you all right?

583
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,600
Tang Xin...

584
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,520
What’s wrong with the water?

585
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,080
Tang Xin...

586
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,600
Tang Xin...

587
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,400
My little sweetheart!

588
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,200
When I woke up,

589
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,400
I found myself disheveled

590
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
at a strange place.

591
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,560
The monster Wan Shan was lying next to me.

592
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,880
I ran out when he was sleeping.

593
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,920
I found it’s a secret resting room

594
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,680
in his office.

595
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,160
The monster came to me a few times later.

596
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,200
This is my evidence.

597
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,560
Tang Xin,

598
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,120
if you listened to me,

599
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,560
how could you end up like this?

600
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,600
But it’s not too late.

601
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,280
Be my sweetheart and make me happy,

602
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,840
I can still make you a pop star.

603
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,120
How could he?!

604
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,320
I thought he was just

605
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,640
taking advantage of his position

606
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,880
to take bribes from you.

607
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,480
I didn’t expect him to be

608
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,760
such a monster.

609
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,560
Miss Tang,

610
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,320
these are out of my expectation.

611
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,480
But if you would like to believe me,

612
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,520
can you give me a copy of your evidence?

613
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,630
I’ll find a way.

614
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,190
Miss Jiang.

615
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,280
I’m desperate now.

616
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,560
You are my last hope.

617
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,710
I understand.

618
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,580
[Mr. Du]

619
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,080
Miss Jiang.

620
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,440
Mr. Du.

621
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,440
Is anyone running after you?

622
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,400
I feel like being stalked.

623
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,880
Perhaps I’m too sensitive.

624
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,520
It’s too late now.

625
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,080
Why are you wandering alone?

626
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,200
I came for work nearby.

627
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,000
My car is parked not far away.

628
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,480
How about I give you a ride?

629
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,080
OK.

630
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,040
Thank you, Mr. Du.

631
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
Sorry to trouble you so many times.

632
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
In fact, you can keep calling me teacher.

633
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,640
I can’t share your burden

634
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,600
at work.

635
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,360
But I am older

636
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,360
and I’ve experienced much more

637
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,840
than you do.

638
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,080
Talking about age, I just realized,

639
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,880
you keep in such a good shape.

640
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,480
I didn’t notice before.

641
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,320
You are much older than me.

642
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,680
I’m just used to you calling me teacher.

643
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,480
All right,

644
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,280
I’ll call you teacher.

645
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,000
By the way, teacher,

646
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,920
what are you doing here?

647
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,080
I came to visit a friend on my father’s behalf.

648
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,520
A newly-elected CEO.

649
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,360
A newly-elected CEO.

650
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,080
Wanxing Entertainment?

651
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,080
Yes.

652
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,160
Do you know Wan Shan too?

653
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,240
Not really.

654
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,800
I’m just impressed.

655
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,720
He is so good at making pop stars.

656
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,520
How long have you known each other?

657
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,840
From childhood.

658
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,360
He visited my home sometimes.

659
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,720
Can I ask something about him?

660
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,720
I just thought he is awesome.

661
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
And I saw him on a lot of

662
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,240
TV shows now.

663
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,200
Among all the judges,

664
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,680
he is the harshest one.

665
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,320
But he has the sharpest eyes.

666
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,480
Every time, the ones he picked became popular.

667
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,240
Is there any secret?

668
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,600
Why?

669
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,840
Do you want to be a paparazzo?

670
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,040
Just curious.

671
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,000
Which girl isn’t curious about the gossip in

672
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,040
the entertainment industry?

673
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,440
Well, the variety shows,

674
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
they are just for fun.

675
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,840
Don’t take them seriously.

676
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,160
The stories behind are complicated.

677
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,360
It seems like you’re really interested

678
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,920
in Wan Shan.

679
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,520
He is my father’s friend,

680
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,120
but I need to warn you.

681
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,360
For pretty girls,

682
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,240
it’s better to stay away from him.

683
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,600
OK.

684
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,800
No more questions.

685
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,640
Thank you, teacher.

686
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,320
See you.

687
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,400
OK.

688
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,680
One more thing,

689
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,440
don’t wander around

690
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,040
at night.

691
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,600
Call me if you need anything.

692
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,840
I’d like to be your driver.

693
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,720
OK.

694
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,520
Good night.

695
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,720
Good night.

696
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,400
What’s this about?

697
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,720
I’ve told you.

698
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,360
Stay away from her.

699
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,480
Then you just came to my building?

700
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,760
If you really care about her,

701
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,800
you’d better watch out.

702
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,220
[FamilyMart]

703
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,760
Why hasn’t he arrived?

704
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,720
Xiaochuan, a seat is kept for you.

705
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,800
When do you plan to come over?

706
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,120
You.

707
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Not planning to collect the money?

708
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,480
I’m sorry.

709
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,680
7 yuan.

710
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,640
How about adding me on WeChat?

711
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,600
I can tip you, all right?

712
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,740
[No tipping, no flirting!]

713
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,440
Mr. Wan, Miss Jiang is here.

714
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,080
Miss Jiang.

715
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
Please have a seat.

716
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,720
Mr. Wan, what is it for

717
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,880
to invite me here today?

718
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,960
The reason I invited you here is

719
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,360
a few days ago,

720
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,040
I heard that a little girl, Tang Xin

721
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,520
of our company

722
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,880
talked nonsense to you.

723
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,880
You know,

724
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,560
some times when kids are under pressure,

725
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,000
they imagine things and talk nonsense.

726
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,760
Miss Jiang, I believe a smart person like you,

727
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,520
will not believe the nonsense of a kid.

728
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,160
Mr. Wan, I am flattered to hear that.

729
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,120
But I can’t take the money by any means.

730
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,000
Miss Jiang, this is...

731
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,840
Trust me,

732
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,440
I know what to do.

733
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,440
Need to go now.

734
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
It is filmed.

735
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,240
Go destroy Jiang Jun’s phone,

736
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,600
and give her a lesson.

737
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,440
Give me your phone!
