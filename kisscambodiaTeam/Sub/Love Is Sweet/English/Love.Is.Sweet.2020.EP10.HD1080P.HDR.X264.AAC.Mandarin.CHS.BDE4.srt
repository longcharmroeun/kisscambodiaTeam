Can’t believe Wan Shan is such a hypocrite!

5
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
So Tang Xin was going to make her debut
through hidden rules!

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,880
Really?

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,400
Of course.

00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,960
Take a look.

9
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,440
It’s obviously Tang Xin’s trick
to catch attention!

10
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,280

ended the contract with you before

What will you say about that, Mr. Wan?

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Yes. Please answer us, Mr. Wan!

Tang Xin’s accusation against me

56
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,760
was totally made-up nonsense!

57
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,320
What?

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,080
If she has evidence,

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,920
I’d love to confront her in person.

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,960
As for why she did this

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,280

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,040

to prosecute her.

73

I’ve consulted the law firm.

74
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,000
If the accusation is proved to be true,

75
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,400
it’ll probably be considered criminal case.

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,880
The IPO will be hopeless by then.

130
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,040

It’d be easy to crack it, you know?

190
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,400
But it’s good that you changed it.

191
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,920
Too many people used it before.

192
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,680
Slow WiFi speed would affect work efficacy.

193
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,400
So what?

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,480
No one would force you to use it!

195
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,360
You are mad at me?

196
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,720
No.

197
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,360
I’m just a

198
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,240
“Continent Store girl.”

199
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,280
How would I dare get mad?

200
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,840
You are referring to the alias on WeChat?

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,760
That’s the quickest way to find you.

202
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,200
Is that why you blocked me?

203
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,720
How do you know?

204
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,760
Do you check my moments often?

205
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,840
You should know how often

206
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,680
you post moments.

207
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,960
Although the things you post are meaningless,

208
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,920
they are always fun to look at.

209
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,400
That’s all?

210
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,520
You came to my school the other day, right?

211
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,760
I really wanna thank you

212
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,080
for organizing my desk for me,

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,280
but you must have done it for a reason.

214
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:43,920
I…

215
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,640
I like things to be organized, okay?

216
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,840
Sorry!

217
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,640
I took your girlfriend’s job!

218
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,120
When did I have a girlfriend?

219
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,520
Stop pretending.

220
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,160
I saw it already.

221
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,840
You name her “Sweet.”

222
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,960
“Sweet” is just a beta test account.

223
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,480
It’s designed for chatting purpose.

224
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,840
It’d send message every day.

225
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,760
Look at you.

226
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,720
You came to my school
and organized my desk all of a sudden.

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,120
You also changed your WiFi password,

228
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,560
thought I had a girlfriend,

229
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,320
and blocked me from your moments.

230
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,680
You

231
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,480
must

232
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,880
need a favor from me!

233
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,760
Right?

234
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,320
Yes.

235
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,720
That’s correct!

236
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,840
I have a friend

237
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,680
who’s also working on an AI account.

238
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,280
I hope you can help

239
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,560
to run a beta test.

240
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,080
Sure.

241
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,560
“Sweet” is also

242
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,440
in the development stage.

243
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,440
I can help you with the test.

244
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,080
Really?

245
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,720
Then I’ll let her add you tonight.

246
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,640
So we are good now?

247
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,200
Xiaochuan, wait for me!

248
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,520
What friend?

249
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,800
What AI account?

250
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
Just a bunch of unemotional data.

251
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
How can they compare to the constant

252
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,600
warm greetings from a real person like me?

253
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,560
Come on!

254
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,280
Dear Xiaochuan,

255
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,840
I’m your friend Shirley.

256
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:28,300
[Li Xiaochuan has accepted your friend request]

257
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,320
Hi! I’m Shirley.

258
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,000
I will be with you forever

259
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,480
in joy or in pain,

260
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,640
in happiness or in sadness.

261
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,920
Too talkative. Need to be improved.

262
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,880
Mr. Wan.

263
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,920
Are you here drinking for fun

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,960
or in grief?

265
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,520
Mocking me?

266
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,520
There’s no way I’d be defeated by a woman!

267
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Besides, it’s not possible that she

268
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,880
holds any hard evidence.

269
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,560
Mr. Wan.

270
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,880
You

271
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,760
are always over-confident.

272
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,040
Under the circumstances,

273
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,240
whom are you fighting against?

274
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,240
That Tang Xin?

275
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,880
Sure,

276
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,240
maybe she really has

277
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,240
some evidence that you don’t’ even know about.

278
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,680
That Jiang Jun

279
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,400
is just your pawn, isn’t she?

280
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,640
You told me intentionally

281
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,080
that she approached Tang Xin.

282
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,480
Turns out it wasn’t for background check,

283
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
but talking Tang Xin into suing me.

284
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,640
Am I right?

285
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,640
I was wondering as coward as Tang Xin was,

286
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,800
how could she dare…

287
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,640
Why?

288
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,160
I’ve always wanted to help you.

289
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,360
With a thing like this, it’s better to
make it go away than fight against it.

290
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,160
Tang Xin is just a nobody. A small mess from her

291
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,360
is way better than a serious lesson

292
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,840
from Yuan Shuai.

293
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,280
Yuan Shuai?

294
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,720
He’s dumb and quiet.

295
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,200
What can he do?

296
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,310
Well.

297
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
He can’t do much.

298
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,440
But,

299
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,400
he has joined hands

300
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,400
with the rival you are afraid of the most,

301
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,680
trying to take you down

302
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,829
in a more graceful way.

303
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,829
How did you know that?

304
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,069
I’m not quite sure.

305
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,760
But at least

306
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,320
I know him better than you do.

307
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,760
So, at this point,

308
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
you can only trust me.

309
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,680
Xiang Ding,

310
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,120
have you categorized the work reports for me?

311
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,640
I’ve sent you last night.

312
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,280
Check your mailbox.

313
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,800
Okay. Thank you!

314
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,280
How about the latest valuation report?

315
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
Miss Jiang,

316
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:31,880
look.

317
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,160
I’ve been doing it the whole night.
It’s too much.

318
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,120
I’ll do my best.

319
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,240
The valuation report is done.

320
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Really? Already?

321
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,800
You are both novices at this.

322
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,960
I knew you’d have a hard time to do it.

323
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,080
Thank you very much!

324
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,080
It’s such a miracle

325
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
that I can get this job done on time!

326
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,840
Take a look.

327
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,640
Tang Xin backed down.

328
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,120
[Lawyer Statement]

329
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,340
It’s true.
[Lawyer Statement]

330
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,640
It’s true.

331
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,760
It is.

332
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,040
The girls nowadays would do

333
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,080
anything to get famous!

334
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,800
It’s not possible!

335
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,280
Why not?

336
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,400
You even colluded with GE

337
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,160
to sabotage our company.

338
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,080
What are you talking about?

339
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
You are pretty close
with our rival company’s ED.

340
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,920
Jiang Jun,

341
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,240
I think you are

342
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,920
going to join GE,

343
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,520
so you are using Wanxing’s case

344
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,960
as your stepping stone.

345
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,240
What’s that about?

346
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,080
No.

347
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,000
There’s no work relationship between us.

348
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,160
He’s just my friend.

349
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,520
I have never betrayed our company.

350
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,680
And I didn’t even know Tang Xin backed down.

351
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,320
I will…

352
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,480
Why would we trust you?

353
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,280
It’s a critical time for the case.

354
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
Any piece of information is confidential.

355
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,320
You, however, don’t care about it at all.

356
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,560
In my opinion,

357
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
you might have even planned
Tang Xin’s withdrawal,

358
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,840
so that Wanxing will stop working with us

359
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,120
and turn to GE!

360
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,600
-How could I…
-Enough!

361
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,880
You’d better make this thing right.

362
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,280
Otherwise, what awaits you

363
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,200
won’t be just a simple punishment!

364
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,840
Do you know

365
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
that your subordinate has connection

366
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,960
with GE?

367
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,520
I know.

368
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,440
You know? Shame on you!

369
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
Tang Xin already backed down.

370
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,960
How are we gonna face Wanxing now?

371
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,360
I even said that you had leadership
on the Board meeting.

372
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,000
Leadership?

373
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,880
Turns out it’s just a joke!

374
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
Mr. Fan, don’t worry!

375
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,240
I will take care of this thing.

376
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,660
[Tang Xin tried all means to get to the top.]

377
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,480
Sorry, the subscriberyoudialedis busy now.

378
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,800
Hello?

379
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,200
I’m begging you! Please leave me alone!

380
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,600
I’m sorry, Jiang Jun,

381
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,320
but he has some unsightly pictures of me.

382
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,120
He forced me to shoot the videos online.

383
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,960
I had no other choice but
to withdraw the charges!

384
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,920
I really had no choice!

385
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,360
Calm down.

386
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,320
Since it’s already happened,

387
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
we need to figure out a way
to solve the problem.

388
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,560
Backing down will only
encourage their wrongdoings!

389
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,160
Are you home? I’ll come to see you.

390
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,280
Okay.

391
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,120
Okay.

392
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,480
Who are you?

393
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Miss Tang, I’m here to help you.

394
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Do I know you?

395
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,520
What do you mean, you are here to help?

396
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,360
It doesn’t matter who I am.

397
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,000
What matters is

398
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I’m here today

399
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,480
to offer you

400
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,280
a best solution.

401
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
Your incident

402
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,360
has made such an uproar.

403
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,120
You should know

404
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,680
that things end up like this

405
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,440
because of your reckless mind back then.

406
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,360
I can help you get rid

407
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,000
of all the negative comments online.

408
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,880
And I can find a new team
to guide the public opinions.

409
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,160
I think it won’t take long before taking

410
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
the netizens’ attention away from you.

411
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,840
We don’t even know each other.

412
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,240
Why would you help me?

413
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,520
That’s a good question.

414
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,640
I certainly

415
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,640
am not a philanthropist.

416
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,840
I do have my purpose

417
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,800
in helping you.

418
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,960
When this thing is settled,

419
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I will offer you a contract of a new agency,

420
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,600
which, I promise,

421
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,640
will be much better than Wanxing.

422
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,800
So, since you’ve withdrawn the charges,

423
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
I hope you’ll stop thinking too much.

424
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,960
Do not do anything

425
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,080
you’ll regret about later.

426
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,280
Tang Xin! It’s me!

427
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,400
Tang Xin!

428
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,800
Tang Xin!

429
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,120
Are you alright? Why don’t you open the door?

430
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,880
Tang Xin!

431
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,120
Tang Xin!

432
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,640
I don’t know why

433
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,760
you refuse to see me,

434
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,680
but I’m sure

435
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,880
you can hear me.

436
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,320
I’ve seen the news on Weibo.

437
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,240
I know you are under

438
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,200
a lot of pressure right now.

439
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,560
But you’ve got to know

440
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,880
that I’m here to help you!

441
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
I know that, to get where you are today,

442
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,880
you’ve been much-maligned.

443
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Whatever you do would be criticized.

444
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,360
Every step you go is difficult for you.

445
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,760
Hadn’t been for your passion,

446
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,420
you wouldn’t have been able to go this far.

447
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,440
[Tang]
you wouldn’t have been able to go this far.

448
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,080
[Tang]

449
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,940
Yes. Escape may help,
[Tang]

450
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,520
Yes. Escape may help,

451
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,840
but every time you escape and compromise

452
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,840
will be a new start of a nightmare.

453
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,280
I don’t want you to bear the burden

454
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,160
that the others impose on you!

455
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,920
Do you understand?

456
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,440
So, I hope you can gather your courage,

457
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,000
and fight your way out!

458
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
It’s painful to travel against the current,

459
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,120
but if you don’t try

460
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,360
to fight destiny,

461
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,640
how can you find out

462
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,400
which is your true self?

463
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,520
Please leave.

464
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,480
I won’t see you again.

465
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,400
Alright.

466
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,280
I respect your choice.

467
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,560
No matter what,

468
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,240
I wish you good luck.

469
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,960
Sounds like you’ve made up your mind.

470
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,400
It’s a smart choice.

471
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:06,920
Hello?

472
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,600
I’m going to speed up now.

473
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,880
It’ll be a good show tomorrow.

474
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,000
Congratulations, Mr. Wan!

475
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,120
But I’ve got to warn you.

476
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,240
If your “gold fish” shows up tomorrow

477
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,120
and makes trouble,

478
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
I won’t go easy on her.

479
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,080
You won’t feel

480
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,000
sorry for her, will you?

481
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,640
I dare you!

482
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,080
It angers you already?

483
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,200
Don’t forget

484
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,800
that we are on the same boat now.

485
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,200
If I let out the thing you told me…

486
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,280
Mr. Wan, don’t forget

487
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
that I know a lot of your secrets

488
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,080
that’ll destroy you.

489
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,200
Be careful with what you say!

490
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,400
I don’t want you to bear the burden

491
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,280
that the others impose on you!

492
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,960
Do you understand?

493
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,680
So, I hope you can gather your courage,

494
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,040
and fight your way out!

495
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,200
It’s painful to travel against the current,

496
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,800
but if you don’t try

497
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,120
to fight destiny,

498
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,480
how can you find out

499
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,240
which is your true self?

500
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,180
One, two, three!

501
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,320
I feel like I’m looking at an ant on a hot pan.

502
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,800
An ant with dark circles.

503
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,480
It’s not the time to joke around.

504
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,000
You are worried about Tang Xin?

505
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,960
I went to her home today,

506
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,440
but she refused to see me.

507
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,280
I don’t know what happened.

508
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
No worry.

509
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,240
Since Wan Shan already released

510
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
the video,

511
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,920
then she’s no longer important

512
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
to him.

513
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,920
No matter what evidence she holds,

514
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,120
it won’t be a threat to Wan Shan anymore.

515
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,040
So, she’ll be safe.

516
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,360
But Wan Shan won’t

517
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,320
let us off easily.

518
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,320
I will go apologize to Mr. Fan.

519
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,720
I’ll take full responsibility.

520
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,160
Why are you laughing?

521
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
It’s not easy

522
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,360
to hear you say

523
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,600
“us.”

524
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,560
Shifting blame to my employee

525
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,400
is not my style.

526
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,080
Have you ever seen anything

527
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,720
that your brother Yuanyuan

528
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,840
couldn’t handle?

529
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,520
You are too old to be called brother Yuanyuan!

530
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,760
So, you’ve had an idea?

531
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,520
We can’t give up until the very end.

532
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,600
The coffee

533
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,240
is to prep you for a war.

534
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,280
Here, cheers!

535
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,240
Cheers!

536
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,600
Hello? Su Chang.

537
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,240
Boss.

538
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,800
Wanxing will hold an interim

539
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,280
Board meeting at 9:00 am today.

540
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,040
You and Mr. Fan are required to join.

541
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,320
Okay, I see.

542
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,600
Jiang Jun,

543
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,000
I’ll send you a location

544
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,720
and a number later.

545
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,720
Make sure to find this person
before 9:00 o’clock

546
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,600
and ask him to fix the phone ASAP.

547
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,720
The phone?

548
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,240
Yes.

549
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,160
It’s very important.

550
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,000
We don’t have much time left.

551
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,600
Do you think you can do it for me?

552
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,720
You can count on me!

553
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,400
Okay.

554
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,520
I’ll get going.

555
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,900
[FamilyMart]

556
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,800
There’s a highly-skilled expert in the
convenience store downstairs?

557
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,000
Seriously?

558
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,240
Pretty tall indeed!

559
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Hello! Welcome!

560
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,920
Li!

561
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,760
Jiang Jun!

562
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Why aren’t you at work? Why do you…

563

I’m here to find…

I know you are here to see me, right?

565
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,600
Tell me…

566
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,600
I’m not here to see you.
I’m looking for an expert.

567
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,680
An expert?

568
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,040
Like Yao Ming?

569
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,040
He’s never been here.

570
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,680
But, what do you think of that one?

571
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,560
Not bad.

572
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,880
Do you know who he is?

573
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,680
I’m busy right now. I’ll talk to you later.

574
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Since you are here,

575
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,880
let me introduce him to…

576
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,320
Hello?

577
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,920
I’m over here!

578
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,040
He

579
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,880
is the expert you are looking for?

580
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,960
What’s going on?

581
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,440
What do you mean?

582
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
How did you know him?

583
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,800
We’ve never met before.

584
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,480
Are you into him?

585
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,320
Stop the nonsense!
I have something urgent to talk to him!

586
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,360
Hi, I’m Jiang Jun.

587
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,960
Hi, I’m Li Xiaochuan.

588
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,440
I’m here for the phone.

589
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,440
This is your phone, right?

590
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,440
I’m trying to recover the data,

591
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,720
but it’s a little difficult,

592
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,960
so I need more time.

593
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,400
It’s an emergency and I need the data.

594
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,440
Could you please hurry up?

595
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,080
Thank you so much!

596
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,760
Alright.

597
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,600
Yuan Shuai,

598
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,200
so he’s your secret weapon.

[Wanxing Entertainment]

600
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,200
Sorry, gentlemen.

601
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,160
I’m late.

602
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,520
Because of some personal issues,

603
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,960
I had a small trouble recently

604
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,960
and it caused a bad influence on our company.

605
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,480
I sincerely apologize to all of you.

606
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,800
But fortunately,

607
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,400
the truth has been revealed,

608
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,240
and I’ve proved my innocence.

609
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,120
I really appreciate

610
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,520
your continuous trust.

611
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,600
I’ll get the company

612
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,960
back on track

613
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,720
as soon as possible.

614
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,520
Although the problem is solved,

615
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,800
the company’s interests

616
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,280
has been greatly impacted.

617
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,000
The one who was behind the whole thing

618
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,240
must take responsibilities.

619
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,800
It’ll serve as a warning to the others.

620
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,480
Therefore, I’ll announce two things.

621
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,440
Firstly,

622
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,480
Wanxing will end the cooperation

623
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,360
with MH forever.

624
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,440
I know

625
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,080
we’ve worked with MH

626
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,320
for many years.

627
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,320
But the way that MH dealt with

628
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,190
the incident this time really disappointed me.

629
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,630
Don’t worry about the IPO.

630
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,760
I’ve already found another

632
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
Secondly,

633
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,920
the company has decided to remove Luo Sheng

634
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,880
from the position as Vice President of Wanxing,
Director of Brokerage Department.

635
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,230
There are two people on the picture.

636
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,600
One is Mr. Yuan of MH,

637
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,760
and the other is Mr. Luo.

638
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,000
The two colluded with each other

639
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,040
and slandered me maliciously.

640
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,360
I even heard

641
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,560
that some of our Directors

642
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,640
fell for their words

643
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,760
and were going to support

644
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,640
Mr. Luo to be the new CEO.

645
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,360
I understand

646
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,440
that you were just deceived by them.

663
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560

It’s good enough already!

673
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,320
This is Tang Xin’s statement
for withdrawing the charges,

674
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,640
on which it clearly shows

675
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,600
that Yuan Shuai and Luo Sheng

676
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,920
made an illegal deal secretly.

677
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,080
And Tang Xin also admitted
that she framed me deliberately.

678
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,160
I’ve also presented

679
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,680
this statement to the media.

680
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,760
I’m sure more people will stand up for me

681
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,280
and provide more evidence.

00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,280

the evidence Mr. Luo sent you

697
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,520
shows that how Mr. Wan has bribed the shows,

698
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,920
falsified the data,

699
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,600

gets out, whether true or false,

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,080

752
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,440
This…

753
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,960
This is your so-called evidence?

754
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,600
A falsified audio?

755
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,640
What do you take the Directors for?

756
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,800
Are you kidding me?

757
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,880
If you think this audio

758
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,320
isn’t convincing enough,

759
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,800
I still have a video.

760
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,640
“Our company has a trainee named Tang Xin.

761
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,880
I heard that she had a long chat with you.

762
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,760
You won’t believe

763
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,680
those nonsense, right?”

764
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
If you have any questions,

765
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,640
please ask away!

766
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,920
Miss Jiang,

767
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,680
you asked

768
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,760
Tang Xin to frame me,

769
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,160
and you told me if I gave you some money,

770
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,320
you’d convince Tang Xin to withdraw the charges.

771
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,480
For the Directors and the interests
of the company,

772
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,000
I chose to compromise.

773
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,520
And now you are using this video
to frame me again!

774
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,480
I’m so impressed by your ability

775
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,960
of shifting blame!

776
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,800
How can you do such a thing?

777
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,560
Throughout history,

778
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,440
no case has ever been established
without witness and physical evidence!

779
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,680
Tang Xin has even withdrawn the charges!

780
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,120
Do you have evidence?

781
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,560
Evidence!

782
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,600
Do you have any?
