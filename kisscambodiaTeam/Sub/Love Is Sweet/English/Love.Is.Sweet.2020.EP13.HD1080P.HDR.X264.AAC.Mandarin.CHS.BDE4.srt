00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 13

3
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,480
Hello, Xu Li.

4
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,000
How come I’m in 702?

5
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,520
Li!

6
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,480
Jun! You woke up!

7
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
I made congee for you.

8
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Have some.

9
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Do you still feel dizzy?

10
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,240
Better.

11
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,390
Check your fridge

12
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,600
and see what else you wanna eat.

13
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,320
I see you bought a lot of stuff.

14
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
I didn’t buy those things.

15
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,880
You didn’t?

16
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,800
So Yuan Shuai

17
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,680
rent this apartment to you

18
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,320
and gave you a nanny for free?

19
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,720
The fridge is filled with food.

20
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,159
Your clothes are nicely folded.

21
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,280
Even the bed is your favorite color.

22
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,240
What he did is so touching!

23
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,920
No wonder I felt wired when I

24
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,159
came to check it out.

25
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
The decoration is your style.

26
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,520
So is the furniture.

27
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,040
I think Yuan Shuai

28
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,920
has been waiting for you to come back!

29
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,760
By the way,

30
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,440
do you know

31
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
how worried he was

32
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
when he called me yesterday?

33
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,000
You had a problem with him before, right?

34
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,480
You know,

35
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,320
in the world of novels,

36
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,280
the main character always appears
to be capricious.

37
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,040
A moment ago, he could be an evil villain.

38
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,840
A moment later,

39
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,120
he could become a handsome and capable person

40
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,280
with a tough life that breaks your heart.

41
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
I think

42
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,480
he wants you to stay for only two possibilities.

43
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,360
He either

44
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,360
plans to murder you in secret

45
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,840
or

46
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,400
heads over heels in love with you.

47
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,400
That’s all. I’ll go get some congee.

48
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,240
I want you to go back to GE with me tomorrow

49
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,320
and meet the client of the new project.

50
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,920
I’ll let go of the things that happened

51
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,480
when you were out of the office.

52
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,520
But the tomorrow’s client

53
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
is our father’s friend,

54
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,400
who personally asked for your presence.

55
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,120
If you don’t come,

56
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,280
our father will know.

57
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
Will you stop messing around?

58
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,840
I will find time and go back in a few days

59
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,560
to take care of some unfinished business.

60
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
But that’s all I can do.

61
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,280
Du,

62
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,480
please don’t be like this!

63
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,360
I’ll say yes

64
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
to whatever you ask for

65
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,840
as long as you don’t leave GE

66
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,440
and me.

67
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,200
I’ve told you,

68
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,320
it’s a battlefield, not an examination site.

69
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,720
There are no rules

70
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
and invigilators.

71
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,320
When dealing with someone like Ma Xiuran,

72
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,800
you can’t let him walk all over you!

73
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,720
I know.

74
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,080
This place is dominated
by the law of the jungle.

75
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,240
Tolerance will only make a bully
push me harder.

76
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,600
It’s good that you know.

77
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,960
Wait.

78
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,669
Take a deep breath.

79
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,040
Go on.

80
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,800
Come in.

81
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
How brazen!

82
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,920
You came to see me first.

83
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,240
I asked you to have dinner with Mr. Qin.

84
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,120
But you

85
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,080
called Yuan Shuai over to make trouble.

86
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,400
You’ve got to apologize to Mr. Qin in person.

87
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,160
Mr. Ma.

88
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,800
Given what happened yesterday,

89
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
I have a formal request to make.

90
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,760
Please stop assigning me

91
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
unfair and unreasonable tasks.

92
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,840
Otherwise, I’ll complain to Mr. Fan about you.

93
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,280
Are you threatening me?

94
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
I’m just negotiating.

95
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,960
According to the company’s policy,

96
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,040
being a drinking companion
of a client isn’t my job.

97
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,000
Look.

98
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,200
You can’t challenge me

99
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,520
even if someone’s got your back.

100
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,480
Everything that your supervisor

101
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,000
asks you to do is your job!

102
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,000
Got it?

103
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,760
Get out!

104
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,800
When dealing with someone like Ma Xiuran,

105
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,680
you can’t let him walk all over you!

106
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,080
As my supervisor,

107
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
you have the right to assign me tasks.

108
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,640
But as an employee of
the Investment Bank Department,

109
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,800
I also have the right to reject
unreasonable work assignments!

110
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
If you are not happy

111
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,040
about my behavior,

112
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,040
you can complain to the company about me!

113
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,840
Challenge my authority?

114
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,280
How dare you?!

115
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,000
Mr. Ma, you look so mad!

116
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,240
Where are you going?

117
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,680
It’s none of your business!

118
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,400
It’s your idea to ask a female employee

119
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,080
to drink with Mr. Qin,

120
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
isn’t it?

121
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,760
You are talking about Jiang Jun, right?

122
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
Mr. Yuan, you are so protective of her.

123
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,920
Are the two of you…

124
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,560
Did you get your perfume from a brine plant?

125
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,160
What a foul odor!

126
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,320
Shut your mouth if you don’t know.

127
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,840
This is a new fragrance from the famous
Milan fashion designer Armar.

128
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,320
Armar?

129
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,880
Armar is surely a famous designer.

130
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,680
So it’s not the perfume’s problem.

131
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,920
Then what do you think the problem is?

132
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
Yuan Shuai, you’d better watch your mouth!

133
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,800
Last Friday,

134
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,320
Ganzheng Pharmaceuticals was delisted from
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

135
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,760
After going through

136
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,640
two years of regulatory period,

137
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,160
several times of trading resumptions
and administrative reviews,

138
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,640
this cheating stock still couldn’t be saved.

139
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,240
Do you know what I mean?

140
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,080
Yuan Shuai, are you threatening me?

141
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,360
Let me tell you.

142
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
It’s all Ganzheng’s Chairman’s idea.

143
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,840
I had nothing to do with it!

144
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,960
But you assisted him with his wrongdoings!

145
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,280
So what?

146
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,280
There’s nothing you can do anyway!

147
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
How beautiful!

148
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,400
Where did you get this picture?

149
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,040
Where did I get it?

150
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,160
As a man who loves to hold grudge,

151
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,480
how could I get where I am in MH

152
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,520
if I didn’t have any special means?

153
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,640
It’s just a way to let you

154
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,200
taste your own medicine.

155
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,040
Ma Xiuran,

156
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,760
let me warn you!

157
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,120
If you use such dirty tricks

158
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,640
to ruin MH’s reputation again,

159
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
I won’t guarantee

160
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,560
this picture won’t be

161
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,640
suddenly released one day!

162
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,640
You’d better behave yourself, beauty!

163
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,080
What are you doing here?

164
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,080
Waiting for you.

165
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,640
Waiting for me?

166
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,560
Do you think

167
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,720
the true words will sound more sincere

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,760
when said outside of the office?

169
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,000
How would I know?

170
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,280
I’ll tell you after you say it.

171
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,840
It’s not something important, actually.

172
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,160
It’s about the apartment.

173
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,880
I think you were right.

174
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,480
I lied to you.

175
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,200
It’s my fault.

176
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,480
So,

177
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,120
you need to be smarter in the future.

178
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,760
Most importantly,

179
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
don’t trust a person like me anymore.

180
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,920
That’s all.

181
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Thank you!

182
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,760
Though you lied to me,

183
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,320
on the account that you saved me,

184
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I’ll forgive you.

185
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,760
But don’t lie to me again.

186
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
That’s all.

187
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,480
Got it!

188
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,640
Hello, Mr. Du.

189
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,480
Do you have time?

190
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
I have something for you.

191
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,560
What is it?

192
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,120
You’ll know when you come.

193
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,320
I’ll wait for you
in the fragrance blending room.

194
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,120
Okay.

195
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,280
Mr. Du.

196
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,480
You are here.

197
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,400
You sounded so mysterious on the phone.

198
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,320
What’s up?

199
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,360
Smell it.

200
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,760
It smells so nice. You blended it?

201
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,520
You did that the last time when you were here.

202
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,800
The new blend should

203
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,040
sit on the shelf for several weeks.

204
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,040
Now it’s ready.

205
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,120
I blended it? Am I that good?

206
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,800
Take a seat.

207
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,760
Juno!

208
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,080
This is my English name!

209
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,160
Really?

210
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,720
What a coincidence!

211
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,200
By the way,

212
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,600
you sent me the address last time.

213
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,520
I did go there,

214
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,800
but I was

215
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,360
late.

216
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,680
It’s okay.

217
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,720
Last time…

218
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,000
Never mind. As long as you were safe.

219
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,360
If the same thing happens again,

220
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
you’ve got to tell me right away.

221
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,640
Okay?

222
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,960
It won’t happen again.

223
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
I was such a pushover before,

224
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,400
so that kinda thing would happen to me.

225
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,680
I won’t let it happen again.

226
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,040
Looks like my disciple

227
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
is fully-fledged now.

228
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,120
So that I can share your burden!

229
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,720
By the way, Mr. Du,

230
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,829
how have you been doing recently?

231
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,240
I’ve been

232
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,109
doing well.

233
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
I’m a lecturer now,

234
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,640
and I’m going to

235
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
do some investment.

236
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,400
If you come across a good project,

237
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,680
please do let me know.

238
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,280
No problem!

239
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,200
Thank you for the perfume!

240
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,160
You are very welcome!

241
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,840
Mr. Du, please turn right here.

242
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,240
Sorry, I almost forgot.

243
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,200
I’m going this way today.

244
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,720
You aren’t going home?

245
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,840
Actually, this is my home now.

246
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,240
You moved?

247
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,360
Good.

248
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
What?

249
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,120
By the way,

250
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,600
how did you get home last night?

251
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,320
A business dinner like that

252
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,640
wouldn’t finish so early.

253
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,080
Last night…

254
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,280
My boss picked me up last night.

255
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,760
Yuan Shuai?

256
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,400
Why did he send you to the dinner?

257
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,400
He didn’t! He was there to help me!

258
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,480
Forget it.

259
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,040
It’s a long story.

260
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,440
Anyway,

261
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
newbies always meet obstacles
created deliberately by others.

262
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Feels like you and Yuan Shuai

263
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,320
have an interesting relationship.

264
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,920
Not really.

265
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
He’s actually my childhood friend.

266
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,040
We were neighbors and we’ve known
each other since kindergarten.

267
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,440
I see.

268
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,280
So you guys must be quite close.

269
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Not really.

270
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,560
He always bullied me when we were kids.

271
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,640
Years later, when we met again,

272
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
he kicked me out of MH

273
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,640
and said I was not an investment bank material.

274
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,680
Since I entered the company,
he’s been very hard on me!

275
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,200
How would I be close to him?

276
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,600
I’m back!

277
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,840
Brother.

278
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,760
You are back!

279
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,000
Where’s Wealth?

280
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,560
I don’t see her anywhere.

281
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,560
Over there.

282
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,120
Li Xiaochuan!

283
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,800
-You…
-What?

284
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,000
Good girl!

285
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,800
It’s okay.

286
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,840
It’s okay, Wealth!

287
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,640
Daddy’s home! It’s okay!

288
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,880
Li Xiaochuan!

289
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,640
This is how you take care of Wealth?

290
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,680
I’ve set the time.

291
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,680
Once she consumes the pre-set calories,

292
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,760
the machine will stop.

293
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,680
Don’t you think you also need to work out?

294
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,440
Don’t you think you should run a little?

295
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
I’ll set the time for you!

296
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,240
Get on it!

297
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,480
Are you kidding?

298
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,160
Get on it!

299
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
Why should I run? I…

300
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,080
Are you getting on it or not?

301
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,920
Okay.

302
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,640
I guess you forgot what’s

303
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
in my phone, right?

304
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,040
-When you were in the college, you confessed…
-Alright!

305
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,160
I’ll run!

306
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,280
Faster!

307
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,800
That’s enough!

308
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,360
You!

309
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,560
Look.

310
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,960
If I see Wealth’s feces

311
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,240
in this house,

312
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,080
I’ll let you know what the real pain is!

313
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,440
Don’t worry about that.

314
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,040
Xu Li told me

315
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,600
that dogs take care of business outside.

316
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,320
So I take some time

317
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,960
and walk her every day.

318
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
And you know what? While you were gone,

319
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,720
she even put on some weight.

320
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,400
About 150 g.

321
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,600
Keep running!

322
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,440
Is this the new project you’ve been working on?

323
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,960
It’s a secret for now.

324
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,880
I wanna give you a surprise.

325
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,320
So mysterious!

326
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
It just hit me that I have something to do.

327
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,240
I’ll leave Wealth to you! Bye!

328
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,640
Weird!

329
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Jun, you are back?

330
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,960
What are you doing?

331
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,560
Don’t move.

332
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,760
Where have you been? You smell so good!

333
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
Mr. Du’s fragrance blending room.

334
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,840
Mr. Du has a fragrance blending room?

335
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,480
Awesome!

336
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,120
Is Mr. Du

337
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,320
the man who’s been

338
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,360
helping you secretly?

339
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,800
What are you talking about?

340
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,440
He’s my respected teacher,

341
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,640
a veteran in the investment bank.

342
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,040
Get that dirty mind out of your head!

343
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,880
What are you doing?

344
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,040
My Jun said I had a dirty mind!

345
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,600
I’ll teach you a lesson!

346
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,840
Itchy!

347
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,200
It’s itchy! Itchy!

348
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,760
I…

349
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,760
I can’t take it anymore!

350
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,280
Itchy!

351
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,680
Be quiet!

352
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,320
Your roommate looks so scary!

353
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,080
I’ve trained myself to be cool about it.

354
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,400
You just need to get used to it.

355
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,160
Perhaps my immune system isn’t strong enough.

356
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,760
I think I should move back.

357
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,480
It’s not right to stay here and disturb you.

358
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,560
You can’t!

359
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
You’ve moved out.

360
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,480
How can you give in so easily?

361
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
You’ve got to protect your dignity!

362
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,080
I…

363
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,040
Be! Quiet!

364
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,560
Don’t laugh!

365
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,400
Of two evils choose the lesser.

366
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Compared with Yuan Shuai,

367
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
it’s harder for me to face

368
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,640
such pair of piercing eyes.

369
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,160
Alright.

370
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,480
Heroine, since you’ve made up your mind,

371
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,000
I won’t hold you back.

372
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,760
But,

373
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,560
could you please cook me some noodles
before you go?

374
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,400
Then let me think again.

375
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,560
But I’m really hungry.

376
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,200
Heroine!

377
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,320
I’m hungry, too.

378
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,520
Can the heroine’s best friend
cook some noodles for her?

379
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,160
But the heroine’s best friend is also tired!

380
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,720
Rock, scissors, paper!

381
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,280
Two out of three!

382
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,120
Rock, scissors, paper!

383
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,520
Another round!

384
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,480
Rock, scissors, paper!

385
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,520
Look at your dark circles!
Did you stay up all night?

386
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,680
I didn’t sleep well.

387
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,000
Do you have to work that hard?

388
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,440
Leave us some opportunities, okay?

389
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,160
What the heck?

390
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,640
When did I start struggling
to sleep in a strange bed?

391
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,760
I’ve never had a sound sleep

392
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
since I moved to Li’s.

393
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,680
In this huge Shanghai,

394
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,400
I can’t even find a place

395
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,000
where I can sleep well?

396
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,480
If it goes on like this, I’d have a sudden death

397
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,760
before my work kills me!

398
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,880
One neighbor is like a devil,

399
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,920
but the other is like a demon.

400
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,520
But apparently, the demon’s place

401
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
is nicer and comfier.

402
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,680
And the rent is reasonable.

403
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
A great man knows when to yield and when not.

404
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,840
Jiang Jun,

405
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,160
do not give up such a nice apartment

406
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,440
just for your ego.

407
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,800
Mr. Yuan!

408
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,680
What’s up?

409
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,240
Well…

410
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
I’m just wondering

411
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,440
if 702 is still…

412
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,880
Still what?

413
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,400
Still…

414
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
It’s the latest evaluation report
of Chenxin Technology.

415
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,040
Doctor Zhu asked you to review it.

416
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,920
Okay.

417
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,680
Are you here to work

418
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,280
or to play a zombie?

419
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,440
You look so pale.

420
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,960
And your dark circles
are even bigger than your eyes!

421
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
It’s fine that you scare us,

422
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,600
but what if you scared the clients?

423
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,160
Besides, look at your top.

424
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,200
Did you buy it from Taobao?

425
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,440
It wrinkles and has such poor texture.

426
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
Jiang Jun,

427
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,880
aren’t you still working

428
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,160
on a prospectus?

429
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,080
Don’t just stand here!

430
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,280
Go finish it!

431
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,480
I’ll read it in my office.

432
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,800
I need to talk to you.

433
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,200
Then let’s go to my office.

434
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,840
The new people

435
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,680
were all so nervous during probation.

436
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,160
Now that they signed the contracts,

437
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,360
they’ve become so undisciplined

438
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,280
Ms. Qiao, you should pay more attention

439
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,560
on yourself instead of those new people.

440
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,480
Me?

441
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,640
Why?

442
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,440
Your makeup is smudged.

443
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,360
It may scare our clients.

444
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,560
It’s not!

445
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
You lied!

446
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,840
Now, here’s the thing.

447
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,280
Based on reliable information,

448
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,680
several big companies are interested

449
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
in Chenxin Technology’s system patent.

450
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,400
It’s so difficult for a tech startup

451
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,080
like Chenxin to survive in a competitive market.

452
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,200
What will you do next?

453
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
MH

454
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,000
doesn’t have to offend those big companies

455
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,320
for a small client like this.

456
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,000
There’s always a solution to a problem.

457
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,160
Since I’ve had my eye on this company,

458
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,040
I will certainly make it develop vigorously.

459
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,640
So, do you have any plan for tonight?

460
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,480
What will you eat?

461
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,600
Sorry.

462
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,720
I have some personal things to take care of.

463
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,520
Personal things?

464
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,160
Need any help?

465
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,520
Alright.

466
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,080
I’m leaving.

467
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,720
So,

468
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,000
do you wanna go eat with me?

469
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,120
No, I’m on a diet.

470
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,720
Hey, you’ve

471
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,720
posed like this for a whole day.

472
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,480
Aren’t you tired?

473
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
I am.

474
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,040
I think

475
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,840
you should just go in there if you wanna

476
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,920
report something.

477
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,560
Nothing.

478
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,640
I have nothing to report.

479
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,880
Please go eat.

480
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,880
Okay.

481
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,320
I’m leaving. Bye.

482
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,920
I’m off work!

483
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,280
Are you looking for me?

484
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,320
What’s wrong?

485
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,120
-Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!
-What is it?

486
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,080
What seems the problem?

487
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,760
Don’t touch me!

488
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,120
-You’ve got a cramp!
-Yes, that’s right!

489
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,920
Then why didn’t you just say it?

490
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,280
Cramp!

491
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,000
Now it’s better.

492
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,960
Better?

493
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,680
You changed your perfume?

494
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,960
Smells nice?

495
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,480
Jiang Jun,

496
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,520
you look quite strange today,

497
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,280
from top to toe!

498
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,360
What’s going on with you?

499
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,360
Hey,

500
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,920
I can hear you.

501
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,080
You don’t need to get this close to me.

502
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,440
If you have something to ask,

503
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,520
just tell me.

504
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
Maybe I’ll say yes.

505
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,720
Nothing! I’ll just work overtime today.

506
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,880
I have nothing to ask.

507
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,320
Are you sure?

508
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,920
It’s okay.

509
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,120
I feel hungry anyway.

510
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,520
I’ll go eat by myself now.

511
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,160
Mr. Yuan!

512
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,240
Good timing.

513
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,240
My stomach says it’s hungry, too.

514
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,440
I just finished my work.

515
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,040
Why don’t we eat together? My treat!

516
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,000
Your treat?

517
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,200
Let’s go!

518
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,520
Come on!

519
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
The cramp is gone, huh?

520
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,600
Mr. Yuan, your rice noodles.

521
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,720
Let me help you to put the ingredients in.

522
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,320
It’s been a while since the last time I came here.
They’ve decorated.

523
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
I don’t know if the noodles taste the same.

524
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,720
Mr. Yuan, you like vinegar, right?

525
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,360
Have some.

526
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,760
Do you want chili?

527
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,120
Just spill it.

528
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,720
What did you wanna say when you
came to me this morning?

529
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,960
Nothing!

530
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,320
Weren’t you waiting for me after work?

531
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,000
No!

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,680
So I guess I misunderstood.

533
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,120
Then let’s eat.

534
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,160
Yum!

535
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
I have something to tell you.

536
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,000
The apartment in Longting Community

537
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,280
has been vacant for a long time.

538
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,800
If you don’t wanna rent it anymore,

539
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,040
I’ll find a new tenant.

540
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,520
What vacant?

541
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,800
The fridge is full of stuff!

542
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,680
What?

543
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,200
I mean

544
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,560
it’s an off season.

545
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
It’s not easy to find a new tenant.

546
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,440
Since you helped me,

547
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,080
and I’m not a narrow-minded person,

548
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,360
I think I can help you to solve this problem.

549
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,960
How can I

550
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,000
bother you for such an unimportant thing?

551
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,640
I can handle it myself.

552
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,360
<i>Su Chang</i> <i>Call me</i>

553
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:30,740
Think about it.
<i>Su Chang</i> <i>Call me</i>

554
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,320
Think about it.

555
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,720
With its nice location,

556
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,800
and the low

557
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
price,

558
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,400
it’s actually in high demand.

559
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,280
Hello, Miss Liu.

560
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,640
You wanna check out the apartment?

561
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,000
I’m busy tomorrow morning.

562
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,480
Can you drop by in the evening?

563
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,880
What?

564
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,840
You wanna transfer me the rent right now?

565
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,360
Great!

566
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,360
I’ll send my bank account number to you.

567
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,160
The apartment is not available anymore!

568
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,960
It’s already taken!

569
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,920
What are you doing?

570
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,040
You are interrupting my business!

571
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,640
Sit down!

572
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,440
But, I…

573
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,120
I’ve thought about it.

574
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,280
Your apartment is quite cost-efficient.

575
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,480
So,

576
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,320
I wanna rent it again.

577
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,800
What?

578
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,640
I wanna rent it again.

579
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,160
Rent it again?

580
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,880
Look,

581
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,160
I don’t think it’s appropriate.

582
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,400
I’m afraid that living in that apartment

583
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,760
will affect your current happy life.

584
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,320
No! Not at all!

585
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,600
I don’t have a happy life!

586
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,440
Okay!

587
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,920
Since you are so determined to rent my house,

588
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,480
I’ll make an exception for you.

589
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,560
But…

590
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,760
What?

591
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,160
Are you going to ask for more rent?

592
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,600
It’s a business. I’m not ashamed of it.

593
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,800
It is shameful!

594
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,480
Very, super, extremely shameful!

595
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,280
You are a wealthy ED.

596
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
Don’t take advantage of a poor employee like me.

597
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,120
Okay!

598
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,240
Whatever you say.

599
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,400
How about this then?

600
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,360
I’ll rent it to you at the same price as before.

601
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,640
No.

602
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,480
Jiang Jun.

603
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,600
You won’t allow me to raise the price.

604
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,800
And you are going

605
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,320
to take advantage of my kindness?

606
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,200
No.

607
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,480
I think

608
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,360
I should pay you according to the market price.

609
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,320
You are being nice to me,

610
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,640
and I can’t let you lose too much.

611
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,760
Okay! No problem.

612
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,040
As long as you are willing to move back.

613
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,040
I said, it gives me headache
thinking about you’ll move back!

614
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,840
Just shut up and eat!

615
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,880
Eat it!

616
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,320
Watch it!

617
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,720
If you get the sauce on my coat,

618
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,080
you can say goodbye to your salary!

619
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
So, when

620
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,160
will you move back?

621
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,440
In these couple of days.

622
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,920
Looks like I have to call Miss Liu again!

623
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,560
Where are you going?

624
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,150
Go pack up my stuff and move back!

625
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Yes!

626
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,080
I did it!

627
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,150
Again?

628
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,630
My God!

629
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,600
Xiaochuan.

630
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,240
How many more phases are there

631
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,240
for the App to be done?

632
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,720
When you get to the next phase,

633
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,440
can you give me a hint

634
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,200
so that

635
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,000
I can get ready for it?

636
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,880
What phase?

637
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,600
I mean…

638
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,760
I mean…

639
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,040
I mean the phase that’ll make you do this.

640
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,680
I’m sorry.

641
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Because my App is pretty much

642
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,400
done by now.

643
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,280
I did that

644
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,560
because I just launched the beta test version.

645
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,560
That’s why I was so excited.

646
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,000
Beta test?

647
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,640
So you mean I can download it now

648
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
and I’ll be your first user?

649
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,200
It’s too late

650
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,840
The first user is me.

651
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,680
Then I’ll share it to my model group

652
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
and let my friends introduce more users to you.

653
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,920
We can recommend it to our fans,

654
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,240
and ask them to recommend it to their friends.

655
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,360
In that case, the App will get popular soon!

656
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,720
No.

657
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,360
My server is too small

658
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,840
to store that much data.

659
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,960
So I can’t

660
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,320
serve a great number of users for now.

661
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,320
I need to tell my brother first.

662
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,480
I told him I’d surprise him!

663
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
Then I’ll go call Jun.

664
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Hi, my babies!

665
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,640
Did the demon water you guys on time?

666
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,760
Let me see.

667
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,320
Not bad!

668
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,880
No place is better than home!

669
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,400
Wealth!

670
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,640
Wealth!

671
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,960
Wealth! How come you are here?

672
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,560
What are you doing here?

673
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,000
Gosh! You put on weight again!

674
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,320
Hello, Li.

675
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,160
What’s up?

676
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,040
You are back!

677
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,120
Who’s with you?

678
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
No… Nobody.

679
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,920
What?

680
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,080
I can’t even speak?

681
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,920
Who is calling?

682
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,760
Is it Yuan Shuai?

683
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,640
You really moved back?

684
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,080
Jiang Jun, you are so weak!

685
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,080
I demand you to come

686
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,120
to my convenience store right now!

687
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,680
Wait!

688
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,480
What are you doing here?

689
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,440
I’m here to welcome you!

690
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,200
Welcome back!

691
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,640
Thank you!

692
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,240
<i>Li Xiaochuan</i>

693
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,720
Brother,
<i>Li Xiaochuan</i>

694
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:51,800
<i>Li Xiaochuan</i>

695
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,980
the surprise I told you last time is done.
<i>Li Xiaochuan</i>

696
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,560
the surprise I told you last time is done.

697
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,920
I hope you can be the first one to see it

698
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,240
and help me to assess

699
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,360
its investment value.

700
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,680
Where are you going?

701
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,560
The convenience store.

702
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,480
The convenience store?
