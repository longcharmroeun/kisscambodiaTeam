00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,450
Episode 26

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,800
Wait! You…

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,400
Be gentle, please.

5
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
Gentle. Be gentle.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Why did you run?

7
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,440
We are not here for money.

8
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,800
What did you run from?

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,230
But, sir

10
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,560
I… I really don’t know anything. I…

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,640
You don’t know?

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,120
I’ve told you. I’m not here for money.

13
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,480
But it doesn’t mean you are safe.

14
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,950
I remember I took the last guy who said

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,880
“I don’t know” to feed fish.

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,520
Feed fish?

17
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,640
Right?

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,680
What did you do to Qin Yueyuan?

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,520
I forgot to introduce him to you.

20
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,920
He is

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,080
a professional hitman I hired.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,280
He’s known as the “Clean Cut”.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,760
What?

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,120
He’s quick and brisk.

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,760
Cut…

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,680
Cut…

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,320
Sir,

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,120
then…

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Sir…

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Since you know nothing,

31
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,360
then I should just kill you!

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,360
Don’t!

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,280
Don’t!

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Bro!

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
Bro! Bro!

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,520
Take it easy.

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,880
Give me a sec.

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,550
But,

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,600
sir…

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,360
But…

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,600
See that?

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,520
He has no mercy

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
when he’s mad.

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,600
I know.

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,600
There’s nothing I can do about it.

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,760
So, at this moment,

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,400
you only have two options.

48
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,520
Either live or die.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,640
Which will you choose?

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,360
Live! Live!

51
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,440
I wanna live!

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,520
Bro,

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,560
he wants to live.

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
Yes! I do!

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,160
I wanna live.

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,080
You wanna live?

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,960
Yes! Yes!

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,080
Then tell me everything you know.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,240
I will!

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,440
I will tell you!

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,560
It was Linda!

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,360
Linda asked me to do it!

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,080
Here’s what happened

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
back then.

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Whether we can take Jiang Yaoming down or not,
<i>Cao Heng, President of C Group</i>
<i>Five years ago</i>

66
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,960
I’ll count on you, Mr. Cao.
<i>Cao Heng, President of C Group</i>
<i>Five years ago</i>

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,260
If you succeed, we’ll all be benefited.
<i>Cao Heng, President of C Group</i>
<i>Five years ago</i>

68
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,800
If you succeed, we’ll all be benefited.
<i>Linda, ED of Investment Banking Dept.
of MH Securities</i>

69
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,000
If…
<i>Linda, ED of Investment Banking Dept.
of MH Securities</i>

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,720
<i>Linda, ED of Investment Banking Dept.
of MH Securities</i>

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,200
Of course, there’s no if.
<i>Linda, ED of Investment Banking Dept.
of MH Securities</i>

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,960
<i>Linda, ED of Investment Banking Dept.
of MH Securities</i>

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,280
I don’t think you’d fail.
<i>Linda, ED of Investment Banking Dept.
of MH Securities</i>

74
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,680
But

75
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,920
would it be too risky?

76
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,240
If you do it according to what I said,

77
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
you will definitely succeed.

78
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,640
Okay.

79
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,360
<i>Jiangnan Flavor Food</i>

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,160
Mr. Yin.

<i>Jiangnan Flavor Food</i>

82
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,500
I heard that you’ve got a big order lately.
<i>Jiangnan Flavor Food</i>

83
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,800
I heard that you’ve got a big order lately.

84
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,760
I happen to have a batch of beef.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,240
All you need to do is to switch

86
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,360
the beef with mine.

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:16,940
I know

88
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,280
I know
<i>Yin Zaizhong, Production Manager of
Jiangnan Flavor Food Co., Ltd.</i>

89
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,840
it’s quite difficult for you,
<i>Yin Zaizhong, Production Manager of
Jiangnan Flavor Food Co., Ltd.</i>

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,680
but it matters to your daughter’s life.

91
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,760
With this money,

92
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,560
you can take her to surgery right away.

93
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,760
After all, your kid is innocent.

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,360
Now,

95
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
wish us a successful cooperation!

96
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Come on!

97
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,040
Congratulations, Mr. Cao.

98
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,960
You successfully took down Jiangnan Flavor.

99
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,160
Nice doing business with you.

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,540
Thanks to your meticulous plan,

101
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:52,600
Thanks to your meticulous plan,
<i>C GROUP COMPANY</i>

102
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,680
things went very well.
<i>C GROUP COMPANY</i>

103
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,400
<i>C GROUP COMPANY</i>

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,320
So, Mr. Cao,

105
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,200
you can find yourself a hiding spot now.

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,240
Miss Ling,

107
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,040
what do you mean?

108
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,200
I thought we’d all be benefited from this.

109
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
And now you can’t wait
to get me out of the picture?

110
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,440
Mr. Cao, you misunderstood.

111
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
I’m just doing it for your good.

112
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,480
After all, you did the whole thing

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,480
all by yourself.

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,520
If you stayed in Shanghai,

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,800
it’d catch too much attention.

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,920
Are you threatening me?

117
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Why do you say that?

118
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,680
We are on the same boat for God’s sake.

119
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,240
After you leave Shanghai,

120
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,520
we’ll give you an amount of money as reward.

121
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,280
I assure you that you won’t be disappointed.

122
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,120
And I promise

123
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,000
no one will bother you.

124
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,880
Miss Ling,

125
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
good for you!

126
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
Seems like I don’t have another choice.

127
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,440
Hope you’ll keep your word.

128
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,200
It’s so pleasant to work with a smart man

129
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,520
like you, Mr. Cao.

130
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,460
You said Linda asked you to do it.

131
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,980
Do you have proof?

132
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,580
I do!

133
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,020
I kept the remittance receipt
from her in secret.

134
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,740
It’s in my phone.

135
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,820
Look.

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,960
<i>Du Ling</i>

137
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,980
Aside from Linda, who else

138
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,180
was involved in this case?

139
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,140
I contacted with Linda only.

140
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,500
After Linda left MH and joined GE,

141
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,180
she found me and made me
the President of C Group.

142
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,700
She asked me to play her clients.

143
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,540
I always thought she was

144
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,500
the boss of C Group.

145
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,980
But whenever she talked,

146
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,220
she always mentioned

147
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,460
“we”.

148
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,100
So I’m not sure if someone else

149
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,940
was behind her.

150
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,700
If you dare

151
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,460
tell anybody

152
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,740
that you met us today,

153
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,340
I can’t guarantee

154
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,540
how long you’ll live.

155
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,420
I… I… I got it!

156
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:12,980
Got it.

157
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,780
But…

158
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,980
But…

159
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,980
But… But…

160
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,940
But what?

161
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,220
I… I’ve told Linda

162
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,740
that Mr. Du talked to me the other day.

163
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,820
Mr. Du, I…

164
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,460
You made the trouble.

165
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,180
You’d better fix it soon.

166
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,940
I will!

167
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,620
Over there!

168
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,220
Have you taken your pills regularly?

169
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,340
Some things

170
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,620
can’t be solved by taking pills.

171
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,260
So,

172
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,940
what are you doing here?

173
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,100
I need to ask you something.

174
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,420
About Jiangnan Flavor?

175
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,820
Cao Heng already told me everything.

176
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,780
Jiang Yaoming’s death wasn’t an accident.

177
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,660
You are so determined to find out the truth.

178
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,500
Are you doing it for yourself

179
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,380
or for her?

180
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,540
Sister,

181
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,940
we can’t keep making mistakes like this anymore.

182
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,820
Tell me what happened back then.

183
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,100
Let Jiang Jun know the truth

184
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,500
and give us a sense of closure.

185
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,820
The truth?

186
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,820
If I told you

187
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,260
I had something to do with Jiang Yaoming’s death,

188
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,020
would you continue the investigation?

189
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,140
I don’t believe at all that you’d do such things.

190
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,900
Who’s behind the whole thing?

191
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,660
No matter how much you’ve found out,

192
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,780
you’ve got to stop now.

193
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,220
Because you have no idea what a powerful enemy

194
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,700
you are about to confront.

195
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,580
I will find out who it is.

196
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,900
I’ve said all I needed to say.

197
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,620
If you insist on

198
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,420
going down this road,

199
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,380
we’ll be enemies in the future.

200
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,020
Sister!

201
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,300
That person already knows that Jiang Jun

202
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,780
is Jiang Yaoming’s daughter.

203
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,280
<i>Inpatient Department</i>

204
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,140
Yin Zaizhong,

205
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,020
former Manager

206
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,420
of Jiangnan Flavor Food Factory.

207
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,420
Five years ago, when Jiang Yaoming’s company

208
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,020
was taken over by C Group,

209
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,820
he didn’t choose to join C Group.

210
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,340
Instead, he opened a store himself.

211
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,300
His daughter once suffered from lymphoma.

212
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,340
She was recovered after surgery.

213
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,140
But it came back again one year ago.

214
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,540
She’s currently in hospital.

215
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,180
Sorry, sir.

216
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,700
I’m fine. Are you okay?

217
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,820
Sir,

218
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,460
you are so handsome.

219
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,460
It’s like you walked right out of the TV.

220
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,940
That’s so sweet.

221
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,860
I’m so sorry.

222
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,940
I’ve told you many times.

223
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,980
Don’t walk around alone.

224
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,540
I just went to get you some water,

225
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,820
and you were gone.

226
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,820
Have some warm water.

227
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,380
Mr. Yin?

228
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,940
You are…

229
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,460
It’s not important who I am.

230
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,220
But I believe

231
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,180
that you must know the people in this picture.

232
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,420
How long will she live?

233
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,140
The doctor said it’d be less than one year.

234
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,660
So you took the bribe from Cao Heng

235
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,500
for her surgery fee back then?

236
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,980
Although

237
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,700
it’s been years,

238
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,340
I know I can never escape from those things.

239
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,180
What do you wanna know?

240
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Just ask away.

241
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,980
As Mr. Jiang’s partner,

242
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,660
do you know any details

243
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,780
about Jiangnan Flavor’s acquisition deal?

244
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,140
10 years ago,

245
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,820
Jiang used his family’s secret rice noodle recipe

246
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,140
to create the brand “Yixianqian”.

247
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,220
Due to its good taste and rich ingredients,

248
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,300
it became very popular.

249
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,820
We all made money

250
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,180
and felt so happy.

251
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,660
So we suggested Jiang

252
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,820
open new factories

253
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,980
and online stores.

254
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,580
But we needed money to expand the business.

255
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,300
So Jiang turned to

256
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,660
the investment bank for financing.

257
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,660
Everything was going well, until one day

258
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,660
a man and a woman came to our factory.

259
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,140
They said they were in charge of the project.

260
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,340
Mr. Jiang,

261
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,420
why are you so stubborn?

262
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,540
Just a small change

263
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,780
to the production mode of the rice noodle

264
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,920
will reduce the production cost by 50%

265
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,300
will reduce the production cost by 50%
<i>Lin Taimo, GM of Investment Banking
Dept. of MH Securities</i>

266
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,540
or even more.
<i>Lin Taimo, GM of Investment Banking
Dept. of MH Securities</i>

267
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,580
With the current reputation of “Yixianqian”,

268
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,940
Jiangnan Flavor’s valuation will be definitely

269
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,940
doubled.

270
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,140
I’ve said it.

271
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,340
I won’t change the production mode
before the other

272
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,700
preservation methods are proved to be safe.

273
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,020
Then think of it this way.

274
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,980
“Yixianqian” is of high cost for now,

275
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,540
and it has a shelf life of only 15 days.

276
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,180
The instant rice noodles
have the similar taste,

277
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,060
but the shelf life can be at least tripled.

278
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,260
In that case,

279
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,220
wouldn’t it be more convenient
for the customers to carry and enjoy?

280
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,860
While there are no similar competitors,

281
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,140
I believe that “Yixianqian”

282
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,740
will quickly take over the market.

283
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,140
But in that way, the freshness and nutrition

284
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,380
of the ingredients will have to suffer.

285
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,900
Most importantly, the taste won’t be
as good as before.

286
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,180
I’m sorry.

287
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,740
I don’t want my family secret recipe

288
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,260
to become another junk food.

289
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,100
Don’t try to convince me anymore.

290
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,940
I won’t agree it.

291
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,060
Mr. Jiang,

292
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,180
why don’t you…

293
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,820
Mr. Jiang.

294
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,900
If you are always this headstrong,

295
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,140
you will pay for your mistake

296
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,700
sooner or later.

297
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,540
After that,

298
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,420
Cao Heng, President of C Group, found me.

299
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,340
He promised to give me a big amount of money.

300
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,060
But I had to use his batch

301
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,940
of beef of poor quality.

302
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
I needed money for my daughter’s surgery,

303
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,860
so I agreed.

304
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,580
Then how did Mr. Jiang die later?

305
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,540
What?

306
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,500
You think there was more to Jiang’s death?

307
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,300
I’m still investigating that.

308
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,980
Do you still remember the name

309
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,060
of the man who talked to Mr. Jiang?

310
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,220
I think it was Lin…

311
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,260
Lin Taimo!

312
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,180
Congratulations!

313
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,540
You took the power back in MH.

314
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,300
I should thank you for reminding me.

315
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,740
I took a close look at her today.

316
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,660
Her personality

317
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,140
is quite like her father’s.

318
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,140
Really?

319
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,780
She’s just a nobody.

320
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,540
Do you have to take care of it yourself?

321
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:54,980
<i>Lin Taimo Vice President</i>

322
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,920
You have to be careful about a nobody.
<i>Lin Taimo Vice President</i>

323
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,540
Since you are in GE and can’t help me,

324
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,580
I have to talk to her myself

325
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,620
to ease my mind.

326
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,220
Are you saying she knows

327
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,820
something about this case?

328
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,220
No worry.

329
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,540
She doesn’t know much.

330
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,580
And,

331
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,780
I won’t give her the chance to.

332
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,860
I called you all here

333
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,420
because Mr. Lin has a special assignment.

334
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,140
What you are looking at

335
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,460
is the materials of Hengsheng Group.

336
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,660
President Wang

337
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,220
of Hengsheng Group came visit us a few days ago.

338
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,380
He said he wanted to complete

339
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,140
the company’s transformation through M&A.

340
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,500
But we found out

341
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,140
that he also talked

342
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,620
to GE.

343
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,140
So, what you need to do

344
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,820
is to take the opportunity
of President Wang’s Shanghai trip

345
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,140
and do your best

346
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,780
to keep this case to our MH.

347
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,820
Of course,

348
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,580
if any of you does a great job,

349
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,820
Mr. Lin said

350
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,820
that he’d promote that person to be a manager.

351
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,020
Since it’s such an important case,

352
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,220
Mr. Lin hopes that you can work

353
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,340
as a team

354
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,420
instead of working on it individually.

355
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,460
So, you need a team leader

356
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,180
to lead this case.

357
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,060
Jiang Jun,

358
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,600
I’ll name you the team leader.

359
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,460
But, Ms. Qiao…

360
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,460
Any problem?

361
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,020
No.

362
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,600
-No.
-No.

363
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,940
Since we are all on the same page,

364
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,300
let’s get back to work.

365
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,600
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

366
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,900
- Thank you, Ms. Qiao.
- Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

367
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,220
As one climbs up relying on personal relationship,

368
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,780
why bother pretending to be a hard worker?

369
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,140
Come in.

370
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,140
Mr. Lin,

371
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,620
Secretary Bai asked me to bring these files to you.

372
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,300
Okay. I see.

373
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,180
By the way,

374
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,060
when Ms. Qiao briefed you guys

375
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,820
on Hengsheng Group’s case,

376
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,300
you seemed to have a problem
with the team leader arrangement.

377
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,380
Why didn’t you say something?

378
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,460
I have no problem, Mr. Lin.

379
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,740
I think it was a misunderstanding.

380
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,860
I wanted to say something. But

381
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,300
Ms. Qiao told me not to talk with her eyes.

382
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,380
So I didn’t say anything.

383
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,820
You stopped just because

384
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,140
she wouldn’t let you talk?

385
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,420
Isn’t it just a play through which

386
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,940
you pave the road for Jiang Jun?

387
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,140
I provide you guys

388
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,980
with only one promotion opportunity,

389
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,860
and ask you to work together

390
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,340
under the management of a team leader,

391
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,420
because I want you to form

392
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,780
a sense of crisis

393
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,740
and a sense of competition.

394
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,900
So, you mean…

395
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,180
My subordinates

396
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,380
will never give up easily.

397
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,460
I will never let go

398
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,060
the things I want.

399
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,900
As long as the result is good,

400
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,780
I’ll try to accomplish my goal by all means,

401
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,940
regardless of the methods and process.

402
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,460
President Wang

403
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,060
is a strict and professional businessman.

404
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,020
When someone is late

405
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,140
for an appointment with him,

406
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,340
he’d be really angry.

407
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,620

563
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,900
including Jiang Yaoming’s death.

564
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,180
You dare to investigate me?

565
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,980
I was also involved.

566
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,780
So it’s not scary that I investigated you.

567
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,540
What’s scary is that Yuan Shuai

568
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,540
investigated you with me.

569
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,900
He also knows everything.

570
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,460
He’s collecting evidence
and going to report you.

571
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,980
As I recall,

572
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,620
you are always defeated by him.

573
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,660
Even so, you could still work with him.

574
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,580
You are such a broad-minded person.

575
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,820
Mr. Lin, you don’t have to mock me.

576
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,540
I approached him

577
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,580
so that I could know him better.

578
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,300
And now it’s the perfect timing

579
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,580
to take him down.

580
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,140
I don’t trust you.

581
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,980
As one who always acts alone,

582
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,460
why do you suddenly need my help?

583
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,540
It’s not convincing at all.

584
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,140
I’ll tell you Yuan Shuai’s weakness.

585
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,060
And I need you to give me Jiang Jun.

586
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,460
So it’s all for a girl!

587
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,140
I’m surprised that you have a romantic soul.

588
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,420
But,

589
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,660
she’s Jiang Yaoming’s daughter.

590
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,820
I can’t let her live.

591
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,660
Don’t worry.

592
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,380
Jiang Jun knows nothing so far.

593
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,380
I can promise you that.

594
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,020
When things are done, I’ll help you watch her.

595
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,020
Our common enemy for now

596
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,940
is only Yuan Shuai!

597
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,380
You are awake.

598
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,740
I thought I’d never see you again.

599
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,260
Thank you for finding me.

600
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,220
Don’t be silly.

601
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,180
We are finally together.

602
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,780
I won’t let you leave me again.

603
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,740
Even God

604
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,060
cannot take you away from me.

605
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,740
Dare to steal a girl from God.

606
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,100
That’s quite impressive.

607
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,380
Lie down.

608
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,820
Here.

609
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,940
Just

610
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,860
take a good rest today.

611
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,700
I’ve helped you to ask for a day off.

612
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,780
Lie down with me for a while.

613
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,660
Jiang Jun.

614
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,980
I’ve checked the surveillance tape.

615
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,780
It wasn’t

616
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,020
an accident.

617
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,220
Shen Xin did it to you.

618
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,460
She removed the repair sign on purpose.

619
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,470
Shen Xin?

620
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,300
How do you want to deal with this?

621
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,220
I’ll listen to you.

622
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,460
About this matter,

623
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,380
you don’t have to get involved.

624
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,300
I’ll solve it myself.

625
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,380
No way!

626
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,180
She almost killed you.

627
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,340
As the saying goes,

628
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,260
“Sweep before your own door”.

629
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,170
I’m sure I also have my own problem.

630
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,210
I’m too insensitive to the office culture, making

631
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,420
my workplace relationships such a mess.

632
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,020
This incident is actually a reminder to me.

633
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,210
So I wanna try to solve it by myself first.

634
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,650
Okay?

635
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,300
Alright.

636
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,100
I’m sure you’ll do a good job.

637
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,540
So sleepy.

638
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,130
I’ll sleep for a while,
and go to work in the afternoon.

639
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,940
Why are you going to work?

640
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,460
You need more rest.

641
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,380
Got it?

642
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,900
No.

643
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,100
I wanna be an independent woman.

644
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,420
I can’t just rely on my husband…

645
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:23,980
Your what?

646
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,300
Say it again.

647
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,020
Jiang Jun?

648
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,460
Jiang Jun!

649
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,620
I heard you had an accident last night.

650
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:16,820
Are…

651
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,540
Are you alright?

652
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,700
Did you get hurt?

653
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,340
I’m curious.

654
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,740
When you did this thing,

655
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,260
have you considered my feelings?

656
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,700
What are you talking about?

657
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,380
I don’t understand.

658
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,860
You don’t?

659
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,940
You removed

660
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,500
the sign on purpose.

661
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,260
Are you too afraid to admit it?

662
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,900
That’s a lie!

663
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,900
Do… Do you have evidence?

664
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,780
You two,

665
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,420
come to my office.

666
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,500
You want evidence, right?

667
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,780
Take a look at this.

668
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,060
Doesn’t the bracelet in the picture

669
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,100
look quite familiar to you?

670
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,580
Ms. Qiao!

671
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,260
Ms. Qiao! Sorry!

672
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:25,860
Enough!

673
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,660
I don’t wanna hear your nonsense.

674
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,020
You will be dismissed by MH because of this,

675
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,380
and you won’t be accepted

676
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,980
by any other investment bank in the future.

677
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,820
Moreover, what you did is a crime.

678
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,460
If you wanna cry,

679
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,980
save your tears for the police.

680
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,580
Jiang Jun!

681
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,060
Jiang Jun, I’m sorry!

682
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,220
I just wanted you to be late
for your appointment.

683
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,260
I didn’t expect things would end up like that.

684
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,540
Please forgive me, Jiang Jun!

685
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,220
I’m begging you!

686
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,340
I don’t wanna leave here!

687
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,460
Jiang Jun, please!

688
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,500
Please forgive me! I shouldn’t have done that!

689
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,460
Ms. Qiao.

690
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,180
I know you are angry.

691
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,420
So am I.

692
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,020
But I think there must be
some misunderstanding.

693
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,900
I wanna have a moment with her.

694
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,940
I’ll get back to you later,

695
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,740
okay?

696
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,740
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

697
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,300
Jiang Jun!

698
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,940
Jiang Jun! Please forgive me!

699
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,580
If I left a paper trail,

700
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,140
my whole life would be ruined.

701
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,460
I thought you just got jealous easily,

702
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,540
but I was so wrong.

703
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,780
Turns out you were jealous

704
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
and stupid.

705
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,300
I just wanted to fight for an opportunity.

706
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,180
That’s why I said you were stupid!

707
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,180
If you want to surpass the others,

708
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,740
you should strive for it.

709
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,500
Why play all the tricks?

710
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,740
Have you thought

711
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,980
that if anything really
happened to me yesterday,

712
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,740
how could you escape from the law?

713
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,260
What about your parents?

714
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,860
And what about your future?

715
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,380
I know

716
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,620
even if I apologize to you,

717
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,220
it’s already pointless.

718
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,700
I can leave MH,

719
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,580
even the investment bank field.

720
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,780
But could you please not to turn me in?

721
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,180
I don’t want to go to prison.

722
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,420
Jiang Jun!

723
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,060
I’m begging you!

724
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,500
Cry!

725
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,580
How would that help?

726
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,060
Should you be the one crying?

727
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,820
Plus,

728
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,780
when did I say that I’d turn you in?

729
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,140
You…

730
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,820
You won’t hold me accountable?

731
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,660
I didn’t get hurt.

732
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,980
What would I hold you accountable for?

733
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,420
And

734
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,820
how would it be beneficial to me
if I asked Ms. Qiao to fire you?

735
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,140
I’d better keep someone

736
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,380
whom I got the goods on around.

737
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,100
Maybe one day

738
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,940
I can use you as a scapegoat.

739
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,540
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

740
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,580
Stop it. You are making me uncomfortable.

741
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,540
I’ll talk to Ms. Qiao later.

742
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,400
<i>MH Securities Co., Ltd.</i>

743
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,500
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

744
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,220
Who are you?

745
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,860
We are from the Compliance Dept of MH.

746
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,260
Someone reported that you took bribe.

747
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,180
We need you to cooperate with us
for the investigation.
