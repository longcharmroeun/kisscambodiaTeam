Love Is Sweet

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,420
Episode 25

3
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,480
What’s wrong?

4
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,530
It’s okay.

5
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,770
It’ll be fine.

6
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,770
Mrs. Jiang.

7
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,770
Can you tell me

8
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,610
what exactly happened back then?

9
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,490
Yuanyuan

10
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,650
Do you remember that when you were little

11
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,250
you loved the rice noodles my husband cooked?

12
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,850
Of course, I do.

13
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,850
Okay, stop playing.

14
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,130
Here, eat it while it’s warm.

15
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,490
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

16
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,650
Thank you, dad.

17
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,050
To have more people try his rice noodles,

18
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,770
he found a few friends

19
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,850
and built a rice noodle brand together.

20
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,810
It was called “Yixianqian”,

21
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,290
and financed by MH.

22
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,450
And later, his business grew bigger and bigger.

23
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,210
In order to open more stores,

24
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,210
he started financing and borrowing money.

25
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,970
But things began to become strange

26
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,370
after he worked with MH.

27
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,210
MH always tried to change our production pattern

28
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,250
and talk us into accepting C Group’s acquisition.

29
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,330
<i>Acquisition Letter of Intent</i>

30
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,890
My husband wouldn’t agree.
<i>Acquisition Letter of Intent</i>

31
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,730
Right at the time when we were short of cash,

32
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,370
a food safety issue suddenly emerged.

33
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,330
Sorry!

34
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,290
I’m sorry, Mr. Wang!

35
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,330
The company is working on it right now.

36
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,370
We will give you an explanation.

37
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,130
Yes! Yes!

38
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,850
Sorry! I’m really sorry!

39
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,890
Hurry!

40
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,410
Stop the restocking of Xinxin Supermarket.

41
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:17,970
Okay.

42
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,770
Withdraw all our products right away.

43
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,410
Okay.

44
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,970
Stop packing!

45
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,490
Leave me alone.

46
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,330
In the end, for the livelihood
of all his employees,

47
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,650
he had no choice but signed the contract.

48
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,890
He never came back again

49
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,650
after he left for Shanghai.

50
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,650
Mrs. Jiang.

51
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,290
It’s already in the past.

52
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,010
Don’t be so sad.

53
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,970
Have you ever thought

54
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,850
that the food safety issue

55
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,250
might not be an accident?

56
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,050
No way.

57
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,770
I trusted my husband.

58
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,890
He wasn’t that type of person.

59
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,250
He had high requirements for food quality.

60
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,170
He wouldn’t use inferior materials.

61
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,010
And the cause of his death

62
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,810
was also quite suspicious to me.

63
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,970
He did have hypertension.

64
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,810
But he took medicine regularly
and it was always under control.

65
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,170
Hadn’t he been shocked somehow,

66
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,170
he wouldn’t have got a heart attack.

67
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:54,810
Mrs. Jiang,

68
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,530
don’t worry.

69
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,770
I will find justice for Mr. Jiang’s death!

70
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,250
Do you still keep the contract?

71
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,210
Yes.

72
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,970
I’ll show you.

73
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,810
Okay.

74
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,970
This is the acquisition contract he signed.

75
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,850
Hope it’ll be helpful.

76
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,650
Great!

77
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,370
Mrs. Jiang, I’ll review it carefully.

78
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,610
Please take a good rest.

79
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,210
And you don’t have

80
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,450
to worry about Jiang Jun.

81
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,010
I will take good care of her,

82
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,890
no matter inside or outside of the office.

83
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,850
Yuanyuan,

84
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,570
thank you.

91

This world is a Colosseo.

93
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,130
Life and death,

94
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,090
winning and losing. It happens.

95
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,970
And the one who pushed him
to the dead end was himself

96
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,570
and MH.

97
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,170
It’s not you.

98
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,010
You don’t have to blame yourself too much.

99
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,570
Listen,

100
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,330
the interests and lives of others

101
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,530
are none of your business.

102
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,810
More importantly,

103
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,050
if you don’t fight for yourself,

104
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,450
no one would fight for you.

105
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,770
Remember?

106
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,330
Your mom fed me so well that I’ve put on weight.

107
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,490
Because she loves you!

108
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,250
-Yuanyuan!
-Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

109
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,250
Mrs. Jiang.

110
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:27,890
Yuanyuan.

111
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,690
Here.

112
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,370
Why didn’t you take these things?

113
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,130
Mrs. Jiang, you don’t have to.

114
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,090
Yuanyuan,

115
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,170
listen to me.

116
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,130
These are good for your health.

117
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,730
Look,

118
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,890
there are sea cucumber, antler and ginseng.

119
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,250
They are good sources for reinforcing energy.

120
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,210
Mrs. Jiang, these are enough for me

121
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,090
to take till the next New Year.

122
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,370
Yuanyuan, they are good for your health.

123
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,370
Jun, make sure he’ll take them.

124
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,610
Don’t worry, Mom.

125
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,770
We are adults.

126
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,050
We know how to take care of ourselves.

127
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,450
Jun,

128
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,210
Yuanyuan has told me.

129
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,810
I won’t stop you from working in MH.

130
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,610
But you’ve got to remember,

131
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,450
no matter what happens in the future,

132
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,370
you need to tell Yuanyuan first.

133
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,250
Don’t make reckless decisions by yourself.

134
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,090
Got it?

135
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,010
If Yuanyuan can’t solve the problem,

136
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,570
then come to Mom.

137
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,730
There’s no problem that I can’t solve.

138
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,290
Mom.

139
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,610
I love you.

140
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,210
I love you, too, my daughter.

141
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,730
Mrs. Jiang,

142
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,210
don’t worry.

143
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,450
I will take good care of Jun.

144
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,250
Yuanyuan,

145
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,290
I feel relieved that Jun’s with you.

146
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,530
Mom,

147
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,210
we gotta go now. We have a plane to catch.

148
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,250
Okay!

149
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,130
Then go ahead

150
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,210
and hurry.

151
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,290
Jun, don’t try to lose weight.

152
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,210
Eat well.

153
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,650
I will!

154
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,170
We are leaving!

155
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,730
-Okay.
-Mrs. Jiang.

156
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,170
Alright.

157
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,090
We’ll come back to see you when we have time.

158
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,290
Okay! Okay!

159
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,690
Go home, Mom!

160
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,370
Okay!

161
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,050
-Bye!
-Bye!

162
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,250
Be safe on the way!

163
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,090
Jun,

164
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,770
call me when you land.

165
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,410
Okay!

166
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,070
<i>Juneyao Airlines</i>

167
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,010
Look! He’s so handsome!

168
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,250
He really is!

169
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,970
But is that Ma’am next to him

170
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,490
his girlfriend?

171
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,770
I don’t think so.

172
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,370
She…

173
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,010
He kissed her!

174
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,450
People are watching! Why did you do that?

175
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,690
What?

176
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,170
We are adults.

177
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,170
How could you be jealous of those little girls?

178
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,850
You just found out?

179
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,170
If you go on like this,

180
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,410
you’ll be jealous all the time in the future.

181
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,050
Are you able to hold

182
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,210
your tears back?

183
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,290
Will you be okay if I cry?

184
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,130
Yuanyuan,

185
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,090
can you promise me one thing?

186
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,010
Mrs. Jiang,

187
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,370
go ahead.

188
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,610
I hope that

189
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,050
no matter how

190
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,690
your relationship changes,

191
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,610
or what happens between you two in the future,

192
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,770
you should always treat her nicely

193
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,410
and not be the one who makes her cry.

194
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,610
Jiang Jun,

195
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,010
if something makes you

196
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,050
feel really, really sad,

197
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,330
just cry out loud.

198
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,090
I will catch you

199
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,770
the moment you pass out.

200
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,530
Why are you being so sweet today?

201
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,690
Because I love you.

202
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,890
I love you, too.

203
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,810
I’m not a Ma’am!

204
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,010
You are a Ma’am!

205
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,890
And I’m a Mister!

206
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,570
Let’s go there again, okay?

207
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,010
Excuse me. Can I help you?

208
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,370
Hi. I’m with the Property Management Company.

209
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,290
I’m here to deliver New Year’s gifts to the owners.

210
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,530
Hey, baby,

211
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,610
I just remembered that we need to get our mails.

212
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,730
Let’s go.

213
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,730
It’s okay. You can give it to me.

214
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,090
Well,

215
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,970
look, he’s busy with

216
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,210
delivering gifts.

217
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,530
Now, the one who lives next door is my friend.

218
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,850
You can leave the gift to me. I’ll give it to him.

219
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,730
I can’t do that.

220
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,250
The gifts are for Mr. Yuan of 701

221
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,810
and Miss Jiang of 702.

222
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,370
Mr. Yuan of 701?

223
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,770
Shouldn’t the owner be Mr. Su?

224
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,250
It’s a misunderstanding!

225
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,090
Seriously.

226
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,970
I’m their friend. You can leave the gifts to me.

227
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,010
Speaking of that, Mr. Su,

228
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,610
which apartment do you live in?

229
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,410
-I…
-We live in 701!

230
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,450
I think you made a mistake.

231
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,330
Mr. Yuan owns both 701 and 702.

232
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,170
He’s the Executive Director
of a top investment bank in Shanghai.

233
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,930
He’s the only owner who owns two apartments

234
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,570
on the same floor in this community.

235
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,050
I can’t be wrong.

236
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,410
Executive Director?

237
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,570
Mr. Yuan?

238
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,730
Yes.

239
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,370
Su Chang!

240
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,850
I gotta go.

241
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,690
I’ll go upstairs to deliver gifts.

242
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,570
Listen, baby, don’t be mad!

243
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,410
Let me explain!

244
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,930
-Can we… Can we go inside first?
-I don’t want to!

245
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,490
I don’t want to hear your explanation!

246
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,090
What’s wrong?

247
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,410
Cover is blown!

248
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:54,770
Xinxin!

249
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,690
Come here! Come on!

250
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,690
Well…

251
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,170
What happened?

252
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,570
He didn’t lie to you on purpose.

253
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,490
Su Chang really regrets that he lied to you.

254
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,410
But, you know

255
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,410
that men can’t swallow their pride easily.

256
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,170
He was afraid that you’d look down upon him.

257
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,450
But I’ve never looked down upon him!

258
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,250
Why would he lie to me?

259
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,250
Later…

260
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,250
Please try to understand him.

261
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,290
Actually, Su…

262
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,450
Baby.

263
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,170
Could you please let me explain?

264
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,730
I know it’s my fault.

265
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,650
I don’t wanna hear it!

266
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,090
Su Xinxin! Stop!

267
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,250
I dare you take another step!

268
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,890
If you leave, I’ll…

269
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,450
You’ll what?

270
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,170
Su Xinxin.

271
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,850
Listen up!

272
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,610
Don’t ask

273
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,290
and don’t talk.

274
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,610
I’ve loved you for 10 years!

275
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,890
You are the only girl I wanna marry!

276
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,970
I know I lied to you,

277
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,570
and I really regret about that.

278
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,290
But if you don’t forgive me,

279
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,450
the day you leave Shanghai will be my deathday!

280
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,970
I… I know that I’m not rich,

281
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,690
but I will work hard for us!

282
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,650
Please give me another chance.

283
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,730
Xinxin!

284
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,330
Baby,

285
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,490
I trust you.

286
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,450
I won’t leave you again.

287
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,050
Come on. Let’s go to our home!

288
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,490
Let’s go.

289
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,650
See?

290
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,290
This move

291
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,410
works for everybody!

292
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,930
Good for you!

293
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,770
But let me warn you.

294
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,490
Don’t try to fool me.

295
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,130
I’m not that easy to be fooled.

296
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,570
I promise

297
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,810
I won’t lie to my queen.

298
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,010
That’s good.

299
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,850
Mr. Yuan, Miss Jiang.

300
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,090
You are finally back.

301
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,090
I wish you happy ever after.

302
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,770
This is your New Year’s gift.

303
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,170
Thank you.

304
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,290
I guess you won’t forget
to pay the water bill anymore.

305
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,270
No. I won’t.

306
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,890
I’ll go upstairs now.

307
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,890
Happy New Year!

308
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,610
Now I know

309
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,210
why Su Chang’s cover was blown.

310
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,730
Who is he?

311
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,010
He’s good at seeing through lies.

312
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,510
Anyway,

313
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,890
now that your apartment is available,

314
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,970
you should move back.

315
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,690
Dream on!

316
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,690
I’ll live wherever I like.

317
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,450
There’s nothing you can do about it.

318
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,730
What if I don’t agree?

319
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,730
Then I’ll sell 701 right away.

320
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,290
I’ll see if you have the heart to kick me out.

321
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,810
I don’t.

322
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,570
Let’s go.

323
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,050

Get back to work already?

00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,410
It was Mr. Luo.

328
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,610
He asked me to sort out some materials.

329
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,890
I might need to take another business trip.

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,290

331
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,010
and I already become “empty nested”.

333
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,490
I’ll be back soon.

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,170
make her allow me to work in MH?

336
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,170
It’s a secret.

337
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,170
I won’t tell you.

I’ve got what I wanted.

I don’t care about how.

342
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,050
Okay.

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,130

C Group was still a small company five years ago.

He’s never showed up again ever since.

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,010
Take good care of yourself.

378
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,890
Wait for me. I’ll be back soon.

379
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:11,730
Morning!

380
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,330
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

381
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,010
Happy New Year!

382
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:15,770
Hi, everybody!

383
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,930
Hi, Happy New Year!

384
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,410
Happy New Year!

385
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,210
Happy New Year!

386
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,210
Happy New Year!

387
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,730
Your bracelet is so pretty!

388
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,610
Of course.

389
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,810
It’s the latest design of this brand.

390
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,490
I waited for a long time for my order.

391
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:27,850
By the way,

392
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,890
you know what?

393
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,290
Our Investment Banking Dept.

394
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,930
outperformed ourselves again last year.

395
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,290
The shareholders are very happy.

396
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,010
I guess

397
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,730
Mr. Fan will try his best today

398
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,010
to encourage us and draw us a pie in the sky.

399
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,290
That’s not a bad thing.

400
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,650
Drawing a pie means we are competent.

401
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,050
Otherwise, no matter how big the pie is,

402
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,250
no one can take it.

403
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,290
Moreover,

404
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:46,970
you see,

405
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,530
he provides us with such a good platform

406
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,010
to show our talents.

407
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,490
So, we may just show ourselves as well.

408
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,850
It’s a win-win situation.

409
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,130
I admire that you have such a good platform

410
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,130
to show your talent.

411
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,890
Why don’t you give your salary and bonus to me?

412
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,130
I don’t think you need them that much.

413
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,250
Salary and bonus

414
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,970
are my reward for making money

415
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:03,970
for the company with my

416
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,410
strength and talent.

417
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,890
Why do you sound like

418
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,650
a street artist living on tips?

419
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,490
Vulgar!

420
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,210
You are vulgar!

421
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,570
Mr. Fan.

422
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,010
Mr. Fan, morning.

423
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,410
Morning.

424
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,290
Mr. Lin is here.

425
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,290
He’s waiting for you in your office.

426
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,090
Mr. Lin?

427
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:21,570
Yes.

428
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,650
Which Mr. Lin?

429
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,850
Okay. I see.

430
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,370
Okay.

431
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,450
Hi, everybody! Happy New Year!

432
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,370
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

433
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:37,930
Happy New Year!

434
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,410
Happy New Year!

435
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,170
Morning, Jiang Jun.

436
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,130
I heard

437
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,130
the receptionist said

438
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,090
that someone named Lin

439
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,050
came to see Mr. Fan this morning.

440
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,530
It’s the first working day of a new year.

441
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,810
Who is so active?

442
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,450
You don’t know him?

443
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,450
How are you supposed to survive in MH then?

444
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,210
He’s our Vice President of Securities,

445
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,890
Mr. Lin, Lin Taimo!

446
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,090
So he’s Mr. Lin that people talked about.

447
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:03,930
Jiang Jun,

448
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,050
you know Mr. Lin very well, don’t you?

449
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,090
I…

450
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:32,650
Mr. Fan.

451
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,530
Long time no see.

452
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,650
Mr. Lin, welcome to the Investment Banking Dept.

453
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,850
It’s such a big honor to have you here.

454
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,410
Mr. Lin, do you feel better?

455
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,130
Thank you for asking, Mr. Fan.

456
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,490
I feel much better now.

457
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,090
During my recuperation,

458
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,810
you had to take care

459
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,290
of all the matters of the company.

460
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,410
I really feel sorry for that.

461
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,970
So, I think it’s time

462
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,970
to unload the burden

463
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,730
from you.

464
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,810
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Lin.

465
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,250
I’m sure after you are back,

466
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,090
you’ll lead the Investment Banking Dept.

467
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,970
to a higher level.

468
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,210
Here. Have some coffee to refresh yourself.

469
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,850
Thank you for your years of hard work.

470
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,570
Thanks.

471
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,210
Mr. Lin.

472
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,570
After all, you were just recovered.

473
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,730
Working too hard will harm

474
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,490
your hard-won health

475
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,850
again!

476
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,090
Fellows.

477
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,450
Excuse me for a moment.

478
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:00,930
Mr. Fan.

479
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,450
Mr. Fan.

480
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,490
First of all, let’s welcome the return
of Mr. Lin, Lin Taimo!

481
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,250
Welcome! Welcome!

482
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,890
Now, we’ll invite Mr. Lin,

483
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,530
Vice President of Securities of MH,

484
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,450
to give us a speech.

485
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,410
Welcome! Welcome!

486
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,210
Dear fellows of the Investment Banking Dept.,

487
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,490
Happy New Year!

488
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,730
I’m Lin Taimo.

489
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,130
Thank you for your hard work last year.

490
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,010
You made a great contribution
to our company’s performance.

491
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,450
This year, the global economic situation

492
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,690
will continue to recover.

493
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,050
Investment banks are crucial

494
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,530
for the market economy, influencing the broad

495
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,930
financial resources by matching

496
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:47,970
sellers and investors.

497
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,850
Hope you can keep up the good work

498
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,290
and bring our company to a new level!

499
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,130
Thank you for your speech, Mr. Lin.

500
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,650
I’m sure under Mr. Lin’s leadership,

501
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,450
our company will have a brighter future.

502
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:02,610
Last but not the least,

503
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,290
I wish all of you a big success

504
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,530
in your work!

505
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,570
-Thank you, Mr. Fan!
-Thanks, Mr. Fan!

506
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,610
Thank you! Thanks!

507
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:12,970
Mr. Lin, this way.

508
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,610
Please.

509
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,890
Looks like somebody’s backer is back!

510
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:28,850
Yep.

511
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,530
In front of all the people,

512
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,970
he only greeted her.

513
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,370
How flattered that was!

514
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,290
Mr. Lin!

515
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,210
Mr. Lin!

516
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,370
Mr. Lin!

517
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,250
I’ve heard so much about you!

518
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,450
I’m Ma Xiuran, Vice President
of the Investment Banking Dept.

519
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,810
I learned so much

520
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,250
from your speech!

521
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,730
So I’m here to introduce myself.

522
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,890
Mr. Ma.

523
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:52,930
I know you.

524
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,330
You are a rare talent

525
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,970
of our company.

526
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,490
You know me?!

527
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,090
I’m so flattered!

528
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,810
I really appreciate your coffee.

529
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,730
It’s been my

530
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,970
favorite brand.

531
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,210
Their coffee beans

532
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,050
-are selected…
-Mr. Ma.

533
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,250
May I go to your office for a chat?

534
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,130
I’ll be honored!

535
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:09,890
Please! Please!

536
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,290
Okay.

537
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:10,970
This way!

538
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,090
Miss.

539
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,890
Are you the one in this picture?

540
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,410
Who are you?

541
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,370
I’m Cao Heng’s friend.

542
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,210
Could you please tell me

543
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,170
where he is?

544
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,290
Don’t ask me! I’m also looking for him!

545
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,490
He escaped from the debts

546
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,410
and left me here alone!

547
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,130
What kinda man is he?

548
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,770
Don’t get me wrong.

549
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,610
I’m not here to collect debts.

550
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,890
I’m here

551
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,450
to pay my debts.

552
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,170
Pay your debts?

553
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,690
You owe him money?

554
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:57,850
How much?

555
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,450
Is it enough to pay off his gambling debts?

556
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,890
Pretty much, I think.

557
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,170
Excuse me.

558
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,410
I’m here to see someone.

559
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,610
Sorry, sir.

560
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,570
It’s not our business hour yet.

561
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,970
I want to see your boss.

562
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:20,930
Our boss?

563
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,090
Brother Hua is not here yet.

564
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,250
Brother Hua?

565
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,570
Isn’t your boss named Cao?

566
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,330
Cao Heng?

567
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,650
Are you here to collect debts?

568
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,690
I’m actually here to give him money.

569
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,450
I met him five years ago.

570
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,290
I wouldn’t have been with him

571
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,930
if he hadn’t had money.

572
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,770
But he said he wanted to start a business,

573
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,330
and he borrowed money from everybody he knew.

574
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,650
I even lent him a lot.

575
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,530
But turns out

576
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,810
he used the money to gamble.

577
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,450
Hadn’t I had the key to his home

578
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,890
and taken some money to pay his debts,

579
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,730
he would’ve already been beaten to death
by the creditors!

580
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,530
Besides,

581
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,490
he always gambles every penny he has.

582
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,650
I saw some money in his home again today.

583
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,290
Who knows where he got it?

584
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,250
If I didn’t take it away,

585
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,930
he’d use it to gamble again.

586
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,410
It’s not all his fault.

587
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,170
That’s how gambling works.

588
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,170
Once you are involved,

589
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,890
it’s quite easy to fall off the wagon.

590
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,410
How about this?

591
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,050
I’ll give you the money I owe him.

592
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,770
Please give it to him for me.

593
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,130
I actually am quite curious.

594
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,770
Where does he go gamble?

595
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,050
How come he’d lose so much money?

596
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,610
I’m not sure about that.

597
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,850
But I heard

598
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,450
it was near a bar he once owned.

599
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,210
It could be an illegal casino,

600
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,250
which doesn’t allow outsiders to go in.

601
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,890
So where does he usually hang out?

602
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,290
I don’t think I can tell you that.

603
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,130
The casino is in the alley

604
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,210
10 meters
to the right from the KTV.

605
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,530
Then you’ll see a steel stairway.

606
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,690
The casino is right on the second floor.

607
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,930
Take this.

608
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,130
Show it to the gatekeepers.

609
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,610
Tell them that you are Brother Hua’s friend,

610
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,330
and they’d let you in.

611
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,290
Thank you.

612
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,730
Mr. Du?!

613
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,570
You are just everywhere, aren’t you?

614
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,170
You’d never disappear.

615
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,050
No wonder my eyelid has been jumping

616
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,250
since I left home.

617
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,210
I thought I’d see something dirty.

618
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,730
Turns out it’s you, Mr. Yuan.

619
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,850
What are you doing here?

620
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,890
I’m looking for Cao Heng.

621
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,330
Why?

622
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,770
Help Jiang Jun to find out the truth
of her father’s death.

623
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,250
Aren’t you here for the same reason?

624
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,130
I think you are here to tie up the loose ends.

625
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,850
I’ve told you.

626
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,370
I’m here to find out the truth.

627
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,730
Then go on.

628
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,170
We’ll both continue.

629
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,050
Why don’t we work together?

630
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,810
Since we are both looking for Cao Heng,

631
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,730
let’s find him together.

632
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,970
I’m just one step away from the truth.

633
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,050
I just don’t know where the casino is.

634
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,090
Work together?

635
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,090
Are you kidding, Mr. Du?

636
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,330
You aren’t capable enough

637
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,690
to find it.

638
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,450
Why should I lower myself by working with you?

639
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,930
Because I know more secrets than you do.

640
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,690
How so?

641
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,450
I once dealt with this case

642
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,570
when I was in GE.

643
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,930
I know a lot of things the others don’t.

644
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,850
More importantly, I do want to help Jiang Jun.

645
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,410
That’s very kind of you.

646
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,410
But why should I trust you?

647
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,930
It doesn’t matter whether you trust me or not.

648
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,570
But I’m telling you,

649
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,570
if we wait for him

650
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,970
in the casino today,

651
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,330
he’ll definitely show up.

652
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,050
Wanna a bet?

653
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,330
Why not?

654
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,530
Are you sure the illegal casino is here?

655
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,690
Don’t come along if you don’t trust me.

656
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,930
I’m Brother Hua’s friend.

657
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,050
Secretary Du,

658
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,050
is this Brother Hua’s casino you told me about?

659
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,170
It’s so small

660
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,050
and shabby.

661
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,650
How am I supposed to gamble here?

662
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,610
I know, Mr. Yuan.

663
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,850
We are only here for business anyway.

664
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,610
Let’s just kill some time here and have some fun.

665
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,490
Alright.

666
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,130
Did you bring that one million yuan

667
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,090
in cash?

668
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,090
I’ve sent someone to fetch it.

669
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,330
This gentleman is quite responsible.

670
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,130
Give him some tips.

671
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,850
Share with him.

672
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:24,970
Thank you, Mr. Yuan!

673
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,370
Please, go in!

674
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,210
Let’s go, Secretary Du.

675
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,330
This way, please.

676
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,890
There was 3,000 yuan in cash,
and the wallet is worth 5,000 yuan.

677
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,730
Remember to pay it back to me.

678
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,850
You are so petty, Secretory Du.

679
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,210
Because it’s you.

680
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,530
Show some sincerity if you wanna work together.

681
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:17,730
What’s going on?

682
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,250
<i>Lin Taimo Vice President</i>

683
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:18,930
How come Mr. Ma’s office
<i>Lin Taimo Vice President</i>

684
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,290
is Mr. Lin’s now?
<i>Lin Taimo Vice President</i>

685
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:22,930
Haven’t you heard?

686
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,890
Ma Xiuran is transferred to the headquaters.

687
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,730
It’s said he’ll work there as the Manager

688
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,410
of the Admin Office for three years.

689
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,050
Admin Office?

690
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:31,690
Yes.

691
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,010
Isn’t it to manage the secretaries

692
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,370
and day-to-day activities of the company?

693
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,650
It appears to be a promotion,
but actually it’s a demotion.

694
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,050
<i>According to the requirements of the company’s
business development and strategic plan,</i>

695
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,710
<i>upon deliberation, the Board of Directors
decided from today on,</i>

696
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,530
<i>1. Lin Taimo, VP of Securities of MH,
will serve as GM of Investment Banking Dept.</i>

697
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,170
It’s going to be a big change!
<i>1. Lin Taimo, VP of Securities of MH,
will serve as GM of Investment Banking Dept.</i>

698
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,950
<i>1. Lin Taimo, VP of Securities of MH,
will serve as GM of Investment Banking Dept.</i>

699
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,650
<i>2. Ma Xiuran, former VP of Investment Banking Dept.,
will serve as GM of Admin Office of the Headquarters.</i>

700
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,810
Once Mr. Lin is here,
<i>2. Ma Xiuran, former VP of Investment Banking Dept.,
will serve as GM of Admin Office of the Headquarters.</i>

701
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,490
Mr. Fan will become a figurehead.
<i>2. Ma Xiuran, former VP of Investment Banking Dept.,
will serve as GM of Admin Office of the Headquarters.</i>

702
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,970
It’s a sign of an impending storm.

703
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,930
You know what?

704
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,490
I think Mr. Lin is trying to threaten

705
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,170
Mr. Fan by transferring Mr. Ma.

706
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,010
Makes sense.

707
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,930
However,

708
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,570
someone will be happy

709
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,850
about Mr. Lin’s return.

710
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,490
Come on! Let’s go back to work!

711
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:23,850
Mr. Ma,

712
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,090
you are…

713
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,330
Hold back your sympathy.

714
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,570
I just lent my office

715
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,530
to Mr. Lin.

716
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,010
I’m transferred to the headquarters.

717
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,370
I can take the time to alleviate the pressure of work

718
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,850
and relax myself a little.

719
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,210
Oh, I see.

720
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,930
Then, congratulations, Mr. Ma!

721
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,930
Jiang Jun, Mr. Lin wants to see you.

722
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:41,690
Okay.

723
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:43,730
You’d better

724
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,490
pick your words wisely.

725
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,450
I’ll be back after all.

726
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,210
Then I wish you

727
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,370
a big promotion in the headquarters.

728
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,970
And hope you’ll come back soon!

729
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,850
See you.

730
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:02,430
<i>Lin Taimo Vice President</i>

731
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:07,850
Come in.

732
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,890
Mr. Lin, you wanna see me?

733
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,050
Jiang Jun.

734
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:13,690
Here.

735
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,410
Come here. Take a seat.

736
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,330
How do you like my new office?

737
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,370
It’s a little small,

738
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,370
but it has the best geomantic quality

739
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,850
in the Investment Banking Dept.

740
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,610
How do you like the decoration?

741
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,010
It’s nice.

742
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,810
By the way,

743
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,090
how are you adapted to your new job here?

744
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,130
Do you get along with your coworkers?

745
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,170
Yes.

746
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,410
They are all very nice to me.

747
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,890
I heard

748
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,930
that your performance was quite good.

749
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,730
You even signed the job contract
earlier than the others.

750
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,770
Well done!

751
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,330
You didn’t let me down.

752
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,770
I didn’t want to let you down,

753
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,970
so I told myself to work harder.

754
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,490
If your dad

755
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,730
knew you are doing

756
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,250
such a good job,

757
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,050
he’d definitely be proud of you.

758
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,610
You knew my dad?

759
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,690
Your dad was Jiang Yaoming, the founder

760
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,130
of Jiangnan Flavor, right?

761
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,210
Yes.

762
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,930
We were friends for years.

763
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,370
He was a positive person.

764
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,930
We always enjoyed our conversations.

765
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,770
Unfortunately, he died so young.

766
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,090
I didn’t expect

767
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,570
that you knew my dad.

768
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,250
But I was in college back then.

769
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,130
I didn’t get to see him
before he passed away.

770
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,930
He was also a client of our MH.

771
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,650
For the brand “Yixianqian”,

772
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,770
we all put a lot of efforts in it.

773
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,610
I know it wasn’t easy for my dad
to start the business.

774
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,970
He and my mom tended not to share bad news.

775
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,170
So, even to the very end,

776
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,890
I didn’t get to help them with anything.

777
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,650
Mr. Lin,

778
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,370
what exactly happened back then?

779
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,890
Could you please tell me?

780
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,170
Back then, your dad’s company

781
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,170
was lack of money.

782
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,290
I tried my very best to help him.

783
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,770
In the end, we found C Group.

784
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,810
Actually, they were very generous with their terms.

785
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,130
After our serious consideration,

786
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,210
we decided to sign the acquisition contract.

787
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,130
But not long after,

788
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,290
I heard that your dad

789
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,810
suddenly died of heart attack.

790
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,890
I think he must have been very sad

791
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,450
about giving his company away.

792
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,090
If I had known something like that would happen,

793
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,730
I wouldn’t have…

794
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:54,730
Mr. Lin,

795
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,610
it’s not your fault.

796
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,890
You just finished an acquisition case

797
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,890
according to the protocols.

798
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:07,890
Jiang Jun,

799
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,130
if you need any help

800
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,770
at work in the future,

801
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,410
just come to me at any time.

802
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,770
In fact, considering the friendship
between your dad and me,

803
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,490
you could even

804
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,650
call me uncle.

805
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,970
I’m already quite thankful

806
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,210
that you approved me to enter MH.

807
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,410
I won’t ask more.

808
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,130
Okay.

809
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,050
Anyway, let me know if you need any help.

810
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,530
You can go back to work now.

811
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,250
Then I’m leaving, Mr. Lin.

812
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,050
Brother Hua!

813
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,810
I’m here.

814
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:56,810
Get him!

815
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:58,690
Get him!

816
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,170
Sir!

817
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,370
I’m sorry!

818
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,050
Run?

819
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,130
It’s…

820
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:47,650
Run!
