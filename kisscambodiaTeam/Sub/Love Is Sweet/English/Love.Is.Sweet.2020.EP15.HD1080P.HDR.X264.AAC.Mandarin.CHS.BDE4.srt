00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,970
Love Is Sweet

00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,970
Episode 15

3
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Think about it carefully.

4
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,080
It’s not your birthday.

5
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,080
Is it the birthday of Wealth?

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,600
Think again.

7
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,320
0905?

8
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,160
0905 is,

9
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
the day when we met again.

10
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,760
Where is Jiang Jun?

11
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,160
She’s took some days off.

12
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Some days off?

13
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,760
Are you taking some days off?

14
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Are you alright?

15
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,660
<i>Zhu Youyi, Chenxin Technology</i>

16
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,840
Hello?

17
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,600
Yuan Shuai, something’s come up.

18
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Defeng Capitals is purchasing my company.

19
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,400
Okay, I see.

20
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,320
I’m coming over.

21
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,560
Su Chang,

22
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
there’s a file folder named CX

23
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,000
on my desktop.

24
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,280
It includes several investors

25
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,400
who’re interested in Chenxin Technology.

26
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,520
Contact them immediately.

27
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,720
Tell them to be here tomorrow noon
for a meeting

28
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,030
if they’re still interested in Chenxin Technology.

29
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,840
Okay, boss.

30
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,520
Thank you, sir.

31
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,320
Aren’t you buying me a meal?

32
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,880
Here?

33
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,160
Yeah.

34
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,840
Are you going to sell me to someone

35
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,920
so you can collect money for Li Xiaochuan?

36
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,000
How would I?

37
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,560
Even if I sold myself to someone,

38
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
I wouldn’t do it to you.

39
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
What’s with this place?

40
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,800
I don’t know either.

41
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
Li Xiaochuan said he would take care of this.

42
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,520
So, I didn’t ask too much.

43
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,000
It is here.

44
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,480
He’s coming?

45
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,760
Morning!

46
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,240
I was afraid you wouldn’t find it.

47
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,560
Mr. Du?

48
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,600
Why are you here?

49
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
Mr. Du?

50
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,760
Is this the Mr. Du?

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Hello, I’m Xu Li.

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,240
Hello.

53
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,560
Thank you for investing in

54
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
Xiaochuan’s West World.

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,400
Investing?

56
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,880
I thought Mr. Du was assessing
for the project.

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
Why is he the investor now?

58
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
After assessing his project

59
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,560
I thought it’s pretty promising.

60
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,040
And I happened to have some spare money.

61
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,080
So, I did it.

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Now that Mr. Du is helping you,

63
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,800
Xiaochuan will succeed definitely.

64
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,640
After all, he’s the man I chose.

65
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,720
I need some help.

66
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,080
Okay.

67
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,680
Here.

68
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
These are for the girls.

69
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Thank you.

70
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,880
Mr. Du.

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
Xiaochuan.

72
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,800
So, your appreciation dinner is?

73
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,960
There’s a very nice recreation area
on the mountain,

74
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,360
which is very suitable for camping.

75
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,040
I brought a barbecue and food.

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,800
We can have a barbecue tonight,

77
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,440
and set up a bonfire.

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,920
On a cold day like this?

79
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,880
Are you sure we’re having a barbecue?

80
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,400
Yeah.

81
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,320
We do it all the time abroad.

82
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,480
It’s a lot fun.

83
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,360
Just follow me.

84
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,000
Let’s go.

85
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,960
Camping?

86
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,200
Picnic?

87
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,880
BBQ?

88
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,560
Thank you.

89
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,560
You can mop your sweat.

90
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,600
Thank you.

91
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
We’re here!

92
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,760
Finally.

93
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,480
Ah, my sore limbs...

94
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,240
I haven’t been tired like this for a year.

95
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,760
You two can take a rest.

96
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,800
I’ll go help Xiaochuan.

97
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
Don’t, Mr. Du!

98
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,160
You’re the guest today.

99
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,360
I’ll go help Xiaochuan.

100
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,240
Go take a rest with Jun.

101
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
I’m sorry, Mr. Du.

102
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,280
I felt bad involving you in this.

103
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,000
It’s not like that. I think this is great.

104
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,960
I have been at home for a long time.

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,880
It’s good that I can breathe some fresh air now.

106
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,500
Jun.

107
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,720
One, two, three.

108
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,800
Pretty.

109
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,840
Xiaochuan.

110
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,080
This is the sixth time that
you’ve overcooked something, right?

111
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,840
Do you really know how to do it?

112
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,760
Didn’t you join activities like this before?

113
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,360
I did.

114
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
But I was not in charge of cooking.

115
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
So, what were you in charge of?

116
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,840
I was pitching the tent.

117
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,360
And I was guiding them to climb the mountain.

118
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,560
Why’s the fire getting stronger?

119
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,440
Go do something else.
Leave this to me.

120
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,800
Okay.

121
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
Jun, Jun, Jun!

122
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
I think Mr. Du

123
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,880
is a good option.

124
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,560
Don’t you like Li Xiaochuan anymore?

125
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,160
What?

126
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
Xiaochuan

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
will be the protagonist in my heart forever.

128
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,720
I just think Mr. Du

129
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
is like those who exist only in the manga.

130
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,480
He’s soft, rich and considerate.

131
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,560
And what’s important is
that he knows how to barbecue.

132
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,960
Seriously, the woman who can marry him

133
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,120
is so blessed.

134
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,320
Right, Jun?

135
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,720
Eat your food.
Food can’t stop you from talking, right?

136
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
The firewood is not enough.

137
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
I’ll go pick some.

138
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,480
I’ll go with you.

139
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,520
Okay?

140
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,720
Xiaochuan.

141
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,360
I...

142
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,080
I...

143
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,080
Can I ask you a question?

144
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:39,920
Sure.

145
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,360
Yuan Shuai said you hadn’t dated anyone.

146
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,720
Is that true?

147
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
I… I can tell you.

148
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,840
Because I believe you.

149
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,080
But you can’t tell anyone else.

150
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,120
I promise!

151
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,840
I swear I won’t tell anyone else.

152
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,960
One time?

153
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,720
One year?

154
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,960
Then what does that mean?

155
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,160
One instant.

156
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,240
One instant?

157
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,360
What the heck is that?

158
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,000
My gosh.

159
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
He seems to have been hurt so badly.

160
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,240
What kind of a girl

161
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,720
could hurt him like this?

162
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
I’m so jealous.

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,320
Xiaochuan, I’m sorry.

164
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,320
Did I remind you of your painful memory?

165
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,440
I...

166
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,520
I have some tissues.

167
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,600
You...

168
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,800
Xiaochuan.

169
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,840
It’s okay. You got me.

170
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,000
There’s something in my eye.

171
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,880
Yuan Shuai!

172
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,440
Doctor Zhu.

173
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,360
Yuan Shuai, I just got some information.

174
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,320
Defeng Capitals has enforced
the debt-to-equity swap.

175
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,020
So, they have the

176
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,400
<i>Zhu Youyi, the founder of Chenxin Technology
and a PhD in Computer Science</i>
So, they have the

177
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,480
<i>Zhu Youyi, the founder of Chenxin Technology
and a PhD in Computer Science</i>

178
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,640
20% stake of Chenxin Technology.
<i>Zhu Youyi, the founder of Chenxin Technology
and a PhD in Computer Science</i>

179
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,040
<i>Zhu Youyi, the founder of Chenxin Technology
and a PhD in Computer Science</i>

180
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,820
Are we gonna lose?
<i>Zhu Youyi, the founder of Chenxin Technology
and a PhD in Computer Science</i>

181
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,040
Are we gonna lose?

182
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,440
Calm down.

183
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,560
It’s still unknown who will win.

184
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,160
One year ago,

185
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,880
you told me to issue new bonds to raise money.

186
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,800
You even lent me some money in private

187
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,120
and encouraged me to hang on.

188
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,960
I have faith in you.

189
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,360
So, please

190
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,000
help me get through this.

191
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,920
Rest assured, Doctor Zhu.

192
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,160
Just focus on your new system right now.

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,720
Leave everything else to me.

194
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Okay.

195
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,240
I’ll leave it entirely to you.

196
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,520
This way.

197
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,520
Mr. Zhang.

198
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,120
Mr. Zhang!

199
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,520
<i>Zhang Ting, the Investment Director

200
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,040
Take a seat.
<i>Zhang Ting, the Investment Director
of Defeng Capitals</i>

201
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,860
<i>Zhang Ting, the Investment Director
of Defeng Capitals</i>

202
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,720
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

203
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,000
Two cups of coffee, please.

204
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,160
Thank you.

205
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,360
Why?

206
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,360
Has a small takeover for Chenxin

207
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,600
aroused the curiosity of Mr. Yuan?

208
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,120
It’s a small takeover for you.

209
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,760
But to Chenxin,

210
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,640
it’s life and death.

211
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,800
Of course I have to show up to save its life.

212
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,400
Mr. Yuan.

213
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,160
Have you read a lot of martial arts novels?

214
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,480
Are you trying to be a hero
in the capital market?

215
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
I have to remind you.

216
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,120
You’re just a listing agent.

217
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,280
Mr. Zhang,

218
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,920
whether I’m a listing agent or a selling agent,

219
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,880
we’re all working for others.

220
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,040
Right?

221
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,360
Chenxin’s debt is due.

222
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,360
If Chenxin can’t afford to recover its bonds,

223
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,360
it’s perfectly justified for us

224
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,960
to exchange the stock.

225
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
It’s the rule.

226
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,560
Whatever you say is of no use now.

227
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,040
The rule?

228
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,760
Mr. Zhang,

229
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,440
in our Agreement,

230
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
the loan extension is one year.

231
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,520
Now you denied it,

232
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,520
required Chenxin to pay back immediately,

233
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,040
enforced the debt-to-equity swap,

234
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,200
and even incited shareholders to sell equity
in private.

235
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,720
You’re attempting

236
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,240
to control Chenxin.

237
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,160
That’s right!

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,160
The shareholders are of different minds.

239
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,360
Technicians are being suppressed.

240
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,240
Due to this, the publishment of

241
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,040
IoT assessment system has been postponed.

242
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
I see.

243
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,120
This is quite difficult.

244
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,080
Or I can give you some advice.

245
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
On behalf of Defeng Capitals,

246
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,720
I’d like to buy out your system patent with 100 million yuan.

247
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,760
Are you kidding me?

248
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,000
If you agree to that,

249
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
we will withdraw the purchase.

250
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,680
I’m raising money!

251
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,920
I’m not selling my patent.

252
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,960
How can you do R&D if you don’t have any money?

253
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,400
Once similar systems appear in the market,

254
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,280
your system will be valueless.

255
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,640
After all, the financial strength
of the technology giants on the market

256
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
is much stronger than you.

257
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,880
That is making a feint to the east
but attacking in the west.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,120
Their intention is not the stock.

259
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,960
Doctor Zhu,

260
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,840
did you see that?

261
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,920
Your system is of great value.

262
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
He offered 100 million yuan.

263
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,120
Have more faith in yourself.

264
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,500
<i>Su Chang</i>

265
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,080
Speak.

266
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:43,880
It’s done.

267
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
We have six investors now.

268
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,840
They will come to the company at
12 pm the day after tomorrow.

269
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,840
Okay.

270
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,080
Alright.

271
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,200
That’s all for the teatime.

272
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,000
What do you mean?

273
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,520
I don’t mean anything.

274
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,960
Mr. Zhang,

275
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,960
enjoy three cups of coffee.

276
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,680
You don’t need to sleep after finishing them.

277
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,440
What?

278
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,760
Excuse me.

279
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,280
Yuan Shuai!

280
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,360
Yuan Shuai!

281
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,120
Why are you leaving?

282
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,200
Do you have a way out?

283
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Tell me honestly.

284
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,880
Did you know they wanted

285
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,760
to buy out your patent a long time ago?

286
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,160
Actually, they came to me before.

287
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,760
But I rejected.

288
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,360
You know it, too.

289
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,300
We have poor sales this year.

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,960
The shareholders don’t want to spend money
in supporting me with the R&D anymore.

291
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,560
So, I didn’t tell you.

292
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,640
Doctor Zhu.

293
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,800
Others are quietly making a fortune.

294
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,480
You’re quietly losing.

295
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,560
I’ve known you for a year.

296
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,280
When will you learn to act

297
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,560
as the owner of your company?

298
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,720
People are good at different things.

299
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,760
Again,

300
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,120
you refused my offer to be the manager.

301
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,440
Let’s go.

302
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,720
Where are we going?

303
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,600
I’m going to train you in the company.

304
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,360
I’ll teach you how to be
an inspirational leader in one day.

305
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,000
Thank me for finding some investors for you.

306
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
No way.

307
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,600
I should make speeches again?

308
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,320
No.

309
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,920
Of course you should.

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,560
Let’s go.

311
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,640
You… You know me.

312
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,880
When I make a speech,

313
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,080
I can’t say anything.

314
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,000
Drink less coffee.

315
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,040
Thank you.

316
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,160
Actually, West World...

317
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,120
Actually, West World is pretty good.

318
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,440
It’s just that Xiaochuan’s idea

319
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,880
is somehow immature.

320
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,240
You decided to be his investor
even after knowing that?

321
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,720
I’m taking a chance.

322
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
At least, his skills are excellent.

323
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,360
There may be a surprise.

324
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,800
No worries. I will help him.

325
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,760
Okay.

326
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
A poor doggy!

327
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,120
My poor doggy,

328
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,600
why are you here?

329
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,480
Come here.

330
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,040
My poor doggy.

331
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Mr. Du.

332
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,080
A little dog.

333
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,720
You dislike dogs?

334
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,720
I used to like them.

335
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,480
There you go.

336
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,080
Then what happened?

337
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,880
Let me tell you a secret.

338
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,240
When I was little,

339
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,320
I had a dog.

340
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,760
I had no friends

341
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,480
or family back then.

342
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,000
But it’s there with me.

343
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,960
When I was 12,

344
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,480
Du’s took me in

345
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,000
because I was born on the same date

346
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,320
with their biological son.

347
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,880
I was happy at first.

348
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,720
So, I took my dog with me.

349
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,480
But they threw it out

350
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,200
because they thought it was dirty.

351
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,800
When I found it,

352
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,080
it had already frozen to death.

353
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,720
It’s a pity.

354
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,920
I’m sorry

355
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,600
that I have reminded you of your painful memory.

356
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,120
It’s not like that.

357
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,920
I feel relieved after telling you.

358
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,760
Keep this secret for me.

359
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,160
Or I’ll kill you.

360
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,240
Got you.

361
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,840
I will zip my mouth.

362
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,560
But I do think

363
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,360
it’s better to

364
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,800
talk about your worries and regrets
with your friends.

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,440
It will help

366
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,240
release your stress.

367
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,640
So,

368
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,560
it seems like you have some worries
and regrets, too.

369
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,680
Everyone in this world

370
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,560
has his worries and regrets.

371
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,680
I shared

372
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,720
mine with you.

373
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,360
To be fair, shouldn’t you

374
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,920
share yours with me?

375
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,680
My biggest regret is that

376
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,400
I didn’t get to meet my dad

377
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,080
before he passed away.

378
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,320
Yixianqian Noodles, founded by my father,

379
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,680
suffered a hostile takeover.

380
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,840
He was busy with the company,

381
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,200
and hadn’t slept for days.

382
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,520
He passed away
when he had a recurrence of an old illness.

383
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,680
It was late after I ran over from school.

384
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
What’s your father’s company’s name?

385
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,280
Jiangnan Flavor, what’s wrong?

386
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,960
Sorry.

387
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

388
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,680
Sorry.

389
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

390
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,560
Sorry.

391
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,040
The subscriber...

392
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,280
What the heck?

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,520
I haven’t seen her all day.

394
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,560
Li,

395
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
did you bring the power bank?

396
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,480
I forgot to charge my phone yesterday.

397
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,160
The phone battery died.

398
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,160
No?

399
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,720
Fine.

400
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,240
<i>Xu Li</i>

401
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,020
The first activity of
West World. Hooray!
<i>Xu Li</i>

402
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,800
The first activity of
West World. Hooray!

403
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
Why’s Du Lei there?

404
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,720
Li Xiaochuan!

405
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,760
Mr. Du, the bun smells great.

406
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,720
Why am I suddenly feeling bad?

407
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,080
Hello, Brother?

408
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,120
Li Xiaochuan.

409
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,160
Come to my place right away.

410
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,440
I will give you 30 minutes.

411
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,760
Or I will release the video

412
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,160
and let everyone see

413
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,120
how bad you’re

414
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,800
at building a relationship

415
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,640
while still trying to develop a dating app.

416
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:12,920
Wait!

417
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,240
Well...

418
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,520
My brother wants me home now.

419
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,920
Right now?

420
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,920
You can tell him you’re working.

421
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,920
Although he’s your brother,

422
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,200
you can’t let him take control of you.

423
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,520
My brother wants me back now!

424
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,720
But we haven’t finished our food.

425
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,440
And the tent was already set up.

426
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,440
It’s okay.

427
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,480
We can go back since he’s needed.

428
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,440
We can come here next time
when we’re fully prepared.

429
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,040
We will have a chance to do this.

430
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,880
Let’s go.

431
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,360
Let’s go.

432
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,800
I’m so sorry…

433
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,760
Yuan Shuai is so annoying.

434
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,760
He didn’t even tell you why he wanted you back.

435
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,840
No matter what it is,

436
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,400
it’s right to come back.

437
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,920
Is there an emergency?

438
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,920
Probably not. I’ll walk you home first.

439
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,040
How can you

440
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,880
come into a girl’s room?

441
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,400
Just go!

442
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,040
Help.

443
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,920
Brother.

444
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,360
Why are you so angry?

445
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,720
What’s with the camping?

446
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,160
I haven’t told you about it.

447
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,440
I found an investor for West World.

448
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,280
So, this is probably the first

449
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,040
activity for our company.

450
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,120
Why’s Du Lei there?

451
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,480
Because he’s

452
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,640
the investor for West World.

453
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,640
Did Jiang Jun recommend him to you?

454
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,040
And,

455
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,560
I’ve been observing...

456
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,800
Did I allow you to sit?

457
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,160
I’ve been observing...

458
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,760
I found Jiang Jun and Mr. Du have

459
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,800
better assessing opinions than you.

460
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,440
I’ve got my first fund.

461
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,080
So, I will be pretty busy lately.

462
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,480
Don’t call me to come over

463
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,800
if there’s nothing important.

464
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,120
Li Xiaochuan.

465
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,080
Did you forget that

466
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,600
I still have something on you?

467
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,320
A video which can prove that

468
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,920
your West World is just a joke.

469
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,240
You liked a girl

470
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,160
and thought she was your perfect match

471
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,200
after you used your algorithm.

472
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,200
And it turns out what?

473
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
She got married with someone else.

474
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Your first love ended in failure.

475
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,840
You’d cried for three days at home.

476
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,200
I know. I know.

477
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,960
Get back on the horse that bucked you.

478
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,760
That was the old algorithm.

479
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,600
There won’t be a problem like that.

480
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,760
I’m pissed off.

481
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,840
You’re acting weird.

482
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,240
Why are you angry

483
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
about Mr. Du investing in me?

484
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,520
Are you really angry?

485
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,840
I’m afraid you’re tricked!

486
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,040
I’m not angry.

487
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,040
I know why you’re angry.

488
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Say nothing.

489
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,880
It’s because...

490
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,760
Don’t guess randomly.

491
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,560
You’re jealous because Mr. Du
and Jiang Jun...

492
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,400
I’m not.

493
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
They...

494
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,000
I’m warning you. Stop.

495
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,240
They have better insights than you

496
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,760
and they supported my project.

497
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,760
Right?

498
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,160
So what?

499
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,520
It’s too late.

500
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,960
I will show you

501
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,440
West World

502
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,160
is a terrific project.

503
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,040
You punk!

504
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,800
My biggest regret is that

505
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,560
I didn’t get to meet my dad

506
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,160
before he passed away.

507
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,440
Yixianqian Noodles, founded by my father,

508
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,680
suffered a hostile takeover.

509
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,880
He was busy with the company,

510
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,360
and hadn’t slept for days.

511
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,520
He passed away
when he had a recurrence of an old illness..

512
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,480
What’s your father’s company’s name?

513
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,640
Jiangnan Flavor.

514
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,360
<i>Be fair and just in handling affairs
A noble spirit that will never perish</i>

515
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,940
<i>A man of integrity with a clear conscience</i>

516
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
Not going in?

517
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,200
This world is a Colosseo.

518
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,600
Life and death,

519
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,560
winning and losing. It happens.

520
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,400
And the one who pushed him
to the dead end was himself and MH.

521
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,760
It’s not you.

522
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,480
You don’t have to blame yourself too much.

523
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,320
Dad, I’m home.

524
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,840
Do you have anything to tell me?

525
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,560
If it’s okay, I will go back to my room.

526
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,480
Wait.

527
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,200
I heard Du Lei resigned.

528
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,640
Is it true?

529
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,840
When did he resign?

530
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
To whom?

531
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,120
I had no idea about it.

532
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,440
If it hadn’t been a GE’s client

533
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
who complained to me,

534
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,880
when would you

535
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,680
tell me that, Linda?

536
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,480
I didn’t do this on purpose.

537
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,760
It was just

538
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,320
an impulse.

539
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,800
An impulse?

540
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,480
He wants to piss me off!

541
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
It’s not like that, dad.

542
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,200
Don’t be angry.

543
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
He was shocked

544
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,480
about the last case

545
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,520
and thought he lost his face.

546
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,200
So,

547
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,440
he hasn’t fully recovered from...

548
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,240
So, he resigned?

549
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,360
Linda, good for you.

550
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,040
You have all kinds of reasons for him.

551
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,360
Are you playing intimate sister and brother?

552
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,080
But did he care about you

553
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,760
when he left all the mess to you?

554
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
Can you solve it?

555
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,880
Has he ever thought about you?

556
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,480
Now you’re still covering for him.

557
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,920
He didn’t leave all the mess to me.

558
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,200
Resignation is nothing more

559
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,160
than a normal personnel change.

560
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,720
Dad, don’t be angry.

561
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,760
I will try to persuade him into coming back.

562
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,760
No need!

563
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,400
Are you the little brother

564
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,600
my dad mentioned?

565
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,920
I’m Du Ling.

566
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,720
I’ll be your sister from now on.

567
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,280
They took away my dog.

568
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,160
Will they kill it?

569
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,560
Is it going to die?

570
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,520
I couldn’t protect it.

571
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,520
Law of the jungle. Survival of the fittest.

572
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,360
This is what my dad told me.

573
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,520
If you don’t want to be bullied,

574
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
grow up as fast as you can

575
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,440
and become stronger.

576
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,720
So, you will be able to protect others.

577
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,920
Stand up.

578
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,560
You still don’t understand this.

579
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,760
I will teach you in the future.

580
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,200
And I will be with you forever.

581
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,080
Really?

582
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,400
Yeah.

583
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,130
<i>Du Lei</i>

584
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,860
<i>Du, how have you been?</i>

585
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,150
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

586
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,560
Okay.

587
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,080
Mr. Yuan, this...

588
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,150
Is... Is he ignoring me?

589
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,120
Is he really angry

590
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,160
at what happened yesterday?

591
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,320
Mr. Yuan, you wanted Xiaochuan back so urgently.

592
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,640
Did he piss you off?

593
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,880
I heard you set up a new company.

594
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,920
How’s it?

595
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,720
Were you happy in the first activity?

596
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,000
So, he is jealous about Mr. Du’s
investing in Xiaochuan.

597
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,080
Why are you laughing?

598
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,600
Nothing.

599
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,360
Here.

600
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,120
A special cup of coffee to calm you down.

601
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,520
I don’t know coffee is capable of doing that.

602
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,320
I refuse it!

603
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,560
Mr. Yuan, is this new?

604
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,800
Your outfit is stunning.

605
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,800
It’s so integrated into your noble identity.

606
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,280
Cut the crap.

607
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,000
This is not crap.

608
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,440
I’m telling the truth.

609
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
Do you have a lot of free time?

610
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,480
No work to do, yeah?

611
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,280
Okay.

612
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,240
Put all the materials

613
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,400
of Chenxin Technology

614
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,600
on my desk in five minutes.

615
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,040
Four minutes and fifty seconds left.

616
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,560
It’s already done.

617
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,080
And,

618
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,000
I’ve been visiting the Reference Office.

619
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,360
I read about so many cases you did before.

620
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,760
I found your insights are way better than others.

621
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,800
No wonder they have

622
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,360
been defeated by you.

623
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
You really are invincible.

624
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,680
Enough.

625
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,840
I think you deserve a better job elsewhere.

626
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,240
Should I go find

627
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,440
a comedy institution for you?

628
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,600
That’s right.

629
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,040
Don’t be angry. You look better when you smile.

630
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,760
Really?

631
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,000
Hello.

632
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,840
Mr. Yuan.

633
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,560
The project group is having a dinner tonight.

634
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,160
Ms. Qiao asked me to remind you of that.

635
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,880
Okay, got it.

636
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,000
What’re you laughing for?

637
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,560
What are you laughing for?

638
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,040
I heard someone said I look better when I smile.

639
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,440
Do you believe every word I said?

640
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,560
I do.

641
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,360
Sit.

642
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,480
Chen Yicheng,

643
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,280
how much fragrance did you put on?

644
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,280
The scent is so strong.

645
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,760
I can’t stand it. Sit over there.

646
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,360
Okay.

647
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,160
Let’s exchange our seats.

648
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,120
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

649
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,120
Mr. Yuan, do you still remember this restaurant?

650
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,520
Two years ago,

651
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,080
we were here for a merger case.

652
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,040
Four negotiation representatives were drunk

653
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,760
while we were not.

654
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,880
Thank you for being my back-up.

655
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,520
I remember Mr. Ma was also here.

656
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,240
You drank too much yourself.

657
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,240
And I sent you back home.

658
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,720
Well...

659
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,320
Can we start eating now, Mr. Yuan?

660
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah, sure.

661
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,000
Dig in.

662
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,080
Back-up?

663
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,080
Send her home?

664
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
She doesn’t have any friends?

665
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,120
You’re so good to

666
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,120
all the girls.

667
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,560
Are you a heating pad,

668
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,720
heating yourself to every girl?

669
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,960
Hope you have a bellyache.

670
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,200
Dear Juno,

671
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,760
I’m here to remind you
to improve your relationship

672
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,960
with your perfect match.

673
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,920
Are you asleep, the master of the secret crush?

674
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,560
Not yet.

675
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,120
Something’s wrong?

676
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,320
I have a question for you.

677
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,440
Go on.

678
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,160
Why? Are you troubled by someone?

679
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,120
A man

680
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,800
is so good to you out of the blue,

681
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,400
and you’re so moved by him.

682
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,320
But you found he’s good to other women, too.

683
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,720
What does he mean?

684
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,960
Women are the same.

685
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,360
She can say sweet words to a man
at this moment

686
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,720
but be entangled with another man at the next.

687
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,360
Did you have similar experience?

688
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,000
These people are so difficult to understand.

689
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,000
It’s too much.

690
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,960
Yeah.

691
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,680
And they have nothing to fear.

692
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,280
Probably it’s because they know

693
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,920
we like them.

694
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,320
Like them?

695
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,320
Who likes him?

696
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,520
I don’t like him!

697
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,320
Is this...?

698
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,920
A painting?

699
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,720
Brother Yuanyuan,

700
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,880
did you solve it?

701
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Are you okay?

702
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,920
Did you have a nightmare?

703
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,320
Of course no.

704
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,040
A good message for you.

705
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,400
I’ve found the owner of the magic cube.

706
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,520
Really?

707
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,040
Who?

708
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,600
It’s me definitely.

709
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,040
I was the person who solved it.

710
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,480
Yeah.

711
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Can you speak to it?

712
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,760
What did it say to you?

713
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
It said I will be the owner
of this magic cube forever.

714
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,400
What about me?

715
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,240
It’s okay.

716
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,040
You can come to me when you miss it.
