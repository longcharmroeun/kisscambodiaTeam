00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,880
Stop crying out loud!

5
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
Don’t!

6
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,720
It’s almost done!

7
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,720
Be gentle!

8
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,080
I am! Just a moment

9
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,960
I’m going to be bald!

10
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,550
Can’t you be gentle?

11
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,080
How do you feel?

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,360
You didn’t keep your promise.

13
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,760
You said you’d walk Wealth today.

14
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,160
So, this is the punishment you get.

15
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,880
Wealth!

16
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
A monster took your daddy away!

17
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,480
What did you say? Say that again?

18
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,360
I’m sorry,

19
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,550
my queen.

20
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,550
That’s more like it.

21
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,360
Well said.

22
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,080
I’ll go take a shower. You go cook.

23
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
I also need to take a shower.

24
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,520
According to the rule, I’ll use the bathroom
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

25
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,400
We have such a rule?

26
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:31,920
We do.

27
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,760
Why don’t I remember?

28
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,480
Go cook!

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,240
I’m hungry!

30
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
I only remember that you need to cook
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays!

31
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,920
My family status seriously mismatches
my workplace status.

32
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,760
I wanna file a complaint.

33
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,040
Complaint rejected!

34
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
I just bought this face wash for a month,

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,920
yet you already used it up!

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,520
Can’t you be a little thrifty?

37
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
I can afford more!

38
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
What’s the big deal?

39
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,920
Okay.

According to this thermometry,

your ovulatory period should be

45
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,960
today!

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,800
If your calculation is right,

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
why haven’t I got pregnant

48
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,200
after this long?

49
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
Something must be missing.

50
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,080
Honey,

51
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,640
do you think

52
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
maybe we…

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,840
Folic acid!

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,520
What folic acid?

55
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,600
Folic acid!

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,320
You need folic acid supplements.

57
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,720
It’ll increase the chance of conception.

58
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,320
Okay?

59
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,640
Sure!

60
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,200
You scared me.

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,240
Li, I’ll go get the soup.

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,240
Here.

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,630
Be good and eat up the soup.

64
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,630
I’ll go buy some folic acid

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
and groceries. I’ll be right back.

66
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,880
Can I not eat it?

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,200
Absolutely not.

68
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,040
I’m leaving.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,080
Eat up the soup!

70
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,120
Yes, sir!

71
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,320
It’s chicken soup every day!

Come on! Hurry!

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680

116
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,320

00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,920
After it released the news that it’ll go public,

159

it has become the target
of many well-known investment banks.

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,280
No wonder you are so successful
at such a young age.

190
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,280
Your girlfriend must feel pressured.

191
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
I don’t think so.

192
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Mr. Chen is such a considerate gentleman.

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,280
Whoever gets to date him

194
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,760
must have saved the world in another life.

195
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,920
I’m so flattered.

196
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,960
It’s not like that.

197
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,240
-It’s exactly like that!
-You are being modest!

198
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,560
Don’t you have work to do?

199
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
-Miss Shen!
-Miss Shen!

200
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
Let me!

201
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,560
My dearest Xin,

202
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
are you angry with me?

203
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,640
Why would I be angry?

204
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,880
Listen.

205
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,280
I was just here to get some water.

206
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,600
I heard them talking about

207
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,920
how nice the new restaurant

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,240
Moon House is.

209
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,520
-And then they praised you.
-I…

210
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
So you were on cloud nine,

211
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,400
right?

212
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,120
No! No!

213
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,720
I wasn’t!

214
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,840
Seriously! That wasn’t the case!

215
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,160
It’s not like what you thought!

216
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,880
Because I…

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
I heard there was a nice restaurant.

218
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,600
So I wanted to treat my girlfriend some nice food.

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,520
How about this?

220
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,520
Let’s go there together after work?

221
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,720
I don’t have time.

222
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,520
It’s okay.

223
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,800
We can go home after work

224
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,480
and I’ll cook you Western food.

225
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
Let go! We are at work!

226
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,320
I overheard that Mr. Chen would cook in person.

227
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,760
Why am I not invited?

228
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,920
Hey, you scared me!

229
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,200
Go away, single guy!

230
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,120
It’s not up to you.

231
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,400
The hostess hasn’t said anything yet.

232
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,240
Well,

233
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,280
my hostess,

234
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,440
seriously,

235
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,160
I swear in the name of my doctorate
from Stanford University.

236
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
I didn’t betray you.

237
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,640
Xiang Ding,

238
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,840
come visit us this weekend for a meal.

239
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Okay.

240
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,840
This Sunday,

241
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
at 6:00 p.m.

242
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,080
Thanks, bro!

243
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,700
<i>TOWER 1</i>

244
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,160
Hello, Mr. Du.

245
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,480
I’ll be their office soon.

246
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,960
It’s said GE is also involved in this Fengchao case.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,720
Be alert.

248
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,840
Okay, I got it.

249
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,960
I’m so sorry,

250
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,920
but Mr. Dong’s schedule is very tight recently.

251
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,240
I’ll make you an appointment
as soon as he’s free.

252
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,360
It’s alright.

253
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,080
You can call me at any time.

254
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,480
Okay.

255
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:28,960
Bye.

256
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,280
Mr. Yuan, it’s such a small world.

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,120
Morning, Ms. Jiang.

258
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
Mr. Yuan, you are quite an actor.

259
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,160
You play my lover at night,

260
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,360
but my rival during the day.

261
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,400
For all this time,

262
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,120
you didn’t blow your cover at all.

263
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Life is life, and work is work.

264
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,240
I’m just trying to be professional.

265
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,040
Okay.

266
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,120
Then from now on,

267
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,040
let’s play fair with no cheating.

268
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,520
By the way,

269
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,640
Fengchao has caught the attention
of many investment banks.

270
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,200
But it’s very difficult to meet
its founder Dong Qi.

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,600
How about you?

272
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
Do you have any idea?

273
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,720
I’m just an insignificant VP.

274
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
What kinda idea would I have?

275
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
Isn’t Dong Qi your alumnus?

276
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,960
Don’t you have the alumni association?

277
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,320
Dong Qi is my alumnus?

278
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,560
You don’t know?

279
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,040
Of course, I do!

280
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,200
But he graduated early.

281
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,960
Seldom do people know him
in our alumni association.

282
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay.

283
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,520
If nothing else, I’ll hang up now.

284
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,080
Bye.

285
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,680
It’s my phone.

286
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,920
I know it’s yours.

287
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,600
I’m cleaning the table, so I have to remove it.

288
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,880
Miss Jiang,

289
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,200
according to Article 24 of the rules of Room 702,

290
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,640
it’s your turn to clean the dishes today.

291
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
Please watch your attitude and finish your job.

292
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,640
Okay, Landlord Yuan.

293
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,440
Please answer it for me.

294
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,280
Wait!

295
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,080
Is it Ms. Jiang?

296
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,560
New apartment building! You can buy
one apartment for 980,000 yuan!

297
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,600
Are you interested?

298
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,400
No, thanks.

299
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,560
Miss Jiang.

300
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,720
I thought it was Mr. Dong calling you

301
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,440
since you were so anxious.

302
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,880
How could I get a hold of him?

303
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,800
It’s mine.

304
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,120
Hello?

305
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,760
Okay.

306
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,360
I don’t think the morning would work.

307
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,760
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

308
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,120
Okay. Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

309
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,600
Alright. Bye.

310
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,400
Who wants to meet you?

311
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
Mr. He of Rongxing.

312
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,200
We’ll have a video conference
tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

313
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,080
Why do you ask?

314
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,560
Nothing.

315
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,280
Who’s calling, Miss Jiang?

316
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,680
It’s that realtor again.

317
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
He always calls to sell me an apartment.

318
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,120
How can I afford that?

319
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I’ll go change my clothes.

320
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,240
Wealth.

321
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,880
Today is your opportunity to prove your loyalty.

322
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,400
I’ll

323
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
count on you.

324
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,720
Hello? Senior Sister,

325
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,000
how is it going?

326
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,320
You are lucky.

327
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,200
One of the persons in charge
of our alumni association

328
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,800
was Dong Qi’s college roommate.

329
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,720
He heard that Dong Qi would

330
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,600
go to DT Aid tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

331
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,960
to promote his public welfare plan.

332
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,240
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.,

333
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,280
DT, right?

334
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
That’s great! Thank you so much.

335
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,880
I really appreciate your help.

336
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,360
You are so welcome.

337
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,800
When we were in the college association,

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
you also helped me write the reports.

339
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,720
It’s just a small favor. Don’t mention it.

340
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,680
By the way,

341
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,560
the activity tomorrow requires tickets.

342
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,960
You’d better get one online.

343
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,320
Okay.

344
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,520
Thank you.

345
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,880
Bye.

346
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,320
What are you doing here, Wealth?

347
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,380
<i>Voice Memos</i>

348
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,040
Yuan Shuai!

349
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,440
I’ve got hard evidence here.

350
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,760
How will you explain it?

351
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,620
I’m not explaining anything.

352
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,400
You think you are in a spy movie?

353
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,480
Can’t believe you played such a trick.

354
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
All is fair in the business war.

355
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
You should get used to it.

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,580
Good girl.

357
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,720
Don’t be mad.

358
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,860
Girl,

359
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,920
just consider it

360
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,860
my reward

361
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,720
for reminding you of using the resources

362
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,720
of your college.

363
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,000
Well done.

364
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,840
I’ll buy all the rest of the tickets.

365
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You’ll be screwed then.

366
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:15,700
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

367
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,780
<i>Order details</i>
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

368
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:16,960
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

369
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,360
I’ve already bought a ticket
for tomorrow’s activity.

370
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,800
Feels so good!

371
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,440
Wealth!

372
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,480
In that case, don’t blame me

373
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,720
for beating you at your own game.

374
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,920
I love you so much!

375
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,560
Jiang Jun!

376
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,160
Open the door!

377
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,320
What are you doing? I can’t wait any longer!

378
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,760
Open the door!

379
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,480
Let me in!

380
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,560
Nature calls me, you know that?

381
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,680
Hurry! Let me in!

382
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,200
Yuan Shuai! I’ll take your car key!

383
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,480
If you don’t wanna be late,
you’d better leave early!

384
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,280
Jiang Jun!

385
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,120
Jiang Jun! You’ve gone too far!

Qiao.

388
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,520
Get in the car.

389
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,880
I’ll drive you to work.

390
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,600
Thank you, Yuanji, but I’ve called a cab.

391
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,200
It’s the rush hour.
It won’t be easy to get a cab.

392
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,760
You…

393
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Aren’t you afraid that people would gossip?

394
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,480
Gossip?

395
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,920
Just let it be!

396
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,280
Do you know how much older I am than you?

397
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,760
It’s not the ancient time anymore.

398
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
Age is no longer a problem.

399
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,960
I don’t care.

400
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,520
Anyway, you should date someone

401
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,160
at your own age.

402
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,240
You and I, never gonna happen!

403
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,680
I don’t know about that.

404
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,200
But,

405
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,640
I want you

406
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,000
to take these.

407
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,720
I do like these things.

408
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,480
Thank you.

409
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,440
But I’ve bought all these necklaces.

410
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,120
And I have many more.

411
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,320
Don’t waste your money again.

412
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
It took me very long to collect all these.

413
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Qiao! Qiao!

414
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,480
Mr. Dong.

415
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:52,880
Nice to meet you.

416
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,520
I’m Jiang Jun, from MH.

417
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,900
<i>Jiang Jun</i>

418
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,520
Our company does plan to go public this year,

419
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,920
but I’m not

420
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,160
quite interested in MH.

421
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,640
Sorry.

422
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,800
Could you

423
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,480
take a look at our cooperation plan

424
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,440
before making the decision?

425
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,800
You know,

426
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
I’ve received cooperation plans

427
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,560
from quite a few investment banks,

428
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,040
including some top ones.

429
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,120
With that being said,

430
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,880
the strength of MH

431
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,760
and the terms you provided

432
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,320
didn’t impress me that much.

433
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,320
Mr. Dong,

434
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,880
the terms can be discussed.

435
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,800
I believe that MH is able

436
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,080
to provide you with a satisfying plan.

437
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,200
This is Mr. Du Lei, Managing Director

438
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,040
of the Investment Banking Dept. of MH.

439
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,440
Mr. Du?

440
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,160
You’ve been quite successful in the past year.

441
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,600
I’ve heard something about you.

442
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,800
I heard that MH’s net profit in Q3

443
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,450
increased by five percentage points

444
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,360
after you’ve worked there for only two years.

445
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,360
You are indeed a capable young man.

446
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,720
I’m flattered, Mr. Dong.

447
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,120
If MH is given the opportunity

448
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,440
to work with Fengchao,

449
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,320
I promise

450
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,760
there are more surprises awaiting you.

451
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,040
Your fees are 10% lower
than other investment banks.

452
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:09,960
Of course,

453
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,880
it’s just a small gesture to show our sincerity.

454
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
Got up early to catch a late show.

455
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,520
Hello,

456
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,040
Ms. Jiang.

457
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,040
Mr. Dong,

458
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,680
I’m Yuan Shuai,

459
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
MD of the Investment Banking Dept.

460
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,640
of GE.

461
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,320
I’ve heard a lot about you.

462
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,840
But,

463
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,920
if you are here today

464
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,000
for the same purpose as theirs,

465
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,800
I’m sorry.

466
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,360
I’m afraid I’d disappoint you.

467
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,800
They are here for work?

468
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,600
Oh, no!

469
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,760
I’m not here for work.

470
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,960
As I know, you are going

471
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,920
to propose a public welfare program today

472
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,880
to expand your overseas markets.

473
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,160
Of course,

474
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,320
it surely is a win-win proposal.

475
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,240
But frankly speaking,

476
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,960
those old-fashioned council members

477
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,360
will definitely think it’s a project that challenges

478
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,440
the public’s conventional perspective

479
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,640
and triggers public opinion risks.

480
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:05,820
I’m sure many of them
will object to your proposal.

481
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,220
<i>Yuan Shuai Council Member DT</i>
I’m sure many of them
will object to your proposal.

482
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,160
I’m sure many of them
will object to your proposal.

483
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,440
You even know that?

484
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,800
A little bit.

485
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,440
When did you become DT’s council member?

486
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,280
Take a guess.

487
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,040
So, Mr. Dong,

488
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,280
if you have my vote,

489
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,560
your chance of success

490
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,080
will increase by over 50%.

491
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,320
Why don’t we

492
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,610
talk about work

493
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,690
after your proposal is approved?

494
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,080
Come to my office later.

495
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,200
Excuse me.

496
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,000
See you later, Mr. Dong.

497
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I didn’t plan well, and made him
get the upper hand.

498
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,000
Sorry that you came here for nothing.

499
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,920
It’s alright.

500
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,360
Yuan Shuai is good at ambushing people.

501
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,440
Don’t blame yourself.

502
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,600
Come on.

503
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,680
Let’s go back to the company.

504
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,840
You go first. I’ll wait a little longer

505
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,120
to see if I can get another chance
to talk to Mr. Dong

506
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
after the meeting.

507
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,960
Okay.

508
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,280
Then I’ll go back first.

509
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,840
Please wait for my call.

510
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,880
Okay, Mr. Dong.

511
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,600
Take care.

512
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,240
See you.

513
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,120
How come the meeting ended 15 minutes earlier?

514
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,000
Because I’m efficient.

515
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,320
Don’t get cocky so soon.

516
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,040
It’s just a beginning after all.

517
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
But you are already out, Ma’am.

518
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,880
But I’m the Ma’am you love,

519
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,480
Mister!

520
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,840
Then let the Mister take good care of you
when we are home.

521
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,200
What are you doing here?

522
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,160
Allow me to introduce.

523
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,040
This is Jia Yuanji,

524
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,880
my administrative assistant.

525
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,640
You… You are the son of GE’s CEO!

526
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
You are okay to be his administrative assistant?

527
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
It’s my pleasure

528
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,760
to serve Mr. Yuan.

529
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Mr. Yuan,

530
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,440
you still have a video conference

531
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,320
with Mr. He of Rongxing.

532
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,000
Let’s go.

533
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,280
I’m leaving, Ms. Jiang.

534
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,720
You’ll be dead when you are home!

535
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,040
Hello? Li, what’s wrong?

536
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You feel sick?

537
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,040
Don’t panic! I’ll be right there!

Don’t make it a big deal.

It’s just a size of a pea.

549
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,160
Since you are pregnant,

550
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
you must need more nutrition.

551
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,160
Do you want chicken soup, or…

552
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,920
Stop! Stop!

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,160

Xiaochuan cooks chicken soup for me every day.

555
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,840
And now, as soon as I hear the word chicken,

556
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,320
I feel like I’m a bowl of chicken soup.

557
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,280
You have no idea

558
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,960
how lucky you are!

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,520
what Yuan Shuai and I have eaten the most

561
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,000
at home these months?

562
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,200
Rice and scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

563
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,000
And I have to clean the dishes.

564
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Women have different ways to realize their

565
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,720
self-value.

566
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,080
Think about it. With or without me,
there’s no difference to our company.

567
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,880
But my Xiaochuan

568
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,400
definitely can’t live without me.

569
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,680
So, family is my stage for realizing my value.

570
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,160
You, however, are a career woman.

571
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,880
So the workplace is your stage.

572
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,400
Therefore,

573
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,640
the two stages are good in different ways.

574
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,320
Right?

575
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,680
Good for you, Li!

576
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,200
Where did you learn

577
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,480
to make a speech like that?

578
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,040
It’s because my Xiaochuan is a
good influence on me.

579
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,800
But, I do need

580
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,640
to have a serious talk with you.

581
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,680
You have to learn to balance your life.

582
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,760
Thank about it. You and Yuan Shuai

583
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,400
are always on business trips,

584
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,400
as though you were in
a long-distance relationship.

585
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,480
Aren’t you worried

586
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,720
that it’d affect your relationship?

587
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,200
Moreover,

588
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,160
unlike us, the girls

589
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
nowadays tend to

590
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,200
be very proactive.

591
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,560
Yuan Shuai is handsome and rich.

592
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,840
If another girl steals him from you,

593
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,040
plus his single image…

594
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,760
Stop it!

595
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,280
You made it sound like we were

596
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,400
about to break up.

597
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,600
I didn’t mean that.

598
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
I do believe Yuan Shuai

599
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,400
is a faithful and responsible man.

600
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,240
I was talking about you.

601
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,080
Will you stop being a workaholic

602
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,640
and care more about your boyfriend,

603
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,320
Jiang Jun?

604
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,520
Do you hear me?

605
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,760
Yes, I do.

606
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,520
No. 12.

607
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,600
Yes. I’m here.

608
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,280
Careful!

609
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,240
Slow down!

610
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,200
Doctor,

611
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,200
is it serious?

612
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,880
It’s okay. You are fine.

613
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,840
Don’t worry.

614
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,160
I don’t. I don’t.

615
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,560
So is there anything I can do

616
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
to make it better?

617
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,440
Don’t eat cold and spicy stuff.

618
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,640
Pay attention to your food,

619
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,840
which is ignored by most of people nowadays.

620
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,360
I will!

621
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,360
And I’ll watch her.

622
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,360
Jun,

623
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,200
do you think I should

624
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,280
call Xiaochuan

625
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,600
and tell him he’ll become a father?

626
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,280
Doctor,

627
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,960
why do you shake your head?

628
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,320
You are not pregnant.

629
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,560
What?

630
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:03,840
Then…

631
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,440
Why did I feel nauseated

632
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,560
and sick?

633
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,280
They were symptoms

634
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,280
from eating unclean food.

635
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,160
It’s not serious.

636
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,440
You’ll recover after taking some medicine.

637
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,080
It must be a dream.

638
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,040
It was a dream.

639
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,920
Just a dream.

640
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,200
You were dreaming.

641
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,040
You were dreaming.

642
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,520
Our Li was dreaming.

643
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,040
Look.

644
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,960
I bought your favorite cake for you.

645
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,720
I won’t eat it. I’m on a diet.

646
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,320
What?

647
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,520
You are angry because

648
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,800
I ruined your meeting with Mr. Dong?

649
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,320
I am not.

650
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,600
Business is business.

651
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,800
I said it myself.

652
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,600
I’m glad that you are not angry.

653
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,560
I’ll go change my clothes now.

654
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,480
Stop!

655
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,040
Sit down.

656
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,520
What? You said you weren’t angry.

657
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,320
Be honest,

658
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,040
whom did you have dinner with tonight?

659
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,040
Mr. He of Rongxing.

660
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,160
And when did Jia Yuanji

661
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,360
become your assistant?

662
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,280
Jia Yuanji?

663
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,200
Half a year ago.

664
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,040
So where’s Su Chang?

665
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,180
I can’t let him

666
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,840
be my assistant forever, right?

667
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,320
He’s been promoted as VP.

668
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,720
And Chairman Jia

669
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,640
wants me to train

670
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,840
Jia Yuanji.

671
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,400
Mr. Yuan, you really can keep secrets.

672
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,920
If I didn’t happen to see him today,

673
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,440
I’d still have no idea.

674
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,720
Because Jia Yuanji is by my side,

675
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,240
no girls come to bother me anymore.

676
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,600
You don’t know how many girls

677
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,160
Jia Yuanji has stopped from getting close to me.

678
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,040
Actually, I’m worried even more
while Jia Yuanji is with you.

679
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
Why?

680
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,160
Because you guys will be surrounded
by more girls.

681
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,560
How can those girls

682
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,080
compare to my girlfriend?

683
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,440
You’re the sweetest.

684
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Where?

685
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,960
Here.

686
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,080
So smooth-tongued!

687
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,080
Come on. Let’s go to bed.

688
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,360
Yuan Shuai.

689
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,880
Do you think

690
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,280
I spend too little time with you?

691
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,040
Why do you ask that?

692
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,760
Nothing.

693
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,520
When I chatted with Li this afternoon,

694
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,280
she said I worked too hard.

695
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,360
Your career

696
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,520
has just taken off.

697
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,000
Getting busier is normal.

698
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,440
I respect all your decisions.

699
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,640
But, as your boyfriend,

700
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,400
I do wanna make your life easier.

701
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,240
Easier? So you’ll support me?

702
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I will!

703
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,000
I can afford it anyway.

704
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,920
I can afford to support more actually.

705
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,960
Dream on! You wanna support more?

706
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,680
I mean daughters

707
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,680
and sons!

708
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,080
That’ll be more, right?

709
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,120
Let’s sleep now.

710
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,800
Goodnight.

711
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,360
Goodnight.

712
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,720
I love you.

713
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,440
I love you, too.

714
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,400
I know that.

715
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,880
The bank hasn’t approved

716
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,480
the M&A loan for Baxi, right?

717
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,640
I will meet Director Liu and talk to her today.

718
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,840
Wait for my update.

719
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,680
Okay, we’ll talk about the other things

720
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,920
when I get back to the office.

721
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,240
Bye.

722
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,400
Where are you going?

723
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,560
I’ll give you a ride.

724
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Global Harbor.

725
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,400
Don’t forget to turn the meter on, sir.

726
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,000
Is the Director Liu you mentioned

727
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,160
in charge of the loan approval in the bank?

728
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,600
Yes.

729
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,720
We’ve been waiting

730
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,080
for an approval from the bank.

731
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,560
I’ll have a meal with Director Liu today,

732
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,600
and I’ll ask her

733
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,680
about it.

734
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,520
I see.

735
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,120
What? Do you know her?

736
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,400
I met her before.

737
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,840
We are friends, actually.

738
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,320
So,

739
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,760
do you need my help?

740
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,230
You wouldn’t help me for no reason.

741
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,120
What’s the catch?

742
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,640
Since I ruined your meeting with Mr. Dong,

743
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,040
I should at least make it up to you.

744
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,520
If you need my help,

745
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,440
I’m here for you at any time.

746
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,040
But, you have to follow my lead.

747
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,960
When we are there,

748
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,120
follow my lead

749
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,230
and play along.

750
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,440
Okay. Looks like my love for you is worth it.

751
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,000
Then I’ll count on you later.

752
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,960
Okay, my queen!

753
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,280
Do you guys know each other?

754
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,400
Yes.

755
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,190
She’s my distant cousin.

756
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,800
She’s also in an investment bank.

757
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,710
Director Liu.

758
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,520
Hope she’ll have your support in the future.

759
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,560
That’s right.

760
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,320
Mr. Yuan is truly my distant cousin!

761
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,000
-Mr. Yuan, what’s wrong?
-What’s the matter, Yuan?

762
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
Nothing. It’s just…

763
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,480
They set the A/C temperature too high.

764
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,320
-I’ll have some water.
-You see,

765
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,840
it’s such a small world.

766
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,480
Since you are Yuan’s cousin,

767
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,680
then I’ll consider you as my family, too.

768
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,640
Listen to me.

769
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,200
Due to the issue of the guarantor,

770
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,920
the M&A loan you applied

771
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,920
hasn’t been

772
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,560
approved yet.

773
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,720
I will ask them to call you later

774
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,040
to talk about the details.

775
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,200
Okay, thanks.

776
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,440
You are welcome.

777
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,880
Yuan,

778
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,240
I think you lost weight again.

779
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,440
Here, have some more!

780
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:46,920
Ms. Liu.

781
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,720
-Don’t worry about me.
-Come on, have more!

782
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,720
-You should have more!
-Go on.

783
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,280
Thank you!

784
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,000
Here! Try this!

785
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
Please try the beef.

786
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,400
Here.

787
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,760
Yuan,

788
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,600
how is it going with your girlfriend?

789
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,640
She… She’s on a business trip in Hong Kong.

790
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,680
She’ll be back in a couple of days.

791
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,760
You said last time

792
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,400
that she was quite short-tempered.

793
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,520
You are right, Ms. Liu.

794
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,960
She really is.

795
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,360
She’d stab things for no reason!

796
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,480
Listen to me, Yuan.

797
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,520
You should find a girlfriend

798
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,240
who’s mature and graceful.

799
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,040
Right?

800
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
First,

801
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,040
she has her own income.

802
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,160
Second,

803
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
she won’t be like those young girls

804
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,040
who get angry

805
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,920
and ask for gifts all the time.

806
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,000
Ms. Liu, you are right!

807
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,400
Of course.

808
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
You are right indeed!

809
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,600
When did your girlfriend go to Hong Kong?

810
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,440
How come I didn’t know?

811
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,680
We’ve talked about it earlier.

812
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,360
Why didn’t you follow my lead?

813
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,240
Since I am short-tempered,

814
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,560
I will not follow your lead.

815
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,040
Instead, I’ll get even with you!

816
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,040
That was all for a show.

817
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,240
How could you take it seriously?

818
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,200
I’m just afraid that someone would
suck himself into the show.

819
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,120
Suck himself into the show?

820
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,880
Where did you get this watch?

821
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,720
It’s a gift from my boss,

822
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,760
Du Lei.

823
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
I won’t hide it from you.

824
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,960
Take it off.

825
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,080
Why?

826
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,280
Take it off!

827
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,800
It’s an ownership declaration. Got it?

828
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,360
Yes.

829
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Good taste.

830
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,880
Of course.

831
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,600
Because I picked it.
