00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,490
Episode 34

3
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,480
Do you think why he helped you?

4
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,760
Because he likes you!

5
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,640
What are you talking about?

6
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,480
He’s my teacher.

7
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,200
Do you really think he treats you

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,270
as his student or friend?

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,960
He always likes you.

10
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,280
He hasn’t told me that all these years.

11
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
And you didn’t tell me after you knew it.

12
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,520
That’s because I had faith in you.

13
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,360
But now I regretted it.

14
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,480
I made a stupid mistake

15
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,520
that I kept you in MH.

16
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,440
It seems anything can come out from your mouth

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,760
trying to get me to resign.

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
I don’t want to explain anymore.

19
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,440
Jiang Jun,

20
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
what’s with the attitude?

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,480
That’s how I am!

22
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,360
I’m doing it for your own good.

23
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,040
<i>Jia Yuanji</i>

24
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,480
Qiao, did you get off work?
<i>Jia Yuanji</i>

25
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,780
<i>Jia Yuanji</i>

26
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,040
What do you want to eat?

27
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,760
I’ll buy anything for you.

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
Roast goose, steak, poached pork slices,

29
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
sweet and sour fish, ginseng chicken soup,
fried chicken or barbecue?

30
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
Qiao, you finished your work?

31
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,560
Why are you sleeping here?

32
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,040
You didn’t allow me to meet you in the company.

33
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,480
And you didn’t text me back.

34
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,400
I had no way but to wait here.

35
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,920
I fell asleep while waiting for you.

36
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,000
Are you a fool?

37
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,080
Can’t you call me?

38
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,680
What’s with the face?

39
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,800
Did you have a fight?

40
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,000
Qiao,

41
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
are you caring about me?

42
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,560
Actually,

43
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,840
I got this

44
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,240
from doing boldly what is righteous.

45
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,920
This is the witness of a man’s growth.

46
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,240
It hurts!

47
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,720
Can you blow on my wound?

48
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,560
Do you want a

49
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,920
symmetrical wound?

50
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,520
And

51
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,400
don’t you need to work?

52
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
Are you idling around

53
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,360
because you’re the successor of GE?

54
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,280
Qiao,

55
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,040
you wronged me.

56
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,000
I finished my work in advance.

57
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,000
My brother granted me a leave
to pursue my wife-to-be.

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
In order to keep up with you,

59
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,560
I’ve studied Chinese,

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,640
finance and jurisprudence

61
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,520
so hard in these two years.

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
I’m serious.

63
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Well,

64
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,800
hang in there.

65
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,120
Qiao, do you mean

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,040
I can pursue you now?

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,080
I

68
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
did not say that.

69
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,280
Oh, are you hungry?

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,440
Do you want to eat anything?

71
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
You didn’t tell me what you want to eat

72
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
when I asked you.

73
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,160
So, I bought different kinds of

74
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,120
food randomly for you.

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,360
I don’t know if you like them.

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,520
I never eat take-outs.

77
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,400
Let’s go.

78
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
I’ll take you out to midnight snacks.

79
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,240
It smells good.

80
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
Look at this.

81
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,840
Look at the colors.

82
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,880
Which dish should I eat first?

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Let me try out the beef.

84
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,560
It’s so tasty.

85
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,520
My gosh!

86
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
Oh my!

87
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,880
I admire my cooking skills so much.

88
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,080
It smells so good, seriously.

89
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,680
Tastes great.

90
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,600
Delicious!

91
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,600
Why is my stomach aching so much?

92
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,160
My stomach aches! Ouch!

93
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,520
I thought Miss Jiang was going to

94
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,360
sleep on the sofa tonight.

95
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,400
So you do like to sleep on the bed, huh?

96
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
Why do I have to sleep on the sofa?

97
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,080
This is my bed.

98
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,200
And this is my quilt.

99
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,920
Move over a little bit!

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,760
What’re you doing?

101
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,480
This is the border between us now.

102
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,360
We will sleep like this from today on.

103
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,180
If you cross that line, you’ll be dead!

104
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,560
Jiang Jun,

105
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
I won’t cross it even if you tell me to.

106
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,120
What if you cross it?

107
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
I’ll sleep with Wealth if I cross the line.

108
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,520
Any one who crosses the line will be a pig.

109
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,000
A man of his word!

110
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,120
You’re being serious, Jiang Jun?

111
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
You use the quilt

112
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
while you just give me a blanket.

113
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,080
You

114
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
are so cruel.

115
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,960
I want the quilt, too.

116
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,000
What’re you doing?

117
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,120
Give it back to me!

118
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,600
Give it back to me!

119
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,040
I have to use the quilt.

120
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
I have to use the…

121
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,360
Let go of it!

122
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
I’m kicking you out!

123
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,720
Take my quilt?

124
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,400
Get out of the bed!

125
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Don’t cross the border.

126
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,560
Jiang Jun.

127
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,880
You’ve gone too far!

128
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,240
Good.

129
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,640
Fine.

130
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,760
I won’t cross the border.

131
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,040
Whoever crosses the border will be a pig!

132
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,840
Why are you so happy?

133
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,440
What are you doing?

134
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,600
Are you a super star? Why are you
wearing sunglasses in the morning?

135
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,760
I didn’t sleep yesterday.

136
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,040
What did you do?

137
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,680
I suspected that I was ill.

138
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,200
Again?

139
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
What’s wrong?

140
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,040
It’s not like what you thought.

141
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,160
Aren’t you afraid of dehydration and loose skin

142
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,560
drinking beauty-slimming tea in the morning?

143
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,440
I have no other choice.

144
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,840
I had some midnight snacks last night.

145
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,960
A remedy is needed.

146
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,560
Did you have midnight snacks?

147
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,520
Yeah, so what?

148
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
Put on your sunglasses.

149
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,640
Just look like a ghost.

150
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,040
No, so what?

151
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,320
Boss,

152
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,800
you’re already in the office.

153
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,960
Why don’t you take off your glasses?

154
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,640
The cost of your quarrel is too great.

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,560
She

156
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,040
had this border

157
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,560
and put a long stick

158
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,440
on the bed,

159
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,240
leaving me a tiny space.

160
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,880
I just can’t sleep well.

161
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,360
And it’s cold.

162
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,400
She always lies next to me.

163
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,480
I’ve been used to it, you know?

164
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,400
But I can’t...

165
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,800
So, I couldn’t fall asleep.

166
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,800
It’s over.

167
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,320
You’re totally done for.

168
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
I think you should apologize to her

169
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,680
in order to save your life.

170
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,240
Apologize?

171
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,560
Why should I?

172
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,800
It’s her fault.

173
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
I was trying to be nice. Why should

174
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,160
I apologize to her?

175
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,920
Fine.

176
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Listen.

177
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,480
According to my keen observation,

178
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
do you think she had a good rest?

179
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,720
She did not either!

180
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,360
I lost.

181
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,080
You two are a perfect match in all respects.

182
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,320
But she’s just recovered.

183
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,280
Do you have the heart to see her
stay up with you?

184
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,440
I’ll tell you what.

185
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
She just can’t stay up late.

186
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
She will give in

187
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,120
tonight.

188
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,880
Listen, guys.

189
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
My status is so good today.

190
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,360
Yuan Shuai, whatever work you have,

191
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
just leave it to me.

192
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,760
I promise I will finish it perfectly.

193
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,680
Yuanji,

194
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,320
something good happened?

195
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,000
There is a bandage on your face.

196
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,600
It’s not something good.

197
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,160
Just a date.

198
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,960
Qiao Na said yes to you?

199
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,160
It’s not that easy to make her say yes.

200
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,280
We just had a midnight meal

201
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,320
and shared each other’s childhood memories.

202
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,760
So that’s what made you like this?

203
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,040
The childhood memories?

204
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,160
Yuan Shuai,

205
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,280
you have no idea.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,680
This is bitter sweetness.

207
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,600
Enough, go back to work now.

208
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,640
Go.

209
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Can’t you congratulate on me?

210
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,480
Su Chang.

211
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Yuanji.

212
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,760
Yuanji.

213
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,960
Love stories and congratulations

214
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
are forbidden for Yuan Shuai today.

215
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,360
Let’s talk about it another day.

216
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,680
Hello?

217
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,960
Mr. Yuan, hi.

218
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,760
The ring customized for you has arrived.

219
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,280
When will it be convenient for you to pick it up?

220
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,600
Okay, I’ll come now.

221
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,960
They have only left for a few days.

222
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Why are their stuff being cleaned so quickly?

223
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,560
A new colleague is coming tomorrow.

224
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,400
So we have to clean up everything today.

225
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,200
This...

226
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,720
Give it to me.

227
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,160
The photo was printed by me.

228
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,640
This is the only copy.

229
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,440
They probably forgot it.

230
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,120
You should keep it.

231
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,000
You can keep it

232
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,920
as a keepsake.

233
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,520
Hello, Shen Xin.

234
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,920
Shen Xin,

235
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,360
I have to ask you something.

236
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,000
When I was on the leave at home,

237
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,800
did you see anything weird in the company

238
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,560
or hear anything strange?

239
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,160
Everything happened as usual.

240
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,360
The strangest thing is

241
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,520
the price leak.

242
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,760
What about Mr. Du?

243
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,080
I remember you reported a lot of work
directly to him

244
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,760
not long after I took the leave.

245
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
Then it was transferred to Ms. Qiao.

246
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,800
Speaking of Mr. Du,

247
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,040
there is something weird about him.

248
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,600
I was anxious about getting a file signed
by him one day,

249
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,400
so I walked into his office after knocking
on his door.

250
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,520
Rest assured.

251
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,120
I have told the accountant

252
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,320
about the financial report of Huanyu Group.

253
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,200
We will do it in the same way as last year.

254
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,160
I’ll handle the CSRC.

255
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,640
Well,

256
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,120
since you are sincere,

257
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
it would be impolite for me to reject it.

258
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,480
He said in the phone that

259
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,080
Huanyu Group’s financial report

260
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,640
would be done like last year.

261
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,480
And he’s handled the CSRC.

262
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,200
What’s wrong?

263
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,360
Anything happened?

264
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,160
No, just asking.

265
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,000
My conclusion is that

266
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,520
Du Lei has a reason

267
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,920
insisting to fire Xiang Ding and Shen Xin

268
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
when he knew

269
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,920
there’s a better solution.

270
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,360
I suspect that

271
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,560
Shen Xin and Xiang Ding have known

272
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,160
Du Lei’s secret which frightens him.

273
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
So, they had to leave.

274
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,800
By the way, what about your job interviews?

275
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,240
I’ve tried a few companies.

276
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,160
It doesn’t work out.

277
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,360
What about Xiang Ding?

278
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,640
Just like me.

279
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,640
What’s your next plan?

280
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,880
Do you still want to work in the investment bank?

281
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
I love this job.

282
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,680
And I’ve accumulated so much experience

283
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,720
and network all these years.

284
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,200
I don’t want to give it up.

285
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,160
Now that Chen Yicheng knew this,

286
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,440
he’s having a hard time, too.

287
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,080
So,

288
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,240
I want to take a shot in GE.

289
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,880
GE?

290
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,640
Yeah.

291
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,680
They’re recruiting people.

292
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,160
But it would be even harder there.

293
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,000
Actually I know

294
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,580
in an investment bank like GE,

295
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,480
I can hardly be hired

296
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,280
if there are no recommendations.

297
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,720
In addition, the SKL’s price leak

298
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,160
has been spread widely.

299
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,160
Even if my resignation says I left MH

300
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,480
for personal reasons,

301
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,860
I guess there is little hope for me.

302
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,240
Jiang Jun,

303
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
actually, I wanna ask you

304
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,360
for a personal favor today.

305
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,200
Go on.

306
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,120
I’ll definitely help you if I can.

307
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,120
Mr. Yuan is in GE, right?

308
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,160
I wonder if you can write
a recommendation letter to him for me

309
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,920
and clarify that

310
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,680
we have nothing to with

311
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,720
the SKL’s price leak.

312
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,600
Forget it, Jiang Jun.

313
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,000
You don’t have to do that.

314
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,160
Just forget what I said.

315
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,360
No, don’t get me wrong.

316
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,560
I think it’s great.

317
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,480
I will write it when I get back.

318
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,560
Really?

319
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,400
Sure.

320
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,520
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

321
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,400
You chose to help me

322
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,200
whenever I’m in need.

323
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,800
It’s nothing.

This bouquet was sent

by a flower shop named L Flower.

343
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,760

what do you want me for?

351
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,800
Scented tea. To calm your mind.

352
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,400
Thank you.

353
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,920
By the way, wait for me after work.

Jiang Jun?

357
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,280
Wealth.

358
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,120
Look what your dad brought home.

359
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,080
See.

360
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,040
Is it beautiful?

361
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,920
Look.

362
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,640
Your dad

363
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,400
is going to propose to your mom.

364
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,320
But now

365
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,240
you have to keep it a secret for a while.

366
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,640
Mr. Du,

367
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,400
do you mean having a dinner together?

368
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,040
Can’t we have a dinner together?

369
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,680
Sit.

370
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,800
Why is there a cake?

371
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,800
What day is it today?

372
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,280
Think about it.

373
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
I’m sorry.

374
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,640
I forgot it’s your birthday.

375
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,640
It’s a pity that they’re already off work.

376
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,520
Otherwise, we can celebrate it
with you together.

377
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,680
It’s not necessary.

378
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,280
I want you to celebrate it with me as usual.

379
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,440
Then make a wish.

380
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,160
I know you don’t like the birthday song.

381
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,960
I want to hear it today.

382
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,600
Sing it.

383
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,800
Okay.

384
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,040
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

385
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,920
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

386
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,440
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

387
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,920
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

388
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,080
Make a wish.

389
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay.

390
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,920
What wish did you make?

391
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,800
It’s a secret.

392
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,120
I’ll get the wine.

393
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,120
What?

394
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,800
I forgot to fetch the delivery of Wealth’s food.

395
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,840
Fetch it for me when you come back.

396
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
I brought this wine from France.

397
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,760
Let’s drink it up today.

398
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,040
Jiang Jun,

399
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,840
are you with Du Lei?

400
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,640
I’ve still got something to do in the company.
Go fetch it yourself.

401
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,480
Jiang Jun.

402
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,560
I’m warning you.

403
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,880
You will be dead if you dare to drink today!

404
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,440
I...

405
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,400
Yuan Shuai is worrying about you again?

406
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,000
How come she is with Du Lei?

407
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,440
Where is she?

408
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,780
<i>GUANG HUA BUILDING</i>

409
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,240
Still in the company?

410
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,920
Well…

411
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,080
I know you can’t drink wine.

412
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,320
You can drink the juice.

413
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,760
Okay.

414
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,360
Then I will drink juice with you.

415
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,640
Here.

416
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,800
Happy birthday.

417
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,840
Thank you.

418
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,640
When I first met you,

419
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,320
you were just a girl new to this industry.

420
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Look at you now.

421
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,720
A vice president.

422
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,200
I have to thank my teacher, Mr. Du.

423
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,840
Thank you for your guidance and caring.

424
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,600
Or I wouldn’t be here today.

425
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,120
It’s been a long time since you referred me
as your teacher.

426
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
Is it?

427
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,840
How about this?

428
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,840
I know you have a poor physical condition.

429
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,920
I’ve thought about it.

430
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,480
From tomorrow on,

431
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,120
stop eating in the canteen.

432
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,160
I’ll find a professional nutritionist for you.

433
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,440
And

434
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,040
you’re not allowed to be here
if you haven’t slept for seven hours.

435
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,320
Mr. Du,

436
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,440
I’ve been thinking about something
for a long time.

437
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,240
Before I make a formal application,

438
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,560
I have to notify you first.

439
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
So formal?

440
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,280
Say it.

441
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,080
I want to resign.

442
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,720
Why do you want to resign all of a sudden?

443
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
Is it because the SKL’s case

444
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,080
has made you uncomfortable?

445
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,760
No.

446
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,440
It’s something personal.

447
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,560
And

448
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,560
I’ve been considering it for a long time.

449
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
If it’s because of your condition,

450
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,400
I can extend your leave.

451
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,440
You can take a two-month leave
if one month isn’t enough.

452
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,920
You can take a six-month leave
if that is still not enough.

453
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,040
Or I can make it a year.

454
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,880
Take a complete rest before you get well.

455
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,600
If I act like that,

456
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,760
my position in MH will be gone soon.

457
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,440
You don’t need to worry about that.

458
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,800
As long as I’m here,

459
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,160
no one can touch your seat.

460
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,760
Do you think why he helped you?

461
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,680
Because he likes you!

462
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,000
Do you really think he treats you

463
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,200
as his student or friend?

464
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,960
He always likes you!

465
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,400
Mr. Du.

466
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,560
Thank you for your good will.

467
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,560
I know I would let you

468
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,320
and the company down.

469
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,160
But

470
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,960
I’ve decided.

471
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,000
I won’t approve it.

472
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,320
Is it because of Yuan Shuai?

473
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,120
I can give you

474
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,120
what he gave you.

475
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,160
No.

476
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,760
You misunderstood me.

477
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,560
I’ve been so tired these two years.

478
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,280
I didn’t even have time to stay
with my family.

479
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,160
Really?

480
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,560
It occurred to me that I still have something
urgent to do.

481
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,560
I’ll go back now.

482
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,360
I drank.

483
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,160
You drive me home.

484
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,640
Mr. Du,

485
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,240
is there anything on my face?

486
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,440
Can you call me teacher?

487
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,840
Okay.

488
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,080
You haven’t worn the watch I sent you.

489
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,160
Actually I was angry at first.

490
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,520
Then I thought about it.

491
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,040
Maybe it’s because you don’t like it.

492
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,800
So,

493
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,560
I picked a necklace for you.

494
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,760
I hope you can like it.

495
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,360
I will put it on for you.

496
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,920
Teacher,

497
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,400
I’m driving. This is dangerous.

498
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,240
Please sit back.

499
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,720
Teacher!

500
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,600
Teacher, I...

501
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,520
Sit back!

502
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,320
This is really dangerous!

503
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,160
Sit back!

504
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,400
Why are you rejecting me like this?

505
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,480
Why do you want to resign?

506
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,080
Did Yuan Shuai force you?

507
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,480
No.

508
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,640
I want to do it myself.

509
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,240
You want to do it?

510
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,200
What’re you going to do then?

511
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,080
Be a good wife and mother?

512
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,720
What about your dream?

513
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,600
How about the dream you had

514
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,920
when you first came to this industry?

515
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,400
You want to give up

516
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,400
just for him?

517
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,080
I want to resign for personal reasons.

518
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,520
I should have the right to resign, right?

519
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,320
Teacher,

520
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,280
I think you should find a designated driver.

521
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,120
Didn’t you ask what

522
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,680
my birthday wish is?

523
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I will tell you now.

524
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,240
My birthday wish is

525
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,840
to be with you forever!

526
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,120
Stop it!

527
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,360
Do you remember this necktie?

528
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,760
You sent it to me two years ago.

529
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,040
I’ve been wearing it from the day I entered MH.

530
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,840
I don’t believe you are so blunt that

531
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,800
you can’t know my feelings for you at all.

532
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,040
Du Lei.

533
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,080
Calm down.

534
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,920
Calm down?

535
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,480
If you have no feelings for me,

536
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,840
why did you send me such a sensitive gift?

537
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,600
I didn’t mean that.

538
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,680
It’s just a gift for a teacher.

539
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,680
Sorry.

540
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,200
It was thoughtless of me
to make you misunderstand.

541
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,360
You guessed right. I want to get married.

542
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,120
So, you should realize

543
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,080
I will not respond to your feelings.

544
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,960
I know you are not drunk.

545
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,200
Please stop acting like this.

546
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,200
I want to

547
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,720
take back this necktie.

548
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,480
Please give it back to me.

549
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,160
Jiang Jun.

550
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,480
Jiang Jun.

551
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,920
Jiang Jun, I love you very much.

552
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,200
I can’t leave you.

553
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,800
I hope you can stay by my side forever

554
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,960
so I can protect you.

555
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,920
Let go of me!

556
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,800
Du Lei, let go of me!

557
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,920
What’re you doing?

558
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,240
What’re you doing?

559
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,000
Let go of me!

560
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,320
What’re you doing?

561
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,560
Jiang Jun,

562
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,440
are you okay?

563
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,440
Were you hurt?

564
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,680
Yuan Shuai!

565
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,400
Stop, you two!

566
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,000
Stop it!

567
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,000
Stop!

568
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,760
Jiang Jun!

569
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,280
Get away!

570
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,760
Jiang Jun,

571
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,160
are you okay?

572
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,240
Let’s go home.

573
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,920
Wealth.

574
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,920
Wealth, you are so nice to me.

575
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,480
You knew I was stimulated and came
to comfort me.

576
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,710
Wealth.

577
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,880
Do you know how frightened I was?

578
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,920
I almost cried.

579
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,640
But your dad came in time.

580
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,120
Wealth, look.

581
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,120
Does your dad look like a lighted incense?

582
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,040
There’s even smoke.

583
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,280
It’s so scary.

584
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,000
Tell me.

585
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,080
What is your true thought

586
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,150
on Du Lei now?

587
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,190
I think it’s a pity.

588
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,190
A pity?

589
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,710
So, I shouldn’t have gone there.

590
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,670
Did I bother you guys?

591
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,150
Didn’t you want to know my true thought?

592
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,440
I do think

593
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,040
it’s a pity

594
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
to lose a friend

595
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,640
who I valued a lot.

596
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,920
If I could have been more sensitive,

597
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,320
and found it out,

598
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,360
things wouldn’t have ended up like this.

599
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,080
Now you know you’re not sensitive?

600
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,360
Yeah.

601
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,640
After all, you have no idea I’ve liked you

602
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,960
for so many years.

603
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,800
You are truly the least sensitive

604
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,600
in this aspect.

605
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,920
I did not think about it at all.

606
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,200
You knew it.

607
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,360
You are the only person I dated.

608
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,720
Or things wouldn’t have been

609
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,080
so awkward now.

610
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,120
Do you think I’m mad about this?

611
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,800
So, what are you mad about?

612
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,400
A man and a woman

613
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,840
drink together

614
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,640
in the middle of night?

615
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,000
And you even drove him home after drinking.

616
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,320
Jiang Jun, you served him so well.

617
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,680
I swear I didn’t drink.

618
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,680
-Don’t...
-Stop!

619
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,480
Sit.

620
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,840
What did you do to Du Lei?

621
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,080
Why did he show his feelings
to you all of a sudden?

622
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I did tell him something.

623
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,280
But I can’t let you know.

624
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,760
Okay, then I won’t accept your apology.

625
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,640
I’m sorry. I was wrong.

626
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,760
You’re breaking the rules.

627
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
More than that,

628
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,040
I’m doing something even worse.

629
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,640
Stop being angry at me, okay?

630
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,840
It’s still hurting.

631
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,720
Is it?

632
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,360
Let me see.

633
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,960
Still hurting?

634
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,080
A little bit.

635
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,600
What about now?

636
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,440
It’s good now.

637
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,600
You

638
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,600
should be more careful,

639
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,360
okay?

640
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,440
By the way,

641
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,400
I forgot something.

642
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,280
What is it? Can we talk about it tomorrow?

643
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,440
No, it’ll be too late.

644
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,160
Okay, go on.

645
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,880
Shen Xin is having an interview
in GE tomorrow afternoon.

646
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,760
You know her condition.

647
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,520
So,

648
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,920
I wrote a recommendation letter to you.

649
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Can you hand it over to the company?

650
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,560
Please.

651
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,960
Jiang Jun.

652
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,000
So you acted cute

653
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,320
because you wanted a favor from me?

654
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,640
No.

655
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,320
It occurred to me all of a sudden.

656
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,880
All of a sudden?

657
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,280
What a coincidence.

658
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,920
Just tell me if you will help me.

659
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,440
A recommendation letter?

660
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,760
Listen to my analysis.

661
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,680
You wrote a recommendation letter for Shen Xin,

662
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,920
which is good to her.

663
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,160
But it’s not good to you.

664
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,880
Shen Xin is your bosom friend.

665
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,120
You’re my girlfriend.

666
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,600
Everybody in this industry knows it.

667
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,560
You want to send the recommendation letter

668
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,040
for Shen Xin to my company.

669
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,200
If someone with an ulterior motive knows it,

670
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,680
they will make a big fuss about it.

671
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,840
Well,

672
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,920
I’m just trying to be a referrer.

673
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,560
I do not break any rules in this industry.

674
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,720
And this might be her last chance.

675
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,200
Can you let off your guard

676
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
and help her this time?

677
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,840
I’ve told you the pros and cons.

678
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,360
Since you’ve made up your mind,

679
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,920
just write it.

680
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,600
Let’s make up.

681
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,480
Okay, let’s make up.

682
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,680
<i>Huanyu Limited Liability Company</i>

683
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,040
October 12th?
<i>Huanyu Limited Liability Company</i>

684
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,300
<i>Huanyu Limited Liability Company</i>

685
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,880
Isn’t it the day Shen Xin mentioned?

686
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,760
My conclusion is that

687
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,400
Du Lei has a reason

688
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,680
insisting to fire Xiang Ding and Shen Xin

689
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,920
when he knew

690
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,680
there’s a better solution.

691
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,560
I suspect that

692
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,480
Shen Xin and Xiang Ding have known

693
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,960
Du Lei’s secret which frightens him.

694
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
So, they had to leave.

695
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,600
I was anxious about getting a file signed
by him one day,

696
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,360
so I walked into his office after knocking
on his door.

697
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,200
He said in the phone that

698
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,800
Huanyu Group’s financial report

699
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,520
would be done like last year.

700
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,760
And he’s handled the CSRC.

701
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,560
<i>VP Jiang Jun</i>

702
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,700
Yu, come to my office.
<i>VP Jiang Jun</i>

703
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:44,760
Yu, come to my office.

704
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,440
Okay.

705
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,600
Come in.

706
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,120
Ms. Jiang, you want me?

707
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
You’ve been following

708
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,400
Huanyu Group’s case, right?

709
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,320
Yeah.

710
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,800
It’s mainly some subsidiary information.

711
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,800
The financial reports of Huanyu Group
for the three quarters of this year

712
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,000
were checked by Mr. Du?

713
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,800
Yeah.

714
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,360
We must be responsible for a big client

715
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,240
like Huanyu Group.

716
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,320
They’ve provided the report directly to Mr. Du

717
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,720
for two consecutive years.

718
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
And Mr. Du attended
the meetings himself

719
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,760
in the accountancy firm.

720
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,880
Okay.

721
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
I see. Get back to your work.

722
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,960
Wait!

723
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,880
Ms. Jiang.

724
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,880
Don’t tell anyone we talked today.

725
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,080
No worries, Ms. Jiang.

726
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,720
Okay.
