1
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,190
Episode 18

3
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,140
Coming!

4
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,340
Miss Xinxin?

5
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,690
I just came back from abroad,

6
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,460
and I’m still jet-lagged.

7
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,020
Wait!

8
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,060
So I got up early,

9
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,300
to buy some breakfast.

10
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,500
I also got some for you.

11
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,380
Okay!

12
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,300
Thank you so much!

13
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,020
It’s such a big house.

14
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,860
You live here alone?

15
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,580
Yes... Alone!

16
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,500
Why is there flush noise?

17
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,020
Dog!

18
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,500
I have a dog! It can flush the toilet!

19
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,140
Dog can flush the toilet?

20
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,780
Yes!

21
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,700
Amazing, right? How smart!

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,960
It is.

23
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,700
What are you doing this early…

24
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,500
Assistant Yuan?

25
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,260
How…

26
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,180
How come you are here?

27
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,340
You two…

28
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,620
Yes, you are right.

29
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,260
We are in a relationship.

30
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,980
<i>FamilyMart</i>

31
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,660
Honey,
<i>FamilyMart</i>

32
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:16,780
<i>FamilyMart</i>

33
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,440
you know what?
<i>FamilyMart</i>

34
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,540
you know what?

35
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,220
I found out something

36
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,940
really unexpected this morning.

37
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,020
What is it?

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,220
That Ms. Jiang living next door

39
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,660
and your Assistant Yuan

40
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,620
are actually an item!

41
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,380
How did you know?

42
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,540
I saw them this morning!

43
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,060
In… In person?

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,580
What…

45
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,420
What did you see?

46
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,980
I saw they lived together.

47
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,900
My sweetheart,

48
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,660
please stay away from her!

49
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,660
Why?

50
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,980
She… She… She…

51
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,500
She is the daughter of our CEO.

52
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,860
Her father sent her here.

53
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,340
Otherwise, how could she be a director

54
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,780
at such a young age?

55
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,700
So you mean

56
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,020
Assistant Yuan is her secret lover?

57
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,740
I guess you can say so.

58
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,740
Anyway, try to stay away from them.

59
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,580
If she knew you find out her secret,

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,900
she’d give me a hard time at work.

61
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,260
Would she?

62
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,900
She looks like a nice person.

63
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,460
You don’t know.

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,460
She’s quite wired.

65
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
How?

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,780
Just steer clear of them.

67
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,940
Okay! I’ll listen to you!

68
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,020
Mr. Su, check please.

69
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,170
Check!

70
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,820
Ms. Jiang?

71
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,420
Assistant Yuan?

72
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,740
Were they talking about
Jun and Yuan Shuai?

73
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,460
But the positions aren’t right!

74
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,820
Forget it. It could be a coincidence!

75
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,580
Jun,

76
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,370
the decoration of the West World office is finished.

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,220
Li Xiaochuan, Mr. Du and I will have

78
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,300
a party tonight

79
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,260
to celebrate the opening of West World.

80
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,940
Make sure to come and join us!

81
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,220
Okay! No problem!

82
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,960
<i>Linda</i>

83
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,720
<i>Li Xiaochuan</i>

84
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,380
Hello.

85
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,180
Hello, Mr. Du.

86
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,620
Are you free tonight?

87
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,500
What’s up?

88
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,260
The decoration of the West World office is finished.

89
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
You are the investor.

90
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,180
We want to invite you over

91
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,700
to witness the opening of West World!

92
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,140
Sure. See you tonight.

93
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,380
Jun!

94
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,260
I’m off work

95
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,420
and on my way to your home now!

96
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,420
We’ll go meet Xiaochuan together.

97
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,820
No! Don’t go to my home!

98
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,940
Wait! Li will be suspicious

99
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,460
if I stop her so quickly!

100
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,860
Hello, Yuan Shuai! Hurry and hide!

101
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
Li is on her way to my home to change clothes!

102
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,060
If she sees you are there, I’ll be dead!

103
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,340
How come Jiang Jun
has a pair of man’s slippers?

104
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,020
Good that you are back!

105
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,660
I was just wondering,

106
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,140
why do you have man’s slippers?

107
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,260
Because…

108
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,020
I live here all by myself.

109
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,740
When those delivery guys

110
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,660
see a pair of

111
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,340
man’s slippers,

112
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,460
they’ll be intimidated!

113
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,540
You’d do the same thing,

114
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,260
wouldn’t you?

115
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,780
Makes sense!

116
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,580
What’s Wealth doing here?

117
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,620
Long time no see!

118
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,220
The feeder is empty. She needs water...

119
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,260
How come you have man’s suits?

120
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,580
Wait! They are mine! All mine!

121
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,100
I just bought them!

122
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,020
I really love the color!

123
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,180
Your makeup is smudged!

124
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,180
Your foundation is getting creasing!

125
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,420
How can you see Li Xiaochuan like that?

126
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,100
Go fix it!

127
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,660
Really?

128
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,460
Okay, give me a sec!

129
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,020
Hurry!

130
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,620
My God!

131
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:27,860
Jiang Jun!

132
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,820
Don’t you think you should

133
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,700
give me an explanation?

134
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,700
How can this thing

135
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,220
appear in your apartment?

136
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,660
I… I bought this recently!

137
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,780
I think it

138
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,100
looks nice and it’s elastic!

139
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,760
So,

140
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,340
I love wearing it after shower!

141
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,370
It’s 100% cotton.

142
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,420
Look!

143
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,120
Quite convenient

144
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:55,940
and loose!

145
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,540
Really comfortable.

146
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,540
Don’t you wanna get one?

147
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,580
Loose?

148
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,660
And comfortable?

149
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,380
You also prefer having a hole here?

150
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,620
What an interesting preference!

151
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
It’s breathable, huh?

152
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,540
You think I’d believe it?

153
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,460
I don’t even believe it.

154
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,540
Tell the truth,
and you will receive a lighter sentence.

155
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,620
It wasn’t my intention!

156
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,980
One of our associates

157
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,940
bragged to his girlfriend,

158
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
saying he’s the Executive Director

159
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,180
and owns several apartments.

160
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,220
His girlfriend returned from abroad
to visit him.

161
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,540
To cover up his lies,

162
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,060
Yuan Shuai lent his apartment to him.

163
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,900
So you are helping Yuan Shuai

164
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,060
by letting him stay with you?

165
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,780
I didn’t want to.

166
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,340
But he wouldn’t leave!

167
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,540
I can’t drive him out.

168
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,220
After all, it’s his apartment.

169
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,260
He wouldn’t leave?

170
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,380
So

171
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,380
did anything interesting

172
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,180
happen between you two?

173
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,180
Of course, not!

174
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
No way!

175
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,540
We…

176
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,300
What’s that look about?

177
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,820
What look?

178
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,060
What… What are you talking about?

179
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,780
It’s late! Aren’t you going

180
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,460
to see Li Xiaochuan?

181
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,540
I have a date! It’s all your fault!

182
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,860
Jiang Jun,

183
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,460
it’s not over!

184
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,500
Thank God, I’m safe for now!

185
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,260
What’s going on?

186
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,420
I get nervous so easily recently
when talking about that jerk!

187
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:15,980
Mr. Du.

188
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,340
Hold on!

189
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,300
Is it necessary?

190
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,860
It’s a sense of ritual!

191
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Please put it on!

192
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,260
Okay.

193
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,900
Alright.

194
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,700
Now, come with me.

195
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:41,900
Steps!

196
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,820
Wait. Here’s a step!

197
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,300
Good!

198
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,180
Another step!

199
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,420
Another one!

200
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,140
Okay. Mr. Du, now you can take off the patch.

201
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,700
Surprise!

202
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,140
How did you know today is…

203
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,420
Today, we are celebrating
the opening of West World!

204
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,100
It’s a surprise party

205
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
we prepared for you!

206
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,700
That’s right!

207
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,420
Mr. Du,

208
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,220
look.

209
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,740
The working area is over here.

210
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,540
Hope you’ll like the style.

211
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,940
And this area is for tea break.

212
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,740
I’ve observed.

213
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,500
When it’s about 2 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon,

214
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,060
the sun will shine over there.

215
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,580
When you have time,

216
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,500
you can take a break there

217
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,380
and have a cup of coffee.

218
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,460
Quite comfy, isn’t it?

219
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,380
Mr. Du,

220
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,700
we know you are a busy man,

221
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,020
but we hope you can

222
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,860
come visit us

223
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,460
as often as possible.

224
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:39,860
That’s right!

225
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,660
No worry.

226
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,220
With such outstanding employees
like you two,

227
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,500
Mr. Du will come to visit often for sure!

228
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,580
What “you two”?

229
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,220
You are also

230
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,900
one of us now!

231
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,060
Right, Mr. Du?

232
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,300
Yes.

233
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,340
By the way,

234
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
Xiaochuan and I are preparing

235
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,900
an offline dating activity.

236
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,620
Please do come if you have time!

237
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,300
Speaking of that,

238
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,660
I want to organize a camping trip,

239
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,940
which can provide a great opportunity
for our users to bond

240
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,540
and to do some exercise.

241
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,540
But somebody thinks

242
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,940
it’s not romantic enough!

243
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,940
Jun, do you think

244
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,060
people would like a date out in the wild?

245
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,260
You can’t dress up,

246
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,300
and it’s dangerous!

247
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,860
Environment is very important for dating.

248
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,100
It must be a place

249
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,940
that is romantic and filled with love!

250
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,060
Jun, am I right?

251
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,260
I think Xu Li is right!

252
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,660
Thank you, boss!

253
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,580
Now, let’s get the celebration started!

254
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,900
Today

255
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,020
is the opening day of our West World.

256
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,900
West World

257
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,980
will officially open today!

258
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,460
Let’s welcome our investor, Mr. Du,

259
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,260
to make a speech!

260
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,460
Okay.

261
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,340
Then I’ll keep it short.

262
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,580
Over the years I’ve worked
in the investment bank.

263
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,940
I handled a great number of cases.

264
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,100
West World

265
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,780
is actually the smallest case

266
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,700
I’ve ever met so far.

267
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,820
But I believe

268
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
that with your hard work

269
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,140
and your abilities,

270
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,020
you will be able to create popular products!

271
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,100
Thank you for your speech, Mr. Du!

272
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,100
Next, let’s welcome

273
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
the founder of West World,

274
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,500
Mr. Li Xiaochuan, to make a speech!

275
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,140
Come on, Xiaochuan.

276
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,180
Say something!

277
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,220
You can do it!

278
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,860
Cheers!

279
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Cheers! Cheers!

280
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,940
Cheers!

281
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,980
It’s such a special day!

282
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,140
Let’s take a picture!

283
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,380
Okay.

284
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,380
Jun, I promise I won’t post the picture
on my Moments!

285
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,260
I’ll keep it! Hurry! Ready?

286
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,580
Three, two, one!

287
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,620
Mr. Du,

288
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,300
we didn’t prepare anything fancy today.

289
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,580
Hope you won’t mind!

290
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,980
Don’t say that.

291
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,620
Mr. Du invested the money.

292
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,180
We should spend every penny wisely.

293
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,900
You know?

294
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,820
In my opinion,

295
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,540
today is the opening day.

296
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,860
We don’t have to be so tight.

297
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,660
Just order

298
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,460
anything you want. It’s my treat!

299
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,220
Great!

300
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,220
Then I’ll go buy some food now.

301
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,140
There’s a restaurant nearby selling
fried chicken and Sichuan cuisine. Very tasty!

302
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,740
Mr. Du, since it’s your treat,

303
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,260
we’ll thank you in advance!

304
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,660
Go ahead.

305
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,460
Let’s go.

306
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,100
Come with me!

307
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,980
Why… Why would I go with you?

308
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,580
Go buy food!

309
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,100
Come on! Let’s go!

310
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,340
You guys keep talking.

311
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,700
It may take a while for us to come back.

312
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,340
Wait!

313
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,140
Let’s go!

314
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,140
Why isn’t she home yet?

315
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,140
<i>Jiang Jun</i>

316
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,980
Where are you?

317
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,020
Working late inefficiently again?

318
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,020
I’m not!

319
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,980
Today is the opening day of West World!

320
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,100
Opening day?

321
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,580
Where’s your office?

322
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,460
I won’t tell you!

323
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,900
Wealth!

324
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,780
We are left out!

325
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,740
Left out! Do you hear me?

326
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,100
Good for you!

327
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:05,860
Let me help you.

328
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,620
I’m so sorry!

329
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,780
Hurry, clean it up.

330
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,580
Are you laughing at me?

331
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,940
No, I’m not!

332
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,180
Hey,

333
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,800
it didn’t get to you

334
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,040
because of my help.

335
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,460
I don’t laugh easily.

336
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,420
Unless

337
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,180
it’s really funny!

338
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,660
Hello? Who’s speaking?

339
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,140
Hello, Mr. Du.

340
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,260
Miss Linda ordered you a birthday gift

341
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,980
and a birthday cake,

342
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,100
but you are not home.

343
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,740
May I know where you are right now?

344
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,940
I’ll have someone send them to you.

345
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,220
How did you know today is…

346
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,420
Don’t bother.

347
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,020
They are at your disposal.

348
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,740
Mr. Du.

349
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,300
Today is your birthday?

350
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,140
Kind of.

351
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,060
Linda was my supervisor in GE.

352
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,860
She’s also a nominal sister to me

353
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,140
in the Du family.

354
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,740
I don’t know your family members anyway.

355
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,020
But I know

356
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,300
today is your birthday.

357
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,380
So

358
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,020
I want to express a sincere wish to you.

359
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,820
Happy birthday, Mr. Du!

360
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,580
Thank you.

361
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,220
Oh, right!

362
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,580
Since we have a cake here,

363
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,980
after they are back,

364
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,500
let’s celebrate your birthday together.

365
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,740
Together!

366
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,100
Let’s forget it.

367
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,300
I don’t want too many people to know.

368
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,380
I see.

369
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,420
Then we’ll celebrate your birthday

370
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,500
secretly and quickly.

371
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:53,940
How’s that?

372
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,540
Okay.

373
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,300
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

374
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,900
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

375
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,980
♫ Happy birthday to… ♫

376
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,420
Thank you,

377
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,700
but it’s a little awkward.

378
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,340
Alright.

379
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,860
Then make a wish!

380
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,060
Make a wish?

381
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,300
Make a wish…

382
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,260
Actually, I can’t think of anything right now.

383
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,420
I’ll save it

384
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,860
for another time.

385
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,660
Sure! Let’s save it!

386
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,380
Go ahead and blow the candles!

387
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:47,820
Okay.

388
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,600
<i>West World Go! Go! Go!</i>

389
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,940
Why don’t the candles go out?

390
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,820
Let me help you.

391
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,940
Finally!

392
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,860
Mr. Du, I don’t think the cake
is eatable anymore!

393
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,020
It’s covered by our spit!

394
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,220
Jiang Jun.

395
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,580
Actually,

396
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,900
I have something to tell you.

397
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,220
Go ahead!

398
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,420
Actually…

399
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,620
Actually…

400
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,020
Is it something urgent?

401
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,100
No.

402
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,180
My friend wants my opinion about his cooking.

403
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Mr. Du, please go on.

404
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,120
<i>Yuan Shuai</i>

405
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,420
I forgot.

406
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,500
“When will you be back?

407
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,860
My wound hurts.”

408
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,340
Well, Mr. Du.

409
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:06,860
I’m sorry,

410
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,220
but it is an emergency!

411
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,580
I have to go now.

412
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,940
I’ll celebrate your birthday another time.

413
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,980
See you!

414
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,540
Happy birthday!

415
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Sorry.

416
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,060
You have to work late because of me.

417
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,620
I tried a few times to ask you to come over
and have a chat,

418
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,900
but you said you were busy.

419
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,460
Why?

420
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,660
What made you come to see me all of a sudden today?

421
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,820
I haven’t slept for days.

422
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,820
I’m tired of taking melatonin, so here I am.

423
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,500
I need someone to talk to.

424
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,580
What happened?

425
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,260
Because of work

426
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,940
or him?

427
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,260
I see.

428
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,060
You’d only come to me

429
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,180
because of him.

430
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,620
He said something that really hurt me.

431
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,620
And I can’t get

432
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,820
a hold of him recently.

433
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,420
I actually envied you when I was little.

434
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,220
It’s true.

435
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,100
You can act freely

436
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,660
and do whatever you want.

437
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,740
So,

438
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,740
I tried so hard to become you.

439
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,180
But after I did it,

440
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,180
I found that’s not what I want.

441
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
We’re born to be different.

442
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,700
Your last name is Du.

443
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,820
But mine isn’t.

444
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,380
I never expected he’d see me that way.

445
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,860
I always thought I was the one he relied on.

446
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,460
But in his eyes,

447
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,820
I’m not different

448
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,300
from those people who want

449
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
to control his life.

450
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,620
Have some warm water.

451
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,100
It’ll help you relax.

452
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,260
No need.

453
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,180
You know my habit.

454
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,820
I’m used to using essential oil to relax.

455
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,060
Judging from what you said,

456
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,180
it’s quite obvious

457
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,620
that you are a controlling person.

458
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,220
I admit that I am when it comes to work,

459
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,620
but not to him.

460
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,660
It’s your personality.

461
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,820
It’d exert a subtle influence on your behaviors.

462
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,420
Take the cup of warm water as an example.

463
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,220
It’s the doctor’s suggestion,

464
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,220
yet you still wouldn’t accept it.

465
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,260
Perhaps you think

466
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,380
you controlled yourself

467
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,220
very well in front of him,

468
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,420
but as a matter of fact,

469
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,860
you were still

470
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,260
subconsciously trying

471
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,660
to control his life.

472
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,220
Actually,

473
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,460
many things would work out better

474
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,260
if you change another way.

475
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,860
Take a good rest.

476
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,260
Try to relax.

477
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,840
<i>Du Lei</i>
<i>Call canceled</i>

478
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Change another way?

479
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,140
Isn’t your wound hurt?

480
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,340
It is.

481
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,900
But I can stand the pain.

482
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,420
Then why are you playing games?

483
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,260
Give me back.

484
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,940
What else can I do?

485
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,300
Lying here and crying out?

486
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,460
I can only play games!

487
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,740
Who cooked all the dishes?

488
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,500
They look so tasty!

489
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,700
Not anymore!

490
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,820
They are cold now.

491
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,580
I can heat them up.

492
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,140
I ate nothing at Xiaochuan’s.

493
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,980
I’m starving!

494
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,180
When I saw the pictures you sent me,

495
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,180
my mouth’s watering!

496
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,620
I’ll heat them up, and let’s eat together.

497
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,020
I’m good!

498
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,140
You go ahead!

499
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,380
What are you guys doing?

500
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,940
Yuan,

501
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,940
why are you yelling at us?

502
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,500
Somebody pissed you off?

503
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,420
Sorry, Miss Xinxin!

504
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,620
Sorry, Mr. Su!

505
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,260
It’s my fault. Please continue.

506
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,540
Mr. Yuan! What are you doing?

507
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,540
It’s cold outside.

508
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,300
Mr. Yuan?

509
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,180
Why would Ms. Jiang call him like that?

510
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,380
Ms. Jiang likes to spice it up!

511
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,300
Yes.

512
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,340
Ms. Jiang prefers

513
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,740
the bossy boss cosplay!

514
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,340
Ms. Jiang.

515
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,660
Yep!

516
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,340
I prefer this kinda role play

517
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,740
with Mr. Yuan!

518
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,700
Sorry!

519
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:31,980
Is it hurt?

520
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Don’t you know that I’m wounded here?

521
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,860
Can’t you be gentle?

522
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,860
Why are your hands so cold?

523
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,100
Where’s your coat? I’ll go get it for you.

524
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,820
In the closet.

525
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,020
Wait a sec.

526
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,220
They are so intimate.

527
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,140
It’s not important.

528
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,220
Please go on.

529
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,420
Ms. Jiang!

530
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,980
I’ll get it myself!

531
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,860
Why are there all suits?

532
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,820
-Well.
-Well.

533
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,180
Go have dinner.

534
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,340
The doctor said my wound was healed.

535
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,700
So I’ll go to work tomorrow.

536
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,660
Now, eat.

537
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,780
Try this. This is tasty.

538
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,500
Try it.

539
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,500
Why don’t you eat?

540
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,460
You… You go first.

541
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,100
You go first.

542
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,540
Well…

543
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,860
About what happened earlier,

544
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
I didn’t do it on purpose.

545
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,180
Please don’t get me wrong.

546
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,660
I’m full. And…

547
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,940
Since you are recovered,

548
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,940
I’ll sleep

549
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,220
in the bedroom now.

550
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,460
I’m going to bed.

551
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,260
Be careful!

552
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,700
So hot!

553
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,340
Is summer coming already?

554
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,780
I’ve read the due diligence report

555
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,700
of Shengshi Group you submitted.

556
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,340
It’s much better than

557
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,580
you did on Wanxing last time.

558
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,180
Good job!

559
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,660
Keep it up.

560
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,180
Let’s start from Xiang Ding.

561
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,540
Xiang Ding has made the most
progress this time.

562
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,140
He checked all the basic information,

563
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,540
including land, property, trademark, patent…

564
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,460
Jiang Jun!

565
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,140
Jiang Jun!

566
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,460
What are you doing?

567
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,660
What’s wrong with your mouth?

568
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,100
What’s wrong with your mouth?

569
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,180
Mouth? My mouth?

570
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,940
I’m doing the popular

571
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,940
octopus mouth dance!

572
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,580
Octopus mouth dance?

573
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,660
Yes.

574
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,260
You don’t know? It’s…

575
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,180
It’s like…

576
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,300
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

577
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,700
It’s a quite popular office dance.

578
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,180
It’s a good exercise for mouth.

579
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,850
If nothing else, I’ll go back to work!

580
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,820
Why are you looking at me this way?

581
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,780
What’s going on?

582
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,140
Sorry! I’m just lost in thought.

583
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,020
How come a man’s lips

584
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,540
are even softer than mine?

585
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,140
What am I thinking about?

586
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,700
Why are you staring at me?

587
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,220
Well…

588
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,580
I… I think you look so pretty today, Ms. Qiao!

589
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,140
You’d better do your job well

590
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,180
instead of playing up to me.

591
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,740
Sure!

592
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,340
Oh my God!

593
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,180
What’s wrong with me?

594
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,260
Do I have lip-phobia now?

595
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,500
Up till now, West World has attracted

596
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,340
8,000 beta test users.

597
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,860
Based on our data,

598
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,860
38 people’s matching degrees reach

599
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,300
over 70%.

600
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,740
In order to get more specific experience data,

601
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,940
we are going to hold an offline activity

602
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,340
with free accommodation service

603
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,060
so that they can meet each other in person.

604
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,820
As for the location,

605
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,980
I still insist on

606
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,300
a camping trip.

607
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,020
But it was vetoed.

608
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,180
So, Xu Li will be fully

609
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,820
in charge of the planning!

610
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,420
The place I found

611
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,180
is pretty, romantic and magical enough!

612
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,540
Many idol dramas

613
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,900
pick this place for love scenes!

614
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,020
<i>Offline activity venue: The aquarium</i>

615
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,580
This magical place is the aquarium!
<i>Offline activity venue: The aquarium</i>

616
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,120
<i>Offline activity venue: The aquarium</i>

617
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,260
During the activity,

618
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,500
I will respectively put the couples

619
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,340
whose matching degrees are

620
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,460
70%, 80% and 90%

621
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,460
at different spots.

622
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,220
But the thing is that they don’t know each other.

623
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,420
The app is the only way for them

624
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,660
to decide if they want to meet each other in person.

625
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,900
And the most importantly,

626
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,460
I’ve arranged

627
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,340
a splendid location

628
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,500
for our only 100% match

629
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,420
to meet!

630
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,300
They’ll be the focus

631
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,660
of our observation.

632
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,100
If their date is successful,

633
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,420
it’ll be a breakthrough

634
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,020
for West World!

635
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,100
Sounds good!

636
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,660
So, Mr. Du, will you be there on that day?

637
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,260
Actually, on that day I…

638
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,180
If anything’s up,

639
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,620
we can consult you and Jun.

640
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,260
Right?

641
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,220
Okay, I’ll be there!

642
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,300
Come here.

643
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,140
Why?

644
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,900
Sit down.

645
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,140
I’ll show you a magic.

646
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,540
Now, watch.

647
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,540
Hold on.

648
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,460
So ugly!

649
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,180
Pig lips!

650
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,460
They are!

651
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,460
You think it’s over?

652
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,620
I also prepared one for you.

653
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,460
No!

654
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,460
Come back!

655
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,220
No!

656
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,060
So ugly!

657
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,100
Yuan Shuai!

658
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,700
Really ugly!

659
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,100
Are you happy now?

660
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,700
Next.

661
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,660
We’ll do something together. It’s called

662
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,020
Super Imitation.

663
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,460
Super Imitation!

664
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,580
Repeat the things I say.

665
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,380
Okay.

666
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,940
Listen carefully.

667
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,500
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

668
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,340
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

669
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,180
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

670
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,740
So fluent?

671
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,780
Let’s change one.

672
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,500
Here it is!

673
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,300
Listen carefully.

674
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,180
Three, two, one!

675
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,500
Little white rabbit,

676
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,260
dressed up in white.

677
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,820
Two long ears stick up high.

678
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,820
It likes radish and cabbage.

679
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,940
It jumps around and It’s so cute.

680
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,500
Little white rabbit,

681
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,020
dressed up in white.

682
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,020
Two long ears stick up high.

683
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,020
It likes radish and cabbage.

684
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,220
It jumps around and It’s so cute.

685
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,740
Better?

686
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,180
What?

687
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,820
You are fine, now?

688
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,860
Dear West World users,

689
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,940
good evening!

690
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,380
Thank you for your support for our beta test.

691
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,900
We’ll hold our first offline dating activity

692
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,540
at the aquarium this Sunday afternoon
at two o’clock.

693
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,900
Hope to see you then!

694
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Dating?

695
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,060
I’m not going!

696
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,660
Jun.

697
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,780
The time and the place of our offline activity

698
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,420
have been settled.

699
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,340
The app should have sent you a notice.

700
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,460
Xiaochuan, Mr. Du and I will all be there.

701
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,980
As a member of West World,

702
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,220
you’ve got to be there, too!
