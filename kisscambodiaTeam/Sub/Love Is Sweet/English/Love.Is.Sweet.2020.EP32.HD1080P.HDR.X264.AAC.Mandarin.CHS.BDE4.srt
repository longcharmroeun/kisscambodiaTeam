1
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,490
Episode 32

3
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:55,840
Come in.

4
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,550
Mr. Du,

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
Baxi’s M&A loan was approved.

6
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,990
Director Liu agreed?

7
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,040
Yuan Shuai and Director Liu were acquaintances,

8
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
so I asked him for a favor

9
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,680
Later, they got very cooperative.

10
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,880
After we resubmitted the materials

11
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,880
in accordance with their requirements,

12
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
it was soon approved.

13
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,920
Don’t you like the watch I gave you?

14
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,240
This is...

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,920
Jiang Jun,

16
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,560
please be professional in the future.

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
Yuan Shuai works for GE now, after all.

18
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
I think you know better than anyone

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
about the relationship between the two of you.

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,160
You need to avert suspicion.

21
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
This is MH’s project.

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,280
How can you just let someone

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,000
from a rival company get in the way?

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,880
It’s not like that.

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,080
We just had a meal

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
with Director Liu together.

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,590
But this is not the first time.

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
Last time in the Fengchao case,
they robbed us of our achievements.

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,720
You think nobody in this company gossiped?

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
People who don’t know

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,440
will think that we are inferior.

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,640
Do you still want to stay in the company

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
if someone with an ulterior motive finds out?

34
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,560
It’s not that I haven’t taught you that

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,760
gossiping is a fearful thing.

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,200
This time I was thoughtless.

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I’ll be careful in the future.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,680
Make sure it won’t happen again.

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,560
When you get back,

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,200
go over the merger data yourself

41
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,120
and give me a detailed report on Wednesday.

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,040
Ok.

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,640
One more thing.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,840
Please come to me

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,080
if you have any problems in the future.

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,880
After all, your immediate boss

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
is me, not him.

48
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,720
I see.

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,280
Have you heard that

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,480
Ms. Jiang was scolded?

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,720
Yes.

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,640
It’s rare to see Mr. Du get so angry.

53
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,000
I heard that the Secretary Department

54
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,120
did not dare to send documents in the afternoon,

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,480
for fearing of being scolded, too.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,160
I heard that

57
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,720
Ms. Jiang had a meal with the client

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
and Mr. Yuan.

59
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,040
I don’t think it’s a big deal.

60
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,800
Why did he…

61
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,360
I’m telling you, out of kindness,

62
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,280
that Mr. Du is in a bad mood today.

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
You’d better stop gossiping here.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,600
Be careful about getting fired.

65
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,760
That makes sense.

66
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,600
Honey,

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,000
I’ll wait for you to get off work tonight.

68
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:33,960
Ok.

69
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
Single guy!

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,080
Come in.

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
Everybody’s left. Why didn’t you go?

72
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,080
I have a few things to do. Go back first.

73
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,520
All right. Then I’m gonna go. Go home early.

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,480
Bye.

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:04:59,960
Bye.

76
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
Tired?

77
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,760
Why are you so late from work today?

78
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,720
Don’t mention it.

79
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
Mr. Du was furious

80
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,200
when he found out you were helping me out
with Director Liu.

81
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
He gave me a piece of his mind

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
and ordered me to go over

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
all the materials for the merger

84
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,720
and write a report to him.

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,160
I’m not leaving early for the rest of the week.

86
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,160
What did he say?

87
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,560
He said I didn’t know how to avert suspicion.

88
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,360
But he’s right.

89
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,880
I was too eager for quick success,
and did not separate business from private life.

90
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,880
It’s my fault.

91
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,600
What’s the matter with you?

92
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,200
I’m fine. I just have a stomachache.

93
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,920
Jiang Jun, haven’t you eaten again?

94
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,040
I had coffee.

95
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Let’s go. I’ll take you to dinner first.

96
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,280
You are too busy to eat.

97
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,640
Why don’t you quit?

98
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,800
Stop working.

99
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,040
I’ll provide for you in the future.

100
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,670
I have such a big appetite,

101
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,320
and you are not afraid that
I will empty all your property?

102
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,480
You’re kidding.

103
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,960
When you are free, check my balance.

104
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,240
You will find that

105
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
it is only a ridiculous fantasy

106
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,840
to try to empty my property.

107
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,120
Yuan Shuai.

108
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,000
I know

109
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
you are devoted to your job.

110
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,320
In fact, I will always support you.

111
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
I just don’t want to see you work so hard.

112
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,760
With you by my side, I don’t feel it’s hard.

113
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,440
I’ll take a nap. Wake me up when we are there.

114
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,160
Shengxin’s case goes according to the plan.

115
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,480
Shen Xin, send a copy of the schedule
to my mailbox.

116
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Ok.

117
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,120
Chen Yicheng,

118
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,360
send me the evaluation report of Rongda
before getting off work.

119
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
Thanks.

120
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,880
Ok.

121
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,120
If there is nothing else, the meeting is over.

122
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
Why do you look so pale?

123
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,880
Are you all right?

124
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,360
Have you offended Mr. Du recently?

125
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,320
How can he assign you so many projects?

126
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,400
I don’t think you can finish your work
even if you live in the company.

127
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,680
No, it’s all normal work arrangements.

128
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,040
It’s so late.

129
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,520
How about getting something to eat together?

130
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,040
Go ahead. I’m not hungry.

131
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
I have work to do.

132
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,840
All right. Then I’m gonna go.

133
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,060
Jiang Jun!

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,420
Jiang Jun!

135
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,740
<i>Outpatient Department</i>

136
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,180
<i>Emergency Room, Inpatient Building</i>

137
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,800
Doctor,

138
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,080
how is she?

139
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,200
Don’t worry.

140
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
According to the preliminary diagnosis,

141
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,800
it was syncope due to the acute gastroenteritis.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,720
It should be caused by long-term overwork

143
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,920
and irregular diet.

144
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,280
Stay in the hospital
for a few days and she’ll be fine.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,680
Thank you, doctor.

146
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,440
You’re welcome.

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,400
Are you satisfied now?

148
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,800
Unreasonable projects,

149
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,080
crazy overtime,

150
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,520
and ineffective and frequent meetings.

151
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,400
Du Lei,

152
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,840
are you doing this because you’re jealous?

153
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,680
Why are you so childish?

154
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,800
I know

155
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,720
she’s sick and you’re worried.

156
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,760
However, your groundless speculation

157
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,240
will only make people think that you are the one
who is naive.

158
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,040
Sorry, Mr. Du,

159
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,440
but now is the time off work.

160
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,360
There is no reason for you to stay here.

161
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,040
I’m her boyfriend.

162
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,720
I’ll just stay and take care of her.

163
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,880
I’m her boss.

164
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,240
It’s my job

165
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,160
to worry about a sick subordinate.

166
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,640
Jiang Jun,

167
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,360
how are you?

168
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
I’m thirsty.

169
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,080
Here.

170
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,480
Drink slowly.

171
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,920
How do you feel? Are you feeling better?

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Mr. Du, I’m sorry.

173
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,400
I couldn’t finish today’s work.

174
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,920
You mustn’t say that.

175
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
You’re enslaved to syncope by the capitalists.

176
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,320
They have to send you
to the hospital immediately.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,920
Or whom will they enslave in the future?

178
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,800
It’s not your fault.

179
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
I’ve been putting too much pressure
on you lately.

180
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,360
Have a good rest.

181
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,600
I’ll take care of the business of the company
right now.

182
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,080
Come back

183
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,000
when you are well again.

184
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,720
Look.

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,520
You didn’t have a good rest

186
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,920
and worked until you fainted.

187
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,400
Your health is the most important of all things.

188
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,520
Do you know?

189
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,800
I was too busy to notice the time

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,960
and forgot to eat.

191
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,280
Here, have some more.

192
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,000
Rest more

193
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,000
and eat regularly in the future.

194
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,520
Watch your step.

195
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,440
I am fine.

196
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,400
It’s the same as the hypoglycemia.

197
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,280
It’s not like I lost my arms or legs.

198
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,280
Don’t treat me like I’m the old or the disabled.

199
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,120
What did you say?

200
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,760
Hypoglycemia?

201
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280
Ma’am,

202
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,480
you know,

203
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,320
the severe gastroenteritis can result

204
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
in shock from dehydration,

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,200
and environmental disorders,

206
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,640
or death.

207
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,480
I always tell you to eat on time
and take breaks on time,

208
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
but you ignore them all.

209
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
You have at least three cups of coffee a day.

210
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,320
Do you think you’re made of iron?

211
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,480
If I hadn’t been with you,

212
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,360
you would have fallen ill long ago.

213
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,600
This

214
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,920
<i>One-week recuperation recipe</i>

215
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,900
is your recipe for the next week.
<i>One-week recuperation recipe</i>

216
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,440
is your recipe for the next week.

217
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,840
Take a good look.

218
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,240
You may ask me if you have any questions.

219
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,600
Yuan Shuai,

220
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,640
did you

221
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,520
copy the recipe for pigs?

222
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,560
If I eat like this for a week, I’ll get so fat!

223
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,600
Your protest is denied.

224
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,640
And then,

225
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
I’m going to prepare your
fifth meal of the day,

226
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,880
kiwi with bean and longan sauce porridge.

227
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,240
Wait for me.

228
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,480
Bean and longan sauce...

229
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,280
What are you going to do with the computer?

230
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,280
Work?

231
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,560
No. I’m going to watch a TV play.

232
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,200
Watch a TV play?

233
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,080
Then why do you put the iPad aside

234
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,680
and use the computer instead?

235
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,040
I have a case to deal with.

236
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,840
I’ll just have a look.

237
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,680
No.

238
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,360
Jiang Jun,

239
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
you are a patient now.

240
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,880
Any work will interfere with your rest.

241
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you understand?

242
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Besides,

243
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
since you made a mistake,

244
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,680
you should be punished.

245
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,840
What punishment?

246
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,440
A pain in the ass.

247
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Sleep tight. I’m here for you.

248
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,600
Here.

249
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,240
Good night.

250
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,600
Good night.

251
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
Where do you want to go?

252
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,120
Look at you.

253
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,960
I know

254
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,200
you haven’t taken your annual leave yet.

255
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,040
So,

256
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,200
I asked Mr. Du

257
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,840
for a seven-day holiday.

258
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,840
In the next few days,

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,960
behave yourself,

260
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,240
stay at home,

261
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,800
and get a good rest.

262
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,200
I know you care about me,

263
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,960
but it’s not so good to ask for leave for me.

264
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,080
Yuan Shuai.

265
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,480
What’s the matter with you?

266
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,240
Why didn’t you tell us you were sick?

267
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,880
Mr. Yuan, you can go to work.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,960
We’re here to take care of her.

269
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,880
Xiaochuan and I went to buy the things
to be stewed early in the morning.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,640
There are chicken and things like that.

271
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,640
I’ll stew them for you later.

272
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
It’s reassuring to have someone
taking care of you.

273
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
Honey, I’m going to work.

274
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,160
Bye-bye.

275
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,240
Bye-bye.

276
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,160
Watch her closely.

277
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,240
Watch her closely.

278
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,400
Don’t you want something to eat?

279
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,640
No.

280
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,000
How are you feeling now?

281
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Is there anything else wrong?

282
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,080
I’m fine. I was already fine!

283
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,080
Yuan Shuai insisted that I rest for a week.

284
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,120
He did the right thing.

285
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,520
Look!

286
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,280
See what I got you.

287
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,880
Your skin is so dry.

288
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,200
You haven’t put on a face mask for days,
have you?

289
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
Take this small reservoir
and apply the mask well.

290
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,120
You are the best to me.

291
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,040
I have something else.

292
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,960
What is it?

293
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Put it away! Put it away!

294
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,800
Why?

295
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,440
I’m bringing in good luck.

296
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,680
Let’s have one for each of us.

297
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,760
Maybe we all get pregnant.

298
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,320
Put it away!

299
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,960
Jiang Jun, have some watermelons.

300
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,520
Thanks.

301
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,280
What are you talking about?

302
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,640
Woman’s secrets. You don’t need to know.

303
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,640
What’s the secret? I want to hear.

304
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,200
The watermelon is too cold

305
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,400
for you to eat.

306
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,920
I’ll get you something else.

307
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,830
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

308
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,580
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

309
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,860
-Good morning, Ms. Qiao.
-Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

310
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,340
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

311
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,280
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

312
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,920
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

313
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,340
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

314
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,320
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

315
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,420
<i>My love for you will never stop.
Jia Yuanji</i>

316
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,120
Little kid!

317
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,000
Hello.

318
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,840
Please ask the staff

319
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,160
to clean up my office.

320
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,360
Clean…

321
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,280
Qiao,

322
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,040
if you accept my love,

323
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,080
I can promise

324
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
to surprise you every day.

325
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,760
Kid,

326
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,640
your behaviors

327
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,400
are too naive.

328
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,840
You want to chase me?

329
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,440
Save it!

330
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,240
Three minutes! Clean it up.

331
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Qiao!

332
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,920
Qiao! I’ve been preparing this all night.

333
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,480
I’m telling you,

334
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,520
I have a friend

335
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,400
who got pregnant during the safe period.

336
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,840
You wake up?

337
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,840
Why do you wake up so early?

338
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Didn’t sleep well?

339
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,000
What’s the matter?

340
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,080
Yuan Shuai.

341
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,400
I…

342
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,680
What?

343
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,040
I’m hungry.

344
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,920
I’ll get you something to eat.

345
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,960
What would you like to eat?

346
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,280
Crawfish.

347
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,440
Crawfish.

348
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,400
Ok.

349
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,760
You sleep a little longer.

350
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:28,960
Wait for me.

351
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,480
Rest assured.

352
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,040
I have told the accountant

353
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,200
about the financial report of Huanyu Group.

354
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,080
We will do it in the same way as last year.

355
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
I’ll handle the CSRC.

356
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,240
Thank you very much, Mr. Du.

357
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,960
We’ve prepared

358
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,120
something for you.

359
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,880
Well, since you are sincere,

360
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,080
it would be impolite for me to reject it.

361
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
It’s the same account.

362
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,200
Yes.

363
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,040
I have to go.

364
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,000
Mr. Du!

365
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,120
Anything I can do?

366
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,560
I am anxious

367
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,920
to ask you to sign the SKL file.

368
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,000
When did you come?

369
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,400
I’ve been standing outside for a while.

370
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,600
Pen.

371
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,960
Next time if you have an emergency,

372
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,040
just knock on the door.

373
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,680
Ok.

374
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,560
Go back to work.

375
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,160
Ok, Mr. Du.

376
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:48,960
What?

377
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,080
How is Jiang Jun?

378
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,640
She’s fine.

379
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,400
It’s just that she should pay more attention
to her diet in the future.

380
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,800
How’s it going over there?

381
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,760
I’m sad.

382
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,320
She said she did not have any interest in me.

383
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,800
Do you have any tips?

384
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,080
She needs to be surprised.

385
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,080
You have to figure it out by yourself.

386
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,600
Have to go. I have work to do.

387
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Pregnancy Test Kit?

388
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,860
<i>What do two bars mean on a Pregnancy Test Kit?</i>

389
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,700
<i>Pregnancy is more likely,
but the result may not be accurate.</i>

390
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,560
What does this mean?

391
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,440
Pregnant?

392
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,440
Wait a minute.

393
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,680
Come here. I need to talk to you.

394
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,400
I know

395
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,480
what I’ve done to you

396
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,200
has made you think differently about me,

397
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,960
but you should have told me.

398
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,560
Told you what?

399
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,840
You should trust me

400
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,880
that I will take good care of you

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,960
and cherish you.

402
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,360
Of course.

403
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,880
I do have my own problems.

404
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,800
I should have thought about this
a little bit earlier.

405
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,600
No.

406
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,760
What are you talking about?

407
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,960
I know all about it.

408
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,040
What do you know?

409
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Your pregnancy.

410
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,800
You shouldn’t hide it from me.

411
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,920
Yuan Shuai, actually…

412
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,640
Honey,

413
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,120
from now on,

414
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,360
we’ll be a family of four!

415
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,720
We’ll be a family of four!

416
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,440
I’m going to be a father!

417
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,720
I’m going to be a father!

418
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,360
Yuan Shuai.

419
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,560
Wealth,

420
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,880
you are going to be an elder sister!

421
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,760
What…

422
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,480
What will our child’s name be?

423
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,040
It’s… It’s…

424
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,080
Yuan Congming?

425
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,120
Yuan… Yuan… Yuan…

426
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,880
Yuan Shuai!

427
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
It’s a misunderstanding.

428
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,040
I think I’m having my period.

429
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,720
I’ll take care of that.

430
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,560
Wealth, you are not going to be an elder sister.

431
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,120
I’m not going to be a father either.

432
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,040
Do you have anything to say

433
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,640
about this false pregnancy?

434
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,000
It’s just a misunderstanding.

435
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,800
Do you want my opinion?

436
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Jiang Jun, I am so sure that

437
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,560
you are the one I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

438
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,120
So, I will respect all your decisions.

439
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,320
In the future,

440
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,240
you can still work in the Investment Banking Department.

441
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,680
But all things being considered,

442
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,920
I think GE’s Fixed Income Department

443
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,920
suits you better.

444
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,080
This way, you can

445
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,880
continue to do the work you love

446
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,240
without working as hard as you do now.

447
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,480
As for the baby,

448
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,800
let nature take its course.

449
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,960
Why do you think so much all of a sudden?

450
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,360
Not all of a sudden.

451
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,920
I’ve been thinking about it for a long time.

452
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Why are you so nice?

453
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,480
When you’re ready,

454
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,120
we’ll have a family of our own,

455
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,200
and we’ll be happy.

456
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:57,920
Ok.

00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,560
Yes.

464
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,240
Would you like to wear it yourself
or buy it as a gift?

465
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,520
Which finger will you need it for?

466
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,440
It’s for my girlfriend.

467
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,880
Ring finger.

468
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,840
What size of the ring

469
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,120
does your girlfriend wear?

470
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,640
It’s about the size of this pen.

471
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,400
That’s not accurate.

472
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,760
I suggest you tell me your girlfriend’s
finger circumference

473
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,400
so that I can recommend the right size to you.

474
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,160
But,

475
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,240
you’d better take your girlfriend

476
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,760
to our offline physical store to try it on.

477
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960

478
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,280
and then we can provide

479
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,920
the customized diamond ring service for you.

480
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,950
I see. I’ll make a reservation.

481
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,160
Ok.

It is all yours.

487
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,280
Why is the SKL’s price leaked?

488
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,720
I’m sorry, Mr. Du.

489
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,160
I have arranged for someone to check the reason,

490
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,040
but

491
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
there is no definite information yet.

492
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,520
In other words,

493
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,520
we don’t even know

494
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,520
where the enemy is right now, right?

495
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,280
How about this?

496
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,440
I will try my best

497
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,480
to explain to the client.

498
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,120
You must get to the bottom of this matter.

499
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,960
However,

500
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,880
within three days,

501
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,640
if you can’t find the source of the leak,

502
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,320
you should have a clear idea of
who is responsible for this.

503
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,600
Ok, Mr. Du.

504
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,360
I’m on it.

505
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,800
The message finally went out
as Mr. Du had intended.

506
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,760
Take a look at this file.

507
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,560
Ok, thank you.

508
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,000
It’s time to eat. It’s time to eat.

509
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,880
It’s time to eat.

510
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,440
Try the bento

511
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,360
your boyfriend has prepared for you.

512
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,400
You eat first.

513
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,800
I have something to do here.

514
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,680
Put it down.

515
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,480
Put it down.

516
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,600
Why?

517
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,200
You’ll only reduce your efficiency
if you don’t eat.

518
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:50,720
Come on.

519
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,800
Leave me alone.

520
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,280
It’s very important.

521
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,840
Honey,

522
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,680
let’s

523
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,840
eat it properly.

524
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
If you do two things at once,

525
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,160
it will only interfere with your digestion.
Right?

526
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,280
Honey, have a bite.

527
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Just a bite, ok?

528
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,760
If the source of the quotation leak isn’t found,

529
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,040
and there is no result,

530
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,240
I am afraid that the company
will hold me accountable.

531
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,800
That doesn’t mean you should work so hard.

532
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,520
I think Mr. Du has done a...

533
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,520
Just leave me alone.

534
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,560
Let me focus on my work.

535
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,600
You eat first.

536
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,080
What do you think that is?

537
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,880
Let’s take a look.

538
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,720
Be quick.

539
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,080
Be quick!

540
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,760
Hello,

541
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,280
what is this, please?

542
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,280
This is a wet paper towel heater.

543
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,320
Newborns

544
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,400
often need wet paper towels to
wipe their bottoms.

545
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,760
It’s cold in the winter.

546
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,800
If you use this to heat the wet paper towel

547
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,200
and then wipe your baby’s bottom,

548
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,800
he won’t feel so cold.

549
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,560
Honey, this is interesting.

550
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,280
What do you think?

551
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,360
Did you know that wet paper towels are toxic
when heated?

552
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,120
Don’t say that in front of the shop assistant
next time.

553
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,880
That’s not good.

554
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,720
Really, it is toxic.

555
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,040
Then keep your voice down.

556
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,720
I’ve seen data on the Internet before

557
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,880
that a lot of kids are…

558
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,920
Honey! Honey, check this out!

559
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,440
See? Building blocks.

560
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,640
We can buy them for the baby to play with.

561
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,320
What do you think?

562
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,760
No! How ugly it is.

563
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,360
Children wouldn’t put away these things either.

564
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,080
If

565
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,520
he drops the block

566
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,600
and steps on it like this,

567
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,320
that would be fun then.

568
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,560
Li Xiaochuan, maybe you shouldn’t
start your own business.

569
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,190
You should be a professional whose job
is to talk back.

570
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,320
Mr. Li,

571
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,440
I didn’t expect it was really you.

572
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,960
I thought I was mistaken.

573
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,000
Do you remember me?

574
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,360
I’m Cheng from Weiran Technology.

575
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,360
Hello.

576
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,230
And this is…

577
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,840
My wife, Xu Li.

578
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,670
Hello.

579
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,960
So you are Mrs. Li.

580
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,440
I didn’t expect that

581
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,750
Mr. Li would like

582
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,000
this kind of girl.

583
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,320
Is there a problem?

584
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,750
Not really.

585
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,800
I just didn’t expect

586
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,880
Mrs. Li to be so pure and lovely.

587
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,190
I’d think she is a high school student
if you did not tell me this.

588
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,560
I’m sorry.

589
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,320
My wife is free to dress as she likes.

590
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,120
She doesn’t need your judgment at all.

591
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,920
Thank you.

592
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,000
Honey,

593
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,760
didn’t you say you like the building blocks?

594
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,720
Then buy the whole thing.

595
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
And that wet paper towel humidifier
or something.

596
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,880
We’ll get it, too.

597
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,760
I’ll buy you anything you like.

598
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,880
Let’s go.

599
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,380
<i>ZOCAI Diamond Ring Customization</i>

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,120
Welcome to ZOCAI Diamond Ring Customization!

601
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,520
What can I do for you?

602
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,280
I’ll have a look at the diamond rings.

603
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,680
Show me this one, please.

604
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,760
Sir,

605
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,160
you have good taste.

606
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
This is called Wedding Dress of Goddess.

607
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,840
It has wedding and proposal styles.

608
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,360
Which one would you like?

609
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,280
Proposal.

610
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,000
Just a moment, please.

611
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,760
Hello.

612
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,760
Hello, Yuan Shuai.

613
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,360
The scale at home is dead.

614
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,440
When you come back,
bring two triple-a batteries.

615
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,880
Ok. Ok. Ok.

616
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
I… I… I’m at work.

617
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,520
I… I’ll get them for you when I get back.

618
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,240
Hello.

619
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,520
Welcome to ZOCAI Diamond Ring Customization!

620
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,520
Well…

621
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,320
Why do I hear music playing in the background?

622
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,280
No, no. That…

623
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,960
That is the background music
of PPT.

624
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,360
Are you here to see the diamond rings?

625
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,080
Well, I have to get back to work.

626
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,120
I’m hanging up.

627
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,520
Go on.

628
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,400
Here, sir.

629
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,200
Ok.

630
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,060
<i>Confirmed by: Yuan Shuai</i>

631
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,240
Why is your dad so weird?

632
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,480
Is he acting up

633
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,560
behind my back?

634
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,240
Look at your dirty face.

635
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,440
I’ll check my mailbox.

636
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,500
<i>Notice of Personnel Change</i>

637
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,940
<i>Shen Xin in the Investment Banking Department
resigned due to personal reasons.</i>

638
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,760
No, I have to check with him!

639
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,240
Don’t!

640
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,720
Why not?

641
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,720
Keep your voice down.

642
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,560
Maybe something really went wrong.

643
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,480
It’s okay. It’s really okay.

644
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,080
Shen Xin.

645
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,080
Ms. Jiang.

646
