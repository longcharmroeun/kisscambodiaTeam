00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,370
Episode 24

3
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,120
Smells so good!

4
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,320
Right?

5
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,280
Don’t touch it.

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,920
I haven’t washed it yet.

7
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
Then wash it for me. I want to eat it

8
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,840
Trying to act cute?

9
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
You don’t like it?

10
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,520
I like it so much.

11
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,240
Yuanyuan.

12
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,760
-How come you’re cooking?
-Mrs. Jiang.

13
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,680
You’re our guest!

14
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,800
Go to the living room and rest!

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,680
It’s fine, Mrs. Jiang.

16
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,430
It’s fine.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
You should rest in the living room.

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,440
Just let me do the cooking.

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,560
Yuanyuan,

20
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,920
it’s not easy for you to visit us.

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,200
I can’t let you work.

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
Hurry! Go to the living room and rest!

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,640
It’s fine, Mrs. Jiang.

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,040
Now I’m in a relationship with Jun.

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,120
It’s natural that I...

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,760
In a relationship?

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,640
I… I mean a working relationship.

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
Right.

29
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,440
So I’ll always come to disturb you,

30
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,200
and scrounge free meals off.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,200
I hope you won’t mind it.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,470
I’ll be very happy

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,760
if you can visit me every day.

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,640
Mom, just let him do it.

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,040
He’s really good at cooking.

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,120
You can take a rest.

38
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,880
Go take a rest.

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,800
-Look at you. You’re so lazy!
-Mrs. Jiang.

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,720
-Go take a rest.
-Thank you.

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,560
It’s fine. It’s fine.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,880
Wait for me!

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Mrs. Jiang, just take the dishes to the table,

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,480
and get some rest.

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,000
Ok.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,720
Just leave it to me.

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,560
Ok. Ok.

48
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,480
You’re so lazy.

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,200
Yuan is still busy cooking for us.

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,800
Mom,

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,880
how do you know I like this dish?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,920
Put it down. Put it down.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,240
Go help Yuan.

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,160
Eat it later.

55
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
Why do you come here?

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,560
Anything I can help with?

57
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,200
Is it delicious?

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,840
So delicious.

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,470
Delicious, right?

60
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,440
Don’t just eat. Crack the eggs.

61
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,160
It tastes good.

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,520
Good, right?

63
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,920
Right?

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,360
Coming!

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,080
The soup is also ready!

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,880
Here.

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
Looks great!

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,880
Be careful.

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,280
It smells great!

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,280
Right, Mrs. Jiang?

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,760
Smells great!

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,360
Yuanyuan, come here.

73
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,480
Coming.

74
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,880
Here.

75
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,000
Let me help you.

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
So many dishes!

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,320
Here.

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,600
Mrs. Jiang,

79
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
happy New Year!

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
Happy New Year!

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,960
-Happy New Year!
-Here, Jun!

82
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,080
I wish my Jun and Yuanyuan

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,640
a happy New Year!

84
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,200
Happy New Year!

85
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,200
-Happy New Year!
-Good luck!

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,800
It tastes great!

87
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,720
Mrs. Jiang, let’s dig in.

88
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,680
Try the food I cooked.

89
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
See if you like it.

90
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,680
Yuanyuan,

91
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
how did you make this dish?

92
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,120
Seems Jun also likes it very much.

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,440
This one...

94
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,040
It’s very easy to cook.

95
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,720
At home, I always…

96
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,550
Mr. Yuan always cooked for us

97
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,440
during our team activities.

98
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
He can cook a lot of dishes,

99
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
and all sorts of cuisines.

100
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,480
Like sweet and sour pork, and pork ribs, etc.

101
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,280
Is it right?

102
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,160
Is it right?

103
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,360
Right. Right.

104
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
Mrs. Jiang,

105
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,200
if you like these dishes, I can always come

106
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,600
to cook them for you.

107
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,960
I can also write down the recipes,

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,840
so you can refer to them.

109
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,920
That’d be great.

110
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,840
Thank you.

111
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,680
My pleasure.

112
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,960
Here, Mrs. Jiang.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,520
Try this.

114
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,560
Thank you, Yuanyuan.

115
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,640
You’re welcome.

116
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,880
Here.

117
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,520
I just tried it. It’s delicious.

118
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,600
Eat more.

119
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
You should eat.

120
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,040
Yuanyuan,

121
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,640
I hope you can come often

122
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,000
when you have time.

123
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,760
I like you.

124
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,080
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

125
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,520
I still remember

126
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,800
you often came to eat with us when you were little.

127
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,640
I know

128
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,160
you and Jun were good friends.

129
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,680
If Jun’s speech notes hadn’t been stolen,

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,240
Jun wouldn’t have gone to the hospital.

131
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,840
If she hadn’t gone to the hospital,

132
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,040
she wouldn’t have transferred to another school.

133
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,920
If she hadn’t transferred to another school,

134
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,440
you would’ve met each other before you went abroad.

135
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,080
It was really a pity.

136
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
The one who stole Jun’s speech notes

137
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,320
is the one to blame.

138
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,440
He’s the most hateful person.

139
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,640
Mrs. Jiang,

140
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,160
speaking of this,

141
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,320
I think that

142
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,520
he didn’t mean to steal the speech notes.

143
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,960
Can you please not hate him?

144
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,550
It just came in my mind,

145
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,800
so I complained it to you.

146
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,680
Every time when I thought of this,

147
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,400
I thought he was very hateful.

148
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
Yuanyuan,

149
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,160
what are you doing?

150
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,320
Get up!

151
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,840
Mrs. Jiang,

152
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,240
I want to confess one thing to you.

153
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,520
The one

154
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,360
who took away Jiang Jun’s speech notes

155
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,600
was me.

156
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,120
I...

157
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
Mom! Mom! Mom!

158
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
It really wasn’t on purpose.

159
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,120
He took it away by mistake.

160
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,240
He really...

161
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,080
He really regrets doing that a lot, right?

162
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,920
-I...
-Right?

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
I regret it very much, Mrs. Jiang!

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,000
It really wasn’t on purpose!

165
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,680
You...

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,680
I regret it very much!

167
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,160
I won’t get up

168
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,400
if you don’t forgive me today!

169
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,080
Please forgive me!

170
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,440
I beg you.

171
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,800
I...

172
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,440
I beg you.

173
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Yuan,

174
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
come.

175
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,880
Get up. I forgive you.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,240
Hurry. Get up.

177
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Sit down. Sit down.

178
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

179
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
Mrs. Jiang,

180
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,400
you really have forgiven me?

181
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,320
I’ll drink a toast to you.

182
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,400
I promise

183
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
I’ll do my best

184
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
to protect Jiang Jun from now on.

185
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,800
I’ll finish it.

186
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,440
Put it down first.

187
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,320
You think I am

188
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
such a narrow-minded person?

189
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,720
It’s been so many years.

190
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,840
I won’t hold a grudge against you.

191
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,520
Mom! Mom! Don’t...

192
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,940
Here.

193
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,880
Yuan, let me drink a toast to you.

194
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,520
I’ll finish it first.

195
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,920
Don’t you want to drink?

196
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,760
I will.

197
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,360
I will drink it, Mrs. Jiang.

198
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
I’ve finished it.

199
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,960
Here’s a second

200
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
glass of wine.

201
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,000
Because you’re Jun’s leader.

202
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Now you’re a grown-up.

203
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,000
I believe

204
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
you won’t harm Jun anymore.

205
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,160
Here.

206
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,160
I’ll finish it first.

207
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,800
Mom!

208
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,040
Don’t you want to drink, Yuan?

209
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
I will.

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,040
I’ll drink it.

211
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I’ve finished it, Mrs. Jiang.

212
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,840
And the third

213
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,880
glass of wine

214
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,680
is to the New Year.

215
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,760
Mom!

216
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,280
New Year, new look.

217
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,960
Mom!

218
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
After today,

219
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,320
the old story will be written off,

220
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,840
and we’ll turn the page.

221
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,000
Yuan.

222
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,600
Happy New Year!

223
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,320
Don’t you want to drink?

224
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,000
I will.

225
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,880
I will drink it.

226
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,680
I will drink it up!

227
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,280
I’ve finished it.

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,120
Jun, dig in.

229
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,560
Are you alright?

230
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,840
I need to use the bathroom.

231
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,440
Sorry, Mrs. Jiang.

232
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,640
Let me go with you.

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,560
Sit down.

234
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,720
But... Mom, he...

235
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,760
Sit down.

236
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,760
But...

237
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,520
Mom, he’s...

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,640
He’s going to throw up!

239
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,440
Sit down!

240
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,360
Li,

241
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,840
why did you come here?

242
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,640
Aren’t you on holiday?

243
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,480
I had nothing to do.

244
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,480
So I came to see

245
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
if there’s anything I can help with.

246
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,240
Anything you can help with?

247
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,280
How about watching the shop for me?

248
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,680
Of course. You can go back.

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,920
I was kidding.

250
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,760
I’m serious.

251
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,120
Go enjoy the festival.

252
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,920
Perhaps later.

253
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,720
But I need to get some sleep first.

254
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,840
You know what?

255
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,720
A young man

256
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,560
came here to drink around midnight yesterday,

257
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,800
but half a bottle got him drunk.

258
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,240
We went to great lengths to send him back.

259
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,200
I think he must be heartbroken.

260
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
We had to comfort him for quite a while.

261
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,760
He’s really spoony.

262
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,720
Li,

263
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,320
what’re you mumbling?

264
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Nothing.

265
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,160
I mean he’s a poor guy.

266
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,600
Right.

267
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,560
What an unpleasant New Year Eve.

268
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Then please watch the shop for me.

269
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,720
I’ll get some sleep and come back soon.

270
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,480
Just go.

271
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,200
Thank you.

272
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,760
Happy New Year!

273
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,800
Happy New Year!

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Happy New Year!

275
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,200
Xu Li, don’t cry.

276
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,120
You’re working.

277
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,480
Don’t cry! Don’t cry! Don’t cry!

278
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,760
Don’t cry!

279
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,200
Eat something and you’ll feel better.

280
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Just eat something.

281
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
I’m very happy.

282
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,880
I’ll eat something and start working.

283
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,880
I’ll work hard.

284
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,240
Don’t cry.

285
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,560
Yuanyuan.

286
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,480
Mrs. Jiang.

287
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,080
Thank you.

288
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,720
My pleasure.

289
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
You’re my guest, but you’re washing the plates.

290
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
It doesn’t matter.

291
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,320
Don’t mind what I did just now.

292
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,280
Here.

293
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,760
Have some slices of apple.

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,200
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

295
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,160
Is it sweet?

296
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,320
So sweet.

297
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,680
The apple is sweet.

298
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,400
Have you ever thought

299
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,280
about having a sweet relationship?

300
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,480
Mrs. Jiang,

301
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,640
actually,

302
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,480
I’m already in a very sweet relationship.

303
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,680
What?

304
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,400
You have a girlfriend?

305
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,040
Mrs. Jiang,

306
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,720
actually, I...

307
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,840
Stop eating!

308
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,840
Wash these plates as well!

309
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,400
What did I do to deserve this?

310
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,160
I’m just in a relationship with your daughter.

311
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,000
I went to buy vegetables.

312
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,160
I did the cooking.

313
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,640
I drank so much wine,

314
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,840
and now I have to wash the plates.

315
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,440
I’m such a wonderful son-in-law!

316
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,080
Mothers-in-law are always right.

317
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,980
Mothers-in-law are the best.

318
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,880
Mothers-in-law can’t be wrong.

319
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,980
This is my job without doubt!

320
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,320
Jun,

321
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,480
have some slices of apple.

322
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,760
Thank you, Mom.

323
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,040
Jun,

324
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,800
our neighbor Mrs. Li’s son is coming back.

325
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,520
Do you want to meet him?

326
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,440
Mom,

327
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,480
don’t always try to arrange blind dates for me.

328
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,000
Look how old you are now!

329
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,160
I hope you can find a boyfriend.

330
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,480
I’ll feel at ease if he can take care of you.

331
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,440
I could take very good care of myself

332
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,320
even when I was alone in college.

333
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Just don’t worry about it.

334
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,080
Stop checking the phone! This is important!

335
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,080
Jun,

336
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,120
Yuan already has a girlfriend.

337
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,760
Do you know that?

338
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,160
Ah?

339
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,560
Surprised?

340
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,560
Why did you take him back then?

341
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,760
Drive him off immediately!

342
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,080
Honey,

343
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
what should I do?

344
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,840
It seems that

345
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,240
Jun fell in love with a man

346
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,120
who already has a girlfriend.

347
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,640
And that man is the son of the Yuan family.

348
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,960
Seems they’re very close to each other.

349
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,640
But Yuan told me

350
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,320
he already has a girlfriend.

351
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,920
Bah!

352
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
He’s such a scumbag!

353
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,000
Honey,

354
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,760
can you come tonight

355
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,200
and take him away?

356
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,920
Have some warm water.

357
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,800
What did my mom say to you just now?

358
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,720
She was so angry and told me to drive you away.

359
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,880
Mrs. Jiang brought a plate of apple slices to me

360
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,720
and asked me to eat.

361
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,720
She asked me if it was sweet.

362
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,960
I said

363
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,200
it’s as sweet as my girlfriend.

364
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,200
Right.

365
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,200
Then she got irritated.

366
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,720
I wasn’t able to finish my words. I…

367
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Mrs. Jiang.

368
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,480
Yuan,

369
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,760
you have to sleep in the living room tonight.

370
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,200
Would you mind?

371
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,200
No need, Mom.

372
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,560
He can sleep in my room.

373
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,360
I can sleep with you.

374
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,400
You’re a girl.

375
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,280
How can he sleep in your room?

376
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,600
Right!

377
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,440
How can a guy

378
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,760
sleep in a girl’s room?

379
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,000
Mrs. Jiang,

380
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,000
the living room is very cozy.

381
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,400
The sofa is very comfortable.

382
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,040
I’ll sleep here.

383
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,320
Mom.

384
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,000
This is a quilt for summer.

385
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,960
He’ll catch a cold.

386
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,840
I won’t!

387
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
I’m very fit, Mrs. Jiang.

388
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,880
I... I’ll be fine.

389
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,680
This quilt is very thick.

390
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,600
I’m ok with it.

391
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,400
Thick? You’ll…

392
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Jiang Jun,

393
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,840
Yuan is fit.

394
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,960
Don’t worry about him.

395
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,920
Get up.

396
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,760
Go sleep in your room.

397
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,680
But, Mom, the quilt is too thin.

398
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,760
Get up!

399
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,880
Mrs. Jiang, you should go to sleep, too.

400
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,640
I... I...

401
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,360
Yuan,

402
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,560
good night.

403
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,360
Good night, Mrs. Jiang.

404
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,920
Mothers-in-law are always right.

405
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,960
You scared me a lot!

406
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,160
Why did you come?

407
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,680
I was afraid you may catch a cold,

408
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,960
so I brought you a quilt.

409
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,640
I’m leaving.

410
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,560
No!

411
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,760
Warm the quilt for me.

412
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,920
I’m cold.

413
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,920
My mom will come out!

414
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,440
I missed you.

415
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,880
So annoying.

416
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,040
Here.

417
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,080
Is it warm?

418
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,760
Good night.

419
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,960
Good night.

420
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,760
It’s 4 am!

421
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Why did you set an alarm at 4 am?

422
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,000
My mom will get up soon.

423
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,120
We’ll be done for it if she sees us.

424
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,840
One more kiss.

425
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,720
I’m leaving.

426
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,960
Come here.

427
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,320
Mrs. Jiang,

428
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I... I can explain this to you.

429
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,440
Move aside!

430
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
It’s not your turn to speak!

431
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,560
Jun,

432
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,640
why didn’t you listen to me?

433
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,520
Why were you so stubborn?

434
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,880
What did I do, Mom?

435
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,800
How come I was stubborn?

436
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
You’re really driving me crazy?

437
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,320
Don’t you know he already has a girlfriend?

438
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,760
I can tell you like him.

439
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,600
But do you know he doesn’t intend

440
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,720
to break up with his girlfriend?

441
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,280
Jun,

442
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,200
you should change your mind now.

443
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,440
Don’t let him ruin you!

444
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,160
Mrs. Jiang,

445
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,360
Jun is my girlfriend.

446
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,720
We’re in a relationship, Mom.

447
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,520
Where am I?

448
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,640
Where am I?

449
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,680
Mom!

450
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,600
I can’t see anything.

451
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,400
Mom!

452
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,240
Am I sleepwalking?

453
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,400
Mom!

454
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,040
One sheep.

455
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,960
Two sheep.

456
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,360
Three sheep.

457
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,640
Your mom sleepwalks?

458
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,080
I’ve never seen this before.

459
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,520
Are you also sleepwalking?

460
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,200
Who knows?

461
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Honey,

462
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,240
I had it all wrong!

463
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,920
Yuanyuan is not a scumbag.

464
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,520
He’s Jun’s boyfriend.

465
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,480
Honey,

466
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
don’t come to take him away then.

467
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,760
Morning, Mrs. Jiang.

468
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,840
Yuanyuan.

469
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,120
Come here! Come here!

470
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,120
Come here!

471
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,760
Have breakfast! Come!

472
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,520
Mrs. Jiang, what a feast this is!

473
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,480
Mom, this is too exaggerating.

474
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,160
Not at all. Not at all.

475
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,560
Just a simple breakfast.

476
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,800
-Simple?
-Yuanyuan,

477
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,160
you haven’t eaten with us for a long time.

478
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,640
I don’t know what you like to eat.

479
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,360
So I cooked a little more.

480
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,200
See,

481
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,040
the Japanese style, Chinese style,

482
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,400
and the Western style.

483
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,760
Eat whatever you want.

484
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,400
Tell you what,

485
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,600
young men

486
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,640
must eat many eggs.

487
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,480
They’re very nutritious, you know?

488
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,440
So,

489
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,800
I’ve cooked some eggs for you.

490
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,600
See,

491
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,080
the quail eggs, soy eggs, boiled eggs,

492
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,480
preserved eggs, fried eggs, poached eggs,

493
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
and the most important one,

494
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,480
very nutritious raw eggs.

495
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,600
Here, Yuanyuan,

496
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,040
drink it up.

497
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,920
I...

498
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Don’t you want to drink?

499
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,560
Mom,

500
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,600
let him eat something first.

501
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,600
Ok. Ok.

502
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,120
Eat something first. Drink that later.

503
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,680
Ok.

504
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
You must drink it. It’s very nutritious.

505
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,920
Come, Yuanyuan.

506
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,560
Hurry.

507
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,920
Here.

508
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,000
Mrs. Jiang,

509
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,360
thank you so much.

510
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,920
But, to be honest,

511
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,360
I’d be very content

512
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,080
if I can eat some

513
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,560
rice noodles that you cook.

514
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,160
Yuanyuan,

515
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,080
how could I possibly forget this?

516
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,360
Wait! Wait!

517
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,160
There are really rice noodles!

518
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,760
My mom is crazy.

519
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,000
Maybe you’re her own child.

520
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,120
I’m going nuts!

521
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,040
What is that?

522
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,160
Drink it.

523
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,480
Very nutritious rice noodles!

524
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,480
Mom,

525
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,360
what did you put in the rice noodles?

526
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,640
Nothing really.

527
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,040
Just a few ingredients.

528
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,920
Chinese Angelica, cartialgenous, sea cucumbers,

529
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,120
Ganoderma lucidum,

530
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,400
and most importantly, the turtle and lamb kidneys.

531
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,520
Here.

532
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,600
Have a taste.

533
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,400
My mom has put her most treasured ingredients

534
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,760
in the rice noodles.

535
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,680
You should eat them all.

536
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,960
Here, Yuanyuan.

537
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,720
Eat up.

538
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,560
Eat them all.

539
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,200
Ok.

540
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,320
Come.

541
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,800
Which should I start to eat first?

542
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,760
Eat the ginseng first.

543
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,960
It’s very nutritious.

544
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,880
I better eat the rice noodles first.

545
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,960
Tell you what, the soup is very nutritious.

546
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,840
You should drink it all.

547
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,760
It’s delicious, Mrs. Jiang!

548
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,560
Delicious, right?

549
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,760
Come.

550
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,680
Eat some eggs.

551
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,680
Come.

552
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,000
Eat more, Yuanyuan.

553
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,600
You have to eat more.

554
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,080
Don’t touch them!

555
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,600
He can’t eat so many eggs!

556
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,960
Am I your daughter?

557
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,600
Girls shouldn’t eat so much.

558
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,400
You can eat some vegetables.

559
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,360
Eat the vegetable and the salad.

560
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,400
Come, Yuanyuan.

561
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,400
Eat more.

562
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,120
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

563
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,080
Mrs. Jiang, come.

564
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,840
Eat with me.

565
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,880
Eat a steamed bun.

566
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,120
Mrs. Jiang,

567
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
the rice noodles are very delicious.

568
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,960
The taste is the same as before.

569
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,960
Yuanyuan,

570
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,200
in the future,

571
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:28,880
I’ll cook

572
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,600
all kinds of dishes for you.

573
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,440
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

574
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,920
I’ll cook for you next time.

575
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,640
I’m very good at cooking.

576
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,800
Wait a sec. I have a phone call.

577
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,240
Hello?

578
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,200
Is it delicious?

579
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,800
Do you have time? Come play mahjong with us.

580
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,120
I can’t today.

581
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,440
I have a guest.

582
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,560
Yuanyuan, right?

583
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,600
Let him join us. We need one more player.

584
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,040
We can catch up by the way.

585
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,920
Ok, Cuiping.

586
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,840
Ok.

587
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,920
See you in the afternoon.

588
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,160
Ok.

589
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,320
Yuanyuan,

590
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
after the meal,

591
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,200
I hope you can complete a glorious mission.

592
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,240
Me?

593
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,240
What is it?

594
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
You’ll know after the meal.

595
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,160
Dig in. Dig in.

596
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,400
Ok.

597
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Delicious, right?

598
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,480
I forgot the most important dish!

599
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,200
The “Buddha’s Temptation”.

600
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
I’ll go get it for you.

601
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,560
Wait.

602
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,400
The “Buddha’s Temptation”.

603
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,000
What’re you doing?

604
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,360
Your mom is going to play mahjong with her friends.

605
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,200
I need to show off my skills.

606
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,760
It’s just a mahjong game, alright?

607
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,880
My mom already likes you very much.

608
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
You don’t understand.

609
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,520
It’s true that

610
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,800
sons-in-law know their mothers-in-law better.

611
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,120
Who’s the son-in-law here?

612
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,440
You’re so shameful.

613
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,480
Listen,

614
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,080
don’t show up in the afternoon.

615
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,640
Otherwise you’ll disrupt our plan.

616
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,800
What the hell is going on?

617
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,560
Am I a member of the Jiang family?

618
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,320
I’ll weep this out to my dad!

619
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,240
Be good.

620
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
This is more like it.

621
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,600
Yuanyuan,

622
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,200
your watch looks very expensive.

623
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,040
Not really.

624
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,040
Green Dragon.

625
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,840
This is just a

626
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,400
mid-priced watch.

627
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,280
Yuanyuan,

628
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,800
I wonder if you have

629
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,360
bought a house in Shanghai.

630
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,840
What I’m trying to say is that

631
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,360
you’re young,

632
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,720
and you’re working in a different city.

633
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,920
You need a house to live a steady life.

634
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,760
Right?

635
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,400
Right. Right.

636
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,080
You’re right, Auntie.

637
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,520
I’ve bought two houses in Shanghai.

638
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,360
But

639
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,720
just two ordinary

640
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,040
commodity houses.

641
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,360
Right. Right.

642
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Yuanyuan’s two houses are very small.

643
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Yuanyuan,

644
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
you’re so young,

645
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,240
but you’ve bought two houses in Shanghai!

646
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,120
Two houses.

647
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,320
Did your parents buy them for you?

648
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,560
No, Auntie.

649
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,600
My parents are living abroad.

650
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,000
-They don’t plan to move back for now.
-Abroad.

651
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,600
The two houses

652
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,080
are for my work.

653
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,240
I bought them myself.

654
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Then you must be

655
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,400
really well-paid in your company!

656
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,000
It depends on the projects.

657
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,600
If they’re small projects,

658
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,160
I won’t get paid very well.

659
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,480
Right. Right.

660
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,800
If they’re large projects,

661
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,680
he’ll earn a bit more.

662
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,200
Not much really.

663
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,320
Nine Dots!

664
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,640
I also have!

665
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,040
Yuanyuan,

666
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,640
you can’t play tricks.

667
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,560
Two Dots!

668
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,440
Wanjun,

669
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,160
let’s switch seats later.

670
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,280
You can’t sit next to Yuanyuan.

671
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,080
Mrs. Jiang is just lucky.

672
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,040
Three Characters!

673
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,480
One Dot!

674
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,880
One Dot?

675
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,360
Two Bamboos!

676
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,160
Two Bamboos! I won! I won!

677
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,760
I won!

678
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,560
So great!

679
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,360
You are playing high!

680
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,600
Yuanyuan, it’s right what I needed!

681
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,040
I was too careless.

682
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
You’re so lucky.

683
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,360
Here’s the money!

684
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,960
Shujuan,

685
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,600
you’re so narrow-minded.

686
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,880
Yuanyuan was so busy with work.

687
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,160
He didn’t have time to practice playing mahjong.

688
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,520
How could he know how to play tricks?

689
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,000
Auntie, you’re right.

690
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,680
I was too busy.

691
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,840
I didn’t have time to play mahjong.

692
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,400
So I came today

693
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,000
to learn from you.

694
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,280
Please don’t loathe me.

695
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,080
-Not at all!
-Not at all!

696
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,000
That’s great. That’s great.

697
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Let’s start then.

698
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Come. Come.

699
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,360
Eight Characters!

700
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,240
I won!

701
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
-It’s a Flush!
-You played high!

702
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,480
You are playing high!

703
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,640
Give me the money!

704
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,800
Aunties, you’re so lucky!

705
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,960
Seven!

706
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
I won!

707
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,080
Wanjun, I won again!

708
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:09,960
So great!

709
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,320
You’re so lucky! Here’s the money!

710
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,320
Nine Bamboos!

711
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,600
I won again!

712
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,600
Give me money!

713
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,480
Okay. Let’s give her money.

714
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,320
Seems I won this time?

715
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,920
Aunties, please help me take a look.

716
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,960
Did I win?

717
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,400
Yes, you did.

718
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
You won! You won!

719
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,360
He really won! He won!

720
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,280
You won! You won! You won!

721
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,280
I won?

722
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,400
I finally won!

723
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,960
Take the money.

724
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,880
Keep the change.

725
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,720
I’ve won

726
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,040
a lot of money from you today.

727
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,200
I actually start to feel embarrassed.

728
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,360
You’re too kind, Auntie.

729
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,560
I was too busy normally.

730
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,960
I don’t really know how to play mahjong.

731
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,040
It’s my honor

732
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,520
to play mahjong with you today.

733
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,800
I knew it.

734
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,680
Yuanyuan’s of good character.

735
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,600
He lost so much money,

736
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,360
but he didn’t pull a long face,

737
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,480
or become anxious.

738
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,360
I’m sure

739
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,680
he’ll be a very good husband!

740
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,360
Yuanyuan,

741
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,760
I’m a straight shooter.

742
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,920
I’ll just be straightforward with you.

743
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,800
Tell you what,

744
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,600
-my daughter also works in Shanghai.
-Wait! Wait!

745
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,080
Quiet! Quiet!

746
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,680
I gathered us together today,

747
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,360
right?

748
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,760
Of course I should go first.

749
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,720
Yuanyuan.

750
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,720
-My daughter...
-Cuiping.

751
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,840
Cuiping.

752
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Sorry to interrupt.

753
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,070
I know

754
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,550
what questions you want to ask.

755
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,960
Yuanyuan

756
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,760
is indeed a bit more outstanding

757
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,520
than some young men.

758
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,960
But,

759
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,160
he’s in a relationship with my Jun.

760
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,440
They’re with each other now.

761
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,550
Really?

762
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,920
You said yesterday that

763
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,680
Yuanyuan is not Jun’s boyfriend.

764
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,630
Shujuan,

765
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,240
I was too shy to say it yesterday.

766
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,920
I already have a girlfriend.

767
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,520
That’s good. That’s good.

768
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,960
I need to go back to cook.

769
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,320
Auntie, why are you leaving?

770
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Let’s continue.

771
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,520
We’re leaving. We’re leaving.

772
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,520
Have a good time.

773
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,400
See you, Aunties.

774
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,920
Let’s play again next time!

775
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,240
Let’s play again next time, Aunties.

776
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,280
Come again.

777
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,240
How was it, Mrs. Jiang?

778
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,680
Did I perform well enough?

779
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,240
Very successful!

780
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,840
Actually, I knew she wanted Four Dots

781
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,880
when I threw it away.

782
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,160
Mrs. Jiang, wait a minute.

783
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,080
Hello.

784
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
How much is it? I’ll buy two bags.

785
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,480
20 yuan per bag.

786
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,360
40 yuan for two bags.

787
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,320
Ok.

788
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,320
Here you are.

789
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,040
Thank you.

790
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,520
Yuanyuan,

791
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,520
can you eat so many?

792
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,520
Jun loves to eat roasted chestnuts.

793
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,720
I think probably you love to eat them, too.

794
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,960
So I bought more.

795
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,960
When Jun was a kid,

796
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,120
her dad always bought roasted chestnuts for her.

797
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,920
Right.

798
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,120
Brother Yuanyuan,

799
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,520
you’re awesome!

800
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,880
Do you want me to teach you?

801
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,800
But,

802
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,080
you’ll have to call me

803
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,320
Brother Yuanyuan three times first.

804
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,400
Jun.

805
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,440
Dad.

806
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,320
Guess what I bought for you.

807
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,440
Chestnuts!

808
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,760
Thank you, Dad.

809
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,640
Eat the chestnuts with Yuanyuan.

810
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,320
I’ll go cook rice noodles for you.

811
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,920
Brother Yuanyuan, let’s eat chestnuts.

812
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,000
I won’t.

813
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,240
How does it taste?

814
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,360
Is it sweet?

815
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,640
A little.

816
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,360
Seems you don’t really like chestnuts.

817
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
I like them very much.

818
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,560
Why don’t

819
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,720
you peel them for me?

820
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,480
I’ll be responsible for eating them.

821
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Why would I peel them for you?

822
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,720
Because my hands are small and weak.

823
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,560
My dad always peeled them for me.

824
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,000
But now he went to cook.

825
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,320
Then how did you

826
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,880
peel that one just now?

827
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,360
I bit it.

828
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,040
Alright.

829
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,920
Well,

830
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,160
call me Brother Yuanyuan three times

831
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,480
and I’ll peel them for you.

832
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,520
Brother Yuanyuan!
Brother Yuanyuan! Brother Yuanyuan!

833
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,160
Give them to me!

834
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,800
Here you are.

835
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,960
Is it sweet?

836
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,380
Yuanyuan,

837
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:45,520

838

00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,720
thank you.

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,100

<i>Roasted Chestnuts</i>

842
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,560
Thank you for caring about Jun’s feelings.

843
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,520
After her father died,

844
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,320
seemed she grew up suddenly overnight.

845
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,240
She never cried again.

846
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,280
I don’t know

847
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,000
if she really has become stronger,

848
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,760
or she was just pretending.

849
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,240
But I know that

850
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,720
she was afraid I may worry about her.

851
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,480
But that made me

852
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,840
worry about her even more.

853
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,600
Now she has you.

854
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,320
I can feel at ease.

855
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,880
Mrs. Jiang, it’s my responsibility.

856
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,080
Yuanyuan,

857
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,720
can you promise me one thing?

858
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,960
Mrs. Jiang,

859
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,360
go ahead.

860
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,480
I hope that

861
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,800
no matter how

862
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,600
your relationship changes

863
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,840
or what happens between you two

864
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,360
in the future,

865
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,720
you should always treat her nicely

866
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,440
and not be the one who makes her cry.

867
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,640
Mrs. Jiang,

868
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,400
don’t worry.

869
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,480
I’ll take good care of her,

870
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,320
and won’t let anyone bully her.

871
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
In this lifetime,

872
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,080
I’ll only make her laugh,

873
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,680
not cry.

874
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,960
Thank you, Yuanyuan.

875
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,200
That street stall, right?

876
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,680
I haven’t eaten them for a long time.

877
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,560
Stop.

878
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,280
It’s my job to peel them.

879
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,960
You’re the best.

880
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,960
Come here.

881
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,200
Try it.

882
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,600
How does it taste?

883
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,400
So delicious.

884
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,200
Delicious, right?

885
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:41,800
Is it sweet?

886
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,640
Sweet.

887
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,240
Yuanyuan,

888
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,600
You’re spoiling her too much.

889
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,720
Mrs. Jiang,

890
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,400
this is how young people are in a relationship.

891
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,320
You won’t understand.

892
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,440
Mrs. Jiang,

893
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,440
girlfriends

894
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,000
are supposed to be spoiled.

895
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,200
Let me peel one for you as well.

896
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,160
Yuanyuan,

897
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,920
no need.

898
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,040
I can peel it myself.

899
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,800
It’s fine. It’s fine.

900
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Come. Try it.

901
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
See if it tastes good.

902
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,600
Thank you, Yuanyuan.

903
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,240
You’re welcome.

904
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,320
Here. Have some oranges.

905
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,080
Ok.

906
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,880
Get me some water. I’m choking.

907
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,320
Eat slowly.

908
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,280
Here you are.

909
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,880
Jun, be careful!

910
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,280
It’s fine, Mrs. Jiang.

911
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,160
It wasn’t on purpose.

912
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,080
You’re so careless!

913
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,560
Come, take it off. I’ll dry it for you.

914
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,520
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

915
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,240
You’re so clumsy!

916
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,520
It’s fine.

917
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,000
This kid.

918
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,920
Are you alright?

919
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,360
Is there anything in your pocket?

920
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,960
Let me see.

921
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,440
I’m fine. Wipe your clothes.

922
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,720
Look what you did!

923
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,200
Are you alright?

924
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,680
I’m fine.

What’s with this?

This... This...

933
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,840
Jiang Jun,

934
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,480
come with me.

935
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,680
This...

936
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,360
This... This...

937
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,000
Jun,

938
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,440
why didn’t you tell me the truth?

939
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,240
Mom, I was afraid you may get worried.

940
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,280
When you wanted to go to Shanghai,

941
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,760
I didn’t agree with your decision.

942
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,400
Working in big cities is very stressful,

943
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,640
and there are all sorts of people.

944
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,840
But you said

945
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,200
you wanted to have a try there.

946
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,400
I didn’t stop you.

947
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,280
I didn’t want you to do a stressful job.

948
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
But you majored in a related subject at college.

949
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,600
So I approved it, right?

950
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,880
But why did you ignore

951
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,560
what I told you?

952
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,480
People in places like MH are very sinister.

953
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,480
I don’t want to hear this name in my entire life.

954
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,240
Can’t you listen to me for once?

955
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,240
Especially your dad...

956
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,320
Mom,

957
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,880
I used to think the investment banks were inhuman.

958
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,200
But after 6 months working there,

959
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
I found it’s not about the industry,

960
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,920
but the people in the industry.

961
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,840
And I really love this job very much.

962
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,840
Say no more!

963
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,280
Quit the job when you’re back.

964
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,680
I won’t compromise with you on this matter.
