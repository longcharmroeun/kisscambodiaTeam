00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,640
It can only be rented to one person.

194
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
Yuan Shuai.

195
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,040
Your clothes. Washed.

196
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
They’re clean.

197
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,680
To be prudent is a basic requirement

198
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,840
in our industry.

199
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,920
What’s wrong with your face?

200
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,600
You know it.

201
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,840
Wait.

202
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,680
We need to talk.

203
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,560
You see this?
<i>[Shimao Technology terminated the acquisition
of Yangsheng Power]</i>

204
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,080
The acquisition was terminated.
<i>[Shimao Technology terminated the acquisition
of Yangsheng Power]</i>

205
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,960
I was the only one who got the answer that day.

206
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,160
Why did you reject me?

207
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,880
I knew you’d talk with me about it.

208
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,280
What do you mean?

209
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,920
You did answer it correctly,

210
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
but that’s only temporary.

211
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
The termination of the acquisition

212
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,040
made people think Ma Yuke did that

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,680
to buy on margin and boost share price.

214
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,840
But,

215
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,080
actually not.

216
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,760
He did that

217
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
just to get one more seat on the board,

218
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,040
plus the right to express
leadership’s decisions.

219
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,960
Got it?

220
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,000
You must keep this word in your mind.

221
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,640
You don’t have to trust yourself,

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,240
but you must trust me.

223
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,280
You

224
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,360
don’t fit MH.

225
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,240
Impossible.

226
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,400
You’re confident.

227
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,280
Alright.

228
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
I’ll give you another test.

229
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,280
If you can do it,

230
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,880
you’ll get into MH.

231
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,280
OK.

232
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
All try but never buy. Are you a demon?

233
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,440
What the hell is the assessment?

234
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Excuse me.

235
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,000
Can I try this on?

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Thanks.

237
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Indeed, you failed the test.

238
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,440
Why did you quit halfway?

239
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,080
You tried on seven dresses in a row

240
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
yet didn’t mean to buy them at all.

241
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,160
The seller got angry with you

242
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
for sure.

243
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,760
But you,

244
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,400
you were embarrassed as if you’d been shot

245
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,520
and ran away.

246
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
What kind of test is that?

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,080
You’re fooling me.

248
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,240
From this test, we can see

249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
you’re

250
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
extremely sensitive

251
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,920
and psychologically weak.

252
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,520
I’ve told you that

253
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,640
the investment banking is like a battlefield.

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,680
You.

255
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,200
You can’t.

256
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Jiang Jun.

257
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
You’re not smart,

258
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
but you’re kind of meticulous.

259
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,880
I think

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,920
consulting will be better for you.

261
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Actually,

262
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,280
I’ve got it done.

263
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,320
Wise Consulting,

264
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,520
one of the top three consulting firms
nationwide.

265
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,440
The position is director assistant,

266
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,040
with annual salary at least 300 grand,

267
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,880
high possibility for promotion.

268
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
You’re welcome.

269
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,320
I won’t give up.

270
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
I will definitely get into MH.

271
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,360
I’ve said

272
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
you couldn’t.

273
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
When girls are sad,

274
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,000
they may cry and let go.

275
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
But you,

276
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,640
you can’t even afford tears.

277
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
I hope you’ll show respect to others.

278
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,000
I hope you’ll be not so weak.

279
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,240
No way can I forgive you.

280
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,040
We may never contact,

281
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,240
never meet again.

282
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,240
Jiang Jun.

283
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,360
In your heart,

284
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,200
am I always a bully?

285
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

286
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,200
I finally see your true color.

287
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,960
Alright.

288
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,000
Don’t be so kind in the future.

289
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,720
If someone bullies you,

290
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,320
just fight back.

291
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,840
If someone sets you up,

292
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,880
you’ll pay back double.

293
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,680
Learn to protect yourself.

294
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
Understand?

295
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,349
Save it.

296
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,589
I’m not as mean as you.

297
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,349
You’re not like other girls.

298
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,589
They can cry to get things done,

299
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,520
but you,

300
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,960
you’re even allergic to tears.

301
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,760
You’re the one who makes me cry.

302
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,040
I don’t want to see you again.

303
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Jiang Jun. Finally, you’re back.

304
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,840
I’ve got a special situation to tell you.

305
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
My son just called me

306
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,360
and said

307
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,720
he’d get married soon.

308
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,280
Really?

309
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,760
Yes.

310
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,120
He asked me to get him an apartment.

311
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,400
You know.

312
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,960
I’ve expected this day

313
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,560
for so many years.

314
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
So, Jiang Jun,

315
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
I’m so sorry.

316
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,880
I’ll return you all the rent and deposit

317
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,280
of this department.

318
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,920
You won’t pay the utility bill this month.

319
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,800
What do you say?

320
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,760
But...

321
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,280
Is it so urgent?

322
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,760
Isn’t your son abroad?

323
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,760
He is abroad,

324
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,320
but

325
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,200
he’ll be back tomorrow.

326
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,360
You know,

327
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,520
he’ll be back with his fiancee.

328
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,720
It’s not convenient for them to live with me,

329
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,200
is it?

330
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,040
Well, Ms. Zhang,

331
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
do you want to raise the rent?

332
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,320
If that’s the case, we can talk.

333
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
What are you talking about?

334
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,880
Do I look like

335
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,440
a snobbish woman?

336
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,440
You don’t.

337
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,400
Alright.

338
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,800
Jiang Jun.

339
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,360
Take an extra month’s rent

340
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
as the penalty.

341
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,720
Alright?

342
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,760
And you’ll just

343
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,840
pack up and move out

344
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,880
very soon.

345
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
We’ll still be good friends.

346
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Alright?

347
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,320
But, Ms. Zhang,

348
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,360
I have so many stuff here.

349
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,240
I don’t have enough time...

350
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,240
You can try to pack up as soon as possible.

351
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,000
That’s it.

352
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,760
-Hurry and pack up.
-But...

353
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,360
Just move out. Alright?

354
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,160
That’s it.

355
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,080
You’re beautiful.

356
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,640
I love you. Bye.

357
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,040
Eat it quickly.

358
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,160
My roommate is on a diet.

359
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,600
If she hears it, she’ll...

360
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,800
You know what I mean.

361
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,400
How is it?

362
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,640
You’re eating instant noodles so late.

363
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,080
I’m on a diet!

364
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Is it good?

365
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,320
It’s good.

366
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
I just tried to go against the tide,

367
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,240
yet got damned right away.

368
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,400
Even my base was taken.

369
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,360
How else can I fight the enemy?

370
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,440
Just keep fighting. Why not?

371
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,640
Jiang Jun.

372
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,840
I’m sorry that

373
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,920
you didn’t see Lin Taimo.

374
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,520
So,

375
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,800
to make up for it,

376
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,240
I’ll ask my entire sisterhood

377
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,560
of 800 models for help

378
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,840
to get Lin Taimo

379
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,400
in front of you.

380
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,720
Thank your sisterhood then.

381
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,120
You’ll be well rewarded.

382
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,160
Yes, my lady.

383
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,160
What are you doing?

384
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,760
Looking for an apartment.

385
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,240
Isn’t it for me?

386
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,800
Friends should share everything.

387
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,120
Leave some to me.

388
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,480
Mr. Yuan. It’s rare that you don’t work
on weekends.

389
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,560
It’s almost done.

390
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,720
Are you satisfied?

391
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,520
All these are bought as you required,

392
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,240
sofa, greenery,

393
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,920
and the wrought-iron bed in the bedroom.

394
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,760
Is this apartment posted on Internet?

395
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Yes, it is.

396
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,160
Since it’s posted on Internet,

397
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,680
I’ve been called by clients.

398
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,320
Certainly.

399
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,280
Take your time.

400
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I gotta go to my company,

401
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,240
Mr. Yuan. Bye.

402
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,800
OK.

403
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,880
Thanks.

404
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
Let’s see if you’ll rent it.

405
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,600
Jiang Jun.

406
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,920
Tell me the requirements.

407
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,400
Five thousand.

408
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,040
Simple furniture style,

409
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,240
not grandiose.

410
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,920
Wrought-iron bed is preferred.

411
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,560
It will be better if there is

412
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,560
a big balcony to see night view of Shanghai.

413
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,600
Jiang Jun.

414
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
That’s not much at all.

415
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,920
What about the location?

416
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,720
If there’s subway,

417
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,940
it doesn’t matter to be a little far.

418
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:51,960
[Refined decoration,
Room No.702, Longting No.79]
it doesn’t matter to be a little far.

419
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,020
[Refined decoration,
Room No.702, Longting No.79]

420
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,000
Wrought-iron bed.

421
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,880
Big balcony.

422
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Shanghai night view.

423
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
It all fits!

424
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,040
Really? Where is it?

425
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,080
Longting Community.

426
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,000
Forget it. I can’t afford it.

427
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,840
That community is nicknamed

428
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,440
Shanghai Investment Banking Backyard.

429
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,920
Most investment banking elites live there.

430
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,120
It‘ll be double price at least.

431
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,160
Did you forget to sort by price?

432
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,280
So cheap?

433
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Is it false advertising?

434
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,200
True or not,

435
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,400
let’s ask them.

436
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,360
Hello. Can I help you?

437
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,160
Hello. I’d like to ask you,

438
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
do you have an apartment to rent

439
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,360
in Longting Community?

440
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,560
Yes.

441
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
I’d like to ask,

442
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,440
is it really 7,000 yuan a month?

443
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,480
Exactly.

444
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,360
Well, can we see the apartment tomorrow morning?

445
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,240
May I have your name?

446
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,320
My surname is Xu.

447
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,240
Miss Xu. I’m sorry but

448
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,440
the apartment is already rented out.

449
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,120
My surname is Xu,

450
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,200
but I’m inquiring about it for my friend.

451
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,840
Her surname is Jiang.

452
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,400
Jiang?

453
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,360
Did you say someone has rented the apartment?

454
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,760
No, not yet.

455
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,680
That apartment is still available.

456
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,440
Does your friend’s phone number end with 3097?

457
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Yes, yes.

458
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
It’s exactly this number.

459
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,560
Shall we go to see the apartment

460
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,600
at 1 pm?

461
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,800
OK. Let’s go this afternoon.

462
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,240
Thank you so much.

463
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Be quiet!

464
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,760
Boss. A little bird said

465
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
Jiang Jun adopted a stray god

466
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,760
at the playground.

467
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,960
She goes to feed it every day.

468
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,360
Once she has affections

469
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,760
with these kitties and doggies

470
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,080
and they’re gone someday,

471
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,680
she’ll cry her eyes out.

472
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,680
No.

473
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,200
I have to do something.

474
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,920
Wealth.

475
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,480
Wealth.

476
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,600
I... I’m getting you out.

477
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,200
Wealth. Don’t be afraid.

478
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,840
Wealth.

479
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,640
Wealth.

480
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,840
Jiang Jun.

481
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,120
What are you doing?

482
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:21,880
What’s wrong?

483
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,920
It seems stuck in there.

484
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Don’t move. Let me.

485
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,200
Come on.

486
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,480
Wealth.

487
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,320
Here.

488
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,040
Slowly.

489
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,040
Fine.

490
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,120
Come out.

491
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,440
Go.

492
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,120
Here.

493
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,240
It’s fine.

494
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,360
-Wealth.
-Wealth.

495
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,920
It’s fine now.

496
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,720
Poor little thing.

497
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,920
Wealth.

498
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,280
Your hand...

499
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
You’re so clumsy.

500
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
How come you are here?

501
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,160
I heard you adopted a dog,

502
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,800
so I bring you a kennel.

503
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
You’re ridiculous.

504
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,480
People are everywhere here.

505
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,080
And there’s always a pool.

506
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,240
Why didn’t you

507
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,800
get a good place to keep the dog?

508
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,200
Here.

509
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,480
Be careful in the future. You hear me?

510
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
I know.

511
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Come, baby.

512
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,920
Wealth. Come.

513
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
You’re naughty.

514
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,040
Are you happy?

515
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Are you?

516
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,440
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

517
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,040
The tenant you designated

518
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,840
has contacted me.

519
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,560
We’re gonna

520
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,960
see the apartment at 1 pm.

521
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Look, Wealth.

522
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,560
It’s odd.

523
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,120
It’s already 1 pm. Why hasn’t she come?

524
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,320
This apartment is particularly well-lit.

525
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,960
The geomantic layout is excellent as well.

526
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,480
If you rent this apartment,

527
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,240
your business will surely be great.

528
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,320
Who is it?

529
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,080
Are you satisfied with this apartment?

530
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,240
Jiang Jun. Obviously,

531
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,200
the layout is exactly what you want.

532
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,760
And the sofa,

533
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,400
it’s exactly the style you love.

534
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
It’s the first time that this apartment
is rented,

535
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,440
so all the furniture is brand new.

536
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,840
The lighting is superb as well.

537
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,120
Honestly,

538
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,080
this apartment is beyond my expectation.

539
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
And its rent is two or three thousand cheaper

540
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,080
than the surrounding ones.

541
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,560
Is there any special reason?

542
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,200
Is it haunted or something?

543
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,120
Haunted?

544
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,840
No way.

545
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,880
Let me tell you.

546
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,880
Since this apartment is posted on Internet,

547
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,400
clients have been inquiring about it.

548
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,400
The landlord doesn’t care about money.

549
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,160
The hygiene is his concern.

550
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,000
You perfectly match

551
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,320
his requirements.

552
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,880
So I bring you here to see the apartment.

553
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,200
What do you say?

554
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,480
Rent it.

555
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,720
Didn’t you say it’s Investment Banking Backyard?

556
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,800
Think about it.

557
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
In case that you could join MH

558
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,320
as you move in.

559
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,280
Ms. Jiang. If you sincerely want to rent it,

560
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,760
you can sign the contract today

561
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,200
and check in.

562
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,200
Well, I’d rather...

563
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,640
Jiang Jun. I’ve found out that

564
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,600
Lin Taimo has been recuperating.

565
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,880
But

566
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,400
he goes to Hui Wang Library

567
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,920
once a month.

568
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,040
And it is exactly today.

569
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,080
Seriously?

570
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,680
I’m going there now.

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,720
Keep your voice down.

762
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
You must be in your company now.

763
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,640
Aren’t you afraid to be scolded by your boss?

764
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,560
There’s no need.

765
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,880
I’ve decided to resign.

766
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,760
Why?

767
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,200
A freak client

768
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,280
tried to harass my model.

769
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,400
I gallantly poured two cups of coffee on him,

770
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,120
and then

771
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,840
got honorably complained by him.

772
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,520
That’s more like you.

773
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,160
It’s fine.

774
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,120
From tomorrow on,

775
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,240
I’ll help you find a job.

776
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
No need.

777
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,440
I

778
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,120
have figured it out

779
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
by eating a packet of cookies.

780
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,720
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

781
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,320
I’m not like you.

782
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,000
Over these two years,

783
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,480
being an office lady has been driving me crazy.

784
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,680
You know.

785
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,880
My dream is to write novels,

786
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,160
depicting the perfect hero

787
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,840
in my mind.

788
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,800
He must have a high IQ above 250,

789
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,560
with fair skin,

790
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,480
big eyes,

791
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,240
long bangs,

792
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,240
better with dimples.

793
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,480
No. I’m shocked.

794
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,800
I’m in a mess.

795
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,920
I’ve found my dream.

796
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,960
I’ve sent you the door code.

797
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,160
I gotta go. Bye.

798
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,080
Excuse me, Miss.

799
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,400
Does that boy

800
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,720
come here often?

801
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,480
Yeah.

802
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,120
He often comes here for Internet.

803
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,560
Thanks.

804
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,380
[Three clerks wanted in the store ]

805
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,960
Amazing.

806
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,120
What a lucky day.

807
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,640
Without that devil,

808
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,840
everything goes well.

809
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,840
You... You... How do you know I’m here?

810
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,800
Miss Jiang. You think too much.

811
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,320
I heard I’ve got a new neighbor here

812
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,560
and come to say hello.

813
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,640
How come it’s you?

814
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,120
What a coincidence.

815
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,800
I wondered

816
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,360
why the rent of this apartment was so cheap.

817
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,240
Turned out there’s an evil neighbor here.

818
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,360
You’re lucky you failed the interview.

819
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,520
Or you’d have to

820
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,000
live here with me every day.

821
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,360
I’m afraid you’ll fall for me.

822
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,320
You’re really paranoid.

823
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,560
Not hitting you

824
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,240
is already a mercy.

825
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,200
What?

826
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,600
Don’t you invite your new neighbor in?

827
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,840
It’s late.

828
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,400
You better go home and go to sleep.

829
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,000
Or else, you’ll get old fast.

830
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:35,960
Your taste

831
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,920
will get worse as well.

832
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,120
Good night.

833
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,640
Excuse me.

834
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,080
Can I check out now?

835
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,120
Never mind.

836
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,360
There’s a long time ahead.

837
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,920
Let’s go home.

838
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,160
Do it! Do it!

839
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,600
Jiang Jun.

840
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,840
Close your eyes. Take deep breath.

841
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,040
Inhale.

842
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,000
Exhale.

843
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,400
Don’t cry.

844
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,440
Don’t cry.

845
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,240
Inhale.

846
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,040
Exhale.

847
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,160
Inhale.

848
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:00,960
Exhale.

849
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,480
Jiang Jun told me that

850
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,400
you asked others to bully her

851
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,000
to make money from me. Right?

852
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,520
Sir. Do you know philosophy?

853
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,560
Philosophy?

854
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:13,960
A thing or two.

855
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,760
What?

856
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,320
The fundamental cause of a thing
is not external but internal.

857
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,000
Right?

858
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,120
Yes.

859
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,720
To prevent her from crying,

860
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,280
the fundamental way

861
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,400
is to strengthen her mental capacity.

862
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,960
When she gets tough,

863
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,920
she won’t cry anymore.

864
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,120
I did ask others to bully her.

865
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,400
The purpose is not

866
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,120
to make her cry,

867
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,200
but to strengthen her mental capacity.

868
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,680
I’m making her troubles

869
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,080
so as to make her tough.

870
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,680
I’m doing so

871
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,640
to make

872
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,400
every penny you paid me

873
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,960
worth it.

874
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,240
You did it right.

875
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,040
I misunderstood you.

876
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,920
Sir.

877
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,040
You haven’t paid me

878
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,360
last month’s salary.

879
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,160
You rascal.

880
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,840
Thank you, sir.
