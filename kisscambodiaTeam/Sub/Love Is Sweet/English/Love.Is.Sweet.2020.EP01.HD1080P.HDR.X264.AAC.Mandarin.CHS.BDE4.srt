00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 1

3
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,670
<i>Welcome
New Members</i>

4
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,010
Give me your spare button.

5
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,290
What do you use it for?

6
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,050
The Maya peoples have a saying

7
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,010
that if you wanna go back to a place,

8
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,370
bury a button there.

9
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,530
Does it work?

10
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,610
Of course.

11
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,890
The Maya peoples will bless you. Good Luck.

12
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,770
Thank you.

13
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,200
The button thing you told him,

14
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,050
was it true?

15
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,570
I was cheating him

16
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,730
to encourage him.

17
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,530
Hello.

18
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,090
I’m Shen Xin,
I was after you in the last interview.

19
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,370
I’m Jiang Jun.

20
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,410
In the recruitment season every year,

21
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,170
MH will get tens of thousands of resumes.

22
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,770
You’ve entered the fourth round,

23
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,970
which means you’ve surpassed

24
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,930
ninety-nine percent of your competitors.

25
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,930
But

26
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,490
this isn’t the end.

27
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,200
I have a question for you.

28
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,050
If you join MH in the future,

29
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,850
what kind of person will you be?

30
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,170
Soros once said that

31
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,650
the financial world was volatile and chaotic.

32
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,010
If we regard the financial market

33
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,610
as part

34
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,610
of a mathematical formula,

35
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,250
it won’t work.

36
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,570
Thus,

37
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,290
math cannot control the financial market.

38
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,730
Psychology is

39
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,290
the key to market control.

40
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,130
Time up. Next.

41
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,450
Well... Sorry.

42
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,930
I... I haven’t finished.

43
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,330
MH is the top investment banking department

44
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,730
of a Shanghai securities dealer,

45
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,570
managing assets valuing tens of billions of yuan.

46
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,810
Our time is too valuable for you

47
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,170
to waste.

48
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,250
Fifteen seconds for each person. Next.

49
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,810
The financial world is like a zoo.

50
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,010
I wanna be a breeder-like investor,

51
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,250
whipping the strong

52
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,610
and taming the weak.

53
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,410
Success is defined as defeating your opponents.

54
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,530
To succeed,

55
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,810
you should find their loopholes.

56
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,570
Find the loopholes and use them,

57
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,970
like Sherlock Holmes did.

58
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,570
That’s why I want to

59
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,890
be an investor like Sherlock Holmes.

60
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,970
The workplace should be filled
with peace and respect,

61
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,050
but not slaughtering.

62
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,290
I wanna be the Mo-tse of MH.

63
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,890
Love, deny wars. Respect talents and seniors.

64
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,050
For the interest of all.

65
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,810
To be MH’s Mo-tse?

66
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,970
What a great mind.

67
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,610
Investment banking is a playground
for aspirants,

68
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,730
for Su Qin and Zhang Yi, not Mo-tse.

69
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,370
Be careful.

70
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,930
I

71
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,330
don’t like guys without ambition.

72
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,410
You don’t look like elite.

73
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,370
But

74
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,690
you’re the first one to benefit

75
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,970
from MH’s diverse recruitment policies.

76
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,490
Congratulations.

77
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,050
You can attend the interview at 2 p.m.

78
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,050
By the way,

79
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,210
don’t be proud.

80
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,450
The interviewer in the afternoon will be

81
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,730
the Undefeated Warrior of MH.

82
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,170
He

83
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,410
will be much stricter than me.

84
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,530
Currently,

85
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,170
600 million yuan of the 800 million yuan

86
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,650
raised by GE for Hualun Culture Group
through bond issuance

87
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,170
has been spent.

88
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,810
If they buy 2% more of stake,

89
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,450
they’ll have

90
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,330
absolute control over VTV.

91
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,770
It’s time to act, isn’t it?

92
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,170
Be quiet. Just wait.

93
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,010
Hey, boss. Still waiting?

94
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,210
You are noisy.

95
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,890
Mr. Du, with two points more,

96
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,490
we’ll be able to help Hualun Culture hold VTV

97
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,130
and complete the acquisition.

98
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,200
MH won’t be able to fight back

99
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,530
in this surprising operation.

100
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,590
<i>Du Lei Executive Director of
GE Securities Investment Banking Department</i>

101
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,370
Still two points short after such a long time.
<i>Du Lei Executive Director of
GE Securities Investment Banking Department</i>

102
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,710
Are you happy?
<i>Du Lei Executive Director of
GE Securities Investment Banking Department</i>

103
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,370
We’ll work harder.

104
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,250
Go to tell Mr. Yuan.

105
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,050
Mr. Yuan. One point to go.

106
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,170
Do it.

107
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,310
<i>VTV (Suspension)</i>

108
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,410
Mr. Du. Bad news.

109
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,930
VTV suddenly suspended trading

110
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,170
and announced follow-on offering.

111
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,570
The stakes bought by Hualun

112
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,970
are diluted.

113
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,410
How could it be?

114
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,770
VTV’s CEO just resigned.

115
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,170
The board is in a mess.

116
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,890
How could they have the follow-on offering?

117
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,770
Mr. Du.

118
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,570
There must be another way out.

119
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:23,770
No bother.

120
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,810
We’ve been tricked.

121
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,810
You may all leave.

122
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,370
I don’t wanna see you tomorrow.

123
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,850
OK.

124
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,570
It’s done!

125
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,050
You and Chairman of VTV

126
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,930
made a great show.

127
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,490
Some pretended quarreling in the board,
<i>Yuan Shuai Executive Director of
MH Securities Investment Banking Department</i>

128
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,770
and some resigned.
<i>Yuan Shuai Executive Director of
MH Securities Investment Banking Department</i>

129
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,610
Not only GE was led by the nose,
<i>Yuan Shuai Executive Director of
MH Securities Investment Banking Department</i>

130
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,250
but also the whole industry was cheated by you.
<i>Yuan Shuai Executive Director of
MH Securities Investment Banking Department</i>

131
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,290
Using strategies is the best.

132
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,050
Using social connections is mediocre.

133
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,410
Attacking the city

134
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,850
is the worst.

135
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,730
You have my admiration for your strategy.

136
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,810
The well-known Mr. Du Lei

137
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,490
was defeated by your childlike plan,

138
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,650
Flip-in Poison Pill.

139
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,850
I assume he must be going crazy.

140
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,690
That makes sense.

141
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,450
I know him.

142
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,610
The more you want to win,

143
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,690
the more likely you’ll lose sense.

144
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,050
Boss.

145
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,090
Why are you still sleeping?

146
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,130
I haven’t finished my report.

147
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,850
Su Chang.

148
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,610
Please let me go.

149
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,570
Last night, for Zhai’s seat in the board,

150
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,810
I helped him with the drinking all night.

151
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,370
I still have a headache now.

152
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,490
Be good.

153
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,450
Another new suit?

154
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,010
Or?

155
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,530
Last night, Zhai vomited all over me.

156
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,730
You really take the workplace and the office

157
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,490
as your show stage?

158
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,210
This is my dress for

159
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,570
BUI Investment Bank Alliance
Cocktail Party tonight.

160
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,170
Any advice?

161
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,250
Nice dress.

162
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,490
You’re overweight somewhat.

163
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,410
I’ll kill you.

164
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,650
Do it.

165
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,210
Ding Tian, the pharmaceutical tycoon

166
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,610
and the richest French-Chinese man, will be there.

167
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,570
Would you be my male partner?

168
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,810
What do you think?

169
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:48,970
Never mind.

170
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,930
I’ve been used to your rejection.

171
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,810
He’ll only stay in Shanghai for one day.

172
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,330
In the cocktail party, there must be

173
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,130
a lot of people surrounding him.

174
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,930
But I can tell you a secret

175
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,970
to draw his attention for sure.

176
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,570
What is it?

177
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,650
When Ding Tian’s wife and Ding Tian were young,

178
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,970
they worked in African Medical Aid Team.

179
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,850
I wrote his wife’s Arabic name

180
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,290
on your back.

181
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,370
I’m sure you’ll get his attention.

182
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,650
What a wild trick.

183
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,490
It’s not in his public information at all.

184
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,770
I did donation for African Medical Aid Team

185
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,650
on behalf of MH half a year ago.

186
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,810
Tell him when you’re there.

187
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,210
The starting pistol hasn’t fired,

188
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,890

Are you OK?

206
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,810
Nothing.

207

Don’t play cool in front me.

It’ll be the fifth and final interview

you’re already elite.

224
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,370
You’re a top student in economics,

225
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,410
and also the only postgraduate in our dorm.

226
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,410

Rest assured. I’ll do my best.

Bye.

234
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,210
There’s big news
in Hong Kong stock market two days ago.

235
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,450
Shimao Technology planned to acquire
Yangsheng Power

236
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,850
and quoted.

237
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,490
You guys may analyze

238
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,610
whether MH should buy

239
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,650
Yangsheng Power’s stocks now.

240
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,210
I think we should.

241
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,490
Yangsheng Power’s stock price is

242
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,570
35 Hong Kong dollars now.

243
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,250
After the merger, it’s conservatively estimated

244
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,130
to rise by 17 percent.

245
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:46,970
Mere three million shares

246
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,570
will give us great influence in the market.

247
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,610
After the merger,

248
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,210
Ma Yuke, Shimao Technology’s major shareholder,

249
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,650
will become Yangsheng Power’s

250
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,530
new chairman.

251
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,050
He’s an investment master.

252
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,170
If we buy now,

253
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,410
the annual profit per share will exceed

254
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,490
442 Hong Kong dollars.

255
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,050
I don’t think this deal will succeed.

256
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,970
Yangsheng Power has declined
for 3 consecutive years,

257
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,050
yet the leadership’s wage doubled.

258
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,970
Ma Yuke is crafty.

259
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,130
He won’t be optimistic about Yangsheng Power.

260
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,090
If he isn’t optimistic about Yangsheng Power,

261
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,330
why would he acquire it for Shimao Technology?

262
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,130
Ma Yuke is Shimao Technology’s shareholder.

263
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,690
His ex-wife had five percent stake

264
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,810
in Yangsheng Power.

265
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,650
I assume his quote on behalf of Shimao

266
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,210
is just a make-believe shot.

267
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,090
He’s trying to inflate its share price.

268
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,610
Any transaction,

269
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,650
and any investment comes with risk.

270
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,770
Profit and risk are like twin brothers.

271
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,490
We need wolf-like recruits,

272
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,730
not sheep.

273
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,410
So, the principle of today’s interview is,

274
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,610
wolves will stay,

275
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,450
and sheep will leave.

A woman who cannot even shed tears

315
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,450
can never survive in this Colosseum.

316
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,530

But, will you pay me 10 yuan

378
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,210
every month in the future?

379
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,410
Of course.

380
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,650
Rest assured, sir.

381
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,050
You can count on me.

382
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,890
Every penny you pay me

383
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,970
will be worthy.

384
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,730
Deal.

385
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,250
Deal.

386
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,650
What did you say?

387
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,410
The interviewer today was the boy

388
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,490
who lived opposite your home

389
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,250
and was bribed by your father to protect you?

390
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,050
I can recognize him even if he turns into ashes.

391
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,050
Seriously?

392
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,410
How could your childhood guardian

393
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,250
reject you?

394
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,050
He wasn’t my guardian.

395
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,210
He’s a thug.

396
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,890
My dad paid him for nothing.

397
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,970
To earn pocket money from my dad,

398
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,730
he asked others to bully me in the dark.

399
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,970
I was too timid

400
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,650
to fight back.

401
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,170
From elementary school to high school,

402
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,050
he’d been a nightmare to me.

403
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,010
What happened then?

404
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,050
Then he did something

405
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,930
that made me hate him forever.

406
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,810
My father transferred me to another school.

407
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,770
If that’s the case,

408
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,770
he’s supposed to feel guilty to you.

409
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,490
Why did he drive you out of MH?

410
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,130
Babe.

411
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,850
Will a hungry wolf feel sorry

412
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,210
for a sheep in his belly?

413
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,650
It’s OK if I’m rejected for incompetence.

414
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,330
I swear there was no problem with my interview.

415
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,530
I could absolutely pass it.

416
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,810
He did it on purpose.

417
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,050
I won’t let it go.

418
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,730
Who is it?

419
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,930
No idea.

420
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,870
<i>Hello I’m YS</i>

421
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,190
<i>Added</i>

422
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:56,030
<i>Jiang Jun has accepted your request</i>

423
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,570
You’re...?

424
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,570
Yuan Shuai.

425
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,890
I am Yuan Shuai.

426
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,170
Is he nuts? He added me on WeChat!

427
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,330
Today I rejected you for your own good.

428
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,810
A smart guy

429
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,530
should do things properly in a proper position.

430
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:36,730
You’re lucky.

431
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,330
A company needs a director assistant,

432
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,770
annual salary at least 300,000 yuan,

433
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,970
and huge chance for promotion.

434
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,770
I can recommend you there.

435
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:53,550
<i>You’re not her friend yet.
Send a friend invitation for verification first</i>

436
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,650
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

437
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,650
I will get into MH in an upright way.

438
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,410
I’ll let him know

439
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,610
he can never determine others’ fate.

440
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:05,730
Exactly.

441
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,650
Where there’s oppression, there’s resistance.

442
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,810
Jiang Jun. I support you.

443
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,970
Cheers.

444
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,330
But we’re nobody.

445
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,650
How should we resist?

446
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,090
My connection is no joke.

447
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,650
I asked our top model’s

448
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,130
sister’s pursuer’s fellow’s

449
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,130
classmate’s brother’s neighbor for help.

450
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,690
The Mr. Wang got us the tickets to BUI.

451
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,330
I also heard that

452
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,570
the one who has been recuperating,

453
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,450
namely Vice President of MH,

454
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,930
manager of the Investment Banking Department,

455
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,810
Lin Taimo,

456
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,690
would also be there.

457
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,930
He’d be there, too!

458
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,970
You admire him most, don’t you?

459
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,130
Think about it.

460
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,410
In case that you meet him

461
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,130
and tell him about the internal unfair business,

462
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,010
then...

463
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,130
Then what?

464
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,450
Make a scene

465
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,770
and complain that I was bullied by Yuan Shuai?

466
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,530
Uh-huh.

467
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,610
No way.

468
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,410
Many people are rejected every year.

469
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,650
Even if I meet Lin Taimo,

470
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,850
he cannot remember me. What to say?

471
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,330
Trust me.

472
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,610
Just

473
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,490
get dressed up for the party.

474
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,770
You can count on me

475
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,450
for the rest.

476
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,350
<i>INVITATION</i>

477
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,550
<i>Welcome
BUI Investment Bank Alliance Cocktail Party</i>

478
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,570
Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

479
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,170
Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

480
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,810
You lost to Director Yuan of MH again.

481
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,650
Do you have any story to share with us?

482
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,250
Sorry, everyone.

483
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,530
We’re just here for the party.

484
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,970
Follow GE’s official media for more news,

485
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,290
as well as press conference.

486
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,450
Mr. Ling. You had worked for MH

487
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,290
before you joined GE.

488
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,170
Does this loss mean

489
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,450
there’s still disparity between the strength

490
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,530
of two companies?

491
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,690
Investment banking is a battlefield.

492
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,490
It’s common whether win or lose.

493
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,370
We’ve been keeping a friendly partnership

494
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,850
with MH.

495
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,530
We’re rivals but also friends.

496
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,850
A business case won’t affect

497
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,650
the goal of win-win cooperation.

498
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,370
Mr. Du. Because of you,

499
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,010
Hualun Culture lost nearly one billion yuan.

500
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,170
Shouldn’t you be responsible

501
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,690
for such a failure?

502
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,370
One billion?

503
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,530
Do you have any basis to say that?

504
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,170
We didn’t get the controlling interest,

505
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,410
but we still hold VTV’s stocks.

506
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,170
Excuse me.

507
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,970
Ms. Ling, could you say something?

508
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,650
Sorry.

509
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,890
Never mind.

510
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,690
Mr. Fan.

511
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,930
MH beat the rival GE again.

512
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,690
Do you have anything to say?

513
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,250
MH never meant to beat anyone.

514
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,330
Our principle is

515
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,130
to benefit our clients the most,

516
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,810
preventing the market and companies

517
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,690
suffering from unscrupulous capitals.

518
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,410
Mr. Yuan.

519
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,410
This morning VTV abruptly suspended trading
for follow-on offering,

520
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,890
-defeating Hualun’s malicious acquisition.
-Demon.

521
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,970
It’s said that you were behind all this.

522
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,370
Do you have anything to say about that?

523
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,490
Keep going

524
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,530
in a low profile.

525
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,450
I heard that it’s Director Du Lei of GE

526
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,650
who helped Hualun with the acquisition.

527
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,570
He’s been your old rival.

528
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,010
This time you defeated him again.

529
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,170
Do you have anything to say to him?

530
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,170
He may work harder.

531
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,210
Sure.

532
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,570
Mr. Fan. What’s the new plan for MH this year?

533
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,130
Could you tell us something about it?

534
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,930
-We have a huge acquisition plan.
-I won.

535
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,130
It’s still in progress.

536
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,850
If there’s any news,

537
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,290
we’ll tell you as soon as possible.

538
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,450
Alright?

539
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,890
Just ignore him.

540
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,930
You’ll win back.

541
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,570
Got it.

542
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,690
The business goes well this year.

543
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,290
The company is also doing very well.

544
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,290
So I hope we can keep up the good work

545
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,130
and do better.

546
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,250
Buddy.

547
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,290
Is that Yuan Shuai?

548
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,810
Compared with this year...

549
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:33,850
Excuse me.

550
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,810
Sure.

551
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,330
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

552
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,690
Thanks.

553
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,090
Yuan Shuai. Why didn’t you reply my message?

554
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,300
Is she crazy?

555
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,050
Who are you?

556
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,250
You don’t love me anymore, do you?

557
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:17,890
Hey.

558
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,690
Do I know you?

559
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,610
What the hell are you talking about?

560
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,090
You said you didn’t know me?

561
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,690
Did you hear that?

562
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,050
He’s pretending that he doesn’t know me.

563
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,330
You’re pretending you don’t know me.

564
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,810
Back then you called me your sweetheart,

565
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,130
your baby.

566
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,850
Now you say you don’t know me?

567
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,130
Is it true?

568
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,490
I’ve never heard

569
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,810
that Yuan Shuai had a girlfriend.

570
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,170
You bastard.

571
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,210
You scumbag abandoning your wife and kid.

572
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,170
Lady.

573
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,050
You mean I’m your boyfriend, right?

574
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,130
OK.

575
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,570
Let me ask you.

576
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,720
Where do I live?

577
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,850
When is my birthday?

578
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,530
What’s my phone number?

579
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,720
Do you know?

580
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,410
Alright.

581
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,970
Since we’re talking about girlfriend,

582
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:25,810
my girlfriend

583
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,280
happens to be here today.

584
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,130
Here?

585
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,570
Who’s his girlfriend?

586
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,240
-Who?
-Who?

587
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,850
Who is it?

588
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,130
-Who?
-Who?

589
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,680
My girlfriend is right here.

590
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,250
His girlfriend?

591
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:08,810
Miss.

592
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,770
Don’t run! Stop!

593
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,610
What a bad day!

594
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,610
Why did you fool me over and over?

595
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,050
I didn’t meet Lin Taimo,

596
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,130
yet left in such a disgrace.

597
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,570
Is this man a demon?

598
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,130
Are you talking about me, Crying Girl?

599
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,130
How do you know I’m here?

600
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,210
You used to go to high places

601
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,890
when you were upset.

602
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,410
It’s been so many years.

603
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,010
You’re still so predictable.

604
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,450
Yeah.

605
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,890
You can see through the mind.

606
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,210
Take a guess then.

607
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,610
What do I want to do now?

608
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,290
You got a terrible actress,

609
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,850
yet she’s your friend.

610
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,890
I humiliated her in public.

611
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,530
Now you must want to yell at me,

612
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,050
but you don’t know how to put it.

613
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,130
It’s OK.

614
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,570
Just yell at me if you want.

615
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,970
Congratulations, but you’re wrong.

616
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,010
You’re not worthy of my anger.

617
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,890
Say it.

618
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,250
Why did you drive me out of MH?

619
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,090
Watch your language.

620
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,490
You’ve never been inside MH.

621
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,850
My interview result was definitely

622
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,930
good enough to get me hired.

623
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:57,690
And as I know,

624
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,890
in the last five years,

625
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,650
MH hasn’t rejected any interviewee

626
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,010
in the final interview.

627
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,610
Congratulations, Ms. Jiang.

628
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,050
You set a precedent.

629
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,090
Isn’t it an honor?

630
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:12,970
Look closely,

631
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,730
you’re such a bastard.

632
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,290
Look more closely then.

633
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,530
Could a bastard be so handsome?

634
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,530
I’ll definitely get into MH.

635
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,250
You will definitely not.

636
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,370
Yuan Shuai. Even a sheep will bite.

637
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,690
Bite me then.

638
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,690
Do it.

639
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,650
Bite me.

640
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,850
Bite here.

641
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,490
I didn’t let you into MH

642
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,010
for your own good.

643
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,850
Take it as a lesson.

644
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,090
It’s not a loss.

645
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,650
For my own good? A lesson?

646
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,810
So far, the most terrible lesson in my life

647
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,730
is to trust you.

648
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,410
My father asked you to protect me.

649
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,210
But you,

650
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,170
you tried all means to bully me.

651
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,690
If not for you,

652
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,130
I wouldn’t have transferred to another school.

653
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,370
Now I still have nightmares.

654
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,610
Do you know that?

655
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,730
Dear teachers,
<i>My Chinese Heart Speech Competition</i>

656
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,610
classmates,
<i>My Chinese Heart Speech Competition</i>

657
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,770
the topic of my speech is
<i>My Chinese Heart Speech Competition</i>

658
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,530
My Chinese Heart.

659
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,610
The Great Wall...

660
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,090
Can you do that?

661
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,970
Yeah. Get down if you can’t.

662
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,010
Don’t waste our time.

663
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,250
-Get down!
-Get down!

664
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,490
What are you doing?

665
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,610
-Get down!
-Get down!

666
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,210
Get down!

667
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,510
<i>My Chinese Heart</i>

668
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,090
Jiang Jun!

669
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:52,890
Jiang Jun!

670
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,450
Jiang Jun!

671
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,890
Don’t cry.

672
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,410
You didn’t lose your speech script.

673
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,650
Look.

674
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,250
I have your script.

675
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,370
It wasn’t lost.

676
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,490
Look.

677
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,370
It’s...it’s you. You...

678
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,130
Wake up. Jiang Jun!

679
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,370
From then on, I had been too ashamed

680
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,690
to stay at Qingcheng High School.

681
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:16,930
I had to transfer to another school.

682
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,930
I can’t believe I’d meet you again

683
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,490
after so many years.

684
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,770
You should know

685
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,770
in the circle of investment banking,

686
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,650
females account for less than 20 percent.

687
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,970
This job requires capability, endurance,

688
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,170
and stress resistance.

689
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,690
Even many men can’t do it.

690
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,290
Not to mention you.

691
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,730
You’re even allergic to tears.

692
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,330
What made you exclude me

693
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,130
from the 20 percent?

694
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,810
Since they can do it, why can’t I?

695
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,930
Whatever you say,

696
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,330
I won’t escape anymore.

697
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,850
Let me tell you, Yuan Shuai.

698
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,850
I will get into MH.

699
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,890
What are you doing?

700
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:30,890
Don’t.

701
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,010
Don’t move.

702
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,410
Go back with me.

703
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,730
I have no time

704
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,810
to take you to hospital if you cry.

705
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,610
Be good.

706
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,370
Let me go, Yuan Shuai!

707
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,090
Let me go, Yuan Shuai!

708
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,090
Let me go!

709
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,370
Be good.

710
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,690
Yuan Shuai, let me go!

711
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,330
Let go of me!

712
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,250
Watch out!

713
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:21,890
Yuan Shuai and his girlfriend!

714
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,530
Here Yuan Shuai is!

715
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,370
Go! Go!

716
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,490
-Coming!
-Hurry.

717
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,200
Yuan Shuai, is she your girlfriend?

718
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,370
No photos!

719
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,650
Stop it!

720
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,530
Shoot again

721
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,290
and I’ll sue you for privacy violation!

722
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,170
Leave!

723
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,210
Jiang Jun!

724
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,170
Jiang Jun!

725
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,490
Jiang Jun!

726
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:45,890
Jiang Jun!

727
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:46,970
Jiang Jun!

728
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:39,970
Jiang Jun.

729
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,050
Yes?

730
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,450
I’ve made detailed statistics and analysis

731
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,850
of your responses to various emergencies

732
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,010
over the last one year.

733
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,210
I divide quarrels into nine levels,

734
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,250
school bullying into 6 categories and 18 types.

735
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,650
After the experiment of one year,

736
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:57,570
I find that

737
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,170
you can only bear argument-level conflict.

738
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,010
You’re absolutely defenseless

739
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,450
against various bullying in school.

740
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,010
Your resistance

741
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,890
against insects and invertebrates

742
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,490
has no improvement at all.

743
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,090
Jiang Jun.

744
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,330
Jiang Jun.

745
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:13,730
Hey.

746
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,770
You have to listen to me.

747
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,810
You like drawing.

748
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,810
But look at these.

749
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,570
You only draw

750
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,730
little rabbits, sheep, puppies,

751
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,450
these weak and cute animals.

752
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,650
I suggest that

753
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,690
