Mr. Luo.

4
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,400
Yuan Shuai, something happened

5
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,760
with our people in Hong Kong Exchange.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,560
I need you to go to Hong Kong with me.

7
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
Okay, got it.

8
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,120
No problem

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,720
Hello?

10
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,680
Ms. Qiao, please recheck all

11
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,760
the financial data of Wanxing for me,

12
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,600
especially the estimated ROE.

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,080
I need to bring it to Hong Kong with Mr. Luo.

14
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,320
Okay!

15
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,470
Boss.

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,120
Su Chang, collect all

17
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,680
the IPO data that Wanxing requires.

18
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
I have an urgent business trip to Hong Kong.

19
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,000
And confirm the flight information

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,200
with Mr. Luo’s secretary.

21
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,080
Okay, I’m on it.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,880
Yuan Shuai?

23
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
I need to go on a business trip.

24
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,240
I’m afraid

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
I can’t spend the New Year with you.

26
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,880
It’s alright.

27
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,880
We can do video chats.

28
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,360
Take good care of yourself.

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
I don’t wanna leave you.

30
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
Me neither.

31
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,660
It’s so dusty!

32
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
What?

33
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,790
You’ve already started cleaning
for the New Year?

34
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,760
Well, please leave us.

35
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,360
It’s clean now. I’m leaving!

36
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,440
Pay attention to these issues
when you are there.

37
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,800
The CSRC will question about them.

38
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,040
Okay.

39
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,800
Um… I… I’ll review it on the way.

40
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,880
Thanks.

41
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,320
The drape is closed during business hours.

42
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,520
Are you that eager to let others know

43
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,800
what’s going on with you two?

44
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
Can’t you just pretend that you see nothing?

45
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
It’s just a kind reminder!

46
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,360
You should keep the drape

47
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,550
and the door open.

48
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,480
Office gossip

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,240
can be cruel!

50
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,200

Has Ms. Qiao found out about us?

53
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,760
Yes.

54

55
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,520
I forgot to tell you.

56
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,960
I made myself a fool again, didn’t I?

57
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,920
It’s my fault.

58
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,480
Are you kidding?

59
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,280
You are always right!

60
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,000
Hi, Ms. Qiao.

61
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,320
I just

62
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,200
don’t understand

63
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,640
what Yuan Shuai likes you about.

64
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,280
I think you should

65
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,480
ask Mr. Yuan this question.

66
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,920
Don’t pretend in front of me.

67
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,680
So, what are you getting at, Ms. Qiao?

68
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,920
I found out about you two by accident.

69
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,920
Hadn’t Yuan Shuai stopped me,

70
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,760
I would’ve already reported your relationship

71
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,000
to the company.

72
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,360
When… When was that?

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,720
Although MH doesn’t put it in writing

74
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,160
that office romance is forbidden,

75
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,600
you should know

76
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,680
that once your relationship is exposed,

77
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
you will be the one in trouble.

78
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,040
Yes. I know that.

79
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,000
Thank you for your reminder

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,280
and your understanding.

81
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
There’s something else I need you to know.

82
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
I think you can see

83
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,600
that I like Yuan Shuai.

84
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,200
Yes, I know.

85
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,040
You appeared in his life first.

86
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,880
I can’t compare to that.

87
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
But no one knows who’ll get the last laugh

88

89
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
If you don’t watch him well,

90
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,550
or fight with him over petty things,

91
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,640
I will

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,680
take the opportunity and steal him from you.

93
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,920
Okay, Ms. Qiao.

94
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
I heard you.

95
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,600
So she was just trying to be a peacemaker!

96
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,120
Don’t even think about stealing him!

-What happened to him?

206
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,520
Was he ever like this before?

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,280
Are you a doctor?

208
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Could you help him?

I’m not a doctor. I don’t know how to help him.

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,400
Hold on. Let me call an ambulance for him!

what would you do if something like this

232
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,520
happened to you?

233
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,560
It’d be too late to regret

234
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,920
that you didn’t

235
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,960
confess your love earlier

236
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,920

270
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,400
There are no problems with

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,520
the West World’s matching system..

272
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,000
What about the one-percent match?

273
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,720
Easy.

274
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
One percent means

275
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,240
it’s completely impossible

276
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,840
because they’re totally inappropriate
for each other.

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,160

278
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,000
I got the time wrong.

I can’t go back now.

281
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,600

282
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,040
of applying your mask,

283
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,720
so I’m here to keep you company for a while.

284
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,680
Have you eaten?

285
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,920
I ordered a lot.

286
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,240
They are all your favorite.

287
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,600

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,560
Why did you order my favorite dishes?

289
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,760
Tastes good!

290
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,240
I’ll order it again.

291
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,280
I don’t know.

292
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,720
I remember you once said

293
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,720
there should be a sense of ritual in life.

294
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,640
So I ordered again

295
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,880
the dishes that represent

296
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,600
a sense of ritual.

297
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Only this much?

So, what’s up?

301
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,920
She wants to know

302
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,080
if you told anybody about what happened before.

303
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,280
That’s why you are here?

304
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,440
I’ve hidden in Suzhou

305
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
for five years.

306
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,640
She still doesn’t trust me?

307
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,720
It’s not that she doesn’t trust you.

308
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,800
It’s just that somebody

309
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,040
has been investigating that thing.

310
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,120
So,

311
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,720
she sent me here to meet you

312
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,920
and ask you

313
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,080
if you left any trace

314
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,880
or clue about

315
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,480
that incident.

316
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Let me tell you.

317
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,680
I deleted the chatting history

318
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,520
right in front of her!

319
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,600
What more does she want from me?

320
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,160
What chatting history?

321
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,320
Just some regular chatting history.

322
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,520
You don’t know about that?

323
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,560
Of course, I do.

324
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,560
You deleted it in front of her.

325
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,520
But…

326
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,120
Linda didn’t send you here, did she?

327
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,640
Tell me,

328
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,800
what are you really here for?

329
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,640
Just stop

330
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,800
lying to me.

331
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,140

332
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,140
There was no chatting history at all.

380
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,880
When I first met you,

381
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,040
I liked you very, very much.

382
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,040
I…

383
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,720
I…

384
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,840
Although I know

385
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,920
I may not be your 100% girl,

386
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,200
and I may just be the 1%,

387
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,160
I’m willing to change for you.

388
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,240
And I’ll

389
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,600
do my best

390
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,440
to be your 100% girl.

391
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,880
Xiaochuan.

392
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,600
I like you!

393
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,080
But…

394
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,000
Why do you like me?

395
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,520
Why…

396
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Why wouldn’t I like you?

397
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,960
You just said it yourself.

398
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,080
We have only 1% match.

399
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,840
It’s impossible for us to be together.

400
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,600
But how do you know without trying?

401
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Look at me.

402
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
Take a close look at me.

403
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,200
Is there any possibility?

404
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,240
Even just a little bit!

405
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,080
I don’t want to have any regret.

406
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,560
I…

407
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,240
I really don’t know!

408
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,200
Hello?

409
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,520
Hello? This is Cao Heng.

410
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,760
I thought I told you not to call me again.

411
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,120
Let me ask you.

412
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,000
Did you send your brother to see me?

413
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,800
Du?

414
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,840
I didn’t.

415
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,160
Just as I thought!

416
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
Your brother came to meet me in your name

417
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,800
and tried to get me talk.

418
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,920
I see.

419
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,720
I’ll take care of it.

420
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,840
That’s all for now.

421
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,040
Okay.

422
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,800
Hello? It’s me.

423
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,160
Jiang Yaoming’s daughter

424
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,880
now works in MH.

425
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,400
But,

426
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,040
sir, I booked your car!

427
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,320
The flight was only delayed

428
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,080
for 20 minutes.

429
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,760
How could you just cancel my appointment?

430
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,480
I had no choice.

431
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,160
My wife asked me to go home.

432
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,240
Miss,

433
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,680
I suggest you find a hotel nearby.

434
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,360
I can even return you 50 yuan more.

435
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,320
Or else,

436
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,280
you just need to figure out something yourself.

437
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,560
How am I supposed to…

438
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,320
If I didn’t come along with you,

439
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,520
you’d just sit in

440
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,440
a stranger’s car and go home?

441
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,800
It’s a legitimate transportation platform.

442
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,040
I would be safe.

443
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,000
Safe?

444
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,440
And now you are stood up

445
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,560
in the middle of the night!

446
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,480
Were you out of your mind?

447
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,040
Don’t you watch the news?

448
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Why are you yelling at me?

449
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,520
I’m concerned about you!

450
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,760
But I got a ticket for the latest flight

451
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,760
only because I wanted to wait for you to return!

452
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,400
Alright. I’ll take care of this.

453
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,800
Hello? Mom.

454
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,160
The flight was delayed.

455
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,440
I might not be able to go back tonight.

456
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,160
Don’t wait up. Just go to bed.

457
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,760
I’ll be back as soon as possible.

458
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,400
Hello? Zhu,

459
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,680
I’m in Jiangcheng City right now.

460
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,040
Could you please send a car to pick me up?

461
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,720
Don’t worry.

462
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,760
I’m with my colleague.

463
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,360
I’ll be fine.

464
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,200
Okay. Thanks.

465
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,200
I’m hanging up.

466
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Don’t move.

467
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,000
Just go ahead and be mad.

468
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,480
I’m just keeping myself warm.

469
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,160
Let’s mind our own business.

470
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,480
<i>FamilyMart</i>

471
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,440
Hi, welcome!

472
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Excuse me, sir. What are you looking at?

473
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,120
Oh, I’ll look around a little.

474
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,120
<i>Personality Test IQ Test EQ Test</i>

475
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,760
<i>A Big Yellow Pear</i>

476
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,040
Sir, are you okay?

477
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,200
Sir?

478
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,320
He drank half of the bottle!
No wonder he’s drunk like this!

479
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,070
Wealth,

480
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,430
you also feel sorry for me, don’t you?

481
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,680
Thank you.

482
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,030
Actually, on my way back,

483
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,990
I really thought about the worst case scenario.

484
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,590
But I didn’t expect

485
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,440
that I’d scare him away.

486
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,320
I guess no matter how hard I try,

487
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,840
I’ll still be a 1% girl for him.

488
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,080
There’s no way that he’d like me.

489
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,720
Li Xiaochuan,

490
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,560
I left.

491
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,680
I won’t bother you again.

492
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,160
By the way,

493
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,520
I’ll give the shares back to you.

494
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Save them for the girl who’s perfect for you.

495
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,080
Bye.

496
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,640
You know what?

497
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,960
For all these years,

498
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,800
this place hasn’t changed a bit.

499
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,560
Listen!

500
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,520
You’d better behave well

501
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,080
when you see my mom later.

502
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,560
Just rest assured!

503
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,800
I’ve laid a good foundation when I was little.

504
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,360
You know what?

505
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,640
With my

506
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,640
handsome look

507
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,720
and my charisma,

508
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,160
your mom will like me very much

509
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,760
when she sees me!

510
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,600
Hopefully!

511
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,320
Mom!

512
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,960
Happy New Year!

513
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,760
Happy New Year!

514
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,800
Jun!

515
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,880
You are back!

516
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,560
Let me take a look! Did you lose weight?

517
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,720
No.

518
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,760
Here, let’s go inside.

519
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,760
Mom.

520
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,200
I brought someone home.

521
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,080
Mrs. Jiang.

522
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,360
You are…

523
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,120
Mom.

524
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,320
He’s Yuan Shuai! Don’t you remember?

525
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,400
He’ll stay with us during the holiday.

526
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,160
Mrs. Jiang, I’m Yuan Shuai!

527
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,000
You mean you are Mr. Yuan’s son?

528
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,920
Oh my!

529
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
You’ve grown up into a fine young man!

530
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
Come on! Come inside!

531
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,120
-Here. Let’s go home!
-Okay.

532
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,160
Somebody just said that my mom

533
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,600
would like him very much.

534
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,280
Embarrassed?

535
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,960
It actually shows that your mom is not

536
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,160
a superficial person
who’s only into appearance.

537
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,280
You can’t get both ways!

538
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,280
There’s nothing wrong to be handsome!

539
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,920
Mrs. Jiang,

540
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,040
look.

541
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,560
I bought these especially for you.

542
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,640
Hope…

543
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,520
Hope you’ll like them.

544
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,600
Thank you so much!

545
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I feel so happy already

546
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
that you are here to see me.

547
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,720
You didn’t have to spend money

548
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,480
and buy me a gift.

549
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,680
It’s my pleasure!

550
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,320
Thank you, Yuanyuan.

551
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,160
You are welcome.

552
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,600
I haven’t seen you

553
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,360
for so many years

554
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,920
since your family moved.

555
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
And now,

556
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,840
you’ve become a handsome young man.

557
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,920
Mrs. Jiang,

558
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,200
you haven’t changed at all.

559
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,440
It’s been so many years,

560
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,240
but you are still as beautiful

561
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,600
and elegant as before!

562
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,360
You just look like

563
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,560
Jiang Jun’s elder sister!

564
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,720
You flattered me, Yuanyuan.

565
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,040
I’m old already.

566
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
No, you aren’t!

567
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,000
Jun,

568
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,360
how did you guys meet in Shanghai?

569
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,440
Did you say you were with a colleague

570
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,320
when you called?

571
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,400
Colleague?

572
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,200
Mrs. Jiang,

573
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,920
I am the colleague.

574
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,920
Here’s the thing.

575
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,320
One day,

576
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,080
Jiang Jun came to my company for an interview.

577
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,880
That’s how

578
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,800
we became co-workers.

579
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,480
Yes.

580
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,280
He’s actually my boss.

581
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,280
I thought you didn’t know that!

582
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,480
Really?

583
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,760
Yuanyuan, you are already a boss
at such a young age!

584
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
How outstanding!

585
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,280
You are young and capable!

586
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,160
You know what?

587
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,600
When you were little,

588
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,520
I always said to Jun’s father

589
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,040
that Yuanyuan would have

590
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,600
a promising future.

591
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,440
See?

592
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,720
I was right!

593
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,120
Yuanyuan, thank you.

594
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,120
I feel so relieved

595
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,920
that Jun has you in Shanghai.

596
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,680
It’s just that Jun’s father…

597
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,760
Mom! Mom.

598
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,920
Would you please cook something for us?

599
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,720
We haven’t eaten anything since last night.

600
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,400
We are starving!

601
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,960
Sure! Sure!

602
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,360
It’s New Year’s Day today,

603
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,440
and Yuanyuan is here.

604
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,600
I’ll cook a few more dishes.

605
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,320
You two take a rest first.

606
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,280
I’ll go to the grocery store.

607
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,200
I’ll be back soon.

608
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,680
Mrs. Jiang,

609
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,440
let me go with you.

610
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,520
No need.

611
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,960
Just take a rest at home.

612
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,040
I’ll be right back.

613
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,080
It’s okay! Let’s go!

614
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,040
Alright.

615
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,120
Then…

616
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,880
Go ahead, you guys. Be safe!

617
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,720
<i>Li Xiaochuan Sorry, I left.</i>

618
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,440
<i>Bye.</i>

619
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,960
<i>From: Li</i>

620
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,480
<i>West World</i>

621
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:24,920
<i>Love Be with You</i>

622
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,200
Mrs. Jiang,

623
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,960
we got so many ingredients.

624
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,960
I’ll cook

625
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,080
tonight. You can try my cooking.

626
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,280
You don’t have to. You are my guest!

627
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,920
Wanjun! Happy New Year!

628
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,960
-Cuiping, Shujuan.
-Happy New Year!

629
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,120
Who’s this young man?

630
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,800
How handsome!

631
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,960
He is!

632
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,400
He’s like a super star!

633
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,680
Isn’t he Jun’s boyfriend?

634
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,200
No.

635
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,400
Good! That’s good!

636
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,400
Good to know!

637
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,480
Cuiping, Shujuan.

638
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,720
Let me introduce.

639
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,320
He’s the son of one of my old neighbors.

640
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,280
His name is Yuanyuan.

641
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,360
Yuanyuan!

642
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,480
They are Cuiping and Shujuan.

643
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,920
We play mahjong together.

644
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,640
Nice to meet you. Happy New Year!

645
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,200
-Nice to meet you, too.
-Happy New Year!

646
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,440
Aunt Shujuan.

647
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,640
The coat you are wearing is really pretty.

648
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,000
You look quite elegant in it.

649
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,920
And it makes your skin look very fair!

650
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,120
Aunt Cuiping,

651
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,880
your hairstyle

652
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,640
is very popular this year.

653
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,040
It goes very well with your light makeup.

654
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,200
You look so great

655
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,200
and

656
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,080
young!

657
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,760
It’s the New Year.

658
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,400
Fresh look for a new year!

659
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,760
He’s such a sweet boy!

660
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,600
Tell me about it!

661
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,320
Your name is Yuanyuan, right?

662
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,680
I’d like to invite you to my home
when you are free.

663
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,520
Sure.

664
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,600
My daughter…

665
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,560
I also have a daughter!

666
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,400
Shujuan, Cuiping,

667
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,120
we need to go home and cook.

668
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,040
Let’s chat another time.

669
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,160
Let’s play mahjong then.

670
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,920
Yuanyuan, let’s go.

671
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,800
Okay! Okay!

672
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,720
Let’s play mahjong!

673
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,480
Let’s! It’s a deal!

674
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,040
Remember to visit me!

675
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,840
I have to go now.

676
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,680
Bye!

677
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,720
Bye! Bye!

678
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,560
Yuanyuan.

679
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,880
You and Jun are not…

680
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,320
What’s wrong, Mrs. Jiang?

681
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,360
Nothing!

682
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,640
Let’s go.

683
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,640
Okay.
