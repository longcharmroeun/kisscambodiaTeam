Yuan Shuai, you are here!

4
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,760
After taking

5
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,320
your advice, I think my song

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
sounds much better now.

7
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,800
Yuan Shuai, you are awesome.

8
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,720
Good to know

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,040
I thought it’d help you.

10
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,230
What’s wrong?

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,680
Can I borrow your phone?

12
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,760
Sure.

13
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,760
Yuan Shuai, I’ll go get ready now.

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,640
Okay.

15
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,320
Don’t turn around. He’s behind you.

16
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,040
Secretary Bai?

17
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Mr. Du!

18
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,320
What a small world!

19
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,160
You are here to drink?

20
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,840
Yes.

21
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,600
Good. Shall we have a drink together?

22
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,800
Of course.

23
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,600
Get me my reserved wine.

24
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,550
Okay.

25
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,520
Thanks.

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Mr. Du, are you here often?

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,320
Sometimes.

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,800
Here.

29
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,360
It’s Glenfiddich,

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,040
40 years whisky, isn’t it?

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
Secretary Bai, you are an expert.

32
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,520
I just know a little.

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,920
I should learn more

34
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,160
from you, Secretary Bai.

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,360
I’m flattered, Mr. Du.

36
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,360
But, I should thank you

37
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,600
for removing an eyesore

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,920
for our boss this time.

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,200
You are so welcome.

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,680
Mr. Lin’s enemy is my enemy.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
So, you mean

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,680
things are almost done by now.

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,440
Yuan Shuai has already left the country.

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,550
The upcoming MH Annual
Shareholders’ General Meeting

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,200
will announce the punishment for him.

46
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
He won’t be able to come back again.

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
Great.

48
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,360
Hello?

49
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,550
What?

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
Revise what?

51
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,920
Okay! Okay!

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,720
I see.

53
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Sorry.

54
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,640
It just hit me

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,240
that I still have a file to sign.

56
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
I have to go back now.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,840
I also need to go back to the company.

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,000
Shall we go together?

59
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,560
Sure.

60
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,520
Good.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,680
Mr. Lin,

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,840
according to your order,
I’ve watched him the whole day.

63
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,040
Everything looked normal.

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,760
And nothing suspicious happened
to his mailbox and call records.

65
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
Good.

66
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,400
Then watch him for another day.

67
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
I wanna see

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
if he really is obedient.

69
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,720

Mr. Jia,

78
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,560
why are you in such a good mood today,

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
inviting me to your home?

80
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,440
I asked you out today

81
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
because I have a friend who

82
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,960
wants to meet you.

How come you are here?

88
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,360
Since you know each other,

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,920
I don’t have to introduce anymore.

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,320
Miss Ling,

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,240
I’ve heard so much about you.

92
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,510
And today, we finally meet.

93
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
I thought you’d be insanely busy.

94
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,320
Turns out you’ve found another job.

95
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,120
After all, compared to you,

96
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,840
my business

97
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,040
is not even worth mentioning.

98
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,920

Please sit down.

100
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,080
I still have things to do.
You two go ahead and chat.

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,520
No problem, Mr. Jia.

102
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,880
Miss Ling, please sit.

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,320

You are right.

105
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,960
I have some documents.

106
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
I’m sure you’ll know why I’m here

I don’t quite get it.

Miss Ling, a smart lady like you

113
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,440
shouldn’t play a fool.

114
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,360

115
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,440
which document do you not get?

116
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,920
This

121
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,280
then let me explain to you.

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,760
I hope you can remind me.

126
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,240
Five years ago,

127
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,800
you noticed the brand value and market prospect

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
of Yixianqian,

129
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,710
so you wanted to take over this company.

130
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,400
You sent Cao Heng to run the errands for you.

131
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,480
But Jiang Yaoming’s rejection

132
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,660
made your acquisition so much harder.

133
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,880
Therefore,

134
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,960
you bought off Mr. Yin,

135
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
which caused a food quality issue

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,800
to Yixianqian

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,720
and the increase of reparation.

138
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,080
As the founder, Jiang Yaoming

139
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,520
had to sign the acquisition contract with C Group

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
for the livelihood of his employees.

After the contract was signed,

144
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,040
you gave Cao Heng some money

145
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,820
and kicked him out of Shanghai.

146
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,440
I really admire your ability

147
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,280
of making up stories.

148
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,240
But do you think

149
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,840
I will take the blame

150
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,640
just because of the story you made up?

151

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,920
I know

153
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,680
you didn’t do it alone.

154
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
You should know Lin Taimo very well.

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,280
He asked you

156
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,920
to take care of everything

157
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,600
because he wanted

158
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
a scapegoat.

159
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
From the viewpoint of law,

the punishments to a principal

161
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
and an accessory are different.

162
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,600
How will you choose?

163
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,620
It’s totally up to you.

164
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,210
Will you take full responsibility

165
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,520
for someone who used you,

166
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,280
and let the real murderer go unpunished?

167
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,680
Or will you choose to work with me,

168
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
catch the real murderer,

169
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,040
and let him be punished

170
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,400
in a way he should be?

171
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,920
Mr. Yuan,

172
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,760
with all that being said,

173
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
you just want me to testify against Lin Taimo.

174
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,490
After all,

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,360
it’s your best way to atone for your sin.

176
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,200
If you do so,

177
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,240
all Du Lei’s efforts will be worth it.

178
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,720
No matter what,

179
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
you made a mistake first.

180
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,720
By doing this,

181
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,240
we just hope

182
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
that you can correct your mistake soon.

183
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,880
By “we”, do you mean you and Du Lei?

184
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,080
There’s another thing

185
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,800
I wanna ask you, Miss Ling.

186
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,520
How did Jiang Yaoming

187
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,440
die exactly?

188
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I guess it was also related to you, right?

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,880
How did Jiang Yaoming
die of heart attack suddenly?

190
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,120
What happened before he died?

191
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
He only met you and Lin Taimo on that day.

192
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Why did his blood pressure suddenly rise?

193
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,640
And what made him

194
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,400
so angry that he

195
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,840
had a sudden death?

196
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,920
I’m sure you know it better than anybody else.

197
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,040
This is the signed contract of Jiangnan Flavor.

198
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
Miss Ling,

199
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,760
you made a great contribution this time.

200
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,880
We should celebrate

201
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,720
our victory.

202
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,000
Sir, you can’t go in!

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,320
Get out of my way!

204
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,800
-Sir!
-Get out of my way!

205
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,000
Sir! Sir! Sir!

206
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,720
Let me through!

207
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,040
Sir! You can’t go in! Sir!

208
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,320
Let go of him!

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,840
Leave us.

210
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,600
Yes, Mr. Lin.

211
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,960
Mr. Jiang, come here.

212
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,400
Let’s have some tea.

213
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,880
You bastard!

214
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
Jiang Yaoming!

215
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,960
I fully trusted you two,

216
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,350
but you set a trap for me!

217
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,880
You are both brutes!

218
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,960
Mr. Jiang,

219
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
it’s merrier to make money together.

220
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,790
Because of your stubbornness,

221
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,500
I had to use some tricks

222
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,430
to help you expand your business.

223
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,620
You are shameless!

224
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,490
What you did was the hostile takeover!

225
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,750
It was a business fraud!

226
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,560
Maybe.

227
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:09,960
But, Mr. Jiang,

228
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,520
you should know

229
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,200
that we’ve signed a contract.

230
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,320
Frankly speaking,

231
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,940
Jiangnan Flavor

232
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,480
is not yours anymore.

233
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
You are in no place to say that

234
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,080
to me at all!

235
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,880
I’m calling you Mr. Jiang

236
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,000
because I want to save your face!

237
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,560
Anyway,

238
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,920
you are the founder of Yixianqian.

239
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
You rejected me

240
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,800
because you wanted to maintain the fresh taste

241
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,880
and the original texture of the rice noodle.

242
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Then let me tell you clearly

243
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,760
that from now on,

244
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,320
Yixianqian will not only become an instant food,

245
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
but also contain preservatives

246
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,000
to extend the shelf life.

247
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,680
The junk food that you abhor

248
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,680
will appear right

249
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
in front of you from today on.

250
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,640
You’d better get ready for that.

251
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
You son of a bitch!

252
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,640
Mr. Jiang.

253
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,560
You’d better take good care.

254
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,680
It’s not over yet!

255
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,000
What’s that?

256
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
It dropped.

257
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,840
What are you doing?

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,080
Pills, pills!

259
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,080
Pills!

260
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
Pills!

261
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
Call an ambulance.

262
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,280
Hello.

263
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,440
Someone had a heart attack!

264
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,280
Please send an ambulance right now!

265
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,000
That’s what happened.

266
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,400
Jiang Yaoming

267
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,360
did die in front of me.

268
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,560
But my intention was to save him.

269
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,160
You two actually

270
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,740
watched a man

271
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,240
die right in front of you?!

272
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,480
It wasn’t my intention.

273
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,920
Back then, I…

274
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,880
Okay.

275
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,040
In that case,

276
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I hope you can

277
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,320
give me the proof of all interest exchanges

278
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,120
between you and Lin Taimo.

279
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,680
It will be answerable

280
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,280
for Jiang Yaoming’s death, too.

281
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,040
Since they are

282
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,080
looking into Jiangnan Flavor’s matter,

283
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,600
I suggest

284
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,920
you get rid of the shares

285
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,590
of C Group as soon as possible.

286
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,800
What?

287
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,400
You are worried that Yuan Shuai

288
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,830
will make trouble?

289
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,430
Yuan Shuai is not

290
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,920
a big threat to us for now.

291
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,830
But if he finds the evidence,

292
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,190
both of us

293
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,870
will be screwed.

294
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
No worry.

295
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,690
I’ve had someone watch him.

296
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,490
And I’ve got the goods on him, too.

297
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,520
His qualifications

298
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,040
and connections are

299
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,860
nowhere near ours.

300
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,000
He won’t be able to harm us.

301
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,520
But aren’t you worried

302
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,200
that someone is helping him?

303
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,040
You mean Fan Qichang?

304
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,400
Fan is simply an old fox.

305
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,720
Seeing his fair-haired boy

306
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,080
bear the blame and leave,

307
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,280
he’s been busy with protecting himself.

308
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,840
Plus, he had nothing

309
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,520
to do with this matter.

310
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,090
He wouldn’t get himself involved.

311
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:35,880
By the way,

312
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,680
what about that document?

313
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,240
Are you sure it’s safe?

314
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,960
The most dangerous place

315
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,230
is the safest.

316
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,160
The safest place?

317
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,680
Don’t worry.

318
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,200
Of course.

319
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,880
I’m relieved

320
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,360
hearing you say that.

321
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,920
Hello.

322
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,840
She told me

323
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,960
Lin Taimo said

324
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,870
“The most dangerous place is the safest”.

325
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,590
So the document shouldn’t be kept in his home.

326
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,280
It’s such an important document.

327
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,690
If he doesn’t keep it home,

328
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,160
it must be put in a place

329
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,200
where he can see it every day.

330
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
He has a safe in his office.

331
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,640
But I don’t know the combination.

332
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,600
Do you want to bet?

333
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,280
Mr. Du.

334
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,600
You are also here, Secretary Bai.

335
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,760
Want some coffee?

336
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,040
No, I’ll have some tea.

337
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,640
By the way,

338
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,040
when will you have time?

339
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
What’s up, Mr. Du?

340
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,520
You are such an expert in wine.

341
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,640
My friend happened to bring me
a few bottles of good wine.

342
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,250
Would you like to taste it when you are free?

343
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,760
I’m not that busy these days.

344
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
You can pick any day you want.

345
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,040
Then why don’t we just do it

346
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,960
today?

347
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,040
Today?

348
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,000
We’ll have the annual conference tomorrow morning.

349
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,680
I don’t think tonight is the best time.

350
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,320
As you know, tomorrow’s meeting

351
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,280
is just to give

352
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,680
the management an opportunity

353
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,000
to praise each other’s work.

354
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,800
It’s all for a show.

355
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,240
All we need to do

356
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,800
is to prepare the conference.

357
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,680
But…

358
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,800
Just relax.

359
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,000
I’m asking you to taste the wine.

360
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,480
I won’t get you drunk.

361
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,490
How about this?

362
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,560
If anything happens tomorrow,

363
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,300
I’ll take full responsibility for it.

364
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,600
Alright.

365
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,240
Since you insist,

366
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,090
I’m looking forward to your nice wine.

367
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,140
Okay. See you tonight.

368
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,790
See you then.

369
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,440
Sounds like you are having quite a good time.

370
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,080
Even in the mood for wine tasting.

371
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,700
Seeing that my opponent

372
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,220
is beaten down

373
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,940
and can’t even fight back,

374
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,860
I wanna celebrate for it.

375
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,300
Sure.

376
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,420
The annual conference tomorrow

377
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,020
is all about others’ merits and demerits.

378
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,620
It’s totally irrelevant to you.

379
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,860
But here’s a kind reminder.

380
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,140
Drunkenness could get you in trouble.

381
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,030
Thank you for reminding me.

382
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,540
Mr. Du, you prepared so much wine for me.

383
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,100
This one

384
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,660
should be a limited edition of LOUIS XIII.

385
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,660
This one

386
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,350
is the top-notch

387
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,800
Martell extra-old cognac.

388
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,640
And this one is Macallan Lalique,

389
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,400
65 years whisky.

390
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,840
It’s so rare to see.

391
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,960
Mr. Du, your collection is so impressive.

392
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,880
You are indeed an expert.

393
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,000
Now, let’s enjoy it today.

394
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,920
Okay.

395
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,760
Here.

396
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,040
Let me fill it for you.

397
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,800
Thank you, Mr. Du.

398
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,560
You really can drink.

399
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,520
Thank you.

400
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,680
Waiter.

401
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,080
He’s drunk.

402
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,200
Find a hotel nearby and send him there.

403
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,110
Thanks.

404
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,040
Dear shareholders,

405
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,080
ladies

406
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,240
and gentlemen,

407
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,280
welcome

408
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,120
to the annual conference

409
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,640
of the Investment Banking Department of MH.

410
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,840
Thank you

411
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,920
for your support and trust

412
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,040
in our department for the last year.

413
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,160
Of course,

414
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,760
our outstanding performance

415
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,240
didn’t let you down.

416
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,520
Let’s cut to the chase.

417
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,360
I announce

418
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,880
that our conference

419
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,880
will begin now.

420
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,960
First of all…

421
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,920
Excuse me, Mr. Lin.

422
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,800
Please hold on for a sec.

423
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,400
Dear shareholders, ladies and gentlemen,

424
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,640
before the conference, please allow me

425
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,880
to report an executive member of MH.

426
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,920
Five years ago,

427
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,800
by taking advantage of his position,

428
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,680
he sought personal gains

429
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,080
during the case of Jiangnan Flavor.

430
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,920
As a result, Jiangnan Flavor underwent

431
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,560
a hostile takeover by C Group.

432
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,120
And this person

433
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,120
is Lin Taimo, Vice President of MH.

434
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,280
Mr. Fan,

435
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,160
you’d better be careful

436
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,760
with what you say,

437
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,000
especially in this grand situation.

438
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,000
I’m afraid you’ll take legal responsibility

439
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,320
for slandering an innocent person.

440
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,440
Mr. Lin,

441
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,120
since I brought it up,

442
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,000
of course I have evidence.

443
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,920
So where is it?

444
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Why don’t you

445
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,120
show it to everybody?

446
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It’s coming.

447
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,680
Where is it?

448
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,120
Shit!

449
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,760
I’m late for the conference!

450
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,200
Mr. Fan,

451
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,720
is this guy who was dismissed

452
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,360
by the company for taking bribes

453
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
your so-called evidence?

454
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,040
Mr. Yuan,

455
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,320
it’s all yours.

456
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,040
Mr. Lin,

457
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,800
what?

458
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,560
Are you afraid of me?

459
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,120
I did nothing wrong.

460
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,640
Why should I be afraid of you?

461
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,200
I’m just worried that someone

462
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,880
may be accused of libel

463
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,920
aside from the crime

464
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,720
of acceptance of bribes.

465
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,960
Good.

466
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,800
Since you

467
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,640
did nothing wrong,

468
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,360
would you please

469
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,400
answer me a few questions?

470
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,000
Of course.

471
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,120
Then let me ask you,

472
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,920
was Linda, GM of
the Investment Banking Department

473
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
of GE Securities,

474
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,360
your ED five years ago?

475
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,030
Yes.

476
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,210
Ladies and gentlemen,

477
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
this is

478
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,760
<i>Special seal for electronic receipt
of China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd.</i>

479
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,920
a remittance receipt
<i>Special seal for electronic receipt
of China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd.</i>

480
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,320
<i>Special seal for electronic receipt
of China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd.</i>

481
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,720
showing Linda transferred money

482
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,680
to Cao Heng, former President of C Group,

483
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,080
five years ago.

484
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,280
Based on Cao Heng’s confession,

485
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,120
it was Linda who asked him

486
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,360
to buy off the manager
of Jiangnan Flavor Food Factory

487
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,720
and force the manger to purchase

488
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,040
a batch of beef of poor quality,

489
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,400
resulting in the severe loss

490
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,640
of Jiangnan Flavor

491
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,160
and a hostile takeover by C Group.

492
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,520
Linda left

493
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,240
MH five years ago

494
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,160
and joined GE.

495
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,400
How’s that matter related to me?

496
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,480
I’m not finished, Mr. Lin.

497
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,440
This document

498
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,840
shows that C Group transferred money to Linda
<i>Renmin East Road Branch of Bank of China</i>

499
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,760
via an offshore account five years ago.

500
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,840
And this one

501
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,960
shows that Linda holds the shares of C Group.
<i>Huixing Industrial Co., Ltd.
Certificate of Shareholding Composition</i>

502
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,840
shows that Linda holds the shares of C Group.

503
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,750
The last one

504
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,400
shows that over the past five years, Linda

505
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,160
has been transferring money to your
<i>Remittance Receipt of Bank of China</i>

506
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,870
has been transferring money to your

507
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,800
right hand man Secretary Bai.

508
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,680
I’m wondering

509
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,080
how you’ll explain

510
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,240
these documents to us.

511
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,440
What?

512
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,320
That’s all you have?

513
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,110
Now, answer me a question.

514
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,160
Mr. Yuan.

515
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,800
Which one of your documents

516
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,440
can prove that I have something

517
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,440
to do with this matter?

518
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,280
This is just a deal

519
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,120
between Linda and Secretary Bai.

520
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,460
It’s totally irrelevant to me.

521
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,120
Lin Taimo,

522
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,240
you planned very well.

523
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,160
That’s right.

524
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,040
The evidence here
doesn’t point at you directly.

525
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
But if I guess right,

526
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
you should have a Share Entrustment Agreement

527
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,880
that you signed with Linda.

528
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,120
Am I right?

529
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,080
Yuan Shuai,

530
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,480
you committed a bribe-related dereliction
of duty.

531
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,840
I didn’t punish you severely

532
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,000
for old time’s sake.

533
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,600
I only had you dismissed.

534
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,160
But now you are here confronting me

535
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,680
and defaming me!

536
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,920
Our Shareholders’ General Meeting

537
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,600
is not a place

538
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,600
where you can talk nonsenses!

539
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,080
Please leave here.

540
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,920
Mr. Lin,

541
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,520
since you can prove that you are innocent,

542
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,880
why are you in a hurry to get me out of here?

543
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,600
Why don’t we make a bet?

544
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,440
From this moment on,
we’ll neither leave nor talk.

545
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,280
10 minutes.

546
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,440
In 10 minutes,

547
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,120
the Compliance Department from CSRC
will send people here.

548
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,720
According to the company’s policy,

549
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,040
your home

550
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,440
and your office,

551
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,080
including your safe,

552
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,840
will be searched thoroughly.

553
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,720
I promise

554
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,000
if there’s no any evidence,

555
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
I’m willing to be punished

556
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,520
and clear Mr. Lin’s name.

557
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,680
But, if they find the evidence,

558
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,360
Mr. Lin,

559
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,640
don’t even think about escaping the law!

560
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,400
10 minutes.

561
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,120
Okay.

562
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,240
I’ll see what you can find

563
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,160
from my home and my office

564
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,720
in 10 minutes.

565
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,760
<i>Jiang Jun</i>

566
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,840
Yuan Shuai is back.

567
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,600
He’s confronting Lin Taimo right now.

568
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,800
Shen Xin,

569
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,720
stop Secretary Bai for me!

570
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,200
Secretary Bai!

571
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,800
You wouldn’t even say sorry?

572
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,920
Sorry.

573
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,320
What’s that about?

574
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,600
A “sorry” won’t solve the problem!

575
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,400
Excuse me, I don’t have time!

576
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,240
What do you mean?

577
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,560
You need to take me to a doctor. You…

578
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,960
-You don’t have time?
-Let go of me!

579
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,040
Are you alright?

580
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,320
I’m fine.

581
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,200
Did he hurt you?

582
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,800
Do you need to see a doctor?

583
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,840
No.

584
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,560
Are you sure?

585
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,360
Secretary Bai is here!

586
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,280
Hide!

587
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,120
What were you doing?

588
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,920
Well…

589
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,920
Mr. Lin asked me to bring him a file.

590
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,880
Give me. I’ll give it to him.

591
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,160
Jiang Jun!

592
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,440
Stop!

593
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,320
Give me the file!

594
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,600
Give me!

595
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,160
Let go!

596
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,760
Give me the file!

597
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,240
It’s empty.

598
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Is that necessary?

599
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,350
You don’t seem

600
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,920
to be afraid

601
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,920
of the Compliance Department.

602
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,000
You’d better confess your crime now.

603
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,060
Maybe the result won’t be that ugly.

604
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,640
Instead of talking nonsense,

605
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,560
you should check

606
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,440
the conviction and sentencing for libel.

607
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,400
Time’s up.

608
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,230
Mr. Fan,

609
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,440
Yuan Shuai,

610
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,670
where are the people from
the Compliance Department?

611
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,680
Are you fooling the shareholders

612
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,000
and the management?

613
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,320
Yuan Shuai,

614
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,000
it’s such a good idea.

615
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,400
Once the Compliance Department was mentioned,

616
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,760
this old fox gave himself away immediately.

617
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,160
Du Lei, what are you doing?

618
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,480
The document I’m holding

619
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,560
is the Share Entrustment Agreement

620
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,080
signed by Lin Taimo and Linda.

621
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,520
This file

622
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>Party A Lin Taimo Party B Du Ling</i>

623
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,880
is also a hard evidence showing that Lin Taimo
<i>Party A Lin Taimo Party B Du Ling</i>

624
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,960
is the real shareholder of C Group!

625
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,880
Mr. Lin,

626
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,400
you think it’s over?

627
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,120
Sister.

628
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,800
This is not

629
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,880
all he did.

630
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,320
When Jiang Yaoming, Chairman

631
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,360
of Jiangnan Flavor,

632
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,040
had a heart attack,

633
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,320
not only did he stop me
from calling an ambulance,

634
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,160
he also took away

635
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,840
the medicine that could’ve saved his life.

636
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,680
He just watched him suffer,

637
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,440
made him miss the best rescue time,

638
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,640
and let him die in front of us.

639
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,600
You are lying!

640
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,800
It’s you who caused Jiang Yaoming’s death!

641
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,320
Do you still

642
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,440
remember this?

643
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
Call an ambulance.

644
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,320
There are only your fingerprints

645
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,240
and Jiang Yaoming’s on this bottle.

646
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,760
It proves

647
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,160
that the one who took away the medicine

648
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,960
and caused Jiang Yaoming’s death

649
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,480
was you.

650
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,000
I’ve turned myself in.

651
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,800
If you have more things to say,

652
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,520
save them for the police.

653
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,780
Mr. Lin Taimo,

654
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,060
you are suspected of corruption in PE

655
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
and violating the Securities Law.

656
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,860
Please come to the CSRC

657
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,740
for investigation.

658
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,460
Wait.

659
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,700
You’ve got

660
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,470
what you want.

661
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,860
Why didn’t you save him?

662
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,880
Because he knew something he shouldn’t have.

663
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,880
That’s your reason?

664
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,480
If you were me,

665
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,880
you’d do the same thing.

666
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,400
I wouldn’t!

667
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,080
Jiangnan Flavor was a brand

668
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,840
that my father built from scratch.

669
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,880
Just like MH to you.

670
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,880
I used to see you as my role model

671
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,560
and a respected leader.

672
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,440
I wanted to become a person like you.

673
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,920
But now I realize I was so wrong.

674
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,230
I wouldn’t do such things

675
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,520
in my whole life!

676
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,160
My father

677
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,480
never cheated any of his customers!

678
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,520
He honored this brand!

679
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,840
My father was an honest and righteous man!
But you…

680
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,080
Just go to that dark and cold place

681
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,400
to atone for your sin.

682
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,680
I’m sure my father

683
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,080
can witness this in heaven.

684
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,030
Jiang Jun.
