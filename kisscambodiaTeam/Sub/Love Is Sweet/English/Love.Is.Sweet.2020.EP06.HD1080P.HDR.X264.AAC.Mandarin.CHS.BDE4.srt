00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 6

3
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,800
You still haven’t answered my question.

4
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Why did you steal my love letter?

5
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,680
Surely because your dad

6
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,920
paid me for it.

7
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,320
There was no doubt

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,880
that the man wouldn’t

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,920
accept you.

10
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,039
We’d rather stop

11
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,400
your fantasy

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,640
than seeing you cry your head off

13
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,040
after being rejected.

14
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,240
Well.

15
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Now

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
you’ve received my apology.

17
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,840
Then I won’t be softhearted

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,760
in work from now on.

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
I don’t need you to do so.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,080
Now I

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
have a very great teacher

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,320
to be my backup.

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,880
I won’t be afraid of any of your tricks.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,880
Teacher?

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,079
A promising young man

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,960
of great ideas working in investment industry.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
Expert in investment industry

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
won’t help people like you.

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,200
People who have enough time to help others

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,520
are all green hands.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,760
Not everyone is so eager for quick success
and instant benefits like you.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,120
He aims for the highest and means to keep normal.

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,840
OK?

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Have you finished?

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,240
Yeah.

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,400
Hey. You.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,760
What a shame to be so wasteful!

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,360
Wait for me.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,120
Wait.

40
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,440
Angry again. Baffling.

41
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,320
What’s the matter?

42
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,920
The cooker should be good for soup cooking.

43
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,840
Buy one.

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Why do we have to pay for it

45
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,120
while there is special offer?

46
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,340
[Nostalgic Photos Experiencing
Top 20 couples will gain an electric cooker for free.]

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,240
Will you take part in the offer for a cooker?

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Of course.

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
Don’t you think the white fits me very well?

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
Modest, luxury, educated,

51
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,360
and of high grade.

52
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,320
I don’t feel that.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,520
I can buy one for you

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
if you like it.

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,240
You just asked me

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,000
about the second part for thanking me, right?

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Welcome to come again.

58
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,120
Hello. Welcome.

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,520
Are you here for the nostalgic activity?

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,520
Yes.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,440
Look,

62
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,880
according to our activity rules,

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,720
I need to confirm whether you two

64
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
are lovers or not.

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,560
-No.
-Yes.

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,760
Yes.

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,600
That’ll be OK.

68
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
This way, please.

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,200
Your water. Please enjoy.

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,960
-OK. Thank you.
-Thank you.

71
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,360
The interface

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,200
is much advanced than that before.

73
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,760
We didn’t have so many templates before.

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Retro style and keeping up with the times
are not in conflict.

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,080
Understand it or not?

76
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,280
Pose.

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,400
Not trendy.

78
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,320
Let go of me.

79
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,680
You are so childish.

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
How can you pull my hair while taking a picture?

81
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,760
Take another one.

82
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,640
It looks great.

83
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
Your pose was really old-fashioned.

84
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,360
Are you dissatisfied with my help?

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,440
Looks great!

86
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,000
Hmm. It’s great!

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,240
Excuse me!

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,040
Finished?

89
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,040
Sir, I’m sorry.

90
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,480
Your photos

91
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,159
don’t meet the requirements.

92
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,120
Why?

93
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,520
Here is the thing.

94
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,360
It’s a couple theme.

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
We hope you can show you relation

96
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,480
in the photos.

97
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,760
But look at it.

98
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,120
It’s not close at all.

99
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,040
The…

100
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,200
How about

101
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,520
taking another set?

102
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Look. This one. This one.

103
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,960
And this one.

104
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
They are all OK.

105
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,480
Forget it. Let’s go.

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,640
Come back.

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,760
See it?

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
What is it?

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,640
Let’s take another set.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,680
No, I don’t.

111
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
It’s an order.

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,280
It’ll be counted in the KPI.

113
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,600
Afraid?

114
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
Yeah.

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Let’s take it.

116
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,720
A heart.

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,840
So fashion.

118
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,640
You even know this.

119
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
It’s because you are old-fashioned.

120
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,600
No perfect cooperation.

121
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,640
One more time.

122
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,600
Cooperate.

123
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,040
Did you do it on purpose?

124
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,520
You did it on purpose.

125
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Let’s stop taking it.

126
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,400
Nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable.

127
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
It means the cooker doesn’t belong to you.

128
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,600
Let’s go.

129
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,560
Come back.

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,200
Sir.

131
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
Cost for maintenance and the machine

132
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,960
is 23,700 yuan.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,560
This is the invoice.

134
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,320
OK.

135
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,920
Miss. Your photos.

136
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,159
Thank you.

137
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,440
Don’t try to take my photos away.

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,960
I am the one wanted to join this,

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,280
so the photos should be mine.

140
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,520
It’s nothing to do with you.

141
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,920
This is your gift. Here you are.

142
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,320
Hers. Shine it down her.

143
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,000
No.

144
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,040
Give it to him. He wanted to join this.

145
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,400
The cooker is useful for you.

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,040
Shine it down her.

147
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,120
I…

148
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,200
Thank…

149
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,400
Thank you.

150
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,200
Miss Jiang.

151
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,000
I’ve felt your sincere apology.

152
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,240
Let’s go home now.

153
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,840
-This…
-I knew it.

154
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,320
This way.

155
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,360
Way…

156
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,640
I can’t finish my words all the time today.

157
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,150
Wealth.

158
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,000
Go away.

159
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,909
Go away!

160
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,520
You…

161
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,480
You little monkey.

162
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,240
Look,

163
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,040
I will cut your paws

164
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
if you ruin the photos.

165
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,680
Am I clear?

166
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,880
Yuan Shuai, why did you bring me here?

167
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,200
Take photos.

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,400
I don’t want to.

169
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,160
I’m leaving.

170
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,000
Come back.

171
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,760
It’s just one place drop in test.

172
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,480
You don’t need to be so gloomy.

173
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,040
You may be blew

174
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,080
in the future

175
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,760
with such weak psychological endurance.

176
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,280
Come on.

177
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
I will count down from 3 to 1.

178
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,440
Smile together.

179
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,840
Let’s go.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Three, two, one.

181
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,640
Look,

182
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,080
you smiled halfhearted.

183
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,080
Smile again.

184
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,480
-Come on.
-I don’t wanna take it.

185
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,720
Come back.

186
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,840
Come back.

187
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
-What’s it?
-Come. One. Two. Three.

188
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,040
You…

189
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,560
Delete.

190
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,880
No.

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,440
Delete.

192
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
It looks great. Don’t delete.

193
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,800
Delete.

194
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,480
No, don’t delete.

195
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,400
Delete.

196
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,960
What are you doing?

197
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Get out.

198
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,520
Boss, help!

199
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,400
Mr. Su.

200
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,760
Mr. Su.

201
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
Come on. This cup of wine

202
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,160
is to thank you

203
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,040
for

204
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,320
your help last time.

205
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,360
I’d drain it.

206
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,360
I’d drain it.

207
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,200
Hey.

208
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,960
Mr. Su. Cheers.

209
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,720
Cheers.

210
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,560
A toast to you.

211
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,040
Cheers.

212
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
A toast to Mr. Su on behalf of our company?

213
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,840
Cheers.

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,560
Cheers.

215
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,440
Cheers.

216
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,080
Cheers.

217
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,240
To Mr. Su.

218
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,240
Seriously.

219
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,440
Mr. Yuan.

220
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,240
Mr. Yuan.

221
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,040
Mr. Yuan.

222
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,600
Mr. Yuan. Here you are.

223
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,680
Boss, I can’t drink more.

224
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,720
They drank a lot.

225
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,520
Look, Mr. Yuan,

226
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,200
you are really late.

227
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,760
This is for you.

228
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,200
Don’t refuse this cup no matter how.

229
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,680
Yeah.

230
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,600
Let’s talk about the old days.

231
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,760
One cup of it is not enough.

232
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,760
It’s not enough for our friendship.

233
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,400
Right?

234
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,840
Come on.

235
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,440
How about this?

236
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,280
I’d drink one for being late.

237
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,000
OK?

238
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,000
OK.

239
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,000
OK. Cheers.

240
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,360
Count me in.

241
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,640
Cheers.

242
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,840
Please sit down.

243
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,400
Please sit down. Mr. Yuan.

244
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,840
Come on. Let’s drink.

245
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,040
Fill the cup.

246
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,960
Thank you.

247
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,720
It’s not enough for you.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,720
See you.

249
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,360
Be careful.

250
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,240
Boss.

251
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,640
You really can drink a lot.

252
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,600
They are all badly drunk.

253
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,920
If you were not here,

254
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,200
I would be the one badly drunk.

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Boss, anything bothering you?

256
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
No. I’m happy.

257
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
Did you quarrel

258
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,520
with Jiang Jun?

259
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,800
So she is unfaithful now?

260
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,360
Doomsayer.

261
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,600
She has a teacher.

262
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,360
She told me today

263
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,760
that her teacher often gives her advice

264
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,720
about work.

265
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,440
Teacher?

266
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,760
Investment is not a large industry.

267
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,200
Did you find out who he is?

268
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,400
It must be some

269
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,440
swindler.

270
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,720
I’m not interested in that.

271
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Don’t you want me to find it out?

272
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Not necessary.

273
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
I’d see

274
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
how long can he deceive her.

275
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,640
You are having the wrong attitude.

276
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,520
You are living close.

277
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Also, you are her boss.

278
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
But you declared

279
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,560
you would kick her out from MH.

280
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,960
In her mind,

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,520
you are now the natural enemy.

282
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,240
I want to kick her out because

283
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,840
I don’t think she’s suited to this industry.

284
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,040
But

285
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,760
this is my conclusion according to

286
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,200
my previous impression on her.

287
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,920
Seems you’ve changed your mind.

288
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,200
After staying with her for several times,

289
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,280
I believe

290
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,760
people and things are always changing.

291
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,000
It’s necessary for me to rediscover her.

292
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,440
My boss is admitting a fault.

293
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,040
Seems being jealous can make you wise.

294
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Great.

295
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
But don’t you think it’s late

296
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
to change now?

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,240
Her mysterious teacher

298
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
is trying to help her

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,240
every day.

300
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,000
But you are trying your best to kick her out.

301
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,560
Be cautious.

302
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,040
She may accept others instead.

303
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,720
You should take the strategy

304
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,600
of paying more attention

305
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
to her mind or thoughts.

306
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,880
Seems it’s hard to understand women’s mind.

307
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,280
Actually, it’s easy.

308
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,760
It just includes two aspects.

309
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,680
First is they can’t help loving cute things.

310
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,560
The other is it’s easy for them to be sympathetic.

311
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,480
They can’t help loving cute things.

312
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
Be sympathetic.

313
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,040
Wealth. Come here.

314
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,840
Come here. Wealth.

315
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,800
Training an army for a thousand days
to be used just an hour.

316
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,440
Now it’s your turn.

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,720
Behave well.

318
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,200
Why are you here?

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,920
Did you run out?

320
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
Come on. I’d bring you back.

321
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,120
You are so heavy.

322
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,480
The door is open.

323
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,640
Go. You are too heavy.

324
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,640
What’s wrong with you?

325
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,320
I’m fine.

326
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,640
Maybe I caught cold last night.

327
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,680
Why didn’t you go to hospital?

328
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,310
It’s so hot.

329
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,310
I will bring you to the hospital.

330
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,480
No, I don’t go.

331
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,349
I just need to take a break.

332
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,680
OK. Have a good rest.

333
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,349
I gotta go.

334
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,310
I feel so cold.

335
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,069
Hey.

336
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,960
Are you sure not to go to hospital?

337
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
I want some water.

338
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,440
Thank you.

339
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,640
I’m leaving.

340
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,480
What now?

341
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,720
I’m hungry.

342
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,640
What do you want?

343
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,160
Check the refrigerator.

344
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,600
Where is it?

345
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,440
You are usually so busy.

346
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,920
I don’t think there are too many things in it.

347
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,360
Over there.

348
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
What dishes do you want?

349
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
That’s simple.

350
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,120
Braised pork in brown sauce.

351
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,160
Sweet and sour fillet.

352
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,560
Braised beef with potato.

353
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,880
Three are enough

354
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
for meat dishes.

355
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,840
For vegetable dishes,

356
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,040
fried potato, green pepper and eggplant.

357
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,840
We got a cooker yesterday, right?

358
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,320
Make a pork stomach

359
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,680
and chicken.

360
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,640
That’s all.

361
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,360
You are not like a sick person

362
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,840
Since you have a good appetite,

363
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,680
how about…

364
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,640
I feel so ill.

365
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
I’m cold and hungry,

366
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,080
but nobody takes care of me.

367
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,680
How poor I am!

368
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
It’s 39 degrees.

369
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
Are the foods ready?

370
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,640
Soon.

371
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,120
Hungry.

372
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,800
Have some.

373
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
What are you looking at?

374
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,040
A sick man can’t eat that oily food.

375
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,280
I cook the porridge the first time in my life.

376
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,040
Take it or not.

377
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
Order takeouts if not.

378
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,600
Come back.

379
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,120
The patient is limply and weak.

380
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,080
Feed me.

381
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,600
I…

382
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,600
I owed you.

383
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:20,960
Hot?

384
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,680
A bit light.

385
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,000
It’s good enough. Don’t be so fussy.

386
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,680
Your sofa is comfortable to sit.

387
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,520
Is it heated?

388
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Imported from Germany.

389
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,680
I just bought it last week.

390
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,560
Is it comfortable?

391
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,840
Yes.

392
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,880
It’s nice to be rich.

393
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:14,760
[Du Lei]

394
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,520
Do you have some time today?
[Du Lei]

395
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:15,800
[Du Lei]

396
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,860
I’d teach you a unique way for pressure relief.
[Du Lei]

397
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,960
I’d teach you a unique way for pressure relief.

398
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Not today.

399
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,560
How about tomorrow?

400
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,040
OK. See you tomorrow.

401
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,880
Can’t you keep your mind?

402
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,560
Concentrate your attention.

403
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,360
OK?

404
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,720
Then please eat it quickly, OK?

405
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,840
I have something else to do.

406
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
The rest porridge is in the cooker
for heat preservation.

407
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,720
Eat at night.

408
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,760
Take it yourself.

409
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,760
I’ll get the medicine for you.

410
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,960
I want to read the book.

411
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,080
Get one for me.

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
So fastidious.

413
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,280
Which one?

414
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Second one on the left in the second row.

415
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,760
This one?

416
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,640
No.

417
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,520
The third one on the left in the third row.

418
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,280
This one?

419
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,880
Not that one.

420
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,960
It should be

421
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,160
on the left in the second row…

422
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,680
No.

423
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,280
The rightmost in the second row.

424
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,920
Why didn’t you just tell me the title?

425
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,040
This one?

426
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
Norwegian Wood?

427
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,280
That’s it.

428
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,840
I can’t imagine

429
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,040
you are also interested in reading

430
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,320
except the stock market.

431
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,800
The book is famous

432
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,320
because it’s extremely charming.

433
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,320
What a pity!

434
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,240
You can’t feel its charm.

435
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,720
Only the one with a Buddha in his mind
can see the Buddha.

436
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,800
You always call names without dirty words.

437
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,440
Yes.

438
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,640
Only profound people can understand its beauty.

439
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,600
Read it diligently.

440
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,400
I’m leaving.

441
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,920
I can’t believe such a famous book

442
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,760
even makes you so shy.

443
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,440
Seems you still have deep-rooted bad habits

444
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,280
of shame-based culture.

445
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,960
Be careful. Being stuffy may be bad for you.

446
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,080
Thank you for reminding.

447
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,840
I will try my best to be innovative.

448
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,680
Hey.

449
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,480
Why can’t you start it from today?

450
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,560
That’s why you can never be

451
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
one of the 20% population.

452
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,680
Understand?

453
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,760
Don’t you really think I’ve read this book?

454
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,240
OK. Then tell me

455
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,120
if Naoko asked Watanabe

456
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,200
for stay with tears

457
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,760
on her twentieth birthday.

458
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,440
She was not asking him for stay.

459
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,920
She wanted to love Watanabe.

460
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,720
But she couldn’t let the past go.

461
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,360
So she was plunged into pain.

462
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,520
They actually

463
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,000
comforted each other.

464
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,320
It is undoubtedly

465
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,800
that she cried the whole night.

466
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,600
They didn’t comfort each other.

467
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,360
Watanabe comforted her all night.

468
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,280
Do you doubt my memory?

469
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,360
I supported Naoko’s body with my left hand,

470
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,160
touched her soft and straight hair with the right,

471
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,200
and waited for so long till she stopped crying.

472
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,640
But she just cried continually.

473
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,360
I slept with Naoko that night.

474
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,400
I didn’t know if it was right.

475
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,040
I still don’t know now, after 20 years.

476
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,120
Maybe I would never know.

477
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,480
I could only do so at that moment.

478
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,680
She was emotional and at a stand.

479
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,240
She wanted my comforting.

480
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,200
I closed…

481
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,200
What’s next?

482
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,360
It’s dawn.

483
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,800
-I touched…
-It’s not about dawn, right?

484
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,640
The page you just turned.

485
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,760
It should have something else.

486
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,600
Are you sure you want to continue?

487
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,080
Of course.

488
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,280
Hey.

489
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,560
How can you stop the story in the middle?

490
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,240
What?

491
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,400
You don’t know the characters behind?

492
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,120
OK. I’m reading it. Listen carefully.

493
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,560
I turned off the lights,

494
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,200
put off her clothes slowly and gently,

495
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,040
also mine.

496
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,640
Then we hugged together.

497
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,280
That was a mild rainy night.

498
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,600
We were together, naked.

499
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
But we didn’t feel the chill.

500
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,320
Naoko and I fondled each other

501
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,120
in the dark.

502
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,880
I kissed her on the lips.

503
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,320
I helped her… In the dark.

504
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,680
Stop.

505
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,480
What a bad story!

506
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,440
I’m sick.

507
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
You may go back.

508
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,400
I’d take a rest.

509
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,440
OK.

510
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,320
Have a good rest.

511
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,400
Take care of yourself. Don’t work too hard.

512
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,560
Take the medicine on time.

513
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,720
I’m leaving now.

514
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
See you, little cute.

515
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,320
Wealth.

516
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,320
Wealth. Come here.

517
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,480
She is a dumb woman, right?

[Norwegian Wood]

519
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,600
Everyone has her own forest

520
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,480
where we may never go to.

521
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,600
But it’s always been there.

522
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,360
All the time.

523
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,120
Those who have lost will get lost.

524
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,200
Those have met will meet each other again.

525
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,200
Today, I finally meet

526
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,810
the lady of “scent of a woman”.

527
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,480
Seems she’s out.

529
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,480
God!

530
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,120
He really looks good in all aspects.

531
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,640
Still that talented.

532
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,840
The first day Xiaochuan doesn’t come. Miss him.

533
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,800
Hello, welcome.

534
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,680
What are you doing here again?

535
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,080
I…

536
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,320
I’ve compensated you so many sanitary pads.

537
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,120
You are a fine-looking man.

538
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
You can’t take a candy from a baby.

539
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,760
Take it easy.

540
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,520
I’m paying for it.

541
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,200
I just want you to do me a favor.

542
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,880
You know Wealth, right?

543
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,440
Yes.

544
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,800
The ball it plays was left
on the balcony of your house.

545
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,560
It was anxious today.

546
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,840
So if you have time,

547
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,840
could you take it to me?

548
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,680
I can’t.

549
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,640
It’s OK.

550
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,120
You can let Jiang Jun take it to me.

551
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,480
Jiang Jun also can’t.

552
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,960
She is with Mr. Du.

553
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,400
I don’t think she can return for the moment.

554
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,600
Mr. Du?

555
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,480
Yes.

556
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,680
Now I

557
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,920
have a very great teacher

558
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,760
to be my backup.

559
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,480
I won’t be afraid of any of your tricks.

560
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,560
Teacher?

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,840
A promising young man

562
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,880
of great ideas working in investment industry.

563
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,280
Speak it in this way,

564
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,360
Jiang Jun is really very lucky.

565
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,040
She could meet such a gentle,

566
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,080
handsome and rich senior

567
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,320
in investment industry.

568
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,240
Gentle? Handsome and rich?

A senior in investment industry.

570
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,040
Baffling.

571
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,920
Being gentle,

572
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,440
handsome and rich, has nothing to do with you.

573
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,000
It’s the place for the chosen one.

574
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,960
The sun shines on him

575
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,360
at just the right angle.

576
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,720
It’ll be too shiny if it has more.

577
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,520
It’ll be dark if it has less.

578
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,720
Excuse me.

579
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,120
Would you try some?

580
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,600
I’ve been working here for five hours.

581
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,400
You offered milky tea for three times,

582
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,600
and food for twice.

583
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,440
I didn’t give attention to it.

584
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,520
But inevitably it reduced my work efficiency

585
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,720
a little.

586
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,400
Please don’t do it again.

587
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,320
The…

588
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,760
The…

589
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,160
The…

590
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,040
I meant to thank you for helping me

591
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,600
catch the thief a few days ago.

592
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,760
And I want to add you a friend on WeChat.

593
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,920
Will it be OK or not?

594
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,520
Moreover,

595
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,160
what do you do?

596
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,920
This is what I’m doing?

597
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,280
I see it.

598
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,640
This is an electronic photo album.

599
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,760
I’m designing a dating site.

600
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,320
My final aim

601
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,400
is to make a one-button blind dating site

602
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,840
with big data.

603
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,040
What you are seeing

604
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,840
is something initial.

605
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,840
Many things need to be adjusted later.

606
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,280
There are many single males and females now.

607
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,560
The market is promising for this idea.

608
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,760
You really think so?

609
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,440
OK.

610
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,280
I’d treat you a meal.

611
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,320
Would you do me a favor?

612
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,680
OK.

613
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,740
[Li Xiaochuan]

614
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,960
Li Xiaochuan.

615
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,760
What do you need me to do?

616
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,000
Let’s contact on WeChat.

617
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,320
OK.

618
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,880
I thought it’s the wrong place.

619
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
I can’t believe it’s really this place.

620
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,000
Thank you.

621
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,080
Will we eat here today?

622
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,440
The chef of this restaurant

623
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,680
is bewitching.

624
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
He’s very skillful.

625
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,080
Please enjoy.

626
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,920
Thank you.

627
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,320
I researched the recipe of this dessert.

628
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,880
Try it.

629
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,880
Really?

630
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,600
Light and not greasy. Delicious.

631
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,200
It’s great since you like it.

632
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,800
The cake tastes nice.

633
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,600
Wanna know why?

634
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,240
I’ll take you to a place after the meal.

635
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
So mysterious?

636
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
What’s this?

637
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,360
Flavoring chamber.

638
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,480
Flavoring helps people releasing the mood.

639
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,760
I thought you were under great pressure

640
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,760
some time ago,

641
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,320
so I took you here for releasing.

642
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,520
So much wine.

643
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
For flavoring.

644
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
Can the wine be used for flavoring?

645
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,190
Sure.

646
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,230
Alcohol

647
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,520
can remain the fragrance very well.

648
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,440
Mixing the essence from plants

649
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,710
and animals with the wine

650
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,080
can keep the fragrance.

651
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,710
Give me your hand.

652
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,560
What a unique flavor!

653
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,560
Perfume

654
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,840
can’t be used just for expressing desire
and feelings.

655
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,520
This perfume I made

656
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,280
contains my favorite lily, bergamot,

657
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,760
and Hungary noble wine.

658
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,200
It feels like being clear,

659
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,800
pure and kind.

660
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,280
I made it according to my first impression on you.

661
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,400
It’s for you.

662
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,600
It’s the first time someone making perfume for me.

663
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,440
Take it as a gift to you at the first meeting.

664
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,000
Thank you, teacher.

665
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,240
Is the case of Kelang solved?

666
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
Thanks to your help.

667
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,360
It’s all settled.

668
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,280
That’s good.

669
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,200
Sit down.

670
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,080
You can try to

671
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,120
make it.

672
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,960
Maybe

673
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,080
there will be a surprise.

674
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,040
Nice.

675
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,080
You are even dating with other men.

676
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,840
Seems you are more capable now.

677
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,400
Come on. Let’s go.

678
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,440
Come.

679
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
What’s wrong, Wealth?

680
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,480
Tired?

681
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,800
Jiang Jun, how dare you

682
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
still not return at this late?

683
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,440
You are too bold now.

684
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,880
How is it?

685
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,000
Have an idea about the name for the perfume?

686
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,120
It’s like the lily fragrance.

687
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,360
Let’s call it lily perfume.

688
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,880
Lily perfume.

689
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,320
It’s well-suited.

690
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,440
Thank you so much for today’s help.

691
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,880
The perfume class is really great.

692
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,440
I finally got a chance to experience

693
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,880
the life for a delicate girl.

694
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,960
If you like it,

695
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,440
we can go more often.

696
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,080
Anyway, perfume

697
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,840
can help people to calm.

698
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,680
It really can relieve the pressure.

699
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,520
Teacher, you know well about being in peace.

700
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,160
About pressure relief,

701
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,160
racing is also a great choice.

702
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,840
Racing?

703
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,440
That doesn’t seem like your style.

704
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,400
You can’t just see one aspect of people.

705
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,480
I will take you to experience it

706
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,280
when we get a chance.

707
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,760
It’s a kind of pressure relieving way

708
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,480
by being out of constriction of time and space.

709
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,880
Personally, I like it very much.

710
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,320
I guess you will like it, too.

711
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,840
OK. Anytime is OK.

712
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,760
It’s a deal.

713
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,560
Thank you.

714
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,560
By the way, Mr. Du.

715
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,880
This is a gift for you.

716
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,720
Hope you can like it.

717
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,640
Seems I’d buy a new suit

718
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,680
for it.

719
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,560
Is this the mysterious teacher you mentioned?

720
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,400
Do you know each other?

721
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,240
-No.
-No.

722
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,560
Anyway,

723
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
thank you

724
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,640
for teaching my staff.

725
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,080
A piece of cake.

726
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,680
Why are you thanking him?

727
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,120
Jiang Jun, thank you for your gift.

728
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,880
I like it very much.

729
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,680
Since when has CEO of GE

730
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,360
learnt to use such a dirty trick?

731
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,960
What do you mean?

732
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,520
I don’t understand.

733
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,080
You are thinking of some dirty tricks

734
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,080
to seduce the new member of the rival company

735
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,400
when all tricks have been exhausted in work.

736
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,600
Do you think you can win a round?

737
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,080
You must be too naïve.

738
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,840
Yuan Shuai, don’t speak like that.

739
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,080
It’s OK.

740
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,440
Mr. Yuan

741
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,040
may misunderstand me.

742
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
I warn you.

743
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,360
Don’t try to use any bad idea.

744
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,600
Otherwise,

745
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,200
you will be defeated even worse.

746
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,360
OK.

747
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,680
I’ll wait and see.
