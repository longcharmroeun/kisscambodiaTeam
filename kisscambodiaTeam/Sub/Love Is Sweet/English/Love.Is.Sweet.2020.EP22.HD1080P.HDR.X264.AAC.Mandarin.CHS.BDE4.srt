00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,370
Episode 22

3
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,430
Have you heard that

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,150
Ms. Qiao is in big trouble this time?

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,920
What’s the matter?

6
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,000
A few days ago, she somehow

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,840
filled in the wrong data

8
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,400
in the financing plan of Yuanyang Group

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
and directly sent it to the client.

10
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,280
As a result, it caused losses to the client.

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,760
Now she’s being held accountable.

12
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,000
I’m telling you that

13
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,760
Yuanyang is a big client

14
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,000
that our company has always valued.

15
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,480
With such a serious mistake,

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,160
can she still stay in the company?

17
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,320
I’m afraid she’ll have a hard time
in the investment bank.

18
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,240
That’s right.

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
The senior leaders had given the order.

20
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,240
Her dismissal

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,160
was a done deal.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,280
But,

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,360
Mr. Yuan stepped forward and saved her,

24
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,400
and promised Yuanyang Group a new financing plan

25
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,400
within 24 hours.

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,470
Did I hear you correctly?

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,680
24 hours?

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,120
That’s right.

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,960
New plan?

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,600
Yes.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
Then Mr. Yuan has to work day and night again.

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,440
And if it doesn’t work out this time,

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,320
our Mr. Yuan

34
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,000
will be sacked along with Ms. Qiao.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,400
Sir Edward Coke once said

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,720
it was better to be careful beforehand
than to make up for it.

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,000
They made the mistake

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,040
and now they should take the responsibilities.

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,240
Edward also said that Mr. Yuan had come.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,040
Edward…

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,720
How are you?

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,600
Xiaochuan, good morning.

43
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,080
Good morning.

44
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,760
Xiaochuan,

45
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,600
is this for me?

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
I happened to pass by a cake shop
in the morning.

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,240
I got it for you.

48
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
Thank you, Xiaochuan.

49
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
This cake looks delicious.

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,880
It’s a nice shop. Buy one and get one for free.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
It’s a bargain.

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,400
No wonder I don’t think

53
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
this cake tastes that good.

54
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,280
Xiaochuan.

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Mr. Du.

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,280
Mr. Du, hello.

57
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,520
What did you say

58
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,120
about the fund?

59
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
Mr. Du, this way, please.

60
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,600
Ok.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Mr. Du,

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
we have a small problem
about the fund right now.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
What should I do?

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
We have a problem with the fund?

65
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,000
Mr. Du, have some water.

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,960
-Xiaochuan.
-Thank you.

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,680
Now you understand

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,480
why there are

69
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,920
two fund expenditure ratios?

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,480
Pretty much.

71
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,800
So, is there a problem with the fund?

72
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,520
No.

73
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
The fund expenditure ratio

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,080
is the percentage of a startup’s fund

75
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,760
that is consumed before it becomes profitable.

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,280
Every startup has that indicator.

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,000
Xiaochuan has simply

78
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,760
misclassified the figures.

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,960
I’ll explain it to him.

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
I’m glad there’s no problem.

81
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,640
I’m glad there’s no problem.

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,360
By the way, Mr. Du,

83
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,440
are you free tonight?

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,960
How about having dinner together?

85
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:35,960
Ok.

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
Wealth.

87
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,920
Are you waiting for me?

88
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,320
How can you be so cute?

89
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Wealth.

90
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,640
Wealth,

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
your dad has a busy day.

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,440
So let’s be considerate of him

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
and not bother him.

94
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
Stay here and wait for him,

95
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,120
ok?

96
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,760
Maybe he’ll come back
after we finish the cleaning.

97
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,360
Right?

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,520
Sit tight!

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,720
Wealth,

100
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,760
your dad is so great.

101
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
We should not hold him back, should we?

102
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
I must find

103
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,680
the most worthy client today.

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,440
Give me Five!

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,280
Give me Five.

106
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,960
Five.

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,120
Five.

108
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,440
Five. Five. Five.

109
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,000
Five.

110
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,960
Kiss.

111
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,480
I see. I see.

112
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,080
Don’t wait for me.

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,130
Beauty sleep matters.

114
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,640
Love you.

115
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,400
Good night.

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,200
Wealth,

117
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,760
your dad doesn’t come home at night,

118
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
and he’s with a beautiful girl.

119
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,200
But I’m not jealous at all.

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,240
I’m such a tolerant girlfriend,

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,640
right?

122
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
Am I great?

123
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,520
Yes.

124
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,280
Here you are.

125
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,840
Thanks.

126
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,680
Whether it works or not this time,

127
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,040
I’d like to thank you for helping me.

128
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
After all, it makes sense

129
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,880
if you don’t help me.

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,560
Actually, the reason I’m helping you
is very simple.

131
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,960
Firstly,

132
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,560
when one of my subordinates made a mistake,

133
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
it was because of my oversight.

134
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,760
From the perspective of business,
I can’t get away with it.

135
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,240
Secondly,

136
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,440
I am well aware of your abilities.

137
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,480
A mistake was made this time.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,280
There must be some reason.

139
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,720
From the personal perspective…

140
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,880
From the personal perspective,

141
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,280
we have worked together for so long

142
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,940
that we have developed the tacit understanding
we should have.

143
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,720
I have always regarded you

144
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,360
as my comrade-in-arms.

145
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,680
Like Su Chang,

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,440
you are very helpful

147
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,400
for me at work.

148
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Thank you, Mr. Yuan,

149
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,120
for being so candid.

150
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
Take a look at these pictures.

151
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,040
Mr. Yuan, don’t be nervous.

152
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,680
I’m just trying to remind you,
as a comrade-in-arms,

153
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,040
to be careful about the consequences
of your relationship.

154
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,000
After all, if these pictures

155
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,360
were taken by someone with an ulterior motive,

156
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,000
it wouldn’t just

157
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
affect the two of you at work.

158
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,480
Of course I’ll delete all of them.

159
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,920
Then,

160
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,320
we are even.

161
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,240
If anything happens in the future,

162
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,320
it has nothing to do with me.

163
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,140
<i>To: MH Admin Dept.
MH HR Dept.</i>

164
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,900
<i>This email has no subject.
Do you still want to send it?</i>

165
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,540
<i>Cancel</i>

166
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,120
Thank you for reminding me.

167
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,480
But as I said,

168
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,880
since it was my choice,

169
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,960
I will see it through.

170
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,440
You’re welcome,

171
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,920
comrade-in-arms.

172
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,840
Jiang Jun, good morning.

173
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,360
Good morning.

174
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,400
Xiang Ding,

175
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,920
have you had breakfast yet?

176
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,360
No. What’s wrong?

177
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,200
I happened to have an extra breakfast. Here.

178
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,520
Thank you.

179
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,080
Hello.

180
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,240
Hello.

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,600
Is it Jiang Jun from MH?

182
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
I am the secretary to the director
of Xinshuo Technology. I’m surnamed Xia.

183
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,840
Our company

184
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,560
is now thinking about an IPO.

185
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,080
I’m wondering if I can

186
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,960
make an initial contact with you.

187
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,240
No problem.

188
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
Is today a good time for you?

189
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,240
Can we meet for a chat first?

190
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,600
It should be ok.

191
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
Then send me the address.

192
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,240
Ok.

193
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,120
Ok.

194
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,360
Xiang Ding,

195
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
a client asked me out.

196
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,120
I saw that Mr. Yuan was busy,

197
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,000
so I didn’t go in to report.

198
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,000
If he asks for me,

199
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,800
please help me explain.

200
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,760
Thank you.

201
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,080
Then I’ll go.

202
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,840
Bye.

203
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,280
Miss Jiang,

204
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:34,960
nice to meet you.

205
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
I’m sorry to have kept you waiting.

206
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,920
It’s okay. I just sat down.

207
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,800
This way, please.

208
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,560
Here is my business card.

209
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,440
Thank you.

210
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,960
I’ve already ordered your coffee.

211
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,080
Let’s talk over it.

212
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,720
Thank you.

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,480
You’re welcome.

214
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,760
This is our new proposal.

215
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,360
Thank you.

216
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,120
Mr. Fan,

217
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,960
MH is really professional.

218
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
They came up with a new financing plan

219
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,800
within one day,

220
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
and it’s improved a lot.

221
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,160
I even wonder

222
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,080
if the previous plan

223
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
was deliberately put out

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
to scare us into a cold sweat.

225
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,720
Anyway, in this case,

226
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,800
we know what to tell the Board.

227
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,920
This time, however,

228
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,720
it was our carelessness

229
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,240
that caused the problem.

230
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,640
So it’s our job

231
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,400
to solve the problem.

232
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,120
We would like to thank
Yuanyang Group in particular

233
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,600
for trusting us again.

234
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,440
At the same time,

235
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,840
Mr. Yuan

236
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,240
is willing to be a technical consultant
for Yuanyang Group

237
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,840
for one year, for free.

238
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,200
Mr. Yuan, one year.

239
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,920
Ok, Mr. Liu.

240
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,920
Go to my office and have a cup of tea.

241
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,800
Good idea.

242
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,000
Everyone, please.

243
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,960
Ok.

244
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,560
Thank you.

245
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,760
You’re being too polite.

246
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,280
Do you have time

247
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,240
to talk?

248
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,640
Ok.

249
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,640
Let’s go.

250
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,280
Hello. Who is it?

251
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,920
What do you mean?

252
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,920
No need to be nervous.

253
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,640
I’m just doing a test for someone.

254
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,600
She is very safe.

255
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,120
She is only sleeping quietly now.

256
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,560
Where is she?

257
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,360
I’ll send you the location.

258
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,920
Sir, hello!

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,560
You can’t park here!

260
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,120
Sir!

261
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,960
Sir!

262
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,080
Sir!

263
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,040
Sir!

264
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,080
Jiang Jun!

265
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,880
Jiang Jun!

266
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,000
Sir.

267
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,200
Sir.

268
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,040
Hello, please open the door for me.

269
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
I’m sorry. Please show me your ID card.

270
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,360
We need to check the information.

271
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,360
How about this?

272
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,600
Call Mr. Luo

273
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,360
and tell him this is Du Lei.

274
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,440
I’ll make amends to him later.

275
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,600
Jiang Jun!

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,520
Jiang Jun!

277
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,560
Xiang Ding.

278
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,440
Mr. Yuan.

279
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,480
Where is Jiang Jun?

280
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,640
It was not long before Jiang Jun left.

281
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,280
She said she was out to see a client.

282
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,440
A client?

283
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,640
Sorry.

284
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,880
The subscriber you dialed is not being answered for the moment.

285
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,680
Please redial later.

286
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,040
She must have taken some sleeping pills.

287
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,640
And she has low blood sugar.

288
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,680
But so far she’s fine.

289
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,280
I think she’ll wake up in a minute.

290
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,360
Ok.

291
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,360
Thank you, Doctor.

292
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,680
Is Jiang Jun in this ward?

293
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,320
Mr. Du,

294
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,960
I…

295
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,160
What happened

296
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,520
to our Jun?

297
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,680
She might have low blood sugar, and suddenly fainted.

298
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,760
I was just in the neighborhood

299
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,680
so I sent her here.

300
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,920
What does the doctor say about her now?

301
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,320
The doctor said it’s nothing serious.

302
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,040
She should wake up in a minute.

303
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,320
I’m relieved you’re here.

304
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,520
Then I’ll leave her to you.

305
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,720
I have to go.

306
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,640
Ok.

307
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,040
Now that you have something to do, go ahead.

308
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,680
The two of us should be enough.

309
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,680
Remember to ask her to drink more water
after she wakes up.

310
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
What’s going on?

311
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,640
<i>Li Xiaochuan</i>

312
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,620
Jiang Jun had an accident. Come to the hospital quickly.
<i>Li Xiaochuan</i>

313
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:56,640
Jiang Jun had an accident. Come to the hospital quickly.

314
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,800
Hello. Is it a good time

315
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
to meet and talk?

316
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,320
I’m so happy for Jun.

317
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,400
She’s so charming.

318
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,960
There are two men around

319
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,760
ready to protect her.

320
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
If only

321
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,720
I could meet someone

322
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
so spoony.

323
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,080
I agree.

324
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,720
Although Mr. Du is really nice,

325
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,040
I am still on my brother’s side.

326
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,040
After all, they’re the only perfect match

327
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,800
in West World.

328
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,680
Then let me ask you

329
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,080
where

330
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,240
the perfect match is.

331
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
Let me make a bold prediction.

332
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,560
I’m going to count down from five,

333
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,440
and the perfect match

334
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,480
will be here.

335
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,360
Do you believe that?

336
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,520
I don’t believe it.

337
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,680
Let’s have a try.

338
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,240
Five.

339
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,120
Four.

340
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,440
Three.

341
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Two.

342
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,240
One.

343
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,760
Jiang Jun.

344
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,360
Jiang Jun.

345
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,760
How is she?

346
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
She is ok, Brother.

347
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,400
The doctor said she had low blood sugar.

348
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,040
Mr. Du was just around the corner

349
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
and sent her over.

350
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,760
Du Lei?

351
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,440
Jun,

352
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,640
you are awake.

353
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,480
Jiang Jun.

354
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,040
How are you?

355
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,680
Do you feel all right?

356
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,360
Why am I here?

357
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,720
The doctor said you were hypoglycemia
so you fainted.

358
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,840
She was fine.

359
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,280
How come she’s hypoglycemia?

360
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,160
Who did you meet this afternoon?

361
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,760
You are asking her!

362
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,120
I haven’t asked you yet!

363
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,960
I entrust her to you.

364
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,760
But

365
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,880
two days later, she is hospitalized.

366
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,720
Did you do your job?

367
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,400
Ok. Ok.

368
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,000
I’m not done yet.

369
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,040
How can you be such a boyfriend?

370
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,760
Li, I’m fine, really.

371
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,600
Don’t blame him.

372
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,880
I’m sorry.

373
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
I didn’t take good care of you.

374
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,400
I’m really fine.

375
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,720
You don’t have to blame yourself.

376
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,560
Isn’t this all right with me?

377
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,360
Let’s go.

378
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,560
And she is on his side!

379
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
It’s… It’s unbelievable!

380
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,840
Sorry.

381
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,800
See?

382
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,000
They are the perfect match.

383
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,800
People who are truly in love

384
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,720
would use hugs…

385
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,640
…or kisses

386
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,440
to boost each other’s serotonin levels,

387
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,400
making each other feel better,

388
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,640
or reducing each other’s stress.

389
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,840
Xiaochuan,

390
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,120
have you ever kissed someone

391
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,920
when you were in love before?

392
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,960
I…

393
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,680
I think I’m still running code.

394
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,240
I’ll run the code first.

395
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,400
That’s what the test report says.

396
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,080
Sleeping pills?

397
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,360
Yes.

398
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,520
The patient’s hypoglycemia was not severe enough

399
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,080
to make her faint.

400
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,560
When I checked her blood,

401
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,440
there was a dose of sleeping pills

402
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,440
in her body.

403
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,120
I see.

404
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Thank you, Doctor.

405
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
She is ok, Brother.

406
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,200
The doctor said she had low blood sugar.

407
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,840
Mr. Du was just around the corner

408
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,160
and sent her over.

409
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,280
Why did you do that?

410
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,560
What did I do?

411
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,200
Why did you hurt her?

412
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,920
Hurt her?

413
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,520
Du,

414
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,760
are you being angry?

415
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
I just want to see you be angry.

416
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,720
You really don’t have a bottom line, do you?

417
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,200
You are telling me about the bottom line?

418
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,840
Did you have a bottom line

419
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,640
when you helped Wan Shan by using her?

420
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,560
Did you have a bottom line

421
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
when you annexed Jiangnan Flavor

422
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,720
and forced her father to die?

423
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Anyone can talk to me about the bottom line,

424
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,040
except you.

425
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,200
By the way,

426
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,200
the person who gives you hope

427
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,240
is the daughter of Mr. Jiang

428
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,680
who was forced to die by you five years ago.

429
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,040
You two are really lucky.

430
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,480
If she knew

431
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,760
you had indirectly killed her father,

432
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,320
would she still give you hope?

433
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,720
<i>Five years ago</i>

434
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,960
I think there’s something strange
<i>Five years ago</i>

435
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,080
<i>Five years ago</i>

436
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,060
about the food safety accident of Jiangnan Flavor.
<i>Five years ago</i>

437
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,120
about the food safety accident of Jiangnan Flavor.

438
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
Their Yixianqian had

439
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,120
the biggest market share among the rice noodle brands.

440
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,120
It has never had any accident.

441
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,720
But it happened

442
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,040
when they did not agree to the takeover,

443
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,680
causing such a big financial crisis.

444
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,800
Let me ask you...

445
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,280
In the food industry,

446
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,520
isn’t it normal

447
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,360
for goods to have quality problems?

448
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,440
Keep in mind that

449
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,640
the capital markets have always given priority to profit.

450
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,760
Investment banks are not charities.

451
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,360
It is your responsibility

452
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,040
to help C Group complete the acquisition.

453
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,480
After you finish the job,

454
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,800
I can recommend you for a promotion to Vice President.

455
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,000
That matters.

456
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,880
I saw no problem with that contract.

457
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,200
Just sign it!

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,240
none of the company’s 112 employees

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,280
I can give you the trademark,

464
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,840
but I won’t give you the secret ingredient.

465
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,640
Don’t worry, Mr. Jiang.

466
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
Your request is clearly stated in the contract.

467
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,480
It won’t be a problem.

469
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,160
I guess I was right.

470
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,680
But I really didn’t think

471
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,960
you were behind it.

472
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,680
What are you trying to prove by saying this?

473
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,280
Didn’t you

474
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,840
choose your own future?

475
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,080
We are the same.

476
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
We are the people

00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,320
who will do anything to get what we want.

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,800
No matter how much you hate your name

479
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,480
and want to get away from it,

480
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
you’re still Du Lei.

481
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,520
I hope that the girl you hurt

482
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,680
will forgive you

483
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
after she knows the truth.

484
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,120
Seeing you like this,

485
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,720
I know how hateful I was.

487
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,360
Mr. Yuan,

488
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,440
why are you so interested in

489
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,840
meeting with an idler like me?

490
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,600
Jiang Jun fainted

491
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,960
and you happened to be nearby and saved her.

492
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,160
Aren’t you going to explain that?

493
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,440
What’s there to explain?

494
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,080
It’s just a coincidence.

495
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,640
Do you think I would believe that?

496
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,000
Du Lei,

497
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,520
what exactly do you want?

498
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,240
To be honest,

499
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
what you think has nothing to do with me.

500
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,560
But there’s one thing

501
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,080
I can promise you.

502
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,480
I didn’t hurt her,

503
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,320
and I never will.

504
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,160
What do you mean?

505
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,800
Because I like her.

506
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,360
Of course,

507
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,760
I know you like her, too.

508
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
So I don’t mind playing fair with you.

509
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,440
After all, I said

510
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,120
I could compromise on some things,

511
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,400
but I wouldn’t compromise

512
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,520
on others.

513
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,560
Do you think I need you to compromise?

514
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,680
I’m sorry.

515
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,040
I forgot to tell you that

516
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,160
Jiang Jun and I are officially together.

517
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,720
If anyone wants to bully her in the future,

518
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,840
only I can protect her.

519
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,920
It will be none of your business.

520
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,840
How are things going
with what I asked you to investigate into?

521
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,560
My friend found that Accountant Xia.

522
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,360
He said using the drug

523
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,320
was a casual idea.

524
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,960
But in the end he did nothing

525
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,720
and ran away.

526
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,320
A casual idea? How come?

527
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,400
Do you carry sleeping pills with you on a whim?

528
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,800
Someone must be behind it.

529
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,640
If he had been instructed to do so,

530
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,720
he would have taken the money

531
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,720
and be ready to be arrested.

532
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,200
I find it a bit difficult.

533
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,760
But you can trust my strong network.

534
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,480
I’ll make him tell the truth.

535
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,720
Make sure it’s done.

I’m thirsty.

539
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,600
It’s for you.

540
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,080
Why aren’t you wearing socks?

541
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
Look how cold your feet are.

542
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,680
Always forgetting to wear socks.

543
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,520
What if you are cold?

544
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,880
It’s not like there’s no heat in the house.

545
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
I’m not that delicate.

546
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,600
You are not that delicate?

547
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,120
If you are not delicate, how come you fainted?

548
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,400
You don’t eat regularly

549
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,840
and often stay up late.

550
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,840
Look at you!

551
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,560
Don’t even dry your hair after taking a shower.

552
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,080
What if you catch a cold?

553
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,600
From now on,

554
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,960
you must eat well and eat on time.

555
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,640
Did you hear me or not?

556
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
The pot calls the kettle black.

557
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,160
Who ruined his health and got into the hospital first?

558
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,000
Ok.

559
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Let’s make a deal.

560
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,200
Starting from tomorrow,

let’s have good meals together.

562
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,880
I’ll cook and you’ll eat.

563
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,360
Can I decide what to eat?

564
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,520
You are dreaming!

565
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,240
You’ll eat whatever I cook.

566
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,800

570
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,240
Mom,

571
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,600
it’s the dog.

572
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,200
I recently got a dog named Wealth Yuan.

573
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,280
It just barked.

574
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Why can a dog talk like a man?

575
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,960
No.

576
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,040
Mom, you heard it wrong.

577
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,120
Mom, what do you want with me?

578
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,200
I just want to ask whether you have bought the ticket
for New Year’s Day.

579
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:21,920
Well…

580
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,800
I… I’ll buy the ticket

581
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,680
as soon as the company announces the holiday.

582
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,680
Hurry up.

583
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,040
Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to get a ticket.

584
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,520
Jun,

585
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,480
I’m telling you.

586
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,920
I have prepared a lot of delicious food for you,

587
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,680
including your favorite rice noodles.

588
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,800
Ok.

589
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,280
Mom, you…

590
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,200
Where are you, Jun?

591
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,920
My dog has diarrhea.

592
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,760
Don’t keep a dog if you live alone,

593
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,400
Jun.

594
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,000
Ok, Mom.

595
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,280
I think you’re sleepy. You should go to bed.

596
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,600
I’ll call you next time. See you on New Year’s Day.

597
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Bye. I love you, Mom.

598
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,760
Is it fun?

599
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,440
Is it fun?

600
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,360
You…

601
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,520
I was wrong! My apologies!

602
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,240
I was wrong! My apologies!

603
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,960
-Were you wrong?
-I…

604
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,680
Were you wrong?

605
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,160
I was wrong. I was wrong.

606
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,360
Why didn’t you let me talk to your mom?

607
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,320
We haven’t been together very long.

608
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,800
I haven’t told my mom yet.

609
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
It’s not like you don’t know my mom.

610
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,840
If she sees me

611
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,360
with a man at night,

612
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,680
she’ll be scared into tears.

613
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,360
Yes.

614
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,480
She is like you.

615
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,080
It’s like there’s a faucet on your face.

616
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,440
Your tears come so quickly.

617
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
There’s a faucet on your face!

618
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,640
Wealth,

619
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,480
bite him.

620
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,800
So,

621
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,640
you’re going home for New Year’s Day?

622
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,800
Isn’t that normal?

623
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,800
You know my parents are both abroad.

624
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,680
I know that.

625
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,120
Then if you go home for the New Year,

626
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,480
I’ll be the only one in Shanghai.

627
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,600
What?

628
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,120
You want to go home with me
to meet your mother-in-law?

629
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,720
Why not?

630
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,640
You are dreaming!

631
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,280
I haven’t seen her for a long time.

632
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,280
I haven’t seen your parents

633
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,200
since I went abroad.

634
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,800
I really miss your dad’s rice noodles.

635
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,800
It’s a taste I can’t stop thinking about now.

636
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,800
What?

637
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,920
You might never see my dad again.

638
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,550
My dad passed away five years ago.

639
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,000
What happened?

640
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,360
A sudden heart attack.

641
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,320
After you moved abroad,

642
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,800
he and his friends

643
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,240
created a brand of rice noodles in partnership.

644
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,240
It was called Yixianqian.

645
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,720
Yixianqian?

646
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,680
I remember that Yixianqian

647
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,320
is the flagship product of C Group.

648
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,720
So this rice noodle brand was made by your dad?

649
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,630
Yes.

650
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,240
He built it step by step.

651
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,320
From offline to online,

652
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,720
it gradually grew stronger.

653
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,160
Its production was also increasing.

654
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,480
But my dad was not good at business,

655
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,440
so he turned to MH for financing.

656
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,000
My mom said

657
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,400
it was MH

658
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,720
that made Yixianqian be bought by C Group.

659
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,120
But then,

660
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,960
they wanted to turn my dad’s work

661
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,800
into cheap homemade rice noodles.

662
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,360
Both taste and ingredients

663
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,600
were greatly compromised.

664
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,040
My dad got so mad that he got sick

665
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,160
and passed away.

666
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,000
So you wanted to join MH

667
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,680
because of your dad?

668
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,000
Right.

669
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,160
My professor told me

670
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,040
that the law of jungle

671
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,200
is the real world of capital.

672
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,960
So I was determined to join MH and see,

673
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,760
in the financing circle,

674
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,440
whether there is only cruel competition

675
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,440
and in front of interests,

676
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,000
kindness and conscience

677
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,080
are only at the bottom of the list.

678
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,840
You’ve been here for half a year.

679
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,200
What do you think of it?

680
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,800
I don’t judge others.

681
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,440
But at least in you,

682
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,840
I see hope.

683
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,120
Whether it is Deng Ke or Wan Shan

684
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,240
or Zhu Youyi,

685
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
you didn’t put your interests first.

686
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,000
You are wrong.

687
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,000
I am also a person who deals with capital.

688
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,560
But,

689
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,680
some people are shortsighted.

690
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,640
They only see the immediate interests,

691
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
so they earn fast and die fast, too.

692
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,440
I’m not like them.

693
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,800
I take the long view.

694
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,440
I’m more interested in long-term benefits.

695
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,520
Only by respecting capital

696
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
and treating capital well

697
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,480
can you benefit from capital.

698
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,440
Little girl,

699
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,360
you still have a lot to learn.

700
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,080
Master Yuan, I’m enlightened.

701
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,040
So,

702
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,960
can I go home with you
to celebrate the New Year?

703
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Yes.

704
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,560
But you have to stand my mom’s test

705
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,800
before you can tell her our relationship.

706
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,920
No problem!

707
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,440
She liked me when I was a kid.

708
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,360
Now,

709
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,640
she’ll like me, too.

710
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,360
Not necessarily.

711
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,440
There’s something I didn’t tell you.

712
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,640
The man who stole my notes

713
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,240
was always my mom’s number one enemy.

714
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,080
I’m still hiding it for you.

715
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,880
If my mom finds out that, you’re doomed.

716
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,480
Why can’t we get through this?

717
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,760
The speech thing…

718
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,480
You deserve it.

719
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,920
Who asked you to do that?

720
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,640
-Still talking about it?
-What are you doing?

721
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,200
What are you doing?

722
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,720
-Still talking about it?
-What are you doing?

723
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,400
Itchy!

724
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,720
Crayfish?

725
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,360
Ok.

726
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,560
Peanuts and edamame?

727
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,200
Ok.

728
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,360
Escargot?

729
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,720
I’ll eat whatever you order.

730
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,560
Ok, boss.

731
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,120
Then it’s up to me.

732
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,320
Sir,

733
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,600
I want each of the things I just said.

734
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,080
And then I’ll have this and this,

735
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,880
and this.

736
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,200
Ok.

737
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,800
Thanks.

738
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,280
Xu Li.

739
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,680
I was thinking of

740
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,360
doing a program for West World

741
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,200
to increase the matching value.

742
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,320
What program?

743
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,600
You raise a plant

744
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,440
with the one you love.

745
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,080
When you find that

746
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,000
you like him a little bit more,

747
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,680
you can help him to water.

748
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,080
If the two people water the plant
more than ten times,

749
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,720
the plant will grow,

750
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,120
and their match value will increase.

751
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,080
What do you think?

752
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,680
People can actually increase
the degree of match like this.

753
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,040
What about me? Can I use it?

754
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,760
Yes.

755
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,040
It’s just that I haven’t decided

756
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,800
whether to use pine or banyan for this plant.

757
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,080
Pine?

758
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,480
Do you want to wish your users a long life?

759
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,880
I think since it’s an app

760
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,040
about love,

761
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,680
why not use forget-me-not?

762
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,680
Its meaning is the eternal love.

763
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,760
It also sounds great. What do you think?

764
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,280
Ok.

765
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,080
Just forget-me-not.

766
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,120
-Here is your food.
-Thanks.

767
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,920
Thanks.

768
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,360
You are welcome.

769
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,720
Thanks.

770
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,520
Xiaochuan.

771
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,840
Are you going home for New Year’s Day this year?

772
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,360
Isn’t it just a festival?

773
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,840
It is just a way

774
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,400
created by people to maintain

775
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,720
the so-called friendship and love.

776
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,560
It’s nothing to me.

777
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,800
Why?

778
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,800
You will be very happy on New Year’s Day.

779
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,600
You think about it.

780
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,920
Life is already so boring.

781
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,280
We’re all looking forward to it,

782
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,480
hoping we can take a vacation.

783
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,640
That way,

784
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,600
you can go home and be with your family.

785
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,840
If you can spend time with someone you like,

786
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,680
it’s so much better.

787
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,360
Even if you are going to spend it alone,

788
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,720
you can use it as a pretext

789
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,280
to take a holiday

790
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,240
and reward yourself.

791
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,040
Life needs to be a little ritual.

792
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,360
But I really don’t want to get together

793
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,760
with my seven sisters-in-law and three uncles.

794
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,120
It’s the seven aunts.

795
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,800
Don’t change the idiom.

796
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I do have seven sisters-in-law and three uncles.

797
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,520
And my three uncles

798
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,360
particularly want to introduce
their friend’s granddaughter to me.

799
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,480
Introduce granddaughter to you?

800
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,880
Then you’d better not go back home!

801
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,680
Weren’t you talking about

802
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,000
how great it was for family reunion?

803
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,680
I just think

804
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,560
that

805
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,480
your home is abroad.

806
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,320
You’ll have to fly back. It’s far away.

807
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,240
The air tickets are so expensive.

808
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,960
And you’re working on this app.

809
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,520
You’d better focus on your career.

810
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,240
Am I right?

811
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,080
Ok.

812
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,240
What about you?

813
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,680
What are you doing during the New Year?

814
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,880
I’ll just go home.

815
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,120
My mom misses me so much.

816
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,120
Eat something.

817
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,800
Thanks.

818
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,960
Brother Bao, you are in luck.

819
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,520
It’s not that I’m in luck.

820
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,160
It’s that you are out of luck.

821
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,580
<i>Unknown Caller</i>

822
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,600
Hand out the cards!

823
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,060
<i>Unknown Caller</i>

824
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,600
Hello?

825
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,040
Mr. Cao.

826
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,040
This is Du Lei. Remember me?

827
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:29,840
Why?

828
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,080
Why did you contact me?

829
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
Did Linda tell you to call me?

830
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,720
Sort of.

831
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,720
Cao Heng,

832
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,840
you want to escape again?

833
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,400
How much do you owe me?

834
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,240
Brother Bao,

835
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,600
how dare I run?

836
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,560
I’m answering a phone call.

837
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,200
I’ll be back in a minute.

838
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,840
In a minute. In a minute.

839
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,520
You play first.

840
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,160
Let me tell you this.

841
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,840
What happened before has nothing to do with me!

842
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,240
Don’t bother me anymore!

843
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,960
Don’t get so irritated.

844
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,560
Of course I know you had nothing to do

845
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,440
with what happened.

846
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,040
It’s just that

847
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,320
you’ve been on Linda’s mind lately.

848
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,680
She is wondering if there is anything

849
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,960
we can do for you.

850
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,640
Why don’t we meet first?

851
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
It’s not convenient for me right now.

852
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,800
I am far away.

853
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,280
I’ll contact you when I get back.
