00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,370
Episode 21

3
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,200
In fact,

4
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,400
the two of us could be

5
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,080
in any kind of relationship.

6
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,080
But not this one.

7
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,760
Why?

8
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,640
Because you are

9
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,840
always a sister to me

10
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,000
I don’t just want to be your sister!

11
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,040
Can’t you feel it?

12
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,800
For all these years,

13
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,120
I’ve always been with you and protecting you.

14
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,600
Everything I’ve done is for you!

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,520
No one would love you

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,760
more than I do in this world!

17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
Don’t reject me again, okay?

18
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,880
Don’t be so cruel to me.

19
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,470
I’ll say yes to whatever you want.

20
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
I can change the things

21
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,560
you don’t like about me.

22
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,320
I know I’m stubborn and bossy,

23
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,760
but I can change for you!

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
As long as you don’t leave me!

25
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Don’t leave me.

26
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,760
Sister.

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,520
I have someone I like.

28
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
She gave me hope to start over.

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
What hope?

30
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,440
I can’t give you such hope?

31
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,880
You can’t.

32
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Miss Du.

33
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,400
It’s the file you asked for.

34
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,980
<i>Employee Registration Form Jiang Jun</i>

35
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,020
<i>Father: Jiang Yaoming
Former CEO of Jiangnan Corporation Passed Away</i>

36
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,080
Yuan Shuai!

37
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,440
Yuan Shuai!

38
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,600
Xiaochuan!

39
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,280
What?

40
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,120
Xiaochuan!

41
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,600
Xiao…

42
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,320
Sorry.

43
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,640
I’ve got a pop-up.

44
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,550
Stop!

45
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,080
Give me your phone!

46
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,600
No!

47
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,160
No!

48
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Give me back!

49
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,480
Give me your…

50
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,550
Give me your phone!

51
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,560
Come on!

52
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,280
Give me!

53
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,520
Now, tell us.

54
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,240
What are you doing here tonight?

55
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,120
I’m just here

56
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,800
to interview the only

57
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,320
100% matched users

58
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,240
of our West World.

59
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,280
But when I was about to knock the door,

60
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,920
I saw…

61
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,680
Shut up!

62
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,120
Delete the video you took.

63
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,960
Delete it!

64
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,880
I can’t.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,520
Do it!

66
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,440
So you are here for an interview.

67
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
How can we help you with that?

68
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,440
It’s very easy.

69
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,080
You just need

70
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,480
to answer some simple questions.

71
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,520
But,

72
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,760
you’ve got

73
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,160
to be honest.

74
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,840
You can’t lie.

75
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,320
Okay, Brother?

76
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,400
Go ahead.

77
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,000
Alright.

78
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
Let’s get it started.

79
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,080
The first question.

80
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,760
Why do you two stop

81
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,400
using West World?

82
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
Wait! You don’t have to answer this.

83
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,000
Because you two have

84
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,320
been matched up successfully.

85
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,800
It means my data are quite accurate.

86
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,080
I’ll delete this question.

87
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,440
The second one. Hurry!

88
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,480
Okay, the second question.

89
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,920
When did you start

90
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,800
having feelings for each other?

91
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
I… It’s just…

92
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,640
It’s just happened recently.

93
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,480
He’s lying!

94
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,440
He’s been into me for over 10 years.

95
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,960
How… How did you know?

96
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,120
“Before I go, I want to tell you a secret.

97
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
A secret that only a silly girl like you

98
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,960
can’t find out.

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
I’ve always had a crush on you.”

100
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,360
Sorry.

101
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,320
I found your treasure box by accident.

102
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,760
What about you then?

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,640
When did you have feelings for me?

104
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,840
Just… Just recently.

105
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,640
I’m not sure.

106
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,880
Now, next question.

107
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,560
Are you planning

108
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,920
on taking your relationship

109
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,560
to the next level?

110
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,300
What’s the next level?

111
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,520
You know.

112
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,400
You’re going to…

113
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,120
Stop it!

114
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,000
Stop asking.

115
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,160
It’s time for us to sleep.

116
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,640
Just… Get out.

117
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,640
Shut up!

118
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,120
I haven’t finished yet!

119
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,880
Stop asking!

120
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,760
What do you…

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,360
Just get out!

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,520
Get out!

123
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,480
Please… Give me more time next time!

124
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
There’s no next time!

125
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,640
Out!

126
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,960
Get out, now.

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,160
And delete the video you took.

128
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,320
Got it?

129
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,480
Delete it!

130
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,040
I won’t!

131
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Li Xiaochuan!

132
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,840
You punk!

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,480
What’s the next level?

134
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,560
Do you wanna know about it?

135
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,360
Kinda!

136
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,160
Is it okay?

137
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,800
Don’t leave me ever again!

138
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,240
We’ve kissed.

139
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,440
No one can leave.

140
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,280
Morning.

141
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,520
Did you sleep well?

142
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,920
Very well.

143
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,640
You?

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,680
Not bad.

145
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,280
Good.

146
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,520
Go freshen up.

147
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,000
I’ll cook breakfast.

148
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,880
Okay.

149
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,200
I’ll be out soon.

150
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,960
We are just having breakfast.

151
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,840
Why are you all

152
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,400
dressed up?

153
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,440
It shows a woman’s taste in fashion.

154
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,360
You don’t understand.

155
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,000
Let me take care of it.

156
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,080
You wanna cook breakfast?

157
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,240
Okay.

158
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,480
Then I’ll wait for the first

159
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,320
breakfast you cook for us.

160
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,400
Go ahead.

161
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,160
I was going to cook for you.

162
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,800
But turns out it was the other way round.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,400
Thank you, Yuan.

164
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Have a taste.

165
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,040
How is it?

166
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,720
To be honest,

167
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,080
I do like your cooking.

168
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,520
Of course!

169
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,440
As long as you like it.

170
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,680
Dig in.

171
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,120
Then please try the milk

172
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,640
I heated up for you in person.

173
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,000
How is it?

174
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,640
Doesn’t it also taste fantastic?

175
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
The microwave did do a good job.

176
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,600
Cheers!

177
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,400
Cheers!

178
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
I’ll cook you breakfast every day in the future.

179
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,320
Morning, Mr. Yuan.

180
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,160
Morning.

181
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,200
Morning, Mr. Yuan.

182
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,400
Chen Yicheng.

183
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,720
Your suit

184
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,200
is quite nice today! Very handsome!

185
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
Especially your tie. Look!

186
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
It’s the highlight.

187
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,160
Nice!

188
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,560
Keep it up!

189
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,680
Thank you, Mr. Yuan!

190
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,240
Morning, Mr. Yuan!

191
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,600
Shen Xin, the color

192
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
of your lip gloss is so pretty! Is it new?

193
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,000
A friend of mine helped me
to get this maple color.

194
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,440
Good choice, isn’t it?

195
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
It’s perfect for you!

196
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,440
Really?

197
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,640
Keep using it!

198
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,000
I will!

199
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,280
Jiang Jun.

200
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,920
Morning, Mr. Yuan.

201
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,000
You look good today.

202
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,680
I bet you slept very well last night.

203
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,640
Thank you for asking, Mr. Yuan.

204
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,880
I did sleep very well.

205
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,800
Hope you’ll sleep well again tonight.

206
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,680
Go to your office!

207
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
Even the air is fresher today.

208
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,120
It’s going to be a perfect day.

209
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,740
Boss.

210
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,500
Kelang just gave us some new documents.

211
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,920
I need you to sign it.

212
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,040
Sure.

213
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,280
One more thing.

214
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,880
You know that Xinxin is visiting.

215
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,200
I want to take a few days off to be her company.

216
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Of course!

217
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,640
You should spend more time with her.

218
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,800
Boss,

219
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,560
I mean I wanna take my annual leave.

220
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,400
What else could it be?

221
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,400
Just go submit your application later.

222
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,040
Go ahead.

223
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
Enjoy yourself.

224
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,240
OMG!

225
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,520
Is this really Yuan Shuai?

226
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,440
Could it be that there’s a breakthrough
in your relationship?

227
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,160
I just knew it!

228
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,040
After living together

229
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,200
for so long,

230
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,000
something’s gotta happen sooner or later.

231
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,760
Cut it out!

232
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
I said nothing.

233
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,760
It’s all your assumption.

234
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,880
Boss.

235
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,680
Am I of a great help to you this time?

236
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,600
You owe me one!

237
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,720
Su Chang.

238
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,640
Do you still want to take your annual leave?

239
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,720
Is it nice to stay in 701?

240
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,680
I do have Xinxin’s phone number.

241
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,160
Boss! Boss!

242
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Don’t forget there’s a meeting later.

243
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,120
I know.

244
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,400
I’m leaving.

245
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,680
You look so happy today.

246
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,560
Anything you wanna share with me?

247
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,520
Nothing special. It’s just the good weather.

248
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,560
It puts me in a good mood.

249
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,360
It’s okay if you don’t wanna tell me.

250
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,240
Petty!

251
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,400
Mr. Yuan.

252
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,200
Mr. Yuan.

253
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,240
Hi.

254
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,280
Mr. Yuan!

255
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,120
Jiang Jun, which cup is for me?

256
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,360
This. This one.

257
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,600
Thank you.

258
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,600
Jiang Jun makes good tea.

259
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,040
Go on.

260
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,160
Have some more

261
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,160
since she makes very good tea.

262
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,120
Jiang Jun!

263
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,360
When we have the meeting,

264
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,920
make a cup of tea for

265
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,240
each and every one of us.

266
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,560
Drinking more tea in this weather
is good for health,

267
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,400
you know?

268
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,560
Okay, Mr. Yuan.

269
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,280
Make the tea.

270
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,900
Okay.

271
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,920
Tea.

272
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,480
Then go ahead.

273
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,600
Ms. Qiao.

274
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,400
Mr. Yuan.

275
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,720
Alright.

276
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,760
We are all here. Let’s begin.

277
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,720
Okay, Mr. Yuan.

278
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,640
Now, today’s report

279
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,800
is about the market research

280
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,960
we are going to carry out

281
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,120
regarding the IPO

282
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,920
of Wanxing Entertainment Group.

283
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,680
Wanxing already had a market value

284
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,600
of 30 billion yuan in 2003.

285
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,400
Its IPO has grown by more than

286
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,720
10% in the first quarter.

287
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,080
In the second and third quarters,

288
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,560
it’ll increase to 215.2 billion yuan.

289
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,600
Besides,

290
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,960
as the largest online music streaming platform,

291
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
the number of Wanxing’s users

292
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,840
has reached

293
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,040
579 million.

294
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,960
This is the part of them.

295
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,600
In a word,

296
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,080
the company put a lot of efforts

297
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
into the case of Wanxing Entertainment.

298
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,320
I believe that we can

299
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,440
accomplish the mission.

300
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,280
Good.

301
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,840
Well done, everybody.

302
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,160
A few days ago,

303
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,520
you were asked to find more clients

304
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,000
for IPO and the refinancing business.

305
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,400
Remember to submit the file and list.

306
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,240
Okay.

307
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,640
That’s all for today.

308
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,360
I don’t know why,

309
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,720
but when I sat next to Ms. Qiao just now,

310
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
I felt the atmosphere was quite intense.

311
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,320
How did you feel that?

312
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,320
It’s a woman’s sixth sense. You won’t get it.

313
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,960
To tell you the truth,

314
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,960
when I met Mr. Yuan’s eyes,

315
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,280
I was a little scared, too.

316
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,640
They both look strange today.

317
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,680
Thank God that I played up to Mr. Yuan in time

318
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,520
and escaped a big trouble.

319
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
Otherwise, my report wouldn’t be approved

320
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
until next year.

321
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
Maybe there’ll be a big change
in the management team.

322
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,680
I don’t think so.

323
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,640
I think it’s all because of the mood.

324
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,440
No way.

325
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,200
It’s not that easy.

326
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,320
Chen Yicheng.

327
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,040
Bring a copy of your report

328
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,800
to my office later.

329
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,040
I’ll sort it out

330
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,000
and give it to you soon.

331
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,520
Okay.

332
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,480
Life and death are the two noblest ways

333
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
of showing courage.

334
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,480
I’ve got to choose one today.

335
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,000
It’s not that serious.

336
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,200
Let me sound him out for you first.

337
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,560
Come in.

338
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,040
Mr. Yuan, this needs your signature.

339
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
Why are you looking at me? Sign it.

340
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,480
What’s the rush?

341
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,380
<i>Yuan Shuai</i>

342
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,200
Done.

343
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,920
Stop looking at me! The others will see us!

344
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,280
They’ll see us!

345
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,040
They can’t!

346
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,240
Mr. Yuan.

347
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,320
It’s the report. Please review.

348
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,960
Just a sec.

349
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,440
You’ve got what I said?

350
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,640
Okay. Go back to work.

351
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,520
Alright, Mr. Yuan.

352
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
Let’s go home together tonight.

353
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Watch it! You are so careless!

354
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
Sorry, Ms. Qiao!

355
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,640
You look great today.

356
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,360
Nice makeup, new clothes,

357
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,000
and even a new perfume.

358
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,520
What?

359
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,240
You are in love?

360
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Since your boyfriend chooses

361
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,000
to date a girl who works in the investment bank,

362
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,400
hope he can understand

363
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,680
our busy schedule.

364
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,040
I’ve read the files you submitted.

365
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,720
I think you did a good job.

366
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,400
But I need more information
about a few companies.

367
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,120
How about this?

368
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,920
I need you to work overtime today

369
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,840
to sort out all the materials.

370
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,200
We’ll have a meeting tomorrow to discuss them.

371
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,960
Okay?

372
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,400
What? You’ve had a plan for tonight?

373
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,560
No.

374
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,840
Okay, Ms. Qiao,

375
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,880
I’ll get it done as soon as possible.

376
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,760
Hi, Mr. Perfect,

377
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,760
you go home first tonight.

378
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,200
I need to work overtime.

379
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,880
Do you need me to stay and be your company?

380
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,870
It’s alright.

381
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,070
I can take care of it myself.

382
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,160
Okay.

383
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,840
Then try to be home early, Miss Perfect.

384
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I’ll do my best, Mr. Perfect.

385
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,180
<i>Exit</i>

386
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,740
Watch it! You are so careless!

387
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,160
<i>Let’s go home together tonight.</i>
Watch it! You are so careless!

388
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,700
<i>Let’s go home together tonight.</i>

389
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,520
You are still working on it?

390
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,840
You scared me!

391
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,720
With your pace,

392
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
these companies might already

393
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
go public when you finish sorting them out.

394
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,800
I thought I asked you to go home first.

395
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,480
I’m worried

396
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,400
that someone can’t get her job done,

397
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,800
and I have to return to an empty house alone.

398
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,000
Nobody is here!

399
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Anybody? Anybody? Anybody?

400
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,200
No one’s here.

401
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,040
Alright.

402
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,960
Just give me a little more time. I’ll finish soon.

403
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Let’s go home first.

404
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,080
I’ll help you after we are home.

405
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,280
I promise you’ll double your pace.

406
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,600
No, I have to do it myself.

407
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,560
It’s a good opportunity to learn.

408
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,440
Go away! You are interrupting my work!

409
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,560
I won’t!

410
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,920
Go away!

411
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,880
I won’t!

412
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,400
Okay, you win.

413
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,320
Let’s go home.

414
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,760
Ms. Qiao!

415
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,520
Why are you back?

416
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,240
I just fetched some files from the meeting room.

417
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,560
Are you alone?

418
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,720
Yes.

419
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,200
I need to stretch my arms.

420
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
They are so sore!

421
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,640
What’s wrong with your lips?

422
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,520
Your lipstick is smudged.

423
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,520
Well…

424
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,680
I just ordered a takeout. It was too spicy.

425
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,080
Really spicy!

426
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,480
No wonder there’s a weird smell in the office.

427
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,240
Don’t eat something pungent

428
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,160
in the office again.

429
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,640
I heard you, Ms. Qiao.

430
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Remember to fix

431
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
your makeup before you go.

432
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,840
Don’t affect the image of our company.

433
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,920
Sure.

434
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,160
Ms. Qiao, have a good evening!

435
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,880
Come out. She’s gone.

436
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,120
Good for you, Jiang Jun.

437
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
I’ve always been an honest and frank man,

438
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,680
yet you just pressed me under the table.

439
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,720
And you kicked me!

440
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,800
Sorry.

441
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,360
Consider it a favor for me, okay?

442
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,360
Are you seducing me?

443
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,840
I am. So what?

444
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:03,660
<i>To: MH Admin Dept. MH HR Dept.</i>

445
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,600
I don’t want to hurt you.

446
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,360
But I’m really sorry.

447
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,840
I already have a girl I like.

448
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,480
Why turn the light on?

449
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,800
The atmosphere is just right.

450
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
What atmosphere?

451
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,600
What do you think?

452
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,120
Good evening!

453
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,760
Enjoy the kiss?

454
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,440
You…

455
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,520
What are you doing here?

456
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,080
That’s what I wanna ask you!

457
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,760
I… I…

458
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,640
I… I…

459
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,200
I…

460
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,320
I… I…

461
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,520
You…

462
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,120
I… We…

463
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,200
We…

464
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,520
You two…

465
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,400
Well,

466
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,320
he feels a little under the weather today.

467
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,880
So I got him on the couch to take a rest.

468
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,200
I got a stomach ache.

469
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,040
Stomach ache can be cured by your kiss?

470
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,520
Actually, I…

471
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,320
I was…

472
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,080
Shut up!

473
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,680
Did I talk to you?

474
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,440
I’ll go cook.

475
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,080
Cook.

476
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,160
Li, what’s up?

477
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,160
Anything happened?

478
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,720
Go on! Keep pretending!

479
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,120
Come on, what’s going on?

480
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,920
You wanna be the “Best Actress” or what?

481
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,440
Xiaochuan already told me everything!

482
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,780
<i>West World</i>

483
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,320
Xu Li.

484
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,400
Here. Have some breakfast!

485
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,840
You got the breakfast for the two of us?

486
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,000
Yes.

487
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,120
This is a celebration meal I prepared.

488
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,640
Celebration?

489
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,800
For what?

490
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,920
You don’t know?

491
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,840
The first 100% matched couple

492
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,680
of our West World

493
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,440
is in a serious relationship now!

494
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,240
Really?

495
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,880
Wait.

496
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,960
You mean Yuan Shuai and Jun

497
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,800
are together now?

498
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,360
Yuan Shuai!

499
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,920
Xiaochuan!

500
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,800
What?

501
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,880
-Too excited to talk?
-Xiaochuan!

502
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,030
Spill it!

503
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,000
When did you fall for this devil?

504
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,480
Who’s devil?

505
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,110
I’m right here!

506
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,280
Can’t… Can’t you

507
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,280
be nice?

508
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,480
Did I ask you to talk?

509
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,280
Fine.

510
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,800
Actually, we just found out
each other’s feelings recently.

511
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,280
Each other’s feelings?

512
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,680
You fell for him already?

513
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,160
No! As your best friend, I won’t allow this!

514
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,240
It’s so yummy!

515
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,280
Chef Yuan,

516
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,320
look at you!

517
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,040
You are good-looking, successful, educated,

518
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,000
and have a better-off family.

519
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,040
Moreover, you are a big boss,

520
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,240
and good at cooking!

521
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,920
Jun.

522
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,040
It’s so tasty!

523
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,960
I think someone just said

524
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,560
that I was

525
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,640
a devil.

526
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,400
Really?

527
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,480
How short-sighted!

528
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,400
Bah!

529
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,360
How can our Chef Yuan be a devil?

530
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,120
You are an awesome guy.

531
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,240
Well said!

532
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,160
Here.

533
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Have some soup.

534
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,320
Very tasty.

535
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,320
Here.

536
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,760
Thanks.

537
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,400
Try it.

538
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,920
Wait a sec.

539
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,480
You are also Xiaochuan’s cousin.

540
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
Family members are always alike.

541
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,240
It’s such a perfect arrangement.

542
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,720
Hadn’t Jun told me

543
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,920
that you were weird,

544
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,400
hard to deal with, and…

545
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,440
I would’ve already matched you guys up!

546
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,960
Weird? Hard to deal with? Huh?

547
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,040
Let’s eat.

548
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,040
Let’s eat.

549
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,200
But, with that being said,

550
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,560
since you are seeing each other,

551
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,520
why did you keep it from me?

552
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,600
I won’t hide it from you anymore.

553
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
It’s okay. We are family.

554
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,840
Come on, let’s eat! Go on!

555
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,000
Have some more

556
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,240
since you like it.

557
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,680
The soup is so yummy!

558
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,280
I’ll bring Xiaochuan here next time

559
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,480
and try more of your cooking.

560
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,400
Anytime!

561
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,760
Tell me what you wanna eat.

562
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,960
I’ll cook for you.

563
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,080
No problem. Jun’s home is my home.

564
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,040
I will come again.

565
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,680
Okay. I’m full.

566
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,000
I won’t be a third wheel now.

567
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,040
Enjoy your couple’s time.

568
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,480
You are really full?

569
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,200
Are you leaving?

570
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,360
Thank you.

571
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,240
You are?

572
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,280
Come again!

573
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,080
Okay!

574
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,360
Clean your mouth!

575
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Okay! I will!

576
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
I’m leaving! Bye!

577
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,040
Bye!

578
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,880
Be safe on the way!

579
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,760
Okay!

580
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,240
Are you full?

581
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,640
Pretty much.

582
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,320
So it’s my turn next.

583
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,640
Your turn for what?

584
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,960
What do you think?

585
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,080
Run?

586
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Does it have to be 100%

587
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,080
to be together?

588
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,140
<i>Garbage Can</i>

589
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,880
I don’t believe I can’t throw it in!

590
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
There’s no goal I can’t score in this world!

591
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,000
I’m sure of it!

592
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,240
There’s no way that an outstanding girl

593
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,320
like me can’t be Li Xiaochuan’s match!

594
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,760
It’s just some app data.

595
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,760
I’m sure I can work my way up

596
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,040
from 1% to 100%

597
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,280
through my hard work!

598
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,080
Keep fighting!

599
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,240
1% girl

600
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,040
can change West World, too!

601
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
I’ll change the world!

602
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,320
Ms. Qiao.

603
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,200
Mr. Fan wants to see you in his office.

604
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,120
Mr. Fan.

605
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,960
Have a look at this first!

606
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,480
Are you unhappy

607
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,680
about our company?

608
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,160
Mr. Yuan.

609
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,280
Is this how you manage your subordinates?

610
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,680
Ms. Qiao, you’ve been in charge

611
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,240
of the financing plan of Yuanyang Group.

612
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,280
How could such a ridiculous situation happen?

613
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,760
Dealing with numbers is

614
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,080
what we do in the investment bank.

615
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,600
A miss is as good as a mile!

616
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
How could you give the plan to the client

617
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,960
without reviewing it?

618
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,520
The client has already carried

619
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,600
out their work accordingly,

620
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,480
and a big mistake has been made!

621
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,440
Tell me,

622
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,160
who should take

623
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,960
responsibility for the loss?

624
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,880
I need to take

625
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,000
inescapable responsibility for what happened.

626
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,120
Ms. Qiao and I will go apologize

627
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,480
to the client later

628
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,480
and

629
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
give them a new financing plan.

630
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,080
A new plan?

631
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,080
You made it sound so easy!

632
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,360
First,

633
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,960
the time for financing has been released.

634
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,680
Second,

635
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
the competitor has known about this plan,

636
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
which can’t be used anymore.

637
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,480
Third,

638
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,960
it’d take at least

639
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,920
a week to come up with a new plan.

640
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
So tell me,

641
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,200
how should I explain to the client?

642
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,600
Sorry, Mr. Fan.

643
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,200
This happened because of my dereliction of duty.

644
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,960
Mr. Yuan has nothing

645
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,200
to do with this.

646
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,120
I’m willing to take the blame and resign.

647
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,640
And I’ll take the responsibility

648
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,000
for our company’s loss and the client’s.

649
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
How can you manage to do that?

650
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,760
Just drop it, Qiao Na.

651
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,120
Mr. Fan.

652
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,680
As Ms. Qiao’s supervisor,

653
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,760
I also failed in managing my subordinate.

654
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,920
I promise

655
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,600
I’ll give the client a new

656
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,520
financing plan in 24 hours.

657
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,400
Rest assured.

658
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,640
If we make

659
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
any mistake again,

660
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,360
I will leave MH

661
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,120
together with Ms. Qiao.

662
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,480
24 hours?

663
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,920
24 hours.

664
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,200
Okay.

665
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,680
So, you’ve made me a promise.

666
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,600
Alright.

667
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,840
I’ll wait

668
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,520
for the new plan tomorrow.

669
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,200
If the client is not satisfied with it,

670
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,800
you’ll both

671
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,600
get fired!
