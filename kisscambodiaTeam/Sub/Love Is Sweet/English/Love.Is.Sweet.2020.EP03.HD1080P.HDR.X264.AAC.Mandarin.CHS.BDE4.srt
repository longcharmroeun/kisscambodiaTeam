1
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 3

3
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,840
Hi.

4
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,080
Is that how you dress for the interview?

5
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
None of your business.

6
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,560
I remember that I introduced a job

7
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
with a salary of 300,000 yuan per year for you.

8
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,280
After all, people who are rejected

9
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,520
in the last interview of MH

10
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,000
are still wanted by many companies.

11
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Investment banking is so cruel

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,400
and is not for you.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Don’t be so sure.

14
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,160
Beware of being

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,480
proven wrong.

16
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
Why is there a feeling of foreboding?

17
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,720
Hello,

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,240
I’m here to go through the entry formalities.

19
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,840
I’m Jiang Jun.

20
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,040
Hello, this way please.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,520
Have a seat.

22
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,760
Wasn’t Jiang Jun rejected in the last round

23
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,360
of interview?

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,920
The People’s Bank of China has incorporated

25
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,040
special bonds of local governments

26
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,520
into the system of social financing scale.

27
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,400
Daily statistics of the special bonds

28
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,040
will be registered in the custodian institution

29
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,560
by creditor’s rights and debts.

30
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
This is my report.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,120
Do you know what your best performance is?

32
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Your complexion.

33
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,040
You look the best in the whole company.

34
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,120
My complexion?

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,640
Don’t you know that?

36
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,160
In MH,

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,079
if a person has enough sleep

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,320
and is energetic,

39
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,440
that means he or is not completely

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,600
absorbed in his work at all.

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
The C round of funding
of Bluestar PR has no result.

42
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,000
But you don’t even know

43
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,760
what went wrong.

44
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
The industry is in recession and

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,880
capital is on the sidelines.

46
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,360
The financing has not been forthcoming…

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
You are in recession.

48
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,160
This is the resignation.

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Go sign your name on it

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,000
and send it to my office in the afternoon.

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,640
Mr. Yuan,

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,200
please give me one more chance.

53
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,320
Chance is for people in the right state.

54
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,400
Sorry,

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,840
there is no chance for you.

56
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
Mr. Yuan, I’ll get married next week.

57
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,000
How can I explain this

58
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,240
if I resign now?

59
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Just tell them that

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
nothing is in the way of your marriage now.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,440
Get out.

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,159
Mr. Yuan…

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,120
Get out!

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
MH is the top investment banking department

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,360
of a Shanghai securities dealer,

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,640
If we stand at the top of the pyramid,

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,960
we need the crisis sense of being replaced.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,560
So, in MH, efficiency first.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,120
Today, we got four new members

70
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
who passed the one in a hundred interview

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
and will be officially employed.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,040
Let me introduce them to you formally.

73
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,880
Come on in.

74
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,159
The four of you will have

75
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
a three-month probation period in MH,

76
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,080
during which I will assess you.

77
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,280
The entire MH is

78
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
accomplished by instruction patterns,

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,360
which are like your source codes.

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,200
Once implanted, they’ll run at a high speed

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,360
until the job is finished.

82
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
This is Mr. Fan Qichang’s office.

83
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,800
Don’t get close if there is nothing serious.

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
This is Mr. Ma’s office.

85
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,280
Ma is a man who pays attention to details.

86
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,800
So if any of you are assigned to his group,

87
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,280
be careful of it.

88
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440
This is the printing room.

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,760
This is the data room.

90
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,040
And this is my office.

91
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,960
That is Mr. Yuan’s office.

92
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,440
You must have heard about him,

93
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,240
the invincible God of War in MH.

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,760
As long as he acts,

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,600
there won’t be any unfinished case.

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,920
Well,

97
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,720
I don’t like to see people wear clothes

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,920
of the same color as mine.

99
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,560
So, remember this.

100
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,800
Alright, that’s the entire introduction.

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,840
Any question?

102
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,080
No.

103
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,520
Invincible God of War?

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,200
I’d like to see

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
who he will lose to.

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,480
Sir, I got it.

107
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,880
Mr. Lin Taimo

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
recommended Jiang Jun.

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,159
Lin Taimo?

110
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,900
[Guarantee: Lin Taimo]

111
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
You may leave now.

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,320
Since you are here,

113
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,240
I’ll let you see the cruelty of investment banking

114
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
and then quit willingly.

115
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
Someone really has great background.

116
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,600
With strong support of a senior leader,

117
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,080
even the result of interview can be denied.

118
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,240
If so,

119
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
why bother to go through

120
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,440
the interviews?

121
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
She could enter the company directly.

122
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,640
Then that wouldn’t be an affectation.

123
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,800
Using the will of power

124
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,520
to trample on the fairness of MH.

125
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,880
We really shouldn’t

126
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
associate with this kind of people.

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,960
I guess Mo-tse would be extremely angry

128
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,720
if he could know this kind of things.

129
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,280
What background does Jiang Jun have?

130
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,200
Even the leader supports her.

131
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,880
We should unite

132
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,920
to isolate her.

133
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Why?

134
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,720
She entered MH

135
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,800
with the help of power.

136
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,520
She destroyed the fairness.

137
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,400
That’s right.

138
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
Here. The sugar you want.

139
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,600
Thank you.

140
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,040
Well,

141
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,520
you have anything to say?

142
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,120
Sometimes actions

143
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
are more effective

144
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,520
than any explanation.

145
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
So you don’t have to care so much

146
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,920
about what they say.

147
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,120
Thank you.

148
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,600
But, why are you saying this to me?

149
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
I mean

150
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,240
others always believe

151
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,400
what they want to believe.

152
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,920
Why do you choose to believe me?

153
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,920
I do not believe you.

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,680
But I’m more reluctant to go with the flow

155
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
and believe what they say.

156
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,960
Jiang Jun,

157
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,920
Mr. Yuan asked you to go to his office.

158
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,800
OK.

159
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,880
No matter what,

160
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,480
thank you for saying that to me.

161
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,120
Come in.

162
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,920
What’s up…

163
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,680
Stop thinking that you can stay in MH safely

164
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,640
because you have Lin Taimo as your supporter.

165
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,680
As long as an employee is laggard,

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,840
I have my own way to get him/her to leave.

167
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
This is the information on Kelang Pharmacy.

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,760
Write a due diligence report

169
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
for me as soon as possible.

170
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,640
Don’t let me rush you.

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,600
You can ask Su Chang

172
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
if you have any question.

173
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,160
Kelang Pharmacy is a star enterprise rising

174
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,400
in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years.

175
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,760
They should be regarded as

176
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,280
the company with the highest call

177
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,760
for an IPO.

178
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,480
Remember,

179
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,760
once an employee in probation

180
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,440
has made three mistakes,

181
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,400
he/she will be judged unqualified.

182
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,520
An incomplete report or any error in it

183
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,040
will be considered a mistake.

184
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,920
I will work hard to prove

185
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
that I did not come to MH

186
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,960
because of anyone’s support.

187
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,000
To slap you in your face again,

188
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,320
I will do my best.

189
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,880
You know the forces are reciprocal.

190
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,280
My face hurts and so does your hand.

191
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,320
Why didn’t you give him another chance?

192
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,720
That man, Lu Yuan, is about to get married.

193
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
Dismissal is the result of work errors.

194
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,760
Marriage is

195
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,200
the beginning for a couple to share tribulation.

196
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,440
The two things are not interrelated.

197
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,360
I think you’re so cold-blooded.

198
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,000
This is not what you should care.

199
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,280
What you should do is to learn a lesson.

200
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,400
You kicked me out in the interview.

201
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,640
But now I appeared in MH again.

202
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,680
You can tell me

203
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,920
if you have any problem with it.

204
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,120
You and I

205
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,400
are like an ant and a wheel.

206
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,520
You climb slowly

207
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,080
while I roll ahead.

208
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,720
So great.

209
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,000
Hope you can keep your word.

210
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
Finish the report as soon as possible.

211
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,840
Don’t let me push you.

212
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,720
OK, Mr. Wheel.

213
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,080
I will do my best.

214
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,680
Ms. Ant,

215
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,680
I have a feeling.

216
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,360
You can’t stay in MH

217
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
for more than two weeks.

218
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,600
Enjoy the experience.

219
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,160
You still want to kick me out of MH?

220
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,440
My judgment is always accurate.

221
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,320
At your present state,

222
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,280
you won’t be here for two weeks.

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let’s wait and see.

224
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,160
I feel like a grenade now

225
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,200
which is about to explode.

226
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,920
No stumbling block can stop me

227
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,120
no matter how hard it is.

228
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,800
Do you know how ridiculous

229
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,840
you are now?

230
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,640
Make a music of what you said just now

231
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,320
and sing it to me with tears two weeks later.

232
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,720
In your dream, Mr. Wheel.

233
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,600
Wish you a flat tire.

234
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,920
Jiang Jun,

235
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,800
I have to share my good news with you.

236
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,760
I found a super satisfying job!

237
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,280
That’s my girl.

238
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
It’s so easy for you to find a job.

239
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,720
By the way,

240
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,720
how is your first day at work?

241
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,600
Just got a bunch of statistical chores.

242
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,480
I’m a new comer,

243
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,280
and need to understand a lot of data.

244
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,680
The data in this line are wrong.

245
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,000
Here, here.

246
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,640
Here. There.

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,080
They are all wrong.

248
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960
If you keep writing reports like this,

249
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
you will leave soon.

250
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Write a new one and sent it to my office.

251
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,520
But a cup of Americano downstairs by the way.

252
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,040
No ice.

253
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,040
Me?

254
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,200
Do you see a third person?

255
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,760
I’m the new comer.

256
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,200
I should finish the job

257
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,080
assigned by the leader dutifully.

258
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,240
Our store is a 24-hour convenience store.

259
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
So we need three shifts.

260
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,400
Your main job is to take charge

261
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
of the cashing.

262
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,560
But we don’t have enough staff now.

263
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,880
So maybe you need to help

264
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,160
sort out the goods sometimes. It that OK?

265
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,040
OK.

266
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,440
Good.

267
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,320
Then I’ll teach you

268
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,520
how to use the cashier system.

269
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,160
Look. If there is a customer

270
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,520
who wants to buy a chocolate,

271
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,120
you can see the bar code.

272
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,080
Then just scan

273
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,040
the bar code here,

274
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,800
and the price will be here.

275
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,120
Then we should ask the customer

276
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,800
if he/she wants to use Alipay, Wechat

277
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,760
or cash.

278
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,480
Next…

279
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
Manager, the goods are here. Please have a check.

280
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,040
The replenishment has arrived.

281
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,800
I’ll have a check first.

282
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,120
OK.

283
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
-Familiarize yourself, OK?
-OK.

284
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,720
Alright.

285
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,320
That way. Right.

286
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,960
It’s easy.

287
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,600
The instant noodles are not with their mate.

288
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,320
That color scheme is like poison.

289
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,200
It’s done.

290
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,400
Hello, welcome.

291
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,720
Hello. Welcome…

292
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,400
Welcome.

293
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,240
Check out.

294
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,160
OK.

295
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,920
Is it done?

296
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,320
Why does it take so long?

297
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Sorry.

298
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,400
Can you hurry up?

299
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,880
-Sorry.
-I’m in a rush.

300
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,720
It’s my first day here.

301
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,400
The system went wrong.

302
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,040
Please wait a second.

303
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,400
Thank you.

304
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,840
Excuse me.

305
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,080
Thank you.

306
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,440
Thank you.

307
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,069
Thank you.

308
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,349
Sir,

309
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,000
what can I do for you?

310
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,829
I’m here just to surf the Internet.

311
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,880
This is the network fee.

312
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,860
[CRYSTAL PALACE ARTS BOOKSTORE]

313
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,240
Jiang Jun, are you back at home now?

314
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,520
No.

315
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
Maybe I will go home very late today.

316
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
I’m still in the library looking up information.

317
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,560
I may stay up the whole night.

318
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,120
My poor Jiang Jun.

319
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,640
I’m also working overtime.

320
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,080
But I think it’s good to work overtime now.

321
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
The sunset today is so beautiful.

322
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,080
Nowadays the convenience stores

323
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,560
need supermodel to keep up appearance?

324
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,400
I’m working as a cashier here.

325
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,640
Aren’t you going after your dreams?

326
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,480
I think the environment here is really good.

327
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,200
I’ll give you a chance to tell the truth.

328
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,280
Alright.

329
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
Actually I found a gorgeous guy

330
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,040
in this store.

331
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,440
He perfectly matches the image of my hero.

332
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,560
And he is a regular customer

333

of this store.

334

Go!

A cup of Latte.

349
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,900
OK. A second.

350
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,340
What a coincidence.

351
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,380

352
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,420
Why are you here?

353
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,740
I had an appointment with my friend here.

354
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,340
But seems that my friend will be late.

355
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,060
What about you?

By the way,

358
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,220
thanks to your help in Huiwang Library,

359
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,660
I entered MH successfully.

360
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,740
I haven’t showed my gratitude to you.

361
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,500
Don’t say that.

362
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,460
It’s my pleasure.

363
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,180
And I did nothing special.

364
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,060
But, look at you,

365
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,660
you have been working so hard already.

366
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,540
I guess your boss must be hard to get along with.

367
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,420
More than that!

368
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,020
He is totally a devil!

369
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,900
It’s such hard work.

370
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,660
He must have high hopes for you.

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,140
Ms. Ant,

372
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,940
I have a feeling.

373
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,460
You can’t stay in MH for more than two weeks.

374
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,500
It is pretty high.

375
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
Your Latte is ready.

376
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,700

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,420
Do you mind buy me a coffee?

378
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,420
Of course not.

379
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,740
I should scan here?

380
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,500
Look.

381
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,980
Your due diligence report

382
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,620
only focuses on

383
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,300
the internal statistics of the company

384
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,060
and does not introduce its external investment,

385
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,260
including the investment amounts,

386
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,020
investment proportions,

387
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,820
investment nature

388
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,180
investment income, etc.

389
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,500
Most importantly,

390
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,300
profiles of the companies invested in.

391
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,060
I’m really enlightened

392
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,100
by your guidance.

393
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,300
But, Mr. Du, how come you

394
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,820
know this much about investment banking?

395
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,380
Are you working for an investment bank?

396
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,740
I’m a trainer at an investment bank.

397
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,060
Unfortunately, you have an appointment.

398
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,500
Or I have to treat you dinner.

399
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,740
I owe you twice now.

400
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,020
Hello?

401
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,180
I will go out right away.

402
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,740
Then, I won’t disturb you.

403
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,340
I’m leaving.

404
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,180
It’s not a right time.

405
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,340
Hope I can have a chance

406
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
to have dinner with you.

407
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,660
The report is just finished.

408
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,780
Don’t get it wet.

409
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,580
What about you?

410
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,940
My friend will pick me up.

411
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,660
Alright.

412
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,500
I will find a chance to give it back to you.

413
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,580
I gotta go.

414
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,140
Be careful.

415
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,740
Looks like you got ecstasy.

416
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,380
How about

417
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,540
I going to have dinner alone?

418
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,460
I’m already hungry.

419
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:09,980
Let’s go.

420
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,020
You helped her to meet Lin Taimo?

421
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,660
I have some other considerations.

422
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,620
So I didn’t tell you in advance.

423
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,540
Don’t forget that

424
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,340
you were my student.

425
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,060
You can’t hide anything

426
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,580
you want to do.

427
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,580
You said that

428
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,820
I would win it back.

429
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,860
Looks like you have figured out ways

430
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,060
to defeat Yuan Shuai.

431
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,980
Tian Ji’s strategy.

432
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,140
I let him win one game first.

433
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,140
When I want him to pay back,

434
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,340
he will lose everything.

435
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,220
I like your state now.

436
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,420
You go clear up the information

437
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,700
in your hands.

438
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,260
Alright. That’s all.

439
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,380
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

440
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,300
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

441
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,780
Jiang Jun, wait a second.

442
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,940
I read your

443
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,940
due diligence report on Kelang.

444
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,020
Let me ask you.

445
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,500
What’s the ultimate purpose of the report?

446
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,060
The ultimate purpose of it

447
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,340
is to find out the truth,

448
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,820
not to move data.

449
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,140
Where is the truth you found?

450
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,500
Jiang Jun, remember,

451
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,940
the truth is like a vagrant.

452
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,100
Wait,

453
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,220
what are you talking about? I don’t understand.

454
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,020
The disguise is often

455
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,180
dapper

456
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,180
and elegant,

457
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,420
like a prince.

458
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,140
What about the truth?

459
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,540
The truth is always in the dirtiest,

460
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,620
the most unfair,

461
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,380
and the most obscure corner,

462
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,900
which is filled with anger and resentment.

463
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,180
You think there is no truth

464
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,260
in my report?

465
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,620
Chairman of Kelang was suspected

466
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,820
of transferring the company’s assets.

467
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,740
And the person who wanted to reveal it

468
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,900
was fired.

469
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,380
Do you know what to do now?

470
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,940
You mean

471
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,380
I have to find this person?

472
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,020
Ask Kelang for

473
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,420
all the personnel files

474
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,060
and find the person who was fired,

475
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,620
find out the truth

476
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,060
and write a new report.

477
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,340
OK.

478
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,700
Let me remind you.

479
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,020
The first mission I gave you

480
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,540
has failed.

481
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,260
I told you that

482
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,260
if you fail three times,

483
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,060
you’d quit on your own.

484
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,740
Why staring at me?

485
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,780
It’s useless.

486
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,380
You don’t need to worry.

487
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,100
You still got two chances.

488
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,660
Hello.

489
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,420
Hello.

490
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,460
I’m Jiang Jun, analyst at

491
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,340
MH Investment Banking Department.

492
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,780
I have an appointment with Mr. Deng today.

493
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,740
Sorry,

494
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,020
Mr. Deng went to play golf with his friends.

495
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,740
Play golf?

496
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,220
Could you tell me the address?

497
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,620
I made an appointment with you in advance.

498
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,380
Please wait.

499
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,460
The golf course at North Dongda Road.

500
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,700
OK. Thank you.

501
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,340
Jiang Jun applied to the Legal Department

502
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,260
to send a legal letter to Kelang,

503
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,140
urging them to submit personnel files.

504
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,140
Then?

505
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,340
The Legal Department refused.

506
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,500
But

507
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
Jiang Jun seems to have got a new idea.

508
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,180
As far as I can see,

509
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,500
Jiang Jun is doing well

510
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,660
and determined.

511
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,980
She is not discouraged

512
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,140
because of being oppressed by the vicious power.

513
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,340
Who do you mean by vicious power?

514
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:26,820
I…

515
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,780
I mean, isn’t the work you gave Jiang Jun

516
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,060
a little too difficult?

517
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,020
Everyone who wants to enter MH

518
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,620
have to have the test.

519
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,740
Jiang Jun

520
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,820
is not an exception.

521
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,380
Hello, Mr. Deng.

522
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,500
[Deng Ke Chairman of Kelang Pharmacy]

523
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,420
Hello. You are…
[Deng Ke Chairman of Kelang Pharmacy]

524
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,180
Hello. You are…

525
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,180
I’m Jiang Jun, an analyst from MH.

526
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,060
I’m here to see you for something important.

527
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,260
MH has no one else?

528
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,620
Even a small analyst can be sent to see me.

529
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,980
What? You analysts from MH

530
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,580
like to be caddies?

531
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,780
Go home now.

532
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,260
Such stupid tactics of yours

533
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,180
have no effect on me at all.

534
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,540
Mr. Deng, I think picking up the balls

535
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,020
is an industry that can create huge wealth.

536
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,220
It’s not a stupid tactic.

537
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,740
On the golf course,

538
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,940
there are tens of thousands of balls

539
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,300
that are not in holes.

540
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,460
If these balls are recycled to the factories,

541
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,780
then sorted out by brand

542
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,860
and quality,

543
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,300
and then repackaged

544
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,860
at 50% of the price...

545
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,060
This business case

546
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,500
has already been used.

547
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,860
I don’t need you to

548
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,740
waste my time

549
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,140
telling me this.

550
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,780
Kelang is MH’s customer.

551
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,860
You spend the money

552
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,340
and we make the money for you.

553
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,900
If you don’t want to talk to me,

554
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,540
I won’t leave

555
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,580
until you get the time.

556
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,100
I can only seize the present opportunity

557
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
to fulfill my duty.

558
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,620
Alright.

559
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,820
You said you are Jiang…

560
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,180
Jiang Jun.

561
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,180
Jiang Jun.

562
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,180
Come on, what’s your matter?

563
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,140
Our company wants to get

564
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,940
all the personnel files of Kelang.

565
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,260
But your person in charge of this

566
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,220
has been unwilling to cooperate.

567
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,220
I knew it.

568
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,500
My people

569
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,260
think that the personnel files you want

570
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,620
will not help

571
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,820
with your due diligence.

572
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,940
When I mentioned personnel files,

573
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,020
you unconsciously touched the brim of your cap.

574
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,740
Psychologically speaking,

575
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,340
you’re nervous about it.

576
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,180
You’re good at picking up balls,

577
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,900
and have vivid imagination.

578
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,300
It is for us to judge the value

579
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,860
of the personnel files.

580
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,340
If you do not provide them, we will suspect

581
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,380
that there is sensitive information in it.

582
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,140
What? Something must be wrong

583
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,380
if you don’t know about it?

584
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,740
I think something is wrong with your logic.

585
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,460
We can’t finish the due diligence

586
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,700
if we can’t get the personnel files.

587
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,500
That means the merger will be delayed.

588
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,500
It’s normal for a merger to be delayed.

589
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,460
The delay will create uncertainty,

590
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,060
and I believe Kelang’s board will question

591
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,140
your ability to navigate the merger.

592
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,900
And as far as I know,

593
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,140
your ex-wife owns 20 percent

594
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,940
of the decision-making shares.

595
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,620
If the merger is delayed,

596
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,980
she is likely to sell the shares.

597
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,340
Then your preferred shares will be exchanged

598
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,780
for common shares

599
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,500
under the valuation adjustment mechanism.

600
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,300
Alright.

601
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,660
Since you want to waste your effort,

602
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,620
I can give you what you want.

603
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,740
I’ll have all the personnel files pulled out

604
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,060
and given to you.

605
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,860
You can pick them up later

606
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
at the HR department of our company.

607
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,620
Then you’ll see

608
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,180
how silly your demands are.

609
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Thanks for your cooperation.

610
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,940
Then I won’t disturb you now.

611
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,660
Wait.

612
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,380
To be

613
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,980
a good caddie on the course,

614
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,700
you must first understand the rules here.

615
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,340
Jiang Jun?

616
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,700
You want to checkmate me?

617
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,100
Pick up some more balls before that.

618
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,100
Mr. Deng told us about it.

619
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,740
The archives room is ahead.

620
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,460
One of your colleagues has just

621
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,380
come over.

622
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,860
He’s already in there.

623
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,820
Really?

624
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,460
Let me take you there.

625
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,300
OK.

626
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,740
Here

627
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,500
is the archives room of the HR department.

628
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Why are you here?

629
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,100
I heard you came to Kelang alone.

630
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,260
So I came to help you.

631
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:09,940
Alright,

632
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,900
you can take your time.

633
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,260
I’ll leave the access card to you.

634
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,860
You can come to me anytime

635
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,940
if you need anything.

636
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,740
Thank you.

637
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,380
You’re welcome.

638
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
That’s too much!

639
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,100
A manufacturing-type enterprise.

640
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,100
It’s normal.

641
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,780
This is just a tip of the iceberg.

642
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,580
There are more.

643
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,300
Come on.

644
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,180
Come on.

645
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,740
[File Cover]

646
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,260
What’s going on?

647
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,620
Boss, finally you’re here.

648
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,580
You know what? I’m almost blinded.

649
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,900
Help me.

650
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,340
I need to use the toilet.

651
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,740
Go now.

652
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,540
Go.

653
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,740
Watch your step!

654
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,180
These are the materials I just sorted out.

655
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,540
You scared me.

656
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,900
This is how you sorted them out?

657
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,500
You’re so superficial.

658
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,620
It looks like a mess,

659
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,139
but they are in order in my mind.

660
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,300
These have paid social insurance for 3 years.

661
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,580
These have just quitted the job for 1 year.

662
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,699
And these were admitted within 1 month.

663
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,540
What about this?

664
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,980
Two months.

665
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,900
Here.

666
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,739
Did you find out anything?

667
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,580
I checked the salary records and the files

668
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,380
of people who left

669
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,300
and found the file of one person is missing.

670
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,420
They must want to conceal it on purpose.

671
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,860
I have the name and record of social insurance.

672
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,340
I think I can find this person.

673
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,659
Be sure to find out something.

674
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,100
You’re not off work yet?

675
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,820
I still got some work to do.

676
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,659
I’ll go soon.

677
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,780
You’re really working hard.

678
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,139
Not as busy as you are.

679
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,740
Look at this.

680
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,460
Yuan Shuai,

681
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,420
you have wrinkles on forehead now.

682
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,100
Every accomplishment takes energy.

683
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,900
You know,

684
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,260
if you care about your face,

685
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,900
you should remember what I told you

686
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,700
in the interview.

687
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,820
Investment banking

688
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,060
is not for you.

689
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,660
It’s been ten years.

690
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,500
You are terribly short-sighted now.

691
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,140
Short-sighted?

692
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,220
Is there any wrinkle

693
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,380
on my face?

694
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,020
What’s going on?

695
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,580
The power is off.

696
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,540
Mr. Deng, it’s done.

697
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,780
Well,

698
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,460
you’re afraid that

699
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,660
there will be danger if you

700
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,860
and I stay in one room alone?

701
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
Don’t worry. I’ll settle this.

702
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,820
You look like

703
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,820
a high-end professional elite.

704
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,020
I didn’t expect you to be so unreliable.

705
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,260
So ironic.

706
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,700
Boss, what happened?

707
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,820
It’s locked.

708
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,540
Don’t worry. I’ll call for help.

709
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,220
Go now.

710
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,980
Anyone out there?

711
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,900
We are locked in here!

712
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,860
Stop shouting.

713
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,860
No one will come however loud you shout.

714
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,140
Looks like you’re enjoying

715
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,100
to be here.

716
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,620
It’s not so enjoyable actually.

717
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,460
But

718
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,260
when I see someone

719
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,420
who can’t wait to leave

720
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,740
but have no way,

721
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,100
I feel it’s good to be here.

722
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,060
You know what?

723
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,700
I’m always unlucky when I’m with you.

724
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,780
Everything went well before you came.

725
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,380
Then the power was off.

726
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,540
If I guess correctly,

727
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,420
there should be

728
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,780
a spare switch in this room.

729
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,100
You can even guess that?

730
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,100
Think about it.

731
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,300
There are so many

732
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,700
important materials in this room.

733
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,260
It neighbors the Finance room and R&D reference room.

734
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,980
It is more likely that the spare switch

735
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,060
is in this room

736
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,900
than in the other two,

737
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,580
which need more security.

738
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:29,980
Let’s find it.

739
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,180
My goodness.

740
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,620
It never rains but it pours.

741
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,860
My period comes to cause trouble

742
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,460
when I am with this devil.

743
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,980
Found it.

744
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,620
Over there.

745
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,380
Come here. I lift you up

746
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,220
and you can switch it.

747
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,220
No.

748
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,100
It is improper.

749
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,300
Miss Jiang,

750
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,100
are you from the feudal society?

751
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,060
Or,

752
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
do you want to

753
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,020
spend a wonderful night

754
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,260
with me?

755
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,340
Stop being shameless.

756
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,900
What’s wrong with you?

757
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,540
Nothing.

758
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,180
I didn’t have lunch. A stomachache.

759
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,660
Alright, I will do it.

760
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,500
I’ll wait for you in the car.

761
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,220
It’s OK…

762
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,380
Don’t move.

763
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,780
You still don’t know how to tie your shoes?

764
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,660
Of course I do!

765
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,020
I have taught you many times.

766
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,980
Make a slipknot first.

767
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,540
Then cross your fingers

768
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,060
and pull it from the middle.

769
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,060
It’s done.

770
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,540
That foot.

771
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,660
Wait…

772
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,740
Let me teach you again.

773
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,220
Make a slipknot first.

774
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,060
Then cross your fingers

775
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,780
and pull it.

776
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,820
Then it’s done.

777
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,740
Do you understand?

778
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:55,900
By the way,

779
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,300
it’s my duty to protect you.

780
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,580
But I’ll charge extra for teaching.

781
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,300
But

782
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,620
you borrowed a piece of chocolate from me

783
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,660
and haven’t paid it back yet.

784
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,780
That’s not a big deal.

785
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,340
A piece of chocolate is not enough

786
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,060
for such a complicated thing like lacing up.

787
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,860
Here is it.

788
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,660
You can call me Brother Yuanyuan.

789
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,740
Then I will let you go this time.

790
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,180
Brother Yuanyuan.

791
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,860
That’s right.

792
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,820
Let’s go. We’ll be late for class.

793
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,340
Come on.

794
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,180
Wait for me.

795
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:35,700
Alright.

796
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,820
Understand now?
