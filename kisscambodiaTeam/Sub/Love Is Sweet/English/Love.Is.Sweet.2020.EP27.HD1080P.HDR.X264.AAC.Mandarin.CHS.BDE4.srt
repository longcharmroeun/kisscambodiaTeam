00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,220
<i>MH Securities Co., Ltd.</i>

4
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,360
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,040
Who are you?

6
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,600
We are from the Compliance Dept of MH.

7
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,950
Someone reported that you took bribe.

8
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,760
We need you to cooperate with us
for the investigation

9
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,920
Taking bribes?

10
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

11
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,230
Me?

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Are you kidding?

13
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,680
Please be cooperative.

14
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
If the facts don’t exist,

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,040
we’ll clear your name.

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,640
Good. I’ll go with you.

17
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
This way, please.

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,290
What’s going on?

19
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,490
I don’t know.

20
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,800
What’s going on here?

21
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,000
What’s the matter?

22
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,360
Those guys look like

23
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,000
they’re from the Compliance Dept.

24
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,040
They said that Mr. Yuan took bribes.

25
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,320
How is that possible?

26
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,280
Yeah, how could that be possible?

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,400
It is wrong of you to do so.

28
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,880
Even if you’re from the headquarters,

29
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,400
you can’t just go through other people’s stuff.

30
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Sorry, please don’t disturb our work.

31
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,800
Put it down.

32
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,200
What are you doing?

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,480
The colleague who was transferred to the headquarters
called and said that

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,400
Mr. Yuan had been reported
for serious disciplinary violations,

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,280
but he did not know the specific reasons.

36
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,920
Serious disciplinary violations?

37
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,920
How is that possible?

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,760
I don’t believe it either,

39
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,560
but he hasn’t found out the specific reasons,

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,120
and I’m still asking someone to help me.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,080
Does Ms. Qiao know?

42
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,840
I asked.

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,920
She didn’t know.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
What about Mr. Ma?

45
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
Didn’t he get transferred to the headquarters?

46
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,280
Mr. Ma?

47
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,320
He wished something had happened to Yuan Shuai.

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,600
What can he care?

49
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,960
Since the head office is in such a hurry
to send someone here,

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,200
it should be no small matter.

51
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
Yuan Shuai is in trouble this time.

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,800
But don’t worry.

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,440
We have to trust him.

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,320
And we still have Mr. Fan,

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,000
so Yuan Shuai will be fine.

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,400
Let’s be patient and wait.

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,240
Ok.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
Let me know as soon as you hear anything.

59
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,560
Ok.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,320
I’m impressed.

61
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,040
Yuan Shuai,

62
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,800
you are now being accused

63
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,040
of taking bribes from Zhu Youyi
of Chenxin Technology.

64
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,360
Do you admit it?

65
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,600
No.

66
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
But we found in your account that

67
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,080
you received a large sum of money

68
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,960
from Zhu Youyi last month.

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,000
How do you explain that?

70
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,720
Zhu Youyi is both my client

71
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,280
and my friend.

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,360
I lent him

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,280
the money.

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,440
Do you have an IOU or a loan agreement?

75
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,920
As I said,

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,720
we are good friends.

77
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,320
So I don’t need a contract with him.

78
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,720
I can confront With Mr. Zhu

79
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,520
about this matter.

80
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,800
Then let’s invite Dr. Zhu in.

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,440
Dr. Zhu, I’d like to ask

82
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,230
if you have ever

83
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,400
bribed our executive director.

84
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,200
Yes.

85
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
Did he take bribes from you?

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,080
He did take money from me.

87
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,760
Zhu Youyi,

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,760
what are you talking about?

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,280
I’ve spent this year

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,440
fighting for the future of Chenxin Technology.

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,520
Why do you want to wrong me?

92
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,880
Yuan Shuai, stop acting.

93
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,360
Is acting helpful?

94
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,360
If there were no profit for you,

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,760
how could you help me twice

96
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,120
when I was in trouble?

97
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,880
I lent you the money

98
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,720
only because I thought you were
a real friend to me.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
Lent me the money?

100
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,440
Who bought you?

101
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,160
How much did he spend?

102
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Yuan Shuai,

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,280
watch your attitude.

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,320
I think there must be some misunderstanding

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,360
in this matter.

106
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,360
Yuan Shuai was cultivated by me.

107
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,560
I know his character very well.

108
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,640
Mr. Fan, they say you may know a person’s face
but never his heart.

109
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,520
I know Yuan Shuai is your beloved subordinate,

110
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,720
but don’t be so sure yet.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Whether it’s a loan or a bribe,

112
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,280
Dr. Zhu,

113
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,160
what exactly is your relationship
with Yuan Shuai?

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,840
Here’s the thing.

115
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,080
More than a year ago,

116
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,800
Yuan Shuai was the project leader

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
for financing and asset restructuring
of Chenxin.

118
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,960
I wasted a lot of money

119
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,240
because of research and development mistakes,

120
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,080
and the company was about to go out of business.

121
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,760
Yuan Shuai saw my project

122
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
and thought it was promising,

123
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,840
so he encouraged me to issue bonds.

124
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,640
At the same time, he hinted that

125
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,520
I would give him a kickback
after I got the financing.

126
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,000
I agreed

127
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,520
and gave him some money.

128
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,440
Not long ago, the creditors called for debts,

129
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,240
and he actively helped me inject new funds,

130
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,800
and I gave him five million yuan as usual.

131
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Mr. Yuan,

132
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,320
is what Dr. Zhu said true?

133
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,320
If I say no,

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
I’m afraid no one will believe me.

135
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,120
Dr. Zhu,

136
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,150
do you have any proof?

137
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,030
This

138
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,760
is the remittance certificate.

139
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,200
At the first time, because we were inexperienced,

140
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,200
and he was afraid of being found out
by other shareholders,

141
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,640
so I gave him cash,

142
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,840
and there was no receipt.

143
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,280
But this time,

144
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,120
I transferred the money to his private account.

145
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,080
I don’t really care about the money.

146
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,680
All I need is the money
for research and development.

147
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,240
But he made even more extravagant demands.

148
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,600
He said he wanted to be a sponsor agent

149
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,960
and hold an initial offerings of Chenxin

150
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
after it goes public.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
He wanted to make a fortune.

152
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
I didn’t want to be threatened by him,

153
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,760
but he was so influential

154
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,160
in the investment banking

155
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,000
that I had to report him to MH.

156
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,800
Zhu Youyi,

157
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,120
well said.

158
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,360
Why didn’t I realize

159
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,040
you are such a person?

160
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,160
Yuan Shuai,

161
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,320
you are suspected of taking bribes

162
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
and corruption in the private equity investment,

163
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,640
which is a serious breach
of MH’s labor disciplines.

164
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,240
We will thoroughly investigate all your projects

165
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,080
in accordance with company regulations.

166
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Ok.

167
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Investigate if you like.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,830
Wait.

169
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,080
Words do not prove things.

170
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,080
Yuan Shuai has always done his duty to MH,

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,760
so we cannot convict him

172
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,040
on one side of the story,

173
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,680
or just on some remittance records.

174
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,800
Mr. Fan, don’t worry about it.

175
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
As things stand,

176
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,440
it’s not that serious.

177
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,000
I will personally intercede

178
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,480
with the headquarters and the chairman

179
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,920
to let Yuan Shuai’s case be handled internally

180
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,960
and not make things look so ugly.

181
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
The worst thing that could happen is to
disqualify him as a sponsor agent

182
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,640
and

183
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,240
ban him from the market.

184
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,760
It’s not that serious.

185
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,200
It seems that

186
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,120
whether I did it or not

187
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,520
doesn’t matter now.

188
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,400
The truth doesn’t matter.

189
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,000
What matters is that
someone puts me on this path.

190
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,360
Whether I take this path sooner or later,

191
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,520
the result is the same.

192
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,400
Mr. Yuan,

193
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,560
it is for the sake of MH’s reputation.

194
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,960
Well, then,

195
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,320
I should thank you

196
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,000
for your leniency.

197
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,840
Mr. Lin is so amazing.

198
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,240
You gave me such a big surprise

199
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,440
as soon as you got back.

200
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,000
Blame it on your own carelessness

201
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,280
and poor staffing.

202
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,680
Really?

203
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,920
There are only the two of us here.

204
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,240
Come on,

205
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,000
what do you really want to do?

206
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Yuan Shuai,

207
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,120
if you want to investigate me, do it.

208
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,760
Why do you want to investigate C Group?

209
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,960
So it’s because of this.

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,840
Ok.

211
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,000
I don’t have to hide it from you.

212
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,240
Let me tell you

213
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,040
what I’ve found.

214
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,440
In 2010,

215
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,440
when you became the General Manager of
MH’s Investment Banking Department,

216
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,240
you used the inside information

217
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,360
and bought shares

218
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,360
of three unlisted companies in advance.

219
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,640
You collected more than 19.47 million yuan

220
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,960
from clients

221
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,800
and made a profit of more than
8.68 million yuan.

222
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
In 2013,

223
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,920
Wuji Technology, founded by your wife,

224
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,960
became the fourth largest shareholder
of Fengshang Technology,

225
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,280
receiving 650,000 shares for 700,000 yuan,

226
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,520
accounting for 1.723 percent.

227
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,840
In 2015,

228
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,000
Fengshang Technology was officially listed.

229
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,440
By the end of the lockdown period,

230
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
Wuji Technology’s stake

231
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,520
in Fengshang Technology

232
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,600
was worth about 10 million yuan,

233
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
an increase of 14.2 times.

234
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,920
Ok.

235
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,760
Don’t recite it any more.

236
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,320
You don’t have any proof.

237
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,160
What can you do with me?

238
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,680
Let me ask you again,

239
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,760
why are you looking into C Group?

240
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,800
Mr. Lin, why are you so nervous

241
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,360
when I mention C Group?

242
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,760
Are you trying to tell me that

243
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,760
I can take you down

244
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,240
if I have information on C Group?

245
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,520
Let’s change the subject.

246
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,840
I’m told you’re on good terms

247
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,480
with your analysts.

248
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,320
Do you know Jiang Jun well?

249
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,720
Jiang Jun?

250
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,800
Isn’t she the girl

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,840
I threw out of MH?

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,520
You asked her to come back.

253
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,080
So you were the one who sent her away.

254
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,720
She is incompetent and only moderately educated.

255
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,080
I did not want her.

256
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,040
Do you think there’s a problem?

257
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,560
But Mr. Lin,

258
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,080
why do you always mention
some irrelevant people?

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,880
Nothing.

260
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Yuan Shuai,

261
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,640
this time I only punished you a little.

262
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,360
Don’t blame me for not warning you.

263
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,160
If you go on against me,

264
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,400
it won’t be easy for you next time.

265
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,840
Including your parents.

266
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,840
Don’t they also run companies abroad?

267
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,840
It’s not difficult for me

268
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,760
to let a company go bankrupt by itself.

269
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,680
Lin Taimo,

270
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,800
I’m warning you.

271
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,840
Leave my parents alone.

272
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,320
Ok.

273
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,160
As long as

274
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,520
you leave MH at once,

275
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
go abroad immediately

276
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,960
and never come back.

277
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
And,

278
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,000
please shut up.

279
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

280
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,430
I am leaving MH

281
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,160
as of today.

282
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,950
Su Chang has a copy

283
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,710
of all the materials in my hand.

284
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,400
Su Chang,

285
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,320
you and Ms. Qiao

286
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,110
keep track of the progress of all the projects.

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,870
All of you,

288
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,190
the unfinished work

289
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,000
is to be completed.

290
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,960
One last thing.

291
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,280
After the company re-divides the ownership
of the project,

292
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
all of you

293
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,480
report to the new leader.

294
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,760
Everyone, go back to your work.

295
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,480
Mr. Yuan.

296
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,080
Mr. Yuan.

297
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
-Mr. Yuan.
-Mr. Yuan.

298
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,080
Mr. Yuan, I’ll go wherever you go.

299
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,160
I said go back to work!

300
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,680
Didn’t you hear me?

301
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
What are you doing?

302
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,680
Get back to work.

303
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
Yuan Shuai.

304
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,800
Mr. Fan,

305
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,320
please tell me

306
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,080
what happened to Yuan Shuai.

307
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,440
I’m afraid

308
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,920
he can’t stay in MH this time.

309
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,440
How is that possible?

310
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,320
Over the years,

311
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,640
all of his clients

312
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,960
have praised Yuan Shuai’s ability.

313
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,160
If there are any problems,

314
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
I can solve them through public relations.

315
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,320
I’m afraid it won’t work this time.

316
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,520
By asking him to resign,

317
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,160
the company has given him an extrajudicial grace.

318
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,640
Mr. Fan, don’t you like Yuan Shuai the most?

319
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,600
Qiao Na,

320
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,520
you stay out of this.

321
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
The most important thing now

322
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,480
is to handle work that Yuan Shuai
has left behind

323
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,240
and stabilize the emotions

324
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,480
of his subordinates.

325
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,600
Yuan Shuai’s vacancy

326
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,960
will soon be filled.

327
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,280
Enough.

328
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,040
Get down to work.

329
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,280
Hello, Lin Fei.

330
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,560
You are familiar with
the Compliance Dept.

331
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,480
I want you to inquire about something for me.

332
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,840
What is the reason

333
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,440
for the investigation of Yuan Shuai today?

334
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,360
Ok. I’ll be waiting to hear from you.

335
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,220
Thank you.

336
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,080
Did Mr. Yuan resign

337
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,080
or was he fired?

338
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,240
He is the backbone of our business.

339
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,680
How wrong would he have to be

340
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,680
to let the company be so unkind?

341
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,440
Did he really take a bribe?

342
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,000
Jiang Jun,

343
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,760

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,760
Where are you? I’ll come to you.

376
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,640
All right.

377
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,160
Come and see me then.

378
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,720
Ok.

379
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,600
You worried me to death.

380
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
Don’t come closer!

381
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,400
Do you really want to know?

382
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,760
Of course.

383
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,880
I love you.

384
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,560
No matter how bad the situation is,

385
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,040
I am willing to go with you.

386
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,960
Go with me?

387
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,280
If I tell you

388
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,560
I am a corrupt person

389
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,840
who’d abuse power for personal gains,

390
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,320
will you go on with me?

391
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,960
Today,

392
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
Zhu Youyi was there to expose me.

393
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,360
Do you think I really believed in his project

394
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,160
and wanted to help him?

395
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,600
I did it for his money,

396
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,600
five million yuan.

397
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,760
Stop.

398
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,960
I don’t believe it.

399
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,000
Believe it or not,

400
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,880
the company should make an announcement
in a couple of days.

401
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,600
I have been delisted from MH

402
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,960
and banned from the market.

403
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,240
Will you stop joking?

404
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,400
Can you tell me the truth?

405
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,920
Jiang Jun,

406
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,440
since ancient times,

407
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,600
there have been few people

408
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,920
who could resist the temptation
of money and power.

409
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,840
Especially, after so many years

410
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,560
in our investment banking world,

411
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,320
everyone changes.

412
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,480
I’m no exception.

413
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,920
Because

414
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,680
we all have desires.

415
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I’m sorry.

416
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,640
I lied to you again.

417
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
I’m not the one

418
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,760
who can give you hope and light.

419
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,760
Still,

420
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,760
consider it as your last lesson.

421
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,840
What do you mean?

422
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,160
I booked a flight to go abroad this evening.

423
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
I…

424
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,720
I probably won’t come back any more.

425
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,280
Let’s

426
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,880
just say goodbye.

427
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,080
Are you trying to

428
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,760
break up with me?

429
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,360
You can think of it that way.

430
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Ok.

431
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,920
Then look me in the eye and say it again.

432
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,960
Yuan Shuai,

433
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,600
look at me!

434
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Is this enough?

435
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,920
I won’t be able to catch the plane.

436
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,040
What?

437
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,240
Still not give up?

438
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,440
Do you really want a goodbye kiss to

439
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,120
commemorate

440
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,760
our short-lived and ridiculous love?

441
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Ok.

442
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,360
Sorry.

443
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,360
The principle of today’s interview,

444
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,920
wolves can stay

445
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,480
and lambs will leave.

446
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,280
You and I

447
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,680
are like an ant and a wheel.

448
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,400
You crawl slowly

449
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,280
while I roll ahead.

450
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,160
Some people are shortsighted.

451
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,280
They only see the immediate interests,

452
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,720
so they earn fast and die fast, too.

453
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,120
I’m not like them.

454
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,340
I take the long view.

455
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,770
I’m more interested in long-term benefits.

456
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,440
I am a corrupt person

457
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,440
who’d abuse power for personal gains.

458
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,000
Let’s

459
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,240
just say goodbye.

460
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
Liar.

461
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,320
Liar.

462
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,280
Don’t you say that

463
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,440
if I am wronged

464
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,400
or sad,

465
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,360
you will embrace me behind me?

466
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,520
I’m going to cry now.

467
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,200
Where are you?

468
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,280
Jiang Jun,

469
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,680
I will be there for you,

470
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,960
always.

471
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,780
<i>Flight Information</i>

472
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,320
Mr. Lin,

473
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,920
Yuan Shuai has left China.

474
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,160
Are you sure?

475
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,240
I’m sure.

476
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,400
Ok.

477
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,240
Ten hours later,

478
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,920
keep track of his cell phone

479
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,320
and computer Internet Protocol addresses.

480
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,520
I see.

481
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,680
Li.

482
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,040
Li!

483
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,160
You finally wake up.

484
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,440
Why are you crying again?

485
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,840
Is it because of Yuan Shuai again?

486
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,840
How could he not be here at this moment?

487
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,960
I’ll find him.

488
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,240
He left

489
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,600
and went abroad.

490
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,400
Why did he go abroad again?

491
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,800
We broke up.

492
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,800
He may never come back.

493
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,320
What?

494
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,790
Did he dump you?

495
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,720
No way.

496
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,750
Then who brought you here last night?

497
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,310
I came by myself.

498
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,270
Yourself?

499
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,400
There’s something wrong.

500
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,720
Didn’t he say he had to get to the airport
right away?

501
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,840
What are you talking about?

502
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,000
Where’s my phone?

503
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,670
Hello, Xiaochuan.

504
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,270
Has Yuan Shuai contacted you?

505
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,760
No,

506
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
he didn’t contact me.

507
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,450
Ok.

508
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,720
Then once he gets in touch with you,

509
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,120
you must tell me.

510
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,000
Jun, what’s going on with you two?

511
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,670
Li, I’m leaving the hospital.

512
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,880
I’m going to the office.

513
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,880
Why hasn’t Jiang Jun come to work today?

514
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,320
Has anything happened to her?

515
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,960
What’s wrong with you today?

516
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,070
Don’t you like her the least?

517
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,360
Why do you suddenly care about her?

518
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,360
None of your business.

519
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,230
Xiang Ding,

520
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,080
don’t you and Jiang Jun get along the best?

521
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,040
Why don’t you call her

522
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,440
and find out what’s wrong with her?

523
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,200
I just sent her a WeChat message,

524
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,810
but she hasn’t responded yet.

525
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,600
Here you are, Jiang Jun.

526
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,200
Are you ill?

527
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,360
Are you feeling better?

528
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,360
Much better.

529
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,000
Jiang Jun, you are finally here.

530
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,360
Finally someone is here to help us
share the pain.

531
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,680
Look at this.

532
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,120
This is what happened

533
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
on the first day

534
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,680
after Mr. Yuan left.

535
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
To tell you the truth,

536
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,240
I did

537
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,400
find Mr. Yuan

538
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,080
unpredictable

539
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
and a little cold in his speech.

540
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,280
But

541
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,400
now that he’s gone,

542
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
it’s like our anchor has gone.

543
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
All the departments are coming to make trouble.

544
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,400
Everyone makes trouble every day.

545
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,440
I just heard the news that

546
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,200
a new executive director

547
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,120
may come to our company today.

548
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
He was appointed by Mr. Lin himself.

549
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,240
Someone is coming so soon?

550
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,240
Everybody puts your work on hold.

551
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,640
I have an announcement to make.

552
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,560
I know everyone is busy with work,

553
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,240
so let me get straight to the point.

554
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,640
Here is the new executive director I engaged

555
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,960
for the Investment Banking Department.

556
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,880
Let’s welcome him!

557
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,400
Mr. Du is an influential figure

558
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,480
in the investment banking world.

559
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,840
I believe you all

560
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,000
know a little about him.

561
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,480
From now on,

562
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,440
he will have complete control

563
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
of the Investment Banking Department.

564
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,400
I hope you can be cooperative.

565
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,600
Mr. Du, say something.

566
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,480
Ok.

567
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,520
Hello, I’m Du Lei.

568
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,680
It is a great pleasure

569
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,120
to be in MH with all of you.

570
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,320
In the days ahead,

571
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,760
your kind cooperation
will be greatly appreciated.

572
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,000
Thank you.

573
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,560
Secretary Bai,

574
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,040
show Mr. Du to his new office.

575
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,560
Jiang Jun, come here.

576
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,840
Sit down.

577
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Thank you.

578
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,440
I’ve heard something from my colleagues

579
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,800
at the headquarters.

580
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,440
Do you know

581
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,480
who gave Yuan Shuai’s tip-off?

582
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,760
Who?

583
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,160
MH’s newly appointed

584
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,480
executive director.

585
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,960
Du Lei?

586
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,760
Don’t you think it’s such a coincidence?
<i>Informant: Du Lei</i>

587
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,400
He arrived only one day after Yuan Shuai left.

588
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,120
And, it is said,

589
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,440
he is chosen by Lin Taimo himself.

590
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,040
Yuan Shuai’s trouble this time,

591
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,480
I think, is probably

592
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,400
the result of their cooperation.

593
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,120
What does this have to do with Mr. Lin?

594
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,080
You’ve been in the company a long time.

595
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,000
Can’t you see it?

596
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,760
Mr. Lin and Mr. Fan in our
Investment Banking Department don’t get along.

597
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,240
Mr. Lin was promoted to the headquarters

598
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,880
but suddenly came back to
the Investment Banking Department.

599
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,840
That means he is going to do something.

600
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,440
On the first day when he came back,

601
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,720
he sent Ma Xiuran away.

602
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,160
That was a demonstration against Mr. Fan.

603
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,320
Yuan Shuai,

604
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,920
Mr. Fan’s right-hand man,

605
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,400
was forced to leave.

606
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,800
Do you still think

607
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,640
all this is normal?

608
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,320
Yuan Shuai.

609
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,440
First of all, let’s welcome the return
of Mr. Lin!

610
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,720
You’d better

611
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
pick your words wisely.

612
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,480
I’ll be back after all.

613
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,720
Hello, I’m Du Lei.

614
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,840
It is a great pleasure

615
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,400
to be in MH with all of you.

616
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,680
In the days ahead, your kind cooperation
will be greatly appreciated.

617
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,480
Thank you.

618
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,240
<i>Du Lei</i>

619
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,080
Come in.

620
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,280
What?

621
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Are you here to celebrate my entry into MH?

622
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,320
Why do you come to MH?

623
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,240
Why didn’t you tell me ahead of time?

624
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
I wanted to surprise you.

625
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,640
I think I’ve adjusted well enough

626
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,160
to get back into the workplace.

627
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,200
Besides, MH is one of the top companies
in the country.

628
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
When it gives me an offer,

629
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,280
I don’t think I’d refuse.

630
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,600
Well, congratulations, Mr. Du.

631
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,000
Would you like to have dinner together?

632
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,160
What’s wrong with your face?

633
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,480
Nothing. I’m a little allergic.

634
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
Mr. Du,

635
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,560
I already know that

636
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,560
you turned him in.

637
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,360
Since you are my friend,

638
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,920
I don’t want you to put the trumpeted accusation

639
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,240
on Yuan Shuai

640
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,160
and be used by others.

641
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,960
Are you sure you don’t want to have a try?
It tastes good.

642
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,600
I know what he’s like.

643
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,160
He would never do such a thing.

644
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,040
And my trust in him will last a lifetime.

645
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,080
If you’re going to go on against him,

646
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,680
I’ll have to take his side.

647
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,880
I have all the evidence.

648
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,080
Why do you believe him but not me?

649
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,000
A lifetime

650
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,520
is a long time.

651
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,400
As for Yuan Shuai,

652
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,640
I will try my best to find out the truth
for him.

653
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,440
And as a friend,

654
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,320
my final piece of advice to you is that,

655
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,040
I hope when the gun turns around,

656
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,560
you won’t hurt yourself.

657
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,720
Bye.
