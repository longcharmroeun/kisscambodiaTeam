00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,490
Episode 33

3
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,840
Xiang Ding already left.

4
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,400
He was fired on the day the story came out.

5
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,240
Well, for me...

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
I have to stay for a few more days

7
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,080
because the handover has to be done.

8
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,080
Why did you resign directly,

9
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
without waiting for me to come back?

10
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,270
Xiang Ding and I failed to

11
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,880
handle the SKL case.

12
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,480
Someone has to take the responsibility.

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,240
But it hasn’t been proved that

14
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,840
you are the ones who leaked the information.

15
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,680
We can still have another choice.

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Mr. Du, do you want to see me?

17
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
The price leak

18
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
hasn’t been found out until now.

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
You got nothing to explain to me?

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,760
Mr. Du, Xiang Ding and I

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,160
are to blame for the price leak.

22
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,720
But it was definitely not leaked by us.

23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,640
You have my words.

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,040
Of course I believe you.

25
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,120
But it had already happened.

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,840
Someone has to take the responsibility.

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,560
Sure.

28
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,280
Jiang Jun is in charge of this case.

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,590
But she’s on a leave

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,920
when the information got leaked.

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,680
So, you’re the people

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
who are most likely to leak it.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,720
But we didn’t do it.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,920
And there is no evidence to prove

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,840
it’s leaked by us now.

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,680
Shen Xin, how long have you been
in this industry?

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,680
For three years.

38
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,720
Three years?

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,000
A nobody always takes the blame.

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,600
You must have been familiar with such things.

41
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,200
How about this?

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,160
When Jiang Jun comes back,

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,240
let’s make her the scapegoat.

44
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,280
No!

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,520
It has nothing to do with her.

46
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,960
Okay.

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,120
If you leave now,

48
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,720
I can announce to the public

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,440
that you left for personal reasons.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,360
If you don’t do it now,

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
later, I may not be able to help you.

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,400
I see.

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,080
Something went wrong.

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,480
And someone has to take the responsibility.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,560
I still want to thank you

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,040
before I leave MH.

57
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,080
If you hadn’t forgiven me,

58
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,160
I wouldn’t have been able to stay in MH.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,920
I guess,

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,720
I just don’t belong here.

61
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,080
So,

62
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,800
I have to find another job now.

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,240
The job market is bleak.

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,120
It’s too risky for you

65
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,400
to resign now

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
since you haven’t landed another job.

67
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,000
I’ll find one anyway.

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,200
No worries.

69
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
I will definitely find a better job.

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,360
Hello?

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,840
Okay, I’ll be right back.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,160
I still have a few things to deal with
in the Administration Department.

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,480
I’ll go back now.

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,960
What about the annual revenue data report?

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,960
Mr. Du,

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,040
this is our performance
for the second half of the year.

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,320
There’s an increase of 20%

78
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
compared to the first half of the year.

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,520
Our achievement rate and net profit

80
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
have far exceeded the second-ranked GE

81
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,280
under your leadership.

82
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,120
Great. Keep working.

83
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
I look forward to a more dazzling performance

84
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,920
in overseas markets next year.

85
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Okay, Mr. Du.

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:32,840
You can leave now.

87
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,500
<i>Jiang Jun</i>

88
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
You came back before you get well.

89
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,320
Yuan Shuai will blame me for enslaving you.

90
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,800
Mr. Du, I know you’re busy

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,240
and don’t have time to answer my calls.

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,600
But I believe Shen Xin and Xiang Ding
have nothing to do

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,200
with the price leak of SKL’s acquisition.

94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,000
I hope you can give them another chance

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,120
to figure out the truth.

96
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
When you were on the leave,

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,520
I already handed this case

98
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,520
over to Qiao Na.

99
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,160
So, it’s not your problem.

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,840
You should know

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,880
how much the company has lost because of this.

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
Also,

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
in this industry,

104
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,200
not everyone has a second chance.

105
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,080
They should be responsible for it

106
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,560
either directly or indirectly.

107
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,960
Am I right?

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,720
Do you have anything else?

109
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,400
No, I’ll leave now.

110
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,720
Xiang Ding and I failed to

111
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,640
handle the SKL case.

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
Someone has to take the responsibility.

113
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,520
When you were on the leave,

114
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,560
I already handed this case

115
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,670
over to Qiao Na.

116
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,200
So, it’s not your problem.

117
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,480
You should know

118
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,520
how much the company has lost because of this.

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,880
Also,

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,600
in this industry,

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
not everyone has a second chance.

122
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,320
There is more than one way of life.

123
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,280
Maybe what I have always insisted

124
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,200
is not the only choice.

125
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,620
<i>Yuan Shuai</i>

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,560
Hello?

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,440
Why didn’t you answer my phone?

128
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,320
I didn’t see it because I’m on my way home.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,160
What happened?

130
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
Nothing happened.

131
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,040
You

132
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,480
still like to be brave,

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,800
minding everyone’s business.

134
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,080
If there’s no way out,

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,040
you will keep it to yourself.

136
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
Have you forgotten that

137
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
you have a powerful boyfriend

138
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,360
as your backup force?

139
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,280
You’re not single anymore.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
Are you a fortune teller?

141
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Why do you know me so well?

142
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,400
Tell me what’s going on.

143
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
When I was on the leave,

144
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Shen Xin and Xiang Ding’s case went wrong.

145
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,200
They took the blame and resigned.

146
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
I thought

147
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,280
there’s another choice.

148
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,520
Is that all?

149
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,040
I thought it was something serious.

150
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,800
My silly girl.

151
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
How do you know I’m here?

152
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,920
No matter where you go,

153
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,200
I’ll be there to protect you.

154
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,600
After all,

155
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,840
you can’t even remember to eat

156
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,800
when I’m not around.

157
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Let’s go home.

158
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,680
Are you still thinking about that?

159
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,400
I’m partially responsible

160
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
for their resignation.

161
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,680
If it hadn’t been for me...

162
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,080
Enough.

163
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,560
Stop thinking about that.

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,680
Take a good rest and forget it.

165
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,520
Look at you. Having a headache now?

166
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,080
Come.

167
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,680
I’ve learned a method

168
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,560
to massage the temple

169
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
online recently.

170
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,680
It can relieve your fatigue.

171
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,240
How’s it? Feel good?

172
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,960
Much better.

173
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,280
All you need

174
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,240
is rest.

175
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,000
Jiang Jun,

176
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,160
I won’t ask you to

177
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,440
work less hard on your job.

178
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
And I’m also happy for you

179
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,280
if you have a good performance.

180
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,440
But if you ruin your health

181
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,600
because of work,

182
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,280
it will hurt my heart.

183
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,600
Got it.

184
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,840
It’s so good to have you.

185
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Wealth, what’re you doing?

186
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,400
What’s wrong?

187
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,960
Are you angry
because I didn’t buy you food?

188
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
I knew you would forget it.

189
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,600
So I bought it.

190
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:46,960
Come down.

191
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,160
Go.

192
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,160
Yuan Shuai.

193
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,080
You’ve been doing the cleaning?

194
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,160
What do you think?

195
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,920
It took you so long to find this.

196
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,640
How about

197
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
hiring a cleaner?

198
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,560
No.

199
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I don’t want a strange person

200
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,560
to step in our private world.

201
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,240
I love to do this for you,
no matter in work or family.

202
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,880
I won’t feel tired

203
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,200
as long as you’re happy.

204
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
You’re so cunning.

205
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,520
You made me look like

206
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,000
a heartless lazy woman.

207
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,280
Lazy?

208
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,240
I told you before.

209
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,760
You’re my queen.

210
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
You will be my queen forever.

211
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,040
My queen,

212
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,320
go to sleep

213
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,480
now.

214
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,360
Okay.

215
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,320
Go.

216
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,960
Yuan Shuai,

217
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,960
I will resign

218
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,120
and be your wife

219
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,560
after I finish this.

220
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,400
Why are the data on the two documents different?

221
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:01,980
<i>Acquisition Background</i>

222
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,140
<i>Plan A</i>

223
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,080
You didn’t listen to

224
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,720
even one word I said, right?

225
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,960
Am I the only one

226
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,960
who cares about your health in this world?

227
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,640
No.

228
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
But I have so many cases on my hand now.

229
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,680
They can’t do anything if I don’t finish them.

230
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,960
And I should be responsible for

231
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,440
Xiang Ding and Shen Xin’s resignations.

232
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,200
I don’t think it’s a fair result.

233
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,400
I can’t wait any more.

234
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,240
MH has its own investigating system

235
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,440
to justify if it’s fair or not.

236
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,320
Do you think the world wouldn’t work without you?

237
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,280
Jiang Jun, you’re being so arrogant.

238
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,480
Arrogant?

239
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,800
If it were you,

240
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,640
would you leave them alone?

241
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,080
Listen.

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,080
I’ve made up my mind.

243
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
When I finish them,

244
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,040
I’ll...

245
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
You’ll resign?

246
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,680
Jiang Jun,

247
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,840
I’ll not allow you

248
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,600
to risk your life for work.

249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,800
Go resign.

250
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,360
And we can get married after that.

251
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,000
I’m capable of taking care of you
for the rest of your life.

252
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,600
Why should I need you to take care of me
for the rest of my life?

253
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,120
I’m educated and capable.

254
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,480
I can feed myself.

255
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,560
And I’ve been doing that for all these years!

256
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,840
That’s not what I mean.

257
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
I just want to protect you.

258
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,360
Here we are.

259
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
You’ve always used the excuse of protecting me

260
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
to do what you want

261
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
since childhood.

262
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,560
But I’ve already grown up.

263
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
I can negotiate with you,

264
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,040
no matter it’s for the resignation
or the marriage.

265
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,480
But I cannot be ordered.

266
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,200
Yuan Shuai,

267
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,600
I have my own life.

268
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,560
I have my responsibility and plan.

269
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,920
I hope you can respect me.

270
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Now I need to work.

271
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,040
Respect you?

272
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,920
Good.

273
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,920
From now on,

274
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,320
you can do whatever you want

275
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,480
and I’ll leave you alone.

276
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,160
Now you rather sleep outside.

277
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,960
How can you work if you get ill?

278
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,680
A double-faced man!

279
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,440
<i>Chen Yicheng</i>

280
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,680
Mr. Du has a meeting this morning.
<i>Chen Yicheng</i>

281
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,160
It will be over around 12:00 pm.

282
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,120
♫ When the sun rises up ♫

283
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,880
♫ Rub your eyes ♫

284
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
♫ The unpredictable one ♫

285
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,040
♫ Is ourselves ♫

286
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,520
♫ Although I’m sad ♫

287
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,880
♫ I have to believe myself ♫

288
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
♫ Think about the ones ♫

289
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,360
♫ Who love you ♫

290
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,400
♫ You’re not alone ♫

291
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,320
♫ The past ♫

292
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,440
♫ Is still in my heart ♫

293
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,360
♫ Every moment ♫

294
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,600
♫ Is the evidence of my growth ♫

295
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,680
♫ I realized it later ♫

296
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,320
♫ What I’ve been pursuing is freedom ♫

297
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,680
♫ Yes, I know ♫

298
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,480
The show’s over.

299
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,040
Go back to work!

300
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,800
Qiao,

301
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,600
look at these.

302
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,560
I picked them on the farm myself.

303
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,520
Each flower represents

304
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,400
“I miss you”.

305
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,040
Do you like it?

306
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:59,000
It seems that this “I miss you” has a short life.

307
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,880
You turn my house into a flower shop,

308
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,840
and now you’re turning my company
into a flower shop.

309
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,640
Don’t you think it’s annoying?

310
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,920
No, I don’t!

311
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,960
But I do.

312
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,880
Guards!

313
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,920
What’re you doing?

314
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,480
Please.

315
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,240
What’re you doing?

316
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,280
I won’t give up on you!

317
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,840
I’ll keep waiting for you!

318
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,040
You can only be my woman!

319
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
I will wait till the end

320
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,800
with my love for you!

321
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,440
You can only be my woman!

322
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,640
It’s the first time

323
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,040
seeing Ms. Qiao flush for all these years.

324
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,800
It seems you’ve fully recovered.

325
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,080
You look good.

326
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
Don’t fake it. I already knew.

327
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,400
Well,

328
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,280
perhaps you should say yes.

329
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,000
You’ve been alone for too long.

330
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,440
A woman will wither

331
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,760
without love.

332
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,120
Hey,

333
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,720
don’t be spoiled by Yuan Shuai,

334
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,800
or you’ll become a fatty woman.

335
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,800
By the way,

336
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,320
I’ve checked the SKL case.

337
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,840
Their raw data are only known to a few people

338
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,840
above the vice president level.

339
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,040
So, Xiang Ding and Shen Xin
must’ve been wronged.

340
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,040
But...

341
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,520
I know what you mean.

342
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,160
I’m going to see him.

343
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,840
I heard a few days ago that

344
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,080
Manager Shen and Manager Xiang

345
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,040
had a hard time finding a job lately.

346
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,280
Leaking in the industry is a taboo after all.

347
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,960
Although they worked in
the top investment bank,

348
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,200
they can hardly shake off the taint.

349
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,360
No one dares to hire them.

350
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,800
They seem...

351
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,080
Don’t you have any work to do?

352
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,120
-Ms. Jiang.
-Ms. Jiang.

353
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,840
I don’t want to hear conversations
like this again.

354
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,840
Okay, I gotta go.

355
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,040
Come in.

356
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,360
Mr. Du.

357
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,440
Didn’t I tell you to take a rest at home?

358
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,360
Why are you here again?

359
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,360
I want to talk about Shen Xin
and Xiang Ding with you again.

360
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,080
I compared the leaked data

361
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,320
last night.

362
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,240
I found they didn’t leak them at all.

363
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,120
They have no motives to do that.

364
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,440
Have a seat.

365
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,120
Since you want to know it so much,

366
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,520
I won’t hide it from you.

367
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,600
Actually,

368
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,440
the chairman of SKL is

369
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,240
the classmate of our senior manager in college.

370
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,680
And they are very close.

371
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,480
So, the senior manager is very angry

372
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,840
when it happened,

373
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,800
blaming us for cold-shouldering SKL’s people.

374
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,000
I’d been pressured a lot

375
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,320
and was told to find the people

376
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,120
to take the blame.

377
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,920
I had no other choice.

378
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,600
But I’m the one who’s in charge of it.

379
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
I should be held accountable.

380
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,840
How can they be the scapegoats for me?

381
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Jiang Jun,

382
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,280
there’s one thing I hope you can understand,

383
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,920
which is that losses should be stopped in time.

384
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,000
What’s more,

385
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,960
you were on a leave
when the information’s leaked.

386
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,800
They’re far from being the scapegoats for you.

387
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,280
What about them?

388
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,720
The rumor of the gross negligence

389
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,080
will have a huge impact

390
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,120
on their job-hunting in the future.

391
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,160
And we don’t even know about the truth.

392
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,880
If the source of the leak cannot be found,

393
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,280
this kind of thing will happen again

394
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,320
or even a third…

395
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,920
What’s wrong with you?

396
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,200
To get them to accept the new price,

397
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,560
I drank too much yesterday.

398
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,840
Did they accept it?

399
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,640
Although the process is a bit difficult,

400
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,920
they accepted in the end.

401
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,360
Jiang Jun,

402
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,120
I know you’re not satisfied with

403
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,320
the way I dealt with it this time.

404
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,000
If no one had come out in time

405
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,320
to take the responsibility,

406
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
it would have been impossible for customers
to give up on us.

407
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,720
And I’ve tried to extend the time
to investigate the truth,

408
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,480
but there are too many possibilities.

409
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,640
There is no way to confirm it in a short time.

410
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,920
If I hadn’t done anything but gained time,

411
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,000
the situation would’ve been worse.

412
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,560
At that time,

413
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,760
Shen Xin would have faced a graver charge

414
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,840
and been expelled from the investment bank.

415
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,480
Do you want to see that?

416
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,760
I was trying to protect her

417
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,320
and you as well.

418
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Can we get over it and move on?

419
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,720
Are you feeling so bad?

420
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,680
Do you have any medicine? Let me get it for you.

421
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,800
It’s in the drawer, thank you.

422
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,640
In the stories where women woo men,

423
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,360
men just want to taste the freshness at first.

424
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,520
The woman in the story is just a naive fool.

425
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,480
When they live together for a long time,

426
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,680
she will fail to give freshness to the man.

427
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,760
The man will fall in love with others easily.

428
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,840
I agree.

429
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
The perfect marriage from love at first sight?

430
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,480
The relationship of two people
with such a big difference

431
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,520
won’t last long.

432
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,800
They’ll get a divorce soon.

433
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,240
You will get a divorce!

434
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,360
Your whole family will have a divorce.

435
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,800
They love each other so much.

436
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,120
If you don’t believe in love,

437
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,080
stop reading romantic novels.

438
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,280
See you in my blacklist. Goodbye.

439
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,400
And the day after tomorrow is
their wedding anniversary.

440
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,240
Just be jealous, you catty girls.

441
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,040
Goodbye!

442
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,120
It pissed me off.

443
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,180
<i>West World</i>

444
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,760
What’s wrong?

445
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,000
Honey.

446
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,640
Come here.

447
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,920
What’s wrong?

448
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,680
I don’t think

449
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,120
you paid any attention to me.

450
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,840
I was there in front you for a while.

451
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,640
And you ignored me.

452
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,120
No.

453
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,360
You did.

454
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,480
I’m launching an online activity recently.

455
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,880
So, I’m pretty busy.

456
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,640
I will stay by your side after I’m done.

457
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,240
Okay?

458
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,640
What kind of activity?

459
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,000
You never told me.

460
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,200
I’m launching

461
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,640
a new activity named

462
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,240
“72 hours’ fresh love”.

463
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,360
Why do you use 72 hours?

464
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,360
Have you ever heard about Titanic Limit in Love?

465
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,360
But you must’ve watched the film, right?

466
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,960
There are two main roles in the film,

467
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,880
Jack and Rose.

468
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,680
The reason why their love story is so moving

469
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,960
is that they met, fell in love
with each other,

470
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,400
and experienced life and death

471
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,400
in just three days.

472
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,800
That’s the reason.

473
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,440
Think about it.

474
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,080
If both of them had got off the boat safely

475
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,720
and none of them had experienced the shipwreck,

476
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,720
they would have to accept the tests

477
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,800
of family, time

478
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,960
and class distinction.

479
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,000
Then that wouldn’t have been so moving.

480
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,880
So, I want to say

481
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,520
love can only

482
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,000
create a temporary chemical reaction

483
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,240
in a specific period

484
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,120
or specific space.

485
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,440
So, you mean,

486
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,240
our love has surpassed

487
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,400
the freshness period of 72 hours, right?

488
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,160
Actually,

489
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,320
you don’t love me that much anymore, right?

490
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,480
That’s not what I mean.

491
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,920
Among all the human relationships,

492
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,000
romantic relationship

493
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,280
has a lower level of stability.

494
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,760
What’s the point of obsessing
over the existence of love?

495
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,560
I just want to prove that

496
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,640
the matching rate

497
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,120
matters a lot

498
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,200
through this activity.

499
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,000
You see...

500
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,560
-... If two people want to be together...
-Stop it.

501
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,040
I got it.

502
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,280
I’m less attractive

503
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,520
to you now.

504
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,240
What’s wrong?

505
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,920
I’m leaving this house!

506
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,280
Don’t stop me!

507
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,920
That’s not what I mean.

508
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,040
I don’t want to hear it!

509
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,720
I’m almost done.

510
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,600
Wait for me.

511
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,520
Wait for a moment.

512
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,880
Li Xiaochuan!

513
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,640
I’m really sad.

514
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,920
I’m really leaving?

515
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,480
I’m leaving?

516
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,840
I’m leaving!

517
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,360
I’ll leave this house!

518
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,000
But

519
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,080
it’s pretty cold outside.

520
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,200
Put on a coat if you want to go out.

521
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
I’ll go out soon.

522
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,920
Remember to bring your keys.

523
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,600
Li Xiaochuan,

524
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,520
I’m telling you

525
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,960
I will leave for real!

526
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,320
I won’t come back!

527
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,480
Li!

528
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,200
Li!

529
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,680
Sir.

530
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,400
Don’t drive before I close the door.

531
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,200
Li!

532
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,240
Li!

533
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,040
Your phone!

534
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,040
Sir, where are you going?

535
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,440
I’m pretty quick, huh?

536
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,200
<i>MD Yuan Shuai</i>

537
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,420
Boss,
<i>MD Yuan Shuai</i>

538
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:57,680
Boss,

539
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,680
I just checked with my best drinking buddy.

540
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,000
SKL’s chairman was extremely angry about

541
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,320
the price leak.

542
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,200
But he said that the one in charge
would not be fired

543
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,120
as long as the problem is solved,

544
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,120
considering that he’s the classmate

545
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,280
of the senior manager of MH.

546
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,440
Are you sure?

547
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,480
Of course.

548
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,520
He is a trusted secretary.

549
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,720
It’s true

550
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,880
as long as it’s from his mouth.

551
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,000
So, no one had to be fired.

552
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,160
But why did Du Lei ask them to resign?

553
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,920
There are only two possibilities.

554
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,560
Either the information was leaked by him...

555
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,680
Or Shen Xin and Xiang Ding

556
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,360
had to be dismissed

557
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,000
for knowing his secret.

558
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,200
Anyway, this is not that simple.

559
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,520
Do you want to tell Jiang Jun about it?

560
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,560
I’ll think about it.
You can get back to work now.

561
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,120
<i>Jiang Jun</i>

562
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,100
Go home early.

00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,120
Go home early.

564
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,520
I have something to tell you.

565
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,800
Why do I have to

566
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,040
mind others’ business?

567
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,640
I’m the one who got the clue.

568
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,360
I won’t tell you if you don’t beg me!

569
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,960
<i>Yuan Shuai</i>

570
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,200
I’ve got some information about SKL.
<i>Yuan Shuai</i>

571
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,200
Do you want to hear it?

572
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,880
Tell me!

573
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,160
Beg me!

574
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,120
Forget it!

575
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,440
I’m begging you. Please tell me!

576
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,680
Begging? Have some backbone!

577
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
Come to me now!

578
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,680
Hello.

579
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,640
May I use your phone to make a call?

580
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,320
Sorry, it’s not a good time.

581
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,520
Thank you.

582
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,960
Hello, lad.

583
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,640
May I have a moment?

584
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,080
For what?

585
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,160
May I use your phone to make a call?

586
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,960
Ma’am.

587
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,480
Are you hitting on me?

588
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
It’s out of date now.

589
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,160
Ma’am?

590
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,000
I...

591
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,360
What?

592
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,040
Alright...

593
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,240
Kid, can you lend your phone

594
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,600
to Ma’am?

595
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,640
Fine.

596
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,720
Here it is.

597
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,280
Hello?

598
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,200
Hello, Jun.

599
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,160
It’s me.

600
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,360
Did you change your phone number?

601
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,280
No.

602
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,760
I’m using the phone

603
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,520
of the lad beside me.

604
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,800
What’s wrong?

605
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,880
-I ran away from home.
-♫ I still want to act on impulse ♫

606
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,150
It’s so noisy over there.

607
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,800
I can’t hear you clearly.

608
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,710
I said I was about to run away from home.

609
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,920
I have to rely on you from now.

610
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,150
Li,

611
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,000
I’ve got something to do.

612
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,320
You can go to my house first.

613
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,280
I gotta go.

614
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,320
Go to your house?

615
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,640
That’s like exposing myself.

616
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,040
Here you are, buddy.

617
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,440
Finished?

618
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:53,960
Thank you.

619
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,600
I didn’t expect you would

620
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,000
run away from home at this age.

621
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,040
Who said I ran away from home?

622
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,920
I...

623
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,840
I’m just here to see the flowers.

624
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,440
Then go on.

625
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,320
Can I ask you

626
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,120
why you’re always looking at the sky?

627
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,480
I’m looking at my love

628
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,880
instead of the sky.

629
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,040
I see.

630
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,360
It turned out to be a love that
you look up at ninety degrees.

631
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,320
Fine.

632
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,960
We’re similar.

633
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,160
Let’s get drunk.

634
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,080
It’s my treat.

635
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,000
How about it?

636
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,760
Good.

637
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,920
I didn’t expect you to be
such a determined person.

638
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,160
Your love story is so bumpy

639
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,600
unexpectedly.

640
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,520
Some people are born to have a shiny life.

641
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,560
But for us?

642
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,240
We’re bound to be the ones
who chase after the light.

643
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,160
It’s so tough.

644
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:37,880
But

645
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,440
at least you turned him into your husband.

646
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,480
Unlike me,

647
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,000
I’ve been after my goddess for two years.

648
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,040
She still ignores me.

649
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,640
You’re my role model.

650
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,320
What role model?

651
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,120
The one who fell in love first is me.

652
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,080
The one who confessed is me.

653
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,000
The one who proposed is also me.

654
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,720
And I’m even the one who wants a baby!

655
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,640
I...

656
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,200
The day after tomorrow will
be our wedding anniversary.

657
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,360
He...

658
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
He even told me

659
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,840
our love has surpassed the freshness period.

660
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,240
Enough.

661
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
We’re on the same boat.

662
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,880
Cheers.

663
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,080
Cheers.

664
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,760
Screw the freshness period!

665
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,760
Yeah, screw her ignorance!

666
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,080
Cheers!

667
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,720
Cheers!

668
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,800
Do you want

669
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,520
to hear the song I wrote for my goddess?

670
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,920
Yeah.

671
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,800
What do you think?

672
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,960
So great!

673
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,880
But

674
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,360
I think you can modify your lyrics.

675
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,280
Your goddess will become tearful

676
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,600
if you change it.

677
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,400
You like it?

678
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,640
I

679
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,720
can teach you guitar.

680
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,680
And you

681
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,720
write lyrics for me.

682
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,560
Good.

683
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,840
Cheers!

684
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,800
Cheers!

685
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,760
Let’s get started, Teacher.

686
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,200
<i>West World</i>

687
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,800
Li.

688
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,000
I’m back.

689
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,360
Li.

690
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,480
Li!

691
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,080
Should I put my fingers here?

692
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,880
This string.

693
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,400
-And then pluck this string.
-This one?

694
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,200
This one.

695
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,400
No.

696
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,320
Look, it’s like this.

697
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,160
Let go of her!

698
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,200
It’s my husband’s voice.

699
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Why is he here?

700
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,840
It’s over!

701
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,680
Hurry, hide this now!

702
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,880
Xiaochuan, listen to me!

703
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,680
It’s not like that.

704
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,480
Who are you?

705
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,840
Why did you touch my wife?

706
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,040
He...

707
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,520
This...

708
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,160
He’s a fan of my books.

709
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,720
A fan?

710
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,040
Did you forget that I collected
the data for you?

711
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,720
Among the 108 fans of your books,

712
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,000
there are no male fans in any age group!

713
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,680
He... He’s not my fan.

714
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,560
He...

715
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
He’s my pursuer.

716
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,440
Yeah.

717
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,400
I’m pursuing Li crazily.

718
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,800
Listen.

719
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,640
I’m her husband.

720
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,080
This

721
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,920
is my wife.

722
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,800
Stay away from her.

723
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,800
Or I’ll beat you up whenever I see you.

724
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,400
Let’s go.

725
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,800
Be nicer to her then.

726
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,120
You heard that?

727
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,160
It’s time you told me.

728
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,960
What’s your attitude?

729
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,400
What’s wrong with my attitude?

730
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,400
What’s the attitude you should use
when asking for a favor?

731
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,840
I don’t need to teach you that, right?

732
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,520
Please tell me anything you found, okay?

733
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,720
Okay.

734
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,680
What I heard is that

735
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,480
SKL’s chairman did not demand that

736
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,320
MH should fire the one in charge.

737
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,240
So, your conclusion is...

738
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,480
My conclusion is that

739
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,120
Du Lei has a reason

740
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,400
insisting to fire Xiang Ding and Shen Xin

741
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,600
when he knew

742
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,240
there’s a better solution.

743
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,160
I suspect that

744
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,400
Shen Xin and Xiang Ding have known

745
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,920
Du Lei’s secret which frightens him.

746
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
So, they had to leave.

747
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,600
But Du Lei told me

748
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,800
SKL demanded to assign blame.

749
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,560
And what he did was to protect Shen Xin.

750
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,800
Besides,

751
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,880
he spent a lot of mind

752
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,200
to make them accept the new price.

753
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,560
What do you mean?

754
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,400
Are you saying that you trust Du Lei
instead of me?

755
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,480
That’s not what I mean.

756
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
It’s because he helped me a lot.

757
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,960
He helped you a lot?

758
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,760
Do you think why he helped you?

759
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,120
Because he likes you!
