1
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 14

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,520
You! Follow me!

4
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:47,960
What?

5
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,080
I know.

6
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,440
I just didn’t expect that it would happen so quickly.

7
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,800
And you’re living with that demon again

8
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,120
Who told me he’s heartless and cruel?

9
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
Who asked me to stop the imagination?

10
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
He’s a bad guy!

11
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
How long has it been?

12
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
Lower your voice.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
You can’t bad-mouth someone
while pointing your finger at him.

14
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,960
He’s my boss and landlord.

15
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,440
So

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
is he the only one with a house in the world?

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,200
Do you have to rent his house?

18
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,880
She’s pointing at you.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
They’re pointing at you.

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:31,960
At you!

21
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,760
Why me?

22
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,600
How do I know?

23
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,680
There’s no need to point at me.

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,760
A wise man submits to fate.

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,440
Also, I’m not sharing a house with him.

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,960
Say that to yourself.

27
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,920
We’re adults. You should have a sense
of propriety.

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,000
A sense of propriety!

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
I got it!

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,360
I was wrong, okay?

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,520
So, why did you want me here today?

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,960
Ah!

33
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,680
It’s all your fault. I only remembered
to warn you.

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
I almost forgot that.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,800
I have some good news.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Women are all like that.

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,360
This is the Dating App

38
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,400
I made,

39
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,360
West World.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,160
Dating App?

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,480
Are you sure?

42
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
Take a closer look.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,520
This is a revolutionary and brand-new product.

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,360
Well.

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,920
Dating Apps are pretty common now.

46
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,520
What’s special about your App?

47
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,000
It’s so different.

48
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,880
West World does not require
basic profiles,

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
and photos.

50
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,120
But users need to

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,360
pass a series of tests before signing in.

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Personality test.

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,560
IQ test.

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,079
And EQ test.

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,600
The big data system will

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,640
do a detailed analysis

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,320
on users’ answers

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,240
and provide them with a comprehensive mark.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,120
At last,

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,200
only those who can

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,360
be rated 100% suitable for each other

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
will be matched.

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,360
So, what you mean is

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,720
a perfect match.

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,600
It’s definitely a work of genius.

66
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Apart from precise matching,

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,560
this App equips blind dating
with intelligence and challenges.

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,280
The most important thing is...

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,160
What?

70
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,480
It has a gene identification matching system.

71
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,640
Gene identification?

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,520
Fortune-telling is superstitious.

73
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,000
Appearance is too coarse.

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,720
Only genes tell you the truth.

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,120
How do you conduct the gene identification?

76
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,360
Collection.

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,080
Build a data base of the simulation gene.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,600
I’ve collected a large amount of

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
gene statistics from couples
who have married over 10 years.

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,600
Summarize the general rules

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,200
from a biological science perspective,

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,560
and put these rules in my App.

83
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,960
Then every user will get to

84
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,960
find his or her date in the most precise way.

85
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,120
It sounds interesting.

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,960
It’s more than that.

87
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,200
Look.

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,159
There are three phases in the mode
of human’s blind dating.

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,600
We go to fortune-tellers in the feudal society.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,680
In the modern world,

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,120
we live in a time

92
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,520
when we get to love freely.

93
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,520
What does that mean?

94
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,320
It’s all about your competence, appearance
and feelings.

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
But in the future,

96
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,400
we’re going to see

97
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,120
a blind dating that is more

98
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
competitive and scientific.

99
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,640
This revolutionary App

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,040
will be launched and led by Mr. Li Xiaochuan.

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,360
Then what’s the ultimate goal

102
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,120
of your project?

103
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
The ultimate goal is

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,200
to achieve a perfect match within one click.

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,480
I heard it’s in the beta test right now.

106
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,560
Yeah.

107
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,720
I may need a lot of funds

108
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,159
in the following development.

109
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,440
So,

110
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,320
I’m looking for investors.

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,400
Jun.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,280
Isn’t MH an investment bank?

113
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
Can you invest in his App?

114
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,720
An investment bank is different
from an investment corporation.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,400
You should have a clear understanding of what

116
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
your good friend is doing.

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,240
Jun.

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,160
I do think this is a nice project.

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,920
What do you think?

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,880
Why’re you looking at me?

121
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,080
How about this?

122
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,480
Follow me to a place.

123
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,320
Beauty.

124
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,040
Can I buy you a drink?

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
I’m sorry. My boyfriend is here.

126
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,600
We’ve been waiting for half an hour.

127
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,080
What exactly are we waiting for

128
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,120
and going to do?

129
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,520
Xu Li.

130
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,680
It’s my design to bring you here.

131
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,720
I want to

132
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,720
give you a chance to be hit on.

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,600
Boring!

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,320
Xiaochuan.

135
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,120
How long have we been here?

136
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,000
Almost half an hour.

137
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,920
During this period,

138
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,040
how many times has
Jiang Jun been hit on?

139
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,240
I… I didn’t notice that.

140
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,800
In this bar,

141
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,600
there are 12 females without a male companion

142
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
and 20 males without a female companion.

143
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,720
If we observe the times that a girl has been hit on,

144
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
we can see her popularity

145
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,360
among males.

146
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,280
As the founder of a dating app,

147
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,640
you should have noticed such details.

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,680
No.

149
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,120
The popularity cannot be calculated.

150
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,560
You can’t turn the appearance,

151
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,440
body shape or makeup

152
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,920
into indexes.

153
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,920
Let me tell you in this way.

154
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,840
Among all 12 females without a male companion,

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Miss. Jiang’s popularity

156
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,280
ranks the seventh.

157
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,160
It can’t be that bad.

158
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,240
You don’t believe it?

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,600
Fine.

160
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
I have a question for you.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,560
How many times have you been hit on?

162
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,840
One time, right?

163
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,560
You saw that?

164
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,160
And the man who hit on you

165
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,440
is a douchebag.

166
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,520
How do you know that?

167
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,240
You made a guess, right?

168
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,120
I mean,

169
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,789
how can you know that?

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
The man who hit on you is at your 3 o’clock.

171
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,789
The tallest guy, right?

172
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,920
Look at his outfit and watch.

173
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,120
Although they’re designer products,

174
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,680
they don’t fit. So, they were borrowed.

175
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,960
Look at his hand.

176
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,280
Although he took off his wedding ring,

177
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,080
the mark it left is still there.

178
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,160
He’s a douchebag indeed.

179
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,040
He is.

180
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,000
My gosh!

181
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,240
What’s your head made of?

182
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,440
Xiaochuan,

183
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,080
if you want to develop a great dating website,

184
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,320
you have to know well
about sociology, sociability,

185
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
and psychology.

186
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,440
And you need to be equipped
with certain practice,

187
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,320
such as love and social experience.

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,240
But you are

189
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
a geek without any of that.

190
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,760
You haven’t even had

191
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,560
a serious relationship yet.

192
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,520
How could you develop

193
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,960
a good dating website?

194
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,280
Brother.

195
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
This is a bar.

196
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,560
People coming here are not
the targeted users for West World.

197
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,960
They won’t want

198
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,040
a regular partner.

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
Online dating is all about
meeting different people.

200
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,440
People coming here

201
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,040
could also find their true love.

202
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,040
Right?

203
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,640
Xiaochuan.

204
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I do understand that you want to
start up your own business.

205
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,080
But developing a dating app

206
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,240
is not suitable for

207
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,000
you, understand?

208
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
I’m doing this for your sake.

209
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,440
Li Xiaochuan!

210
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,200
You know nothing about me

211
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,880
and my website.

212
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,360
Xiaochuan.

213
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,040
Xiaochuan, don’t get angry.

214
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,520
What’s your mouth made of?

215
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
-Li! -Don’t go after him!
-Xiaochuan!

216
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,680
As an entrepreneur,

217
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,760
he has to go through such attack.

218
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,120
But your words are a bit harsh.

219
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,760
Enough. Can we stop talking about this?

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,560
Okay.

221
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,920
So, tell me

222
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,480
how’s your popularity

223
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
in this bar?

224
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,800
Okay.

225
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,600
Look at your 12 o’clock.

226
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
There is a girl in black.

227
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
She has the best figure in this bar

228
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,920
and she’s the prettiest.

229
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,160
So,

230
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,800
the person she’s looking at

231
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
is also the man

232
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,920
who has gotten the most attention.

233
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,320
You’re so narcissistic.

234
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,920
Fine.

235
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,840
You don’t believe me.

236
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,760
Then I’ll show you

237
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,640
how I reject her politely

238
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,000
while still leaving an impression
that I am attractive.

239
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,080
Excuse me, beauty.

240
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,960
Today, I’m here to drink, not to make friends.

241
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,520
Could you please make way for me?

242
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,800
Are you talking to me?

243
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,760
Yeah.

244
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,920
Can I buy you a drink?

245
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Yeah, sure.

246
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,920
I like to chat with beautiful ladies.

247
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,240
Yuan Shuai...

248
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,040
Seriously, he...

249
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,680
Let me show you a magical trick.

250
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,080
Look.

251
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,720
I have nothing in my hand, right?

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,920
Nothing.

253
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,120
See it clearly.

254
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,600
The magic moment is coming.

255
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,000
Mr. Li Xiaochuan, congratulations!

256
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,560
Congratulations on getting your first investor,
Xu Li!

257
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,960
Although others are not optimistic
to your product, I am!

258
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,120
You’re the best Li Xiaochuan in the universe!

259
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,360
Let’s just take it easy.

260
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,440
This is all I have.

261
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,840
I’ve been saving it for a long time.

262
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,440
Although I can’t be very helpful,

263
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,680
at least it should serve the purpose
temporarily.

264
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,960
Take it back.

265
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,240
Why is your hand so cold?

266
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,680
I think your judgment about Xiaochuan

267
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,720
has influenced your judgment about the project.

268
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,200
It is because I know too well about him.

269
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
So, I know

270
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,200
this project is not suitable for him at all.

271
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
So, what’s your judgment of him?

272
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,280
I will fully support him

273
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
as long as he

274
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,240
doesn’t do anything about love.

275
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
Of all things, that punk chose

276
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,120
something that is not

277
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,720
suitable for him at all.

278
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,160
Of course I should stop him.

279
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,640
So, you think you rejected his project

280
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,200
because you know him too well.

281
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,520
But have you ever thought about a fact that

282
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,040
a man is bound to have some shortcomings?

283
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,520
Xiaochuan has them.

284
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,440
So do you.

285
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,880
You did what you think is good for him

286
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,880
in a way he found difficult to take.

287
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,440
You hadn’t considered his feelings.

288
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,000
And,

289
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,760
I think West World is promising.

290
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,680
You sound clear and logical
when talking about me.

291
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
What about yourself?

292
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,000
What about me?

293
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,560
Do you know well about this app?

294
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,240
Did you ever try it?

295
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,200
Do you know

296
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
what kind of advantages and disadvantages,

297
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,360
targeted users or core competence it has?

298
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,040
You said you want to support him

299
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,200
in developing a dating app.

300
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,520
But do you know love?

301
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,600
You sounded like you know it well.

302
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,880
Luckily,

303
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,880
I do know some of it.

304
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
So, Mr. Yuan has dated a lot of girls, right?

305
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,080
No.

306
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,960
Not once.

307
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,960
Not once?

308
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,360
Now you sounded like you have.

309
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,560
Of course no.

310
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,960
You know my condition.

311
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
If I broke up with someone,

312
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,520
I would have to be hospitalized.

313
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
So,

314
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,800
I told you

315
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,520
you should study medicine.

316
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,600
Study your own physiological structure.

317
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,400
But why haven’t you dated anyone?

318
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,600
If you want to,

319
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,880
it would be easy.

320
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
There’s a pretty girl
who likes to follow you around

321
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,120
in the company.

322
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
A pretty girl?

323
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,920
Nothing. You misheard me.

324
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,480
Actually,

325
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
I do like someone.

326
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,520
But,

327
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,720
after seeing a girl

328
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,880
who was greatly affected

329
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,840
by a rejected love letter,

330
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
I dare not to tell her my feelings.

331
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,160
When did you have someone you like?

332
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,760
If you dare not to do it,

333
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,960
you could tell me.

334
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,109
I can help you.

335
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,440
That’s a secret crush,

336
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,349
do you understand that?

337
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,880
It’s a nice way

338
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,480
to describe a coward.

339
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
I’m afraid that if I told her,

340
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,160
we wouldn’t be friends anymore.

341
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,800
It seems like raining.

342
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,720
Let’s go home.

343
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,540
<i>West World</i>

344
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,940
<i>Sign Up</i>

345
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,180

346
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:42,180
<i>Nickname: A Big Yellow Pear </i>

347

348
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,800
<i>Failed Match</i>

349
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,120
What the heck? Why did the match fail?

350
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,000
Li Xiaochuan,

351
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
is your app reliable or not?

352
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,440
Never mind.

353
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,160
Anyway, I need to support him

354
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,800
since he’s the one I chose.

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,880
Yuan Shuai didn’t support him at all.

356
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,160
Who else would support him?

357
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,440
I need to support him!

358
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,360
Oh, yeah.

359
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
Mr. Du, the capable friend

360
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,920
of Jun.

361
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,840
Hello, Jun.

362
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,640
I have something important

363
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,360
to discuss with you. I’ll go find you now.

364
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,640
Bye.

365
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,080
What’s wrong? Why are you so hasty?

366
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,840
Jun, do me a favor.

367
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,160
I was thinking...

368
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,840
Can you tell Mr. Du about this?

369
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,880
Ask him to

370
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,320
check Xiaochuan’s project, okay?

371
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,600
Yuan Shuai was not

372
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,760
being objective today.

373
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,600
I know. Drink some water first.

374
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,440
Take it easy.

375
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,400
I also think his judgment is

376
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,440
biased today.

377
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,000
Well,

378
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,440
then...

Well, sorry.

389
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,160
I have a friend who’s starting his business.

390
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
He developed a dating app,

391
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,920
which is in the beta test right now.

392
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,040
He’s looking for some professionals’ opinions.

394
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah, no problem.

Love you!

403
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,840
I don’t know what to do without you.

404
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240

It’s a dating app.

415
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,560
You can try it out

416
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,800
if you need it.

417
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,520
Okay, I will try it out.

418
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,160
So, you think you rejected his project

419
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,760
because you know him too well.

420
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,960
But have you ever thought about a fact that

421
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,600
a man is bound to have some shortcomings?

422
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,920
Xiaochuan has them.

423
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,800
So do you.

424
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,480
You did what you think is good for him

425
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
in a way he found difficult to take.

426
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,200
You hadn’t considered his feelings.

427
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,440

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,280
Because I already have someone I like.

470
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,920
So, I wouldn’t believe this.

471
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,600
Why do you still use a dating app
since you already like someone?

472
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,360
So,

487

Definitely not.

Why do you want to develop a dating app?

499
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,680
Because I hope people

500
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,840
could find their

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,400

through this algorithm?

506
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,040
No.

507
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,280
I don’t have a girlfriend.

the core competence of West World?

519
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,600
The perfect algorithm.

520
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,240
The invincible database.

521
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,320
Why do you think so?

522
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,040
Because

523
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,080
I can turn their past experiences,

524
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,240

525
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,360
EQ and IQ

527
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,400
Can love be turned into data?

528
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,640
Of course.

529

I do appreciate your intelligence and algorithm.

But unluckily, you lost.

531
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,800
You used what you’re good at

532
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,960
to deny what I’m good at.

533
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,520
This

534
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,800
is not fair.

535
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,520
If you’re developing an app about sports,

536
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,640
how am I supposed to believe someone

537
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,000
lying on the boxing ring?

538
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,200
Likewise,

539
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,640
you have never dated anyone.

540
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,280
A man who has never dated anyone

541
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,800

How am I supposed to persuade

543
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,960
the investors and users?

544
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,880
I know what you’re trying to say.

545
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,280

I idealized love, right?

547
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,160
But here’s the story.

548
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,520
It is because I know nothing about it

549
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,080
that I can develop a dating app

550
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,040
that is so rational

551
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,960
and objective.

552
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
I can let them know

553
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,240
what right choices and wrong impulses are. Right?

554
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,480
I admit that

555
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,200
it’s a good idea to

556
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
help someone find

557
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,160
his or her perfect match.

558
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,280

By the way, did you sign up?

570
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,160
What’s your ID?

571
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
What are you doing?

572
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,320
You scared me.

573
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
The guilty look.

574
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,280
You are slacking off, right?

575
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,120
You were so quiet.

576
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,760
Anyone would be scared. Okay?

577
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
This is the lunch break.

578
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,920
I’m here...

579
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,360
Yes!

580
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,560
I want to ask you about

581
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,760
the experience on

582
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,800
South World or East World.

583
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,440
It’s West World.

584
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,040
Oh, okay.

585
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,160
How’s it?

586
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,320
I thought you didn’t care about it.

587
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,560
If asking a question means I care about it,

588
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,120
I would care about so many things then.

589
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Drink yourself.

590
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,160
Who would use those coffee beans
which were touched by your hand?

591
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,640
Little West is here to remind you

592
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,320
to strengthen your relationship
with your perfect match.

593
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,040
I don’t need to.

594
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,760
Find a topic.

595
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,680
Fine, the master of the secret crush.

596
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,840
Did you confess your love?

597
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,120
Did you meet someone you like?

598
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,360
Not yet.

599
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
I’m busy with my work.
I don’t have any time for that.

600
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,040
Busy?

601
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,040
She’s definitely single

602
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,560
because she’s too busy with her work.

603
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,480
Seems that quick match

604
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,680
does have a large market.

605
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,240
That’s hypocrite.

606
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,760
You’re still chatting online while you don’t have time?

607
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,840
I’m snatching a little leisure
from a busy life, okay?

608
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,360
Most users on this app

609
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,640
are those who work in big cities

610
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,480
and have no time to meet new people.

611
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,480
I have to remind you.

612
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,600
Don’t expect anything from me.

613
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,680
I’m faithful to the one

614
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,000
I like.

615
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,040
Bro, a secret love sounds good.

616
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
But aren’t you afraid that

617
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,520
someone would take her away?

618
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,480
Xu Li!

619
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,520
Xiaochuan!

620
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,800
This...

621
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,220
This was made by you?

622
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,360
<i>West World</i>
This was made by you?

623
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,880
<i>West World</i>

624
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,620
Although this is not a big store,
<i>West World</i>

625
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,440
Although this is not a big store,

626
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,960
there are a lot of people passing by.

627
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,000
And people live here are all elites.

628
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,680
Perhaps some of them are your potential users.

629
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,760
Thank you.

630
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,640
I believe that West World

631
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,880
will find the man

632
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,440
most suitable for you some day.

633
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,680
You don’t need to say thank you to me.

634
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,320
By the way,

635
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,880
why are you here?

636
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,160
I have a question for you.

637
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,480
Take a seat.

638
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,680
You said you wrote love stories, right?

639
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,710
Since people like to date someone so much,

640
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,840
and they fail at it quite often,

641
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,480
why do they keep doing it?

642
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,080
Such a philosophical question.

643
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Let me think...

644
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,120
Dating is like a process where

645
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,120
two different souls

646
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,320
get closer because of destiny.

647
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,320
They might have many difficulties

648
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,880
and conflicts in the process.

649
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,480
But!

650
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,000
They are willing to understand and tolerate
each other.

651
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,190
Also, they’re willing to change themselves
for each other.

652
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,320
So, even though you met the wrong one,

653
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,630
went through so many difficulties
and started over,

654
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,630
you would still expect the true love

655
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,480
at the thought that you would

656
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,400
meet the right one.

657
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,120
Not right.

658
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,880
I think it’s because

659
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,600
technology is less advanced before.

660
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,920
Don’t you think

661
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,920
that so many tragedies

662
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,560
occurred because

663
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,320
people loved someone so blindly?

664
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,160
But love is always blind.

665
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,040
You meet her, your heart flutters
and you fall in love with her.

666
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Then, you’re together.

667
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,120
Why do you have to care about
the rights and wrongs?

668
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,160
Because people get improved

669
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,040
at different rates and have different limits.

670
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,560
When two individuals

671
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,080
are too different,

672
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,640
they can’t get improved together.

673
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,160
And when that

674
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,200
happens,

675
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,000
they’re bound to part each other.

676
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,520
Then there would be no love left.

677
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,080
Since the variants are so enormous,

678
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,040
why don’t we

679
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,160
use data to

680
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,400
match those who’re the most similar?

681
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,280
Well,

682
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,880
then do you think

683
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,920
we will get improved together?

684
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,200
I mean, why you behaved so weird?

685
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,680
Well.

686
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,320
Mr. Du said West World is

687
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,760
good in general.

688
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,640
But I missed one core index.

689
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,360
I’m still looking for the answer.

690
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,720
I see.

691
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,760
A package for Xu Li.

692
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,000
Wait a minute.

693
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,000
Wait.

694
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,240
Hello.

695
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,760
Hello.

696
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,400
Please sign for this.

697
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,040
Okay.

698
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,080
Thank you.

699
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,680
You’re welcome.

700
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,080
What is this?

701
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,200
Wait a moment.

702
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,560
Take a look.

703
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,520
This is?

704
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,800
These are blind boxes.

705
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,600
It means we have no idea what’re inside them.

706
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,440
In short,

707
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,840
I bought some toys blindly.

708
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,280
I don’t know whether they’re good-looking,

709
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,720
they’re useful,

710
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,000
or they’re a good deal.

711
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,680
People will buy that?

712
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,960
Yeah, it’s so popular.

713
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,880
It’s funny. Try yourself.

714
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,360
Open it.

715
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,960
It’s so ugly.

716
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,200
Don’t loathe it.

717
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,080
No matter it’s ugly or pretty,
you’re meant to meet each other.

718
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,120
Try it again.

719
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,080
You will find something you like.

720
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,000
Thank you.

721
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,720
I think I’ve found the answer.

722
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,880
Wait.

723
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,520
Again?

724
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,200
One more cuddle?

725
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,000
Is he taking advantage of me?

726
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,880
Is he your boyfriend?

727
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,280
He’s handsome and treats you so good.

728
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,480
I’m so jealous.

729
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,760
He...

730
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,480
He’s always like that.

731
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,680
Sorry.

732
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,560
By the way, have a look at this.

733
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,400
This app

734
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,760
can do

735
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,320
a quick match for you.

736
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,160
I got my boyfriend from it.

737
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,200
I’ll try it immediately.

738
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,440
Scan that code on the poster.

739
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,120
Okay.

740
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,380
<i>Li Xiaochuan</i>

741
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,040
Hello.

742
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,760
You figured it out so quickly?

743
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,000
I know where the problem lies in West World.

744
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,360
Go on.

745
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,320
Now West World

746
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,960
has all kinds of algorithm.

747
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,960
But it missed one thing, fate.

748
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,200
What’s your

749
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,160
specific plan to improve it?

750
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,480
I was thinking about...

751
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,400
Besides what we have,

752
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,160
we can add

753
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,200
an X Fate Match Mode.

754
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,600
It’s like buying blind boxes.

755
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,680
Those who do not have

756
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,960
a perfect match

757
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,360
can do a random match.

758
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
This mode

759
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,040
will not be restricted to

760
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
any preconditions.

761
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,240
The system could reduce the factors

762
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,240
of EQ, IQ and genes

763
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,960
according to the frequency of their chat

764
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,560
and the users’ feelings.

765
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,840
That is to say,

766
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,880
a random match

767
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,280
may become a perfect match.

768
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,040
What do you think?

769
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,080
It sounds like a great breakthrough.

770
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,240
How about this?

771
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,280
Like what you thought and planned,

772
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,720
you need to develop West World 2.0.

773
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,200
You don’t have to worry about funds.

774
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,880
Wh… What do you mean?

775
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,720
I mean I’m going to invest in you.

776
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,000
So, you can go on with your RD.

777
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,440
Really?

778
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,600
Of course.

779
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,360
Th… Thank you.

780
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,080
Thank you!

781
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,280
I’ll work hard.

782
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,520
Mr. Du has decided to invest in West World.

783
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,680
Really?

784
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,120
It’s true.

785
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,160
Really?

786
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,840
Well.

787
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,880
Then do you have any other plans?

788
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,880
Yes.

789
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,120
Well.

790
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,120
I will receive

791
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,480
Mr. Du’s funds soon.

792
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,240
So, I will need to finish the frame

793
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,640
and run the data analysis.

794
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,960
And show the analysis to...

795
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,240
Xiaochuan, I don’t mean this.

796
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,920
I mean, do you have any other things needed to do?

797
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,880
Of course.

798
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,760
I will make Mr. Du’s money worthy.

799
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,560
I will try to develop a good app.

800
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,640
Xiaochuan,

801
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,200
I mean...

802
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Think about it.

803
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,040
It’s Jun who introduced you to Mr. Du.

804
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,520
And now Mr. Du decided to invest in you.

805
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,000
Shouldn’t you do something
to show your gratitude?

806
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,600
Like inviting them to a dinner,

807
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,480
or holding a party.

808
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,560
You’re right.

809
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,400
I should thank them

810
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,640
and thank you!

811
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,360
Okay.

812
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,760
It’s fine. I’ll take care of it.

813
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,120
Leave it to me.

814
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,920
I’m going to do it now.

815
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,560
Don’t you need my help?

816
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,680
Jun.

817
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,560
Xiaochuan is taking us out
for a nice dinner tomorrow.

818
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,080
Please arrive on time.

819
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,440
I’ll send you the location.

820
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,560
A nice dinner?

821
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,040
Why?

822
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,680
You will know it when you arrive.

823
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,720
Why are you so mysterious?

824
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,720
You got together?

825
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
If that’s the case,

826
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,920
it won’t be as easy as a nice dinner.

827
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,720
I will invite you to the moon!

828
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,920
Fine. I need to go.

829
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,680
I have to work overtime now.

830
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,680
Take a rest early.

831
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,080
Good night.

832
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,960
Why do you come here

833
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,160
instead of working hard?

834
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,520
Yuan Shuai.

835
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,080
Do you think Shanghai is a big city?

836
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,400
No.

837
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,800
Why?

838
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,440
We met again.

839
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,560
Is it big?

840
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,160
Why?

841
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,440
Why do you become so emotional?

842
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,480
Yeah.

843
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,640
People

844
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,920
would always feel themselves so small

845
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,360
when facing something big.

846
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,720
You can stay. I will go back to work.

847
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,800
Wait.

848
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,040
I may work late today.

849
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,600
Take Wealth for a walk for me.

850
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,440
Wealth is so unlucky

851
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,480
to have an owner like you.

852
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,760
What’s your password?

853
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,880
0905.

854
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,360
0905?

855
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,680
Is it the day when you eliminated me?

856
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,840
Think about it carefully.

857
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,560
It’s not your birthday.

858
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,600
Is it the birthday of Wealth?

859
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,160
Think again.

860
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,800
0905?

861
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,360
0905 is

862
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,600
the day when we met again.
