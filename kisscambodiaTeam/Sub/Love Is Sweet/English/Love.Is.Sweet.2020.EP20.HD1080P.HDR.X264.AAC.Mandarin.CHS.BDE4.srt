00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,980
Love Is Sweet

2
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,900
Episode 20

3
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,920
No! No! Please don’t misunderstand.

4
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
Yuan

5
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,920
already has a girlfriend.

6
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,670
Hello.

7
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
It’s

8
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
approved

9
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,960
Hezhong

10
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,320
went public successfully!

11
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,600
Congratulations!

12
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,760
This is your first time as a sponsor

13
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,880
and the company went public smoothly.

14
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
It’s everyone’s credit.

15
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
Thank you!

16
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,800
Thank you!

17
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,560
Ok, everyone.

18
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,360
Let’s take a picture. Come on.

19
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,480
Ok, ok. Come.

20
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,920
Three, two, one. Yeah!

21
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Come in.

22
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
Ms. Qiao, what’s up?

23
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,160
Mr. Wu from Hezhong would like to

24
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,400
invite us to dinner this evening

25
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,360
to catch up on old times.

26
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,240
Mr. Wu?

27
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,400
Why didn’t he contact me?

28
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,520
I made an appointment with his wife at dinner.

29
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,760
You’ve been so busy.

30
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,160
Ok.

31
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
I just haven’t seen Mr. Wu for a long time.

32
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,080
I may as well meet with him tonight.

33
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,400
Then be there at seven tonight.

34
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,800
I’ll send you the address later.

35
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,440
Ok.

36
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
It is cold today.

37
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,360
Put on more clothes.

38
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,600
Ok.

39
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Don’t worry.

40
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
The patient showed good signs after the operation.

41
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,960
He should be waking up soon.

42
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,280
I was wrong.

43
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,640
How many times was that?

44
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,840
Four.

45
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,200
How many grades did you get?

46
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,120
Ninety-two.

47
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,440
How many times do we still need?

48
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Four.

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,760
Du Lei, remember that

50
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
you are my son.

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
You have to be the best,

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,080
not the second best.

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
More!

54
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,760
You are awake.

55
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,040
The rumors about you out there

56
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,600
are affecting the morale of the company.

57
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,520
But don’t worry.

58
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,360
I have taken care of it.

59
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,920
-The reporter will give you a face-to-face…
-Wait a minute.

60
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,440
Come here.

61
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,320
I’m a little tired.

62
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,320
I can’t hear you clearly.

63
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,440
The video of the interview

64
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,400
will be released on the same day
with the press conference.

65
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,480
As for the other competitors,

66
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,440
I’ve basically stabilized them.

67
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,680
You can count on me.

68
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,080
Thank you.

69
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
If there is nothing else to do,

70
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,600
I’m going back.

71
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,880
Wait a minute.

72
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,320
When did you get here?

73
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
Where is your sister?

74
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,120
In fact, it doesn’t matter

75
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
how many years have passed.

76
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,720
If a man wants to get mature

77
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
and sensible,

78
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,680
he really needs to go through some hardships

79
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,280
and crises.

80
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,840
I’m glad

81
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,120
you’ve grown up.

82
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,320
Anyway,

83
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,520
thank you for helping our family

84
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,280
through this crisis.

85
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Don’t get me wrong.

86
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I was not helping you.

87
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,440
I just did

88
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,520
what I had to do.

89
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,960
If you must thank me,

90
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,920
I hope from today on

91
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,440
I have nothing to do with the Du family.

92
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,520
You know what?

93
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,800
I still don’t know

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,480
why at the time of my son’s death

95
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,720
I found a child

96
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,080
born at the same time

97
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,280
on the same day

98
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,160
of the same year

99
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
as my son,

100
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,240
adopted him,

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
and raised him.

102
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,600
I think…

103
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,120
I feel that I have done

104
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,750
more or less the wrong thing.

105
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,560
Let bygones be bygones.

106
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,840
It’s nothing.

107
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,480
Fine.

108
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,040
If you think that

109
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,520
all you have done over the past few days

110
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,000
is worth more than ten years of my upbringing,

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,240
I have no objection.

112
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,800
Boys

113
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,280
should always run away

114
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,160
when they grow up.

115
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,480
Lei.

116
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,600
When I get out of the hospital, and if you want,

117
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,440
I can go to the courthouse with you

118
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,840
and put an end to our relationship.

119
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,240
I mean it.

120
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,360
Thank you.

121
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,080
Have a good rest.

122
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,120
It’s so cold outside today.

123
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,440
Let me treat you to ice cream!

124
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,880
Are you frozen?

125
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,560
What are you doing?

126
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
Are you angry?

127
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,600
You…

128
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,080
Don’t do this again.

129
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
I’m just kidding.

130
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
Don’t be angry.

131
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,240
I’m not angry.

132
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,320
Ok, then.

133
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,560
I guess you don’t have time

134
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,600
to buy things for the season.

135
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,960
I bought you facial masks.

136
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,760
You can use one a day.
It will moisturize your skin

137
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,800
and prevent dryness.

138
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,600
This foot-soaking capsule

139
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,760
can remove cold. Isn’t it perfect?

140
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,160
You’re watching the video of that day?

141
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
That’s right.

142
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,840
I really did not expect that

143
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,520
the first couple to match 100%

144
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,720
was actually Yuan Shuai and Jun.

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
Neither did I.

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,800
Xiaochuan.

147
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,920
Isn’t your app a little inaccurate?

148
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,440
Why do I think they’re not a good match?

149
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,680
Is there anything wrong?

150
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,560
Unlikely!

151
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
There are no problems with

152
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,560
the West World’s matching system.

153
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
They’ll be together for sure.

154
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,800
But I really don’t think it’s accurate.

155
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,200
What about the one-percent match?

156
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,360
Easy.

157
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,040
One percent means

158
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,800
it’s completely impossible

159
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,640
because they’re totally inappropriate
for each other.

160
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,200
Li Xiaochuan!

161
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,160
What?

162
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,160
I’m going to do the cleaning.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,760
Cold?

164
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,640
It is so cold outside.

165
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,640
I’m almost frozen to death on a delivery trip.

166
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,320
The weather forecast said it might snow today.

167
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,560
Really? The first snow comes so early?

168
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes.

169
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,920
<i>Yuan Shuai: Come in here.</i>

170
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,680
<i>Yuan Shuai: Come in here.</i>
Come in here.

171
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,280
Mr. Yuan asked me
to write the fundraising risk assessment report.

172
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,240
I forgot to hand it in.

173
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,040
I’m so over.

174
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I’ll be scolded.

175
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,160
It’s here. It’s here.

176
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,440
When did Mr. Yuan ask her

177
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,920
to do a fundraising risk assessment?

178
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Why didn’t I know that?

179
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,880
Doctor,

180
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
she took a shortcut to the top long ago

181
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,880
when you were working hard.

182
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,880
As for you,

183
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,000
you can’t write a prospectus
without being rejected ten times.

184
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,240
Who cares?

185
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,200
I have my own way.

186
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
How noble you are!

187
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,240
Did you have a good time
teasing me at noon today,

188
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,680
Ms. Jiang?

189
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,400
If it’s a play, make it a full play.

190
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,200
Isn’t that the task you assigned me?

191
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,360
Mr. Yuan, you can’t be so narrow-minded.

192
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,400
Come here.

193
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,520
What?

194
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,320
Come here!

195
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,600
Warm your cold hands.

196
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,000
Don’t fall sick.

197
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,880
Ok. Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

198
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,920
I’m afraid that if you get ill,
it might affect your work.

199
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,120
I’m not going to be easier on you
just because you are sick.

200
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,480
Warm?

201
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,480
Mr. Yuan,

202
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,240
it is said that
there will be the first snow this evening.

203
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,560
So?

204
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
How rare it is to have snow in Shanghai!

205
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,920
Shouldn’t it be a little ritualistic?

206
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,800
What kind of ritual do you want?

207
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,400
Why don’t we cook hot pot at home?

208
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,520
Hot pot?

209
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,880
Good idea.

210
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,560
I have something to do tonight,

211
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,920
but I’ll go home as soon as I can.

212
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,360
Then I’ll eat it by myself.

213
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,480
If you come back late,
you won’t have anything to eat.

214
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,760
You really know how to make hot pot?

215
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,080
I remember the soup you made

216
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,720
was unbearable even for Wealth.

217
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,760
Who are you belittling?

218
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,000
I promise it will move you
to tears this time.

219
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,240
Ok, I’ll wait.

220
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,000
Ok. I’m not cold any more.

221
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
I’m going.

222
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,680
First snow?

223
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,320
Wealth.

224
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,640
Are you here to welcome me?

225
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,720
Let’s go.

226
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,920
Come here.

227
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,080
Come here.

228
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,920
Never mind.

229
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,680
If I set up the table with candles,
he’ll laugh at me.

230
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,680
Where are Mr. Wu and Mrs. Wu?

231
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,520
Actually, they didn’t ask you out.

232
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,840
It’s me.

233
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,200
Is there something you can’t say at work

234
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,280
so that you have to ask me out?

235
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,800
There are a lot of things that
I can’t talk about in the office.

236
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,720
Let’s have dinner first.

237
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,120
These are your favorite foods.

238
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,480
Actually, I met a girl in the company today,

239
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,120
and she told me

240
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
you had a girlfriend.

241
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,040
Is it true?

242
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,480
I don’t have a girlfriend.

243
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,560
So that’s it.

244
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
How could you possibly have a girlfriend?

245
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,040
Why can’t I have a girlfriend?

246
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Yuan Shuai.

247
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,120
They said that

248
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,600
love is a momentary impulse.

249
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,360
Do you believe in the eternal love?

250
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,600
I do.

251
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,920
Of course I do.

252
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,000
I believe, like most people,

253
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,600
that an instant can become an eternity.

254
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,760
Do you think

255
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,440
there will be a moment like that

256
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
between us?

257
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,040
No.

258
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,880
Why?

259
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Everyone thinks we are

260
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,920
the perfect match.

261
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,920
Qiao Na,

262
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,360
you’re my best partner

263
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,640
at work.

264
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,240
I also sincerely

265
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,200
regard you as my best friend.

266
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
But apart from that,

267
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,320
there is nothing else between us.

268
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,440
Yuan Shuai!

269
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,000
Sorry! Sorry!

270
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
I didn’t mean it.

271
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,800
That’s ok. I’m going to the bathroom.

272
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,520
Wealth,

273
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,080
why isn’t your father back yet?

274
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,080
Why don’t I give him a call?

275
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,480
It’s ok for the subordinate

276
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,800
to care about the leader.

277
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,840
It’s not safe at night, is it?

278
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,320
See?

279
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,280
There’s so much to eat.

280
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,200
It’s too much for us. Right?

281
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,480
Call him?

282
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,680
Forget that.

283
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,240
Let’s eat it.

284
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,120
Some vinegar for you.

285
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,200
Wealth, there’s no vinegar.

286
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,960
I’ll ask your father
to buy you a bottle of vinegar, okay?

287
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
Don’t you like vinegar?

288
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Let me give him a call.

289
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,480
Hello. There’s no vinegar left at home.

290
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,800
What vinegar?

291
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,360
Ms. Qiao?

292
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,840
Yes, it’s me.

293
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,080
Mr. Yuan has no time

294
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,480
to guide you in your work tonight.

295
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,760
We are very busy.

296
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,400
Don’t call again.

297
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,600
Who cares if you don’t come back?

298
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,040
I’ll eat it myself!

299
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,760
You’ll be sorry! You’ll be sorry!

300
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,520
I have a few things to do, so I’m leaving.

301
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,200
Do you have something to do
with some other girl?

302
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,480
Whoever it is, it’s my business.

303
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,520
Sit down!

304
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,680
Yuan Shuai,

305
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,960
I’ve been in love with you
for so many years.

306
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,280
Are you sure you don’t feel a thing?

307
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,920
I’d rather you didn’t feel it

308
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,520
than you know it

309
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,000
but pretend you don’t.

310
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,280
But,

311
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
what’s not good about me?

312
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,920
Is there something wrong with me
that I don’t deserve you?

313
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,120
I don’t want to hurt you.

314
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,720
But I’m really sorry.

315
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,280
I already have a girl I like.

316
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
What do you mean by that?

317
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,520
Ever since I met you,

318
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,120
you’ve never had a girl beside you.

319
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,200
Is it the girl from the company
who follows you around every day?

320
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,320
I like her for my own sake.

321
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,040
It has nothing to do with her.

322
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,160
So I’m sorry.

323
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,080
I can’t tell you.

324
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,400
Ok.

325
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,160
Let me ask you one last question.

326
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,760
If the one you like doesn’t like you,

327
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,280
can you

328
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,000
come back to me?

329
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,560
Even if the girl I like doesn’t like me,

330
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,680
I won’t take a look at anyone else but her.

331
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,040
So rare!

332
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,480
The invincible man

333
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,080
is as humble as I am in love.

334
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,200
No.

335
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,960
We’re not the same.

336
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,760
At least I can speak up.

337
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,520
But you

338
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,040
don’t even have the courage to say it.

339
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,840
I’m leaving.

340
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,480
It is snowing.

341
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,360
Xiaochuan,

342
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,120
hurry up.

343
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,480
Look!

344
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,280
It’s snowing.

345
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,360
It is said that
those who see the first snow together

346
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,960
will become gray-haired together.

347
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,960
Those are the lies

348
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,320
to deceive little girls.

349
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,960
You are watching the first snow outside.

350
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,960
Of course your hair will be gray,

351
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,800
because the snow is falling on your head.

352
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
You’re not romantic at all.

353
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,080
You just said that

354
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,320
those who see the first snow together
will become gray-haired together.

355
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,920
There’s no data to back this up.

356
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,960
It’s not reliable.

357
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,280
Ok. Ok.

358
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,960
Your big data is the most reliable.

359
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,880
So

360
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,640
why aren’t your perfect couple

361
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,080
being together yet?

362
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,480
Why?

363
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,800
Why?

364
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:02,880
Hello.

365
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,880
Hello, Ms. Qiao.

366
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,520
Send me our financing proposal

367
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,280
right away.

368
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,400
Mr. Feng, how is this possible?

369
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,760
You agreed to give me a week.

370
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,080
It’s only five days.

371
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,000
Now you suddenly want it.
I can’t come up with it at all.

372
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,760
No.

373
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,840
My investors are suddenly changing
their investment ratio.

374
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,960
Anyway,

375
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,080
I’m going to get it by daybreak.

376
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,840
Hello?

377
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,080
Du!

378
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,160
Is Dad feeling better?

379
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,480
Much better.

380
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
The doctor said he would be discharged

381
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,200
in a few more days.

382
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
I’m pretty much done
with the affairs of the company.

383
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,000
Don’t worry.

384
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,120
You are here.

385
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,240
I have nothing to worry about.

386
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,640
Do you remember,

387
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,840
when you were a kid
and you didn’t do well in a test,

388
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,320
you cried your eyes out.

389
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,720
And you got beaten up by Dad.

390
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And then

391
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,360
you stayed up all night comforting me.

392
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,040
The next day,
you looked exactly like a panda

393
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,800
with two dark circles under your eyes.

394
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
You still remember that?

395
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Of course.

396
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,560
You are telling me.

397
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,480
You made me look like a ghost for a few days.

398
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,360
You look really nice

399
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,160
when you smile.

400
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,320
Du.

401
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,320
Now you are no longer a member of the Du family,

402
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,200
and we are no longer siblings.

403
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,240
Have you ever thought about

404
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,520
trying to get along with me in another way?

405
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,240
What way?

406
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,640
Can we be together?

407
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,200
Dishonest.

408
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,840
Hypocritical.

409
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,800
Playboy.

410
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,320
You led me on! Shame on you!

411
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,880
Yet you occupy half of my house,

412
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,680
half of my sofa, half of my living room,

413
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,160
half of my bedroom,

414
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,960
and half of my wardrobe. Why?

415
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,520
You are dreaming!

416
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,120
Get out of my wardrobe!

417
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,640
Get out!

418
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,480
Get out!

419
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,600
Get out!

420
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,400
What’s this?

421
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,400
Wealth.

422
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,120
Are you

423
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,400
the same Wealth ten years ago?

424
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,200
So it is you.

425
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,740
<i>Love Is Sweet;
choose the capable people; encourage all that is good</i>

426
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,280
He still has my notes

427
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,590
and love letters.

428
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,440
Crying Girl.

429
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,080
Hello.

430
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,520
I’m Brother Yuanyuan.

431
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,480
Although

432
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,150
you only called me that once,

433
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,240
I really like it when you call me that.

434
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,590
When you read this letter,

435
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,480
I will go to study abroad.

436
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,400
I don’t know when I’ll be back.

437
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,520
You mustn’t miss me too much.

438
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,160
If you really miss me,

439
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,520
just call me.

440
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,200
Call me when you feel like crying.

441
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,720
And remember to call me

442
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,920
when someone bullies you.

443
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,040
Well.

444
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,000
Actually,

445
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,560
I hate to leave you.

446
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,320
Before I go,

447
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,680
I want to tell you a secret.

448
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,560
A secret that only a silly girl like you

449
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,360
can’t find out.

450
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,040
I’ve

451
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
always had a crush on you.

452
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,760
When did you have someone you like?

453
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,120
If you dare not to do it,

454
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,350
you could tell me.

455
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,520
I can help you.

456
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
That’s a secret crush,

457
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
do you understand that?

458
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,400
It’s a nice way

459
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,800
to describe a coward.

460
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,520
I’m afraid that if I told her,

461
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,520
we wouldn’t be friends anymore.

462
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,840
<i>Yuan Shuai</i>

463
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,720
What are you doing

464
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,120
out there in the cold?

465
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
I am looking for you.

466
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,040
I’m sorry.

467
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,640
I was late.

468
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,000
I…

469
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,920
I…

470
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,520
Jiang Jun,

471
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,880
I don’t want to wait any longer.

472
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,960
Yuan Shuai, I want to cry.

473
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,520
I love you.

474
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,240
In fact,

475
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,280
the two of us could be

476
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,160
in any kind of relationship.

477
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,790
But not this one.

478
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,860
I have someone I like.
