Love Is Sweet

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,190
Episode 17

3
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
<i>Emergency Department</i>

4
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
Are you alright?

5
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,820
Mr. Yuan, you’re awake.

6
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,460
How could you

7
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,100
treat yourself so badly?

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,780
You shouldn’t have pushed yourself so much

9
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,380
I’m fine now.

10
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,780
Su Chang,

11
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,380
see Ms. Qiao off.

12
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,220
I have nothing to do.

13
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,540
I’ll keep you company.

14
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,940
I’m fine.

15
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,460
There’re nurses and doctors.

16
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,220
You can go back.

17
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,420
Well, Ms. Qiao,

18
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,020
it’s not appropriate for you to stay here.

19
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,380
Let me see you off.

20
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,100
I can take care of him.

21
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,260
Alright.

22
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,700
I’ll come to see you tomorrow then.

23
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,500
Mr. Yuan.

24
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,820
Let me help you.

25
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,100
Where’s Jiang Jun?

26
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,060
She was not here when we came.

27
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,620
How did Qiao Na know I had surgery?

28
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,460
Mr. Yuan, I’ll admit it.

29
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,780
She forced me to say it.

30
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,740
Please forgive me.

31
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,060
I’ll give you a chance to correct your mistake.

32
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,740
Hello?

33
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,140
Jiang Jun, where are you?

34
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,140
Mr. Yuan felt bad in the hospital.

35
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:04,980
What happened?

36
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,220
It’s hard to explain clearly.

37
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,420
You should come here quickly.

38
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,820
Ok. I’ll be there soon.

39
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,980
Excuse me!

40
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,900
Excuse me!

41
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,420
Hello,

42
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,420
how...

43
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,140
How is the patient in bed No. 45?

44
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
He’s fine.

45
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,700
We just changed the dressing.

46
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,780
He’s up and about now.

47
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,140
You’re here.

48
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,980
You’re awake?

49
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,420
How do you feel now?

50
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,660
I haven’t eaten for a day.

51
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,980
I’m hungry.

52
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,100
Peel an apple for me.

53
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,020
You’re a girl.

54
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,420
Can’t you even peel apples?

55
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,820
Forget it. Stop peeling it.

56
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,780
You can just feed me.

57
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,980
How can you be like this?

58
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,700
How come you’re eating it?

59
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,380
I just remembered

60
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,180
patients shouldn’t eat cold food after surgery.

61
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,660
But you can watch me eating.

62
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
How is the wound?

63
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,020
It hurts!

64
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,260
It hurts so much.

65
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,980
It hurts so much.

66
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,060
Where?

67
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,300
Here.

68
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,060
Why did you want to hit me?

69
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,300
Because you lied to me.

70
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,060
You said you’ll be by my side

71
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,820
when I wake up.

72
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,020
Why were you not here?

73
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,260
Alright.

74
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,700
We’re even now.

75
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,060
I’m sorry.

76
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,180
I just knew that

77
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,460
you can actually run that fast.

78
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,540
Are you worried for me?

79
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,060
I’m not a cold-blooded monster like you.

80
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,100
I’ll get worried no matter who he is, alright?

81
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,860
I’ll go ask the nurse what you can eat,

82
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,140
so you won’t starve to death.

83
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,940
Why are you so eager to leave the hospital?

84
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,100
You can stay here for a few more days.

85
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,220
I won’t. I won’t.

86
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,460
If I stayed here any longer,

87
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,140
Wealth wouldn’t be able to recognize me.

88
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,860
Alright.

89
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,620
Give me the car key.

90
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,820
Why?

91
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,980
I’ll drive.

92
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,100
You drive?

93
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,580
What? You look down upon me?

94
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,580
Not that.

95
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,820
It’s just...

96
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,340
Don’t worry, Mr. Yuan.

97
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Just leave it to me.

98
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,100
I’ll make sure to send you home

99
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,380
within 20 minutes.

100
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Let’s go.

101
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,580
20 minutes?

102
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,500
Slow down!

103
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,000
Be careful!

104
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,820
Jiang Jun, can you drive safely?

105
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,820
Don’t disturb me!

106
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,140
I’m driving safely, alright?

107
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
So scary!

108
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,180
Jiang Jun, are you driving a rocket?

109
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,420
I’ll put up with you for now.

110
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,740
19 minutes. Perfect.

111
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,580
Are... Are you all right?

112
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
I’m fine.

113
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,220
I’m fine.

114
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,500
Road killer!

115
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,180
You’re so impressive!

116
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,220
I really admire you!

117
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,980
Are you abusing me indirectly?

118
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,780
No.

119
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,700
I’m praising you.

120
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,020
You just showed off your driving skills.

121
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,900
You can turn this area

122
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,260
into a barren land!

123
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,420
Seriously, Miss Jiang,

124
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,220
where did you learn to drive a car?

125
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,740
I need to go there, too.

126
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,780
Maybe I can improve

127
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,260
my racing skills there.

128
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,260
Alright. Let’s go home.

129
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,580
Let me take it. You just got better.

130
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,020
I’m fine now.

131
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,580
You can go to work.

132
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,220
I can make breakfast myself.

133
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,620
It’s fine.

134
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,780
I’ll help you till the end.

135
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,260
Don’t get too touched.

136
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,820
Look at these.

137
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,420
What are they?

138
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,780
Diced carrots.

139
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,380
Are these diced carrots?

140
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,820
You think they’re not?

141
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,260
You better let me do it.

142
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,180
Don’t move.

143
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,380
You just had surgery.

144
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,060
Go sit there and have some rest.

145
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,340
The breakfast will be ready very soon.

146
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Then I’ll sit here

147
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,220
and wait for the nutritious breakfast you made.

148
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,940
Ok.

149
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,420
I read some recipes.

150
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,940
They said patients after surgery

151
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,780
should have soups and fluid food.

152
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,300
Have a try.

153
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,860
Ok.

154
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,860
Which one should I try first?

155
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,580
Try the chicken soup first.

156
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Ok.

157
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,060
How is it?

158
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,380
It’s wonderfully made.

159
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,180
The taste is imaginative.

160
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,300
Really?

161
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,860
I have stewed it for two hours.

162
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,340
Then you should eat more. Finish them.

163
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,540
I’m going to work now.

164
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,460
Ok.

165
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,020
Be careful on the road.

166
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,580
How come the soup is sweet?

167
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,700
What about the fish soup?

168
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,140
Did she mistake sugar for salt?

169
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,900
I need to finish them.

170
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,300
I need to finish them.

171
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,020
It just tastes like milk tea.

172
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,700
Morning.

173
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,060
Has Mr. Yuan got any better?

174
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,140
He’s fine. He was discharged today.

175
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,740
During these days

176
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,820
when he was in the hospital…

177
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,820
I felt really great!

178
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,020
I’ll tell him what you said just now.

179
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,220
Hello.

180
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,660
Honey, guess where I am right now.

181
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,180
In my heart.

182
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,940
I’m on my way back.

183
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,180
What?

184
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
How come you came back?

185
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,660
We’re having a holiday.

186
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,140
So I wanted to give you a surprise.

187
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,380
Honey,

188
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,420
I’ll have an emergency meeting later.

189
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,180
You should be good and wait for me.

190
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,740
Mr. Yuan,

191
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,420
I need your help!

192
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,180
Coming!

193
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,020
Sit here.

194
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,820
Coming!

195
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,660
Couldn’t you press the doorbell gently?

196
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,540
Mr. Yuan!

197
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,860
Mr. Yuan! Mr. Yuan!

198
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,060
Mr. Yuan!

199
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,180
You’re handsome and wise!

200
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,100
You have to help me.

201
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,460
Mr...

202
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,580
Don’t try to hug me.

203
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,860
Sit down and tell me.

204
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,700
Over there.

205
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,260
Go ahead.

206
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,900
My girlfriend is studying abroad.

207
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,300
I often went to see her before.

208
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,660
I didn’t expect she’d come back.

209
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
She said she wanted to give me a surprise.

210
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,820
Now she’s at Pudong Airport.

211
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,580
Are you showing off before me?

212
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,580
No, no, no.

213
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,740
I asked for this myself.

214
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,420
I’m getting a taste of my own medicine.

215
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,420
I used to brag before her

216
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,180
saying I’m the Executive Director of MH.

217
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,700
I have a Porsche.

218
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,700
I live in a high-end apartment

219
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,940
and have a personal assistant.

220
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,180
You dumbhead!

221
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,580
Kids wouldn’t copy others’ homework entirely.

222
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,260
What about you?

223
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,580
You copied others’ words

224
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,300
without changing anything?

225
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,740
I was wrong.

226
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,100
You dumbhead!

227
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
You want me to clean the mess for you?

228
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,500
Mr. Yuan,

229
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,060
can we switch houses?

230
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,940
I promise

231
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,420
I’ll move out right away after she leaves.

232
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,860
I’m willing to do anything

233
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,820
for you in the future.

234
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,340
Please, Mr. Yuan!

235
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,300
If you don’t want to live in my house,

236
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,700
I can book a hotel room for you.

237
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,620
I’ll cover the fees.

238
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,140
No!

239
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,300
Su Chang,

240
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,180
listen,

241
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,940
let your girlfriend live in my house.

242
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,220
I’ll help you.

243
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,820
Mr. Yuan,

244
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,940
where will you live then?

245
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
Is this the only house I have?

246
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,140
You want to move next door?

247
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,860
Mr. Yuan, it’s a rare opportunity.

248
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,740
You must grasp it.

249
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,020
A brewer’s wife may bite of a tun.

250
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,980
The heart of a woman...

251
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,540
Leave here before I

252
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,940
change my mind.

253
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,700
Yes, Mr. Yuan!

254
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,800
Time is short.

255
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,140
Please pack up your things yourself.

256
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,320
Mr. Yuan!

257
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,040
Don’t try to hug me!

258
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,500
I won’t hug you.

259
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,860
I’m a man.

260
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,180
I’m leaving,

261
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,900
Yuan.

262
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Yuan?

263
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,040
How dare you call me that? You dumbhead!

264
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,280
You dumbhead.

265
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,060
Wealth, we’re moving out.

266
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,100
Honey,

267
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,580
this place is really nice.

268
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,460
I like it very much.

269
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,900
And here. Here.

270
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,060
It’s also nice.

271
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,460
It’s a great place.

272
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,420
I like it very much.

273
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,740
Let’s go.

274
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,660
What’s wrong with you?

275
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,860
Nothing, Honey.

276
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,220
Let’s go up.

277
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,260
It’s 701, right?

278
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,700
Yes, right.

279
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,780
But why is the door open?

280
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,260
It’s...

281
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,020
This is...

282
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,060
This is my assistant.

283
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,260
Yuan Shuai.

284
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,420
Yuan.

285
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,020
Mr. Su.

286
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,340
Hello, Mr. Su.

287
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,940
I’ve packed up your things.

288
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,580
How do you want to dispose of them?

289
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,820
Throw them away.

290
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,700
Throw them away.

291
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,620
Throw them away.

292
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,700
Throw them away?

293
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Ok, Mr. Su.

294
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,180
Wait.

295
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,020
Isn’t this shirt

296
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,140
the latest model for autumn and winter?

297
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,820
And it’s brand new.

298
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,300
Why do you throw it away?

299
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,420
It’s fine.

300
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,660
We’re rich.

301
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,060
We’re rich.

302
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,340
But,

303
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,980
you were so thin before?

304
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,940
Honey,

305
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,500
since I got together with you,

306
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,820
my life has become very sweet.

307
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,460
So I became fat.

308
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,820
But I’m happy.

309
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,460
How happy you are!

310
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,900
How sweet your life is!

311
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,500
How fat you are!

312
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,460
You’re moving out?

313
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,420
Ms. Jiang.

314
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,260
Ms. Jiang?

315
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,220
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

316
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,340
I’m packing up things for Mr. Su.

317
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,780
Mr. Su?

318
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,340
Then she must be your girlfriend.

319
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,780
Hello.

320
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,020
I’m a colleague of Mr. Su,

321
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,980
Ms. Jiang.

322
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,740
Ms. Jiang.

323
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,620
Hello, I’m Xinxin.

324
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,900
Yuan,

325
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,020
after packing up Mr. Su’s things,

326
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,060
go clean up my house as well.

327
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,460
Ok, Ms. Jiang. No problem.

328
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,980
No problem.

329
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,620
Well, we’re going in then.

330
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,140
Bye-bye.

331
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,980
Bye-bye, Mr. Su.

332
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,900
Yuan,

333
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,140
you’re recovering well.

334
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,780
You can move things now.

335
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,820
I had to do this. I need your help.

336
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,340
Honey,

337
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,180
your house is so well furnished.

338
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,540
Very classy, right?

339
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,500
Honey, it’s very classy!

340
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,180
Honey,

341
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,700
I want to give the best things to you.

342
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,380
You’re so nice to me.

343
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,500
Well, I need to use the bathroom.

344
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,820
Ok. I’ll be back soon.

345
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,580
What did you say?

346
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,620
You... You want to live with me?

347
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,300
How can you live with me?

348
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,180
You’re a man, alright?

349
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,060
Stop! Stop!

350
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,100
So what if I’m a man?

351
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,260
I don’t quite understand.

352
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,740
It’s not just us, alright?

353
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,580
Who else is here then?

354
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,580
She!

355
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,500
She is also a girl.

356
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,500
Ok. She can stay.

357
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,460
You leave.

358
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,940
Jiang Jun, you!

359
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,420
How heartless you are!

360
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,660
How immoral you are!

361
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,940
You see,

362
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,300
Su Chang has worked hard

363
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,940
for me for so many years.

364
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,740
When he needed my help,

365
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,100
I lent my house to him

366
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,340
without even thinking about it.

367
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,420
What is this called?

368
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,140
This is called being grateful.

369
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,660
Not like someone.

370
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,860
I took Lin He there in time

371
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,900
during Kelang’s case.

372
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,020
I found someone

373
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,620
to repair the data in the phone

374
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,940
during Wan Shan’s case.

375
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:52,740
Also,

376
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,820
I rushed back to help you

377
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,700
during your meal with Ma Xiuran.

378
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,900
-Enough.
-You!

379
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,060
You’re so naggy!

380
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,620
You can live here.

381
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,420
I’ll go live with Li, alright?

382
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,180
My wound hurts so much!

383
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,460
It hurts so much!

384
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,220
So this is the way of the world.

385
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,580
I’m a sick man.

386
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,780
What if the wound breaks down

387
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,980
when I use the bathroom

388
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,940
at night?

389
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,300
My blood

390
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,220
would pour out

391
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,060
and fill the bathroom

392
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,780
until...

393
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,660
I’m drained of blood.

394
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,820
Stop pretending.

395
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,420
You’re determined

396
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,340
to live here, right?

397
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,980
Isn’t it very obvious?

398
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,100
What did you say?

399
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,700
I said it’s very natural, alright?

400
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,380
This is my house.

401
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,700
Of course I can live here when necessary.

402
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,060
Understand?

403
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,860
Very natural?

404
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,860
Where are you going?

405
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,620
I want to be alone.

406
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,420
Who is “Alone”?

407
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,620
Your sister.

408
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,340
I don’t have a sister called “Alone”.

409
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
I only have a sister called Jun.

410
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,420
Listen, don’t buy bananas anymore.

411
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,340
I don’t like bananas.

412
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,940
I like apples.

413
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,540
You should buy more apples.

414
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,620
Be gentle.

415
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,260
This is my house.

416
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,940
Who cares?

417
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,740
Kick it harder.

418
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,340
I’ll stay here anyway.

419
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,860
It’s so delicious.

420
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,640
<i>West World</i>

421
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,500
Working downstairs,

422
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,020
and sleeping upstairs.

423
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,580
It’s perfect.

424
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,100
What’s inside the box?

425
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,740
Gifts.

426
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,780
Now we have a new office.

427
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,460
We need to have a sense of ritual.

428
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,700
This one is for Mr. Du.

429
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,420
It can match his mature temperament.

430
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,700
And this one is for you.

431
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,340
That one looks better.

432
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,060
Can I have that one?

433
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,380
No!

434
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,100
This is for your own good.

435
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,020
Think about it.

436
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,540
Our app is about love.

437
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,620
When our clients come

438
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,860
seeing our office

439
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,220
is filled with cute things,

440
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,300
they will think

441
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,180
you’re a very caring man.

442
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,540
And then they’ll trust your app more,

443
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,500
right?

444
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
Alright.

445
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,100
What about...

446
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,940
Buy one and get one free.

447
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,100
It’s a good bargain, right?

448
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,740
Thank you.

449
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,660
You’re welcome.

450
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,940
What is this for?

451
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,260
This is

452
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,300
another gift I prepared

453
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,620
for our company.

454
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,300
I’ve checked the dates.

455
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,340
Tomorrow is a good day to move.

456
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,380
We can invite Jun

457
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,340
and Mr. Du here.

458
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,180
Then we can drink it.

459
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
And make a toast to West World!

460
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,980
To West World.

461
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,860
Mr. Li,

462
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,460
I’ve been doing physical work all day long.

463
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,220
Do you think you should treat me to a meal?

464
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,140
Ok.

465
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,380
Coming!

466
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,340
Your kebabs.

467
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,300
20 mutton kebabs, 10 beef kebabs,

468
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,500
10 pork kebabs, 10 gristle kebabs,

469
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,940
2 chicken wings, 2 lamb kidneys,

470
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,940
2 chicken kebabs, 4 needle mushroom kebabs.

471
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:21,820
Just let me know

472
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,100
if you want to order more.

473
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,940
-Enjoy. -Thank you.
-Thank you.

474
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,340
Can we eat so many kebabs?

475
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,300
I don’t know.

476
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,500
I just wanted to order so many.

477
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,940
I actually wanted to order more.

478
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,540
No, no, don’t!

479
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,020
I found that

480
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,540
your way to celebrate is very special.

481
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,980
Your beer.

482
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,420
Thank you.

483
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,100
Xu Li.

484
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,140
I want to tell you something.

485
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,420
I’ve thought a lot about it.

486
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,700
Without you staying by my side,

487
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
advising me,

488
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,740
and helping me,

489
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,980
I wouldn’t have got the investment from Mr. Du.

490
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,780
So,

491
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
I’ve decided...

492
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,020
Oh my!

493
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,140
Is he finally getting what I meant?

494
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,020
Is he ready to profess his love for me?

495
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,580
What have you decided?

496
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,980
Hurry and tell me!

497
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,620
I’ve decided

498
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,460
to give 5% of West World’s

499
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,580
shares to you!

500
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,780
Consider it as the technology investment.

501
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
From now on,

502
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,660
you’re my best buddy.

503
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,420
Come on, bro.

504
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,420
Fine.

505
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,700
I thought

506
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,380
you were going to...

507
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,580
Forget it.

508
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,500
I don’t care about the shares.

509
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,780
You can keep them.

510
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,740
Alright.

511
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,820
But

512
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,740
considering the current speed of development,

513
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,380
the 5% of shares

514
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,780
will become 500 thousand yuan,

515
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,940
or even

516
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,820
5 million yuan very soon.

517
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,460
Fine. So be it.

518
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660
How much is it again?

519
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,100
5 million yuan.

520
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,940
I take back what I said just now.

521
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,020
I accept your gift.

522
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,660
Ok.

523
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,420
Cheers, bro.

524
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,300
To West World.

525
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,540
To West World!

526
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,420
Eat up. I’m so hungry.

527
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,460
Hurry! Eat!

528
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,580
Is it delicious?

529
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,780
This is the last one.

530
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,180
Very nutritious soup.

531
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,380
Done.

532
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,340
Why are you just standing there?

533
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,260
Sit down and eat.

534
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,260
You want to bribe me with just these things?

535
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,780
Bribe you?

536
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,820
Jiang Jun, you know what?

537
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,460
Your body reaction will give you away.

538
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,060
Try them.

539
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,460
How is it?

540
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,660
So delicious! How did you make it?

541
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,900
How did I make it?

542
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,100
That’s my secret.

543
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,420
You’ll know after

544
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,940
you live with me for a long time.

545
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,580
Here. Have some soup.

546
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,460
I want to discuss something with you.

547
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,900
It’s about

548
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,860
who gets to use the bed in your bedroom.

549
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,620
What do you mean, Yuan Shuai?

550
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,220
Are you going to draw a line

551
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,100
in the middle

552
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,780
and each of us

553
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,260
sleeps on our own side?

554
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,380
Am I that boring?

555
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,140
I wanted to say that

556
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,220
I should sleep in the bedroom

557
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,100
and you should sleep on the sofa.

558
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,700
Yuan Shuai,

559
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,620
don’t press your luck.

560
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,900
I already let you stay in my house.

561
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,860
Now you want to sleep in my bedroom?

562
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,620
Are you saying

563
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,180
you’ve agreed to let me live here?

564
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,180
I heard it.

565
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,780
Pulling tricks on me?

566
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,700
I didn’t, alright?

567
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,380
It’s just because you’re too stupid.

568
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,980
Time to eat!

569
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,980
I’ll have some ribs.

570
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,940
I’ll have some sweet and sour pork…

571
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,620
Have...

572
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,460
Jiang...

573
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,780
This is mine.

574
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,700
I cooked it.

575
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,780
I cooked it.

576
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,700
This is mine.

577
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,020
I cooked it.

578
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,860
This is mine.

579
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,540
I cooked it.

580
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Get away. These are all mine!

581
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,020
-I cooked them!
-You can’t eat them!

582
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,940
--I cooked…
-You can’t eat them!

583
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,220
I cooked them! I…

584
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,980
All mine!

585
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,260
What’s wrong?

586
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,540
The wound is hurting? Sit down.

587
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:03,980
How do you feel?

588
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,460
Are you alright?

589
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,340
Are you worried about me?

590
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,460
I’ll be responsible if something

591
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,900
happens to you in my house.

592
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,260
How about this?

593
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,060
I’ll wash the dishes later.

594
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,180
You can have some rest.

595
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,980
Then I’ll make myself at home.

596
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,940
I’ll start eating.

597
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,300
I’ll have some ribs.

598
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,780
So good!

599
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,780
Then you should eat more,

600
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,180
till you’re stuffed to death.

601
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,020
I won’t. I’m thin.

602
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,980
I’m pissed off.

603
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,860
Have some nutritious soup.

604
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,700
I won’t!

605
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,860
Have some.

606
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,220
Beg me.

607
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,620
It tastes so good!

608
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,940
So delicious.

609
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,780
I’ll dig in.

610
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,140
So delicious.

611
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,660
You’ll kiss me indirectly.

612
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,020
I can use the spoon.

613
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,930
Whatever!

614
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,540
How come you didn’t make a sound?

615
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,930
You didn’t hear it, alright?

616
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,220
I thought about it.

617
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,780
I shouldn’t let a patient

618
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,740
sleep on the sofa.

619
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,820
You can sleep in the bedroom.

620
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,980
You’re not having a fever.

621
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,380
Why are you so nice to me now?

622
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,540
You’ll let me sleep in your bed?

623
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,540
Before I change my mind,

624
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,940
you…

625
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,060
I’ll go!

626
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,060
Did you put

627
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,180
some nails on the bed?

628
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,980
You go...

629
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
I’ll go! I’ll go!

630
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,700
Locked the door?

631
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,980
I’m a girl, alright? How could you...

632
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,340
Fine.

633
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,420
I won’t get angry.

634
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,740
You’re a patient.

635
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,260
Getting angry will make me look older and uglier.

636
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,100
I won’t get angry.

637
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,460
I won’t get angry.

638
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,820
I’ll drive you crazy.

639
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,620
Ms. Jiang.

640
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,220
Ms. Jiang?

641
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,140
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

642
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,620
I’m packing up things for Mr. Su.

643
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,740
Mr. Su?

644
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,700
No wonder Su Chang and Assistant Yuan stuttered

645
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,860
when Ms. Jiang came back.

646
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,140
So there’s something fishy.

647
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,180
Little Sheep.

648
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,700
Crying Girl.

649
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,300
You’re so clumsy.

650
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,620
You just finished one side?

651
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,340
How great it’d be

652
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,660
if you’re cute like this

653
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,340
when you’re awake.

654
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Sleep well.

655
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,780
Good night.

656
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,100
Wait. Why am I happy?

657
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,620
I’m insane. I’m insane.

658
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,060
I’m insane!

659
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,500
I’m insane.
