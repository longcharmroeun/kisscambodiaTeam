00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

2
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,550
Episode 30

3
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,520
Linda.

4
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,080
It all came to a good end.

5
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,320
Why do you still wear such a bitter face?

6
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,600
Give me a smile.

7
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,400
I didn’t think it would come to this.

8
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
You didn’t do anything wrong

9
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,200
This is the end I deserve.

10
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,680
Thank you for telling me,

11
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,960
so that I won’t be wrong any more.

12
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
It makes me feel good

13
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,150
to say this now.

14
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,680
Du,

15
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,240
thank you for showing me that

16
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,880
to truly love someone

17
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,200
is to give him what he needs,

18
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,960
not what I think

19
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,120
he needs.

20
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,640
You know I don’t apologize easily.

21
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,040
I’m sorry that

22
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,640
my selfish love to you

23
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
has hurt you so much

24
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
for so long.

25
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,760
For the rest of your life,

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,600
just do whatever you want to do

27
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,440
and pursue whatever you want to pursue.

28
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,680
When you feel tired,

29
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,440
just go home.

30
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
The Du family is always your home.

31
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,040
Linda,

32
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,560
stop.

33
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,150
I know.

34
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,320
I’ll take care of dad for you.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,320
We will always be one family.

36
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Okay,

37
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
I’ve got to go now.

38
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
You take care.

39
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,000
Jiang Jun!

40
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,640
Jiang Jun,

41
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
listen to me.

42
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,160
I have a good reason for this.

43
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,920
I’m sorry.

44
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,000
Will you forgive me?

45
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,600
Crazy… Crazy bitch,

46
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,160
why do you beat Yuan Shuai?

47
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,120
Who is the crazy bitch?

48
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
You!

49
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,120
No. You’re…

50
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,640
Jiang Jun,

51
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
ignore him.

52
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
He’s just a kid.

53
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,720
Yuan Shuai,

54
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,800
does she have something on you?

55
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
Jia Yuanji.

56
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,400
Yuan Shuai.

57
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,600
Shut up!

58
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,200
What’s the matter?

59
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,360
What are you doing?

60
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,040
Hello, my name is Jia Yuanji.

61
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,920
Whose kid is this?

62
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,120
Bye.

63
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,840
Jiang Jun!

64
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,720
Jiang Jun.

65
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,880
Jiang Jun, I’m home.

66
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,280
Jun.

67
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
Jun, open the door.

68
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Honey,

69
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,720
I bought some chestnuts you like.

70
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Her birthday.

71
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,840
My birthday.

72
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,560
Her mother’s birthday?

73
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,960
It’s over. It’s over.

74
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,600
I can’t even get into my house.

75
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,040
Honey, open the door. Honey.

76
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,270
Honey, open the door.

77
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,040
I know you won’t be so cruel.

78
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,400
I bought some chestnuts you like.

79
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,360
What do you mean?

80
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,240
Can’t you see?

81
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,960
Congratulations!

82
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,280
You are kicked out of the house.

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,040
You’ve gone too far, Jiang Jun.

84
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,560
It can’t be worse than certain people
working with others

85
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,280
to hide the truth from me.

86
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,440
I had a good reason for doing that.

87
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,960
I can explain it to you.

88
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,760
I know.

89
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,920
If you know, why are you still doing this to me?

90
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,000
I do this

91
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,280
for a good reason, too.

92
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
What reason do you have?

93
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,160
You don’t need to know.

94
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
You just need to know

95
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,160
I’m also doing this for your own good.

96
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
Jiang Jun, good for you.

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,120
You changed the password.

98
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,960
I’m not allowed to enter the house.

99
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,960
I bought you chestnuts and you didn’t want them.

100
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,280
What do you want?

101
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,800
I apologized to you so sincerely,

102
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,360
and yet you still don’t forgive me.

103
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,680
You could meet a better man than me?

104
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,720
I don’t believe it.

105
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
You’re drinking here all by yourself

106
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,720
without me.

107
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,720
You are not enough of a friend!

108
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,640
Thank you.

109
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,760
Buy it yourself. It’s mine.

110
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,880
Why are you so mean?

111
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,040
After all, we’ve been through a lot together.

112
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,520
Don’t turn your back on me.

113
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,880
The whole Lin Taimo thing is over.

114
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,000
When do you intend to leave MH?

115
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,800
When am I leaving?

116
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,120
I haven’t thought about leaving.

117
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,680
Why?

118
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Aren’t you going to leave MH?

119
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,560
Look.

120
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,280
I had been out of work for a long time

121
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,720
since I left GE.

122
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,120
I’ve wanted to do something.

123
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,200
Besides, I think MH is good.

124
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,120
I like it very much.

125
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,280
You like MH,

126
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,600
or you like the people in MH?

127
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,000
To be exact,

128
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,080
both.

129
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,320
What?

130
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
You’re so nervous.

131
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480
Are you afraid I’m too close to Jiang Jun?

132
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,560
Are you kidding?

133
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,960
Would I be nervous because of you, Du Lei?

134
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
I don’t think you’re seeing
the situation clearly.

135
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,960
Jiang Jun had already made her choice.

136
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
Situation is something that can change.

137
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,360
You two aren’t back together yet?

138
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,320
It’s none of your business.

139
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,560
Thank you for telling me the good news.

140
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,240
Drink?

141
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,120
This is my drink! Buy it yourself.

142
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
I guess I’ll have to think about

143
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,560
what I shall do to ask her out for dinner
this weekend.

144
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,440
Waiter,

145
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,440
I want a bottle more expensive than his.
I want to celebrate.

146
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
You have money, right? Okay.

147
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,800
Waiter,

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
this bottle is on him, too.

149
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,080
-Jun.
-Li.

150
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,320
By the way,

151
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
why do you want to go shopping today?

152
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,520
It’s now clear about what happened to my dad.

153
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,480
I just want to go home in a few days,

154
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,880
talk to my mother about it,

155
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,280
and buy her some clothes.

156
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,160
It’s a little too long.

157
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,200
This is not bad.

158
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,520
This must be warm.

159
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,040
Du Lei, you bastard!

160
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,480
It’s you!

161
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,440
Yuan Shuai.

162
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,560
I’m hungry.

163
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,080
Hungry?

164
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,120
Will you treat me to dinner?

165
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
Sure. What would you like to eat?

166
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,560
Pizza.

167
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,680
Pizza? Alright.

168
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,240
Ok.

169
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,680
-Where is it?
-Let’s go.

170
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,680
Which floor?

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,960
It’s on the ground floor or the first floor?

172
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,440
I forgot.

173
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,040
Let’s go.

174
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,320
Could he be covetous of our charms?

175
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,680
There are a lot of perverts these days.

176
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,560
Go! Hurry up!

177
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,760
Alas!

178
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,640
Why are you sighing?

179
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,920
Because of you, I lost track of her.

180
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,080
I didn’t even sigh.

181
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,920
I don’t know why.

182
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,160
I just want to sigh.

183
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,400
Is it because of Xu Li?

184
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,640
You like her?

185
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,360
Xiaochuan,

186
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,560
if you really like Xu Li,

187
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,280
you should go after her boldly,

188
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,840
and just forget about your stupid match thing.

189
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,360
You’re talking about me.

190
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
What about you?

191
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Are you and Jiang Jun back together?

192
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,680
Li,

193
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,640
three-legged toads are hard to find

194
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,680
but two-legged men are everywhere.

195
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,080
So there’s nothing to regret.

196
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,560
I know all the theories.

197
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,840
But I’m just sad.

198
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,000
So all you have to do now

199
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,800
is to forget about Li Xiaochuan

200
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
and start your new life.

201
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,800
Are you back with Yuan Shuai?

202
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,720
No.

203
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,560
Isn’t he going to get back together with you?

204
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,520
It is not like that.

205
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,680
I didn’t forgive him.

206
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,920
I risked my life for her.

207
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,120
I’ve done so much for her.

208
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,600
Not only was she unmoved,
but she gave me the cold shoulder.

209
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,320
What do you think she was thinking?

210
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,280
What was I thinking?

211
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
He worked with others

212
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,320
and hid the truth from me.

213
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,320
And in the end he came to tell me
it was for my own good.

214
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,840
He just doesn’t trust me at all!

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,960
Lin Taimo is so dangerous.

216
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,280
-What if something happens to her,
-What if something happens to him,

217
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,240
how am I going to live the rest of my life?

218
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,600
I heard everything you just said.

219
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
So what?

220
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,120
Then I won’t forgive you easily.

221
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,920
Li, let’s go.

222
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,640
Go!

223
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Pay it for us!

224
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,320
Two hundred and one yuan.

225
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,760
Why are you laughing?

226
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,000
You scared them away.

227
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,200
And you were made to pay.

228
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
Because I confirmed one thing.

229
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,560
What is it?

230
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,400
She still has me in her heart.

231
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,880
But will she forgive you?

232
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,000
You don’t understand, Xiaochuan.

233
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,920
When someone still likes you

234
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,880
and is willing to give you the cold shoulder,

235
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,000
she doesn’t want to win at all.

236
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,720
She just wants to prove that
you still care about her.

237
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,720
So,

238
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,520
what are you going to do?

239
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,880
One word.

240
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,440
Pestering.

241
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,560
Two words.

242
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,560
Pestering. Pestering.

243
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,480
Three words.

244
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,560
Pestering. Pestering. Pestering.

245
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,960
Coming!

246

250

It’s been paid.

today is the launch

269
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,920
I have something to tell you.

270
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,360
Can you come to the scene?

271
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,240
Xu Li, wake up!

272
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
Do you still want to insult yourself?

273

That person has nothing to do with you anymore.

00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,040
I…

275
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,920
I will not go to the scene.

276
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,120
I’ll just watch the live broadcast.

277
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,080
I’ll just take a look.

278
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,480
Mr. Li. Mr. Li,

279
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,520
the press conference is about to start.

280
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,440
I will be there soon.

281
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,920
I’d like to welcome everyone

282
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,840
to the press conference of West World 2.0.

283
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,880
I am Li Xiaochuan,
the developer of this app.

284
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
First of all, I would like to
thank all media friends

Today,
<i>Launch of West World 2.0</i>

290
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I want to introduce to you
<i>Launch of West World 2.0</i>

291
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,040
a new product
<i>Launch of West World 2.0</i>

292
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,360
<i>Launch of West World 2.0</i>

293
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,240
developed by the West World after the upgrade.
<i>Launch of West World 2.0</i>

294
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,720
This

295
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,040
is called the Smart Bracelet of West World 2.0.

296
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,240
This bracelet

297
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,080
is connected with West World’s app.

298
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,720
At the same time we added a new model

299
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,160
called growth model.

300
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,560
Under the growth model,

301
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,280
it will collect the chat information of the two users

302
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,680
based on their original matching degree,

303
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,080
and the changes in their secretion of

304
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,560
adrenaline, pheromones and other body hormones

305
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,840
when the two are in contact,

306
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,560
and adjust the matching degree
between two people accordingly.

307
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,240
When the matching degree increases,

308
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,960
this bracelet will make a sound

309
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,480
like the heartbeat.

310
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
And I call it

311
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,800
“love signal”.

312
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,040
So, with West World 2.0,

313
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,360
even if two users

314
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,280
are 1 percent of a match,

315
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,520
they have a chance of growing into
a perfect match.

316
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,200
Thank you.

317
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,760
It sounds like the bracelet really
has market value.

318
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,520
Yes.

319
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,480
Mr. Li,

320
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,560
what was your inspiration

321
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,400
for the bracelet?

322
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,060
<i>Symbiotic Aquarium</i>

323
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,320
It comes from

324
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,280
a girl who was only

325
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,280
a 1 percent match for me.

326
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,200
When we met,

327
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,640
I was adamant that

328
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
the West World’s algorithms

329
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
were 100 percent accurate

330
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,160
and completely error-free.

331
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,560
Why

332
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,640
wouldn’t I like you?

333
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,000
You just said it yourself.

334
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,960
We have only 1% match.

335
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,960
It’s impossible for us to be together.

336
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,600
<i>FamilyMart</i>

337
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,520
But

338
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,760
after she left me,

339
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,280
I realized

340
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,240
I was wrong.

341
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
I was completely wrong.

342
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,920
So,

343
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,800
the launch of West World 2.0

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,800
wants to prove one thing,

345
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,200
which is that even if we are a 1 percent match,

346
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,040
we have a chance to be a perfect match.

347
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,200
May I ask if

348
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,320
this girl is here today?

349
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,840

359
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,120
do you even know what you’re doing?

will become gray-haired together.

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,080
Of course not.

378
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,480
This bracelet was inspired by you.

379
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,160
Let’s do it again.

380
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,080
This time,

381
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,040
it won’t be one percent.

382
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
How can it be like this?

383
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,400
How can it be like this?

384
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,280
It is what you can see.

385
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,760
Your most trusted software is now
telling you that

386
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,560
I don’t deserve you

387
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,080
and that we have no chance

388
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,680
of ever being together.

389
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,400
So, Li Xiaochuan,

390
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,240
please.

391
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,560
I’m begging you.

392
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,120
Don’t come to me again.

393
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,140
<i>Symbiotic Aquarium</i>

394
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,240
I like you!

395
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,040
What did you just say?

396
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,400
I said

397
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,680
I like you.

398
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,440
I haven’t been myself

399
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
since you left.

400
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,800
I don’t know what to do all day.

401
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,160
You’re all over my head.

402
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,640
I’ll never let you go again,

403
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,920
not for a second.

404
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,880
However, we are

405
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,240
still a one percent match.

406
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,880
If we are together,

407
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,760
does it mean your software is a failure?

408
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,680
I don’t care.

409
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,000
If it’s one percent,

410
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,560
that means it still has its problems.

411
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
I’ll fix it.

412
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
I’ll fix it

413
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,160
until we’re a perfect match.

414
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,440
Li,

415
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,400
be my girlfriend.

416
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,560
Xiaochuan, look!

417
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,640
We are now a perfect match.

418
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,880
Jun!

419
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,640
Mom!

420
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,920
Why are you back?

421
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,480
I miss you.

422
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
When did you become so good?

423
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,640
Why don’t I believe it?

424
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,800
Where’s Yuanyuan?

425
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,160
He…

426
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,760
Who is it?

427
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,760
What… What are you doing here?

428
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,200
I’m not here to see you.

429
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,640
Mrs. Jiang,

430
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,360
I’ve come to see you.

431
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,640
See me?

432
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,480
Mrs. Jiang,

433
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,640
this is

434
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,000
the brand transfer agreement

435
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,240
of Mr. Jiang’s Yixianqian.

436
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,680
I’ve done all the other procedures.

437
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,600
You just have to sign it here

438
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,280
and then the brand Yixianqian

439
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,480
will be in your hands again.

440
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,340
<i>Brand Transfer Agreement</i>

441
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,680
Mrs. Jiang,

442
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,240
Mr. Jiang watched me grow up.

443
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,840
The brand Yixianqian

444
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,000
is his lifetime effort.

445
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,920
So,

446
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,200
I think that’s what I should do.

447
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,960
When he was alive,

448
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,760
he always said that to do something

449
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,040
you have to love it enough.

450
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,400
Because only if you love it enough,

451
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,520
you can love it with all your heart.

452
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,280
I didn’t understand him back then.

453
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,200
I thought he was such a big man,

454
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,160
how could he be so childish?

455
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,640
The day when our company opened

456
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,200
he cried out of joy

457
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,240
in front of all his old friends.

458
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,080
It was at that moment that I realized

459
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,840
how much he loved what he did.

460
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
So,

461
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,560
I always supported him

462
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,440
to work hard outside

463
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,160
and did not distract him.

464
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,160
I took care of the family wholeheartedly.

465
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,840
I just didn’t think

466
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,960
it would turn out that way.

467
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,560
Yuanyuan,

468
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
thank you.

469
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,400
Thank you for all you’ve done for our family.

470
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,680
Thank you.

471
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,920
Mrs. Jiang.

472
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,800
Don’t say that.

473
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,480
That’s all I ought to do.

474
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,960
Mom, stop crying.

475
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,360
Otherwise, I’m going to cry, too.

476
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,200
I won’t cry.

477
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,640
I don’t want to cry.

478
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:08,840
It’s okay.

479
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,440
I’m just happy.

480
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,960
I’ll tell your father

481
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,760
the good news.

482
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,360
Thank you.

483
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,040
I’ll take you somewhere.

485
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,160
Why did you bring me here?

486
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,760
It’s all about how I bullied you

487
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,800
when I was a kid.

488
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,760
You can follow it today

489
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,040
and bully me like that

490
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,640
as many times as you want.

491
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,120
Why?

492
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,480
Want me to forgive you?

493
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,240
All right.

494
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,080
<i>Study hard and make progress every day</i>

00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,240
For the sake of you helping my mom
<i>Study hard and make progress every day</i>

496
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,480
get the brand back today,
<i>Study hard and make progress every day</i>

497
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,920
I can give you a chance.
<i>Study hard and make progress every day</i>

498
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,600
Ok.

499
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,040
Let’s start.

500
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,320
I don’t need these things.

501
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,520
I only want you to answer me one question.

502
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,520
Answer it until I’m satisfied.

503
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,360
Ok, just ask.

504
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,710
Let me ask you.

505
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,800
Do you really, really,

506
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,230
really know where you went wrong?

507
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,670
I know.

508
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,920
Where?

509
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,520
Jiang Jun,

510
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,920
my biggest mistake was that

511
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,680
I didn’t realize

512
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,280
how much you loved me.

513
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,160
Just as I can forget about everything

514
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,760
and risk everything to protect you,

515
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,840
you can do the same

516
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,360
to protect me.

517
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,400
But I did not choose to believe you,

518
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,480
and believe that

519
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,000
you must be willing to

520
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,640
bear all the risks with me.

521
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,320
What’s worse,

522
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,200
I kept everything from you

523
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,360
in the name of protecting you.

524
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,520
If…

525
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,760
If anything were to happen to me,

526
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,280
you would…

527
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,600
You would have no one to complain to.

528
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,280
I’m sorry, Jiang Jun.

529
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,880
So narcissistic.

530
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,320
I’m serious.

531
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,240
If you can forgive me,

532
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,520
I’ll do whatever you want me to do.

533
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,000
Ok.

534
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,200
Didn’t you say

535
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,240
I can bully you the way you bullied me?

536
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,040
I already figured out how to punish you.

537
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,720
Come here.

538
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,040
Jiang Jun,

539
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,280
are… Are you serious?

540
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,040
Come here!

541
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,800
No.

542
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,040
Jiang Jun.

543
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,200
Jiang Jun. No.

544
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,800
It’s so childish.

545
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,600
You really want to hit me in the palm?

546
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,240
Who said anything about hitting you in the palm?

547
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,480
I’m going to hit you on the buttocks.

548
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,960
Buttocks?

549
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,160
Get ready.

550
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,200
-You…
-Get ready!

551
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,880
Can you feel ashamed?

552
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,160
Hit me on the buttocks?

553
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,000
Let go of me.

554
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,880
No, I won’t.

555
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,080
Let go of me!

556
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,280
No!

557
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,600
Yuan Shuai,

558
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,080
you only get one shot.

559
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,000
Will you take it?

560
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,640
If not, let’s break up nicely.

561
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,240
Jiang Jun, good for you!

562
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,280
Come on!

563
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,120
Get ready.

564
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,640
You’re good at faking it.

565
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,160
I haven’t started yet.

566
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,160
Get ready!

567
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,400
Be gentle.

568
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,200
Ok. Ok.

569
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,240
It must be gentle.

570
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,520
Gentle?

571
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
Will you admit your mistake or not?

572
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,020
<i>Class 3, Grade 1</i>

573
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,480
Do you remember this street?

574
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,240
When we were children,

575
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,440
we used to walk this street every day
to and from school.

576
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,120
I don’t remember.

577
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,240
How long are you gonna give me
the cold shoulder?

578
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,000
How long have you been away?

579
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,880
All right.

580
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,320
It doesn’t matter.

581
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,720
Anyway, I have been waiting for you
for more than ten years,

582
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,600
and I don’t care to wait a few more days.

583
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,360
I’m telling you, Jiang Jun.

584
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,520
I’ll always be there for you.

585
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,280
You can only be mine.

586
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,600
Brother Yuanyuan,

587
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,320
how long are you going to bully me?

588
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,440
As long as you keep crying,

589
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,880
I’ll bully you.

590
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,080
Thank you, Brother Yuanyuan.

591
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,400
Let’s go.

592
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,760
Brother Yuanyuan.

593
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,640
How long are you going to bully me?

594
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
I will never bully you again.

595
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,800
From now on,

596
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,960
I will only protect you.

597
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,640
How?

598
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,040
Hold you tight

599
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,960
and never let you go.
