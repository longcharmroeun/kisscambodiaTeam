00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,490
Episode 36

3
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,490
<i>Fu Flower</i>

4
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,600
Hello, what can I do for you...

5
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
Why didn’t you tell me you are back?

6
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,520
I told you.

7
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,240
Right.

8
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,480
I received your flowers

9
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,240
Thank you.

10
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,760
Why did you suddenly think of

11
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,920
opening a flower shop here?

12
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,680
Maybe it’s because the flowers represent

13
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
new hope.

14
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,480
Every flower

15
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,880
is a new life.

16
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
Its life cycle is very short,

17
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,240
but when it is trying to bloom,

18
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,400
it looks so beautiful.

19
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,880
And that’s its best moment.

20
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,640
I want to pass on

21
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,080
this happiness to everyone.

22
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,360
What about you?

23
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,360
How are you doing in MH?

24
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,080
Linda,

25
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,840
I suddenly felt ridiculous.

26
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,880
I was desperate

27
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,160
to get rid of you and dad.

28
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,780
I felt that the way of life

29
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,080
and the way of survival

30
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,470
were not what I wanted at all.

31
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
In the end,

32
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,160
I just didn’t have the courage

33
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,280
to face who I really was.

34
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,560
So I lost.

35
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,240
And I lost it all.

36
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,960
If you feel miserable,

37
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,670
choose to live in a way

38
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,560
that makes you happy.

39
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,880
That’s all that matters.

40
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,320
Do you remember what I said to you

41
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,320
before I left?

42
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
To truly love someone

43
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,400
is to give him what he needs,

44
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,680
-not what I think
-not what I think

45
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,120
-he needs.
-he needs.

46
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,700
<i>The first day after my period leaves.
I don’t miss it at all.</i>

47
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,880
Stop.

48
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,760
I’ll get some more sleep.

49
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
Don’t scratch me. I’m wrong.

50
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,160
Itchy. I…

51
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,320
Coming!

52
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,280
How is…

53
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,440
-She…
-What’s wrong with her?

54
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,960
I… I…

55
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,520
Come in. Come in first.

56
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,240
Come in.

57
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,080
Li.

58
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
Come in.

59
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
What’s wrong with you?

60
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,400
Li, what’s wrong with you?

61
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,360
What’s wrong with her?

62
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,880
Take it easy.

63
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,560
I went for a check-up yesterday

64
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,640
and the doctor said…

65
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,720
What?

66
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,200
What did the doctor say? I’m worried.

67
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,720
I’m pregnant!

68
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,360
Really?

69
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,720
I’m going to be a father!

70
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,080
That’s great! That’s great!

71
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,760
I’m going to be a father!

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,920
I know. Congratulations to you.

73
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,040
Xiaochuan,

74
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
if you’re so energetic,

75
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
you could walk Wealth for me.

76
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,800
I need to speak to her alone.

77
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
What are you still doing? Go.

78
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,960
Ok.

79
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,400
More efficient than me.

80
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
You go as well.

81
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,560
Let’s go.

82
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,160
What about our war?

83
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,880
We’ll have it another day.

84
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,240
I’ll go.

85
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,040
What shall be my child’s name?

86
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,520
Li World

87
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,520
or

88
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,400
Li Science?

89
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,840
Li West World.

90
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,640
Li West World?

91
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,160
Then you might as well choose a longer name

92
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,680
and call it Li Xiaochuan · Xu Li ·
The Crystallization of Love.

93
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,280
Isn’t this good?

94
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
I’m just too happy.

95
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,480
Look at you.

96
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,200
Yuan Shuai,

97
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,760
well,

98
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,000
you’ve been with Jiang Jun for so long.

99
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,080
Have you

100
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,420
ever thought of marrying her?

101
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,000
I actually sounded out Jiang Jun once.

102
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,040
But I have a feeling that

103
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
she doesn’t really want to get married
right now.

104
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,720
Why is that?

105
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,520
Have you asked her?

106
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,640
No.

107
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,800
Then why didn’t you ask her?

108
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,600
How can I ask?

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
Should I say

110
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
I want to marry you, Jiang Jun?

111
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,640
It’ll be ok if she says yes.

112
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,590
What if she doesn’t want to get married?

113
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,240
Wouldn’t that be awkward

114
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,760
for both of us?

115
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,400
How will we face each other?

116
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
If I ask her like that,

117
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
cracks are sure to appear

118
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,440
in our relationship.

119
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,920
Then should I force her to marry me?

120
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
No.

121
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,200
I don’t want to pressure her.

122
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,640
In fact, for me,

123
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,400
I just want to be with Jiang Jun.

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,720
Whether we get married or not

125
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,720
is just a matter of getting that piece of paper,

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,400
which will not affect our feelings.

127
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,480
Let me ask you,

128
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
why do people need the marriage license?

129
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,880
If your logic works,

130
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,960
wouldn’t it be better

131
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,280
if the whole world abolished marriage?

132
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,800
People are different.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,680
Jiang Jun and I

134
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
just don’t need

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,840
a marriage license to bind us.

136
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,560
To put it bluntly,

137
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,720
you’re just a wimp.

138
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,400
I’m a wimp?

139
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
I am resourceful

140
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,320
and omnipotent. How come I’m a wimp?

141
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,320
Then ask her to marry you.

142
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,640
No.

143
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,160
So you are a wimp.

144
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,440
Never mind.

145
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,880
You science freak and mortal,

146
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,320
just can’t understand my thoughts.

147
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,240
Yuan Shuai.

148
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,120
It’s been a long time.

149
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,520
Even I understand that

150
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,960
women are such duplicitous creatures.

151
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Ok?

152
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,480
You’re such a smart guy.

153
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,280
How can you be so stupid

154
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
in this matter?

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
What do you mean?

156
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,400
In this matter,

157
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,240
I’m more experienced.

158
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
I know

159
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,200
this can’t be put off.

160
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,680
So think it over.

161
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,080
I’ll be there for you, along with Li

162
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
and Wealth.

163
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,840
We’ll help you.

164
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
Am I right, Wealth?

165
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,360
Ok. Let’s go.

166
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,640
Isn’t it too long

167
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,480
since I taught this boy a lesson?

168
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,560
Proposal?

169
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,120
How’s that?

170
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,000
Do you feel the power of life?

171
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,400
Li, you belly doesn’t show a sign yet.

172
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,560
How can I feel it?

173
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,880
Be serious and feel it.

174
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,000
How’s that?

175
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
Is there

176
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,560
a divine power?

177
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,400
Like it?

178
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,200
Then have a child of your own.

179
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,880
That way,

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
we can arrange their marriage to each other.

181
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,120
Don’t talk nonsense. We’re not married yet.

182
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,200
Besides,

183
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,880
Yuan Shuai and Xiaochuan are cousins,

184
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,320
and our children will also be related.

185
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,920
How can we plan their marriage to each other?

186
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,840
You are right.

187
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,600
You and Yuan Shuai have been together
for so long.

188
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,040
When are you two going to get married?

189
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,040
To be honest,

190
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,960
I haven’t thought about it.

191
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,360
Oh, come on.

192
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
Do you have to wait until you are old,

193
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
and Yuan Shuai ran away,

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
don’t you?

195
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,080
He won’t.

196
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Blind confidence is called arrogance.

197
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,080
I have nothing to worry.

198
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,840
If he runs away,

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,240
I still have you.

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
How eloquent you are.

201
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,280
I’m telling you this is serious.

202
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,800
I’m not kidding you.

203
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,200
It’s not like I won’t get married.

204
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
It’s just that

205
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,080
he has not asked me to marry him.

206
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,160
Am I going to ask him

207
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,480
when he’s going to propose to me?

208
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,320
Then ask.

209
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,600
Come on. Who would do that?

210
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Me.

211
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,240
And then?

212
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,720
And

213
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,720
when I woke up the next morning,

214
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,280
I found a diamond ring on my finger.

215
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,160
Maybe that’s your thing.

216
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,960
Feel it again.

217
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,280
Getting married?

218
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,280
Should I take the initiative and ask him?

219
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,720
Ms. Jiang.

220
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,000
Ms. Jiang is back.

221
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

222
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
It’s good to be back.

223
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,240
Sure enough, I still don’t want to
leave you behind.

224
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,440
Welcome home.

225
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,400
Thank you.

226
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,870
Now that you are back,

227
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,360
you must set to work at once.

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,680
Let’s go.

229
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,120
I’ll take you to a place you know.

230
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,720
There’s one thing that you’ve heard.

231
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,040
Huanfei Group is planning to
buy Shanhui Pictures

232
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
and has made an offer.

233
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,800
Do you think MH

234
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,880
should buy the stock of Shanhui now?

235
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
Yes.

236
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,280
Shanhui Pictures is now trading at 18 yuan.

237
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,200
If we buy now…

238
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,320
The most conservative estimation is that

239
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,320
there should be an increase of 17 percent.

240
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
If we buy three million shares,

241
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
we will become the main capital.

242
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,000
Ma Yuke, the major shareholder
of Shimao Technology,

243
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,160
will become the new chairman of Yangsheng Power.

244
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,680
He is a master investor.

245
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,800
If we buy now,

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,120
earnings per share will exceed HK $442.

247
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,320
I don’t think we should buy now.

248
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,440
Why is that?

249
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,280
As far as I know,

250
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,480
Shanhui Pictures would be sold

251
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,960
because of a power struggle
among its three founders

252
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,320
that led to three years of falling profits.

253
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,560
So, I suspect this is fake information

254
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,560
intended to boost

255
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,480
Shanhui Pictures’ stock price.

256
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,920
Ok.

257
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,320
That’s all for today’s interview.

258
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,960
The interview result will be sent to you

259
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,160
via a message.

260
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,360
How’s that?

261
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,960
Did that make you think of your old times?

262
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,360
Yes. It’s…

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Wait!

264
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,360
The Mayans had a saying that

265
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,800
if you want to go back to a place,

266
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,560
bury a button there.

267
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,720
What is that?

268
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,840
Does it work?

269
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,320
Anyway, the last person who did this

270
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,840
stayed in MH.

271
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,840
Su Chang,

272
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,000
the Board…

273
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,360
Su Chang.

274
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,240
Why are you always holding your mobile phone

275
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,640
and laughing in my office these days?

276
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,840
What are you happy about?

277
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,400
Are you up to something shady?

278
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,560
You got a woman out there?

279
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,720
Boss, will you stop talking nonsense?

280
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,600
I’m so obsessed with my wife.

281
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,880
How could I cheat?

282
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,720
Boss,

283
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,640
I forgot to tell you.

284
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,600
I proposed and succeeded!

285
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,280
No wonder.

286
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,360
That explains why you are so happy.

287
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,580
Well, congratulations.

288
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,000
Congratulations.

289
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,560
But Boss,

290
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,800
it’s been a long time
since you bought the diamond ring.

291
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,680
Haven’t you proposed to Jiang Jun yet?

292
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,400
Why are you all

293
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,520
so anxious?

294
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,100
You’re more anxious than my mother.

295
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,280
It’s not that.

296
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,480
Diamonds don’t have a shelf life,

297
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,560
but they can get dusty.

298
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
You have to be proactive and decisive
in this kind of thing!

299
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,640
Take my Xinxin for example.

300
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,840
She always said that she wants to be

301
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,000
an independent woman in the new era,

302
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,520
and that she will never get married

303
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
before she has the ability to support herself.

304
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,480
But when I proposed

305
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,800
and took out the ring,

306
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,480
and before I asked her

307
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,800
to marry me,

308
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,560
she nodded her head wildly.

309
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,960
Really?

310
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,480
Really.

311
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,480
I’ll tell you what.

312
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
I tried,

313
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
but failed.

314
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,080
Failed.

315
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,200
She… She…

316
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,120
She turned you down?

317
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,640
No.

318
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,440
It’s

319
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
a structural,

320
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,720
accidental,

321
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,480
planned,

322
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,600
and causeless failure.

323
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,480
My dear Boss,

324
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,920
you are just unlucky.

325
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,880
You’d better get it done in one vigorous effort.

326
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,800
The old saying makes sense,

327
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,160
and it works especially well.

328
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,160
In this case,

329
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,720
you have to pull out all the stops

330
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,000
and get it done.

331
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
What kind of things haven’t you experienced?

332
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,440
Is there anything else in the world
you can’t handle?

333
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,560
This is only about one woman.

334
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,960
You have to try your best

335
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,840
and get it done.

336
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,000
Don’t hesitate.

337
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Let’s do it!

338
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,240
Do it!

339
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,420
<i>Yuan Shuai</i>

340
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,600
Hello.

341
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,720
Honey,

342
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,120
I’m gonna go on a business trip in a sudden.

343
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,960
Can you go home and help me pack up?

344
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,040
After that

345
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,280
we’ll meet in MH.

346
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
Okay?

347
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,760
But I still have work to do.

348
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,880
That’s ok.

349
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,560
I have asked Su Chang to pick you up.

350
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,840
It’s not far from our apartment anyway.

351
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
It won’t take long.

352
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,600
Ok.

353
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,840
Hurry up. I have work to do.

354
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,400
Step one finished.

355
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,560
Here.

356
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,960
See if the lights are ok.

357
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,840
Yes.

358
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,320
Ok.

359
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:23,960
Look.

360
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,520
A little to the left.

361
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,360
A little to the left?

362
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:26,920
Yes.

363
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,600
Here?

364
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,440
Yes.

365
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,440
Is this ok?

366
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,640
Ok.

367
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,560
Hurry up.

368
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Step one finished.

369
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,400
There’s one more.

370
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,840
Step two finished.

371
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,280
Let’s go.

372
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:47,840
Ok.

373
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,760
Let’s go.

374
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
We can go now.

375
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,760
Done.

376
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,040
Hello, Qiao Na.

377
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
What are you doing, Jiang Jun?

378
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,480
Do you know I’m waiting for your file?

379
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,880
I have had the file ready.

380
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,000
It’s on my desk.

381
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,800
But I’m out of the office on something.

382
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,880
Please ask Chen Yicheng
to pick it up from my office.

383
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Chen Yicheng and I
are out negotiating over a project.

384
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,760
Shouldn’t you be doing

385
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,280
your job right now?

386
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,000
Are you a little complacent?

387
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,880
I’ll give you an address.

388
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,520
Get it to me in 30 minutes.

389
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,800
Ok.

390
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,960
Su Chang,

391
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,480
I left something in the office.

392
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,720
Could you turn around and go back to the office

393
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,640
and then drive me home?

394
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,680
Ok.

395
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,480
Boss,

396
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,120
it’s up to you now.

397
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,400
I’m going to propose.

398
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,880
Honey.

399
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,600
Today, I prepared an after-dinner cake

400
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,000
specially for you.

401
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,920
Are you crazy? A cake at night?

402
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,240
Do you want me to get fat?

403
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,200
I’m full.

404
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,320
-Wash the dishes.
-No.

405
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,480
Why don’t you have a try?

406
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,160
I made it specially for you.

407
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,960
The first time,

408
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,920
I failed.

409
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,800
This is the second proposal.

410
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,240
The second time.

411
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,880
I must succeed.

412
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Come on!

413
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,560
What are you doing?

414
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,240
The second time,

415
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
I failed.

416
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,360
This is the third time.

417
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,360
I must succeed.

418
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,440
Come on!

419
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,200
Jiang Jun.

420
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,440
Can you help me find out

421
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,480
what this word means?

422
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,480
I’ve been looking up for hours,
but I can’t find it.

423
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,760
I think I lost my contact lenses.

424
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,280
I’m going to the bathroom.

425
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,920
No.

426
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,640
No.

427
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,160
When did you start to wear contact lenses?

428
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,800
The third time,

429
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,360
I failed.

430
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,160
Wealth,

431
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,320
come here.

432
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
I’m telling you,

433
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,880
your mom

434
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,080
is very careless.

435
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,560
Now

436
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,040
it’s unlikely

437
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,760
to surprise her.

438
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,160
Let’s use the old-fashioned way.

439
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,240
This time,

440
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,440
I’m counting on you.

441
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,040
Counting on you. Ok?

442
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,760
Jiang Jun,

443
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,920
no matter how many times

444
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,360
I have to try,

445
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,920
I must marry you.

446
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,440
Must!

447
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,840
Come here, Wealth.

448
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
See?

449
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,320
The ring.

450
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,040
Go, Wealth!

451
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,080
Go!

452
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,880
Wealth.

453
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Wealth.

454
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,000
Wealth.

455
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,440
Wealth,

456
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,400
you look so beautiful today.

457
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,040
Jiang Jun,

458
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,720
we once missed each other for ten years

459
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,560
because of a misunderstanding.

460
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,920
In the ten years,

461
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,600
I could only miss you.

462
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,480
It felt like my life was incredibly long.

463
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,280
But with you,

464
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,040
I feel that

465
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,880
my life is short,

466
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,320
so that I’m afraid

467
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,280
we don’t have time

468
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,720
to do all the things

469
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,120
we want to do.

470
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,120
If

471
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,760
I have the honor

472
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,280
to be your lawful husband in this life,

473
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,840
I will

474
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,960
spare no effort to

475
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,880
protect you,

476
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,880
dote on you

477
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,960
and love you

478
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,800
for the rest of my life.

479
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,000
Go.

480
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,560
Jiang Jun,

481
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,800
I love you.

482
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,600
Will you marry me?

483
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Yes.

484
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,800
Should I get out of the way?

485
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,880
Boss,

486
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
congratulations on your proposal!

487
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,040
Jiang Jun, I wish you every happiness!

488
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,680
What’s this?

489
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,040
This is

490
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,360
a lifetime pledge.

491
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,560
This is an agreement.

492
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,960
Once you sign it,

493
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,040
you’ll never be able to leave me

494
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,040
for the rest of your life.

495
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,700
<i>Yuan Shuai Jiang Jun</i>

496
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,040
By the way,

497
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,320
there’s one more.

498
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,600
This

499
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,360
is a private equity agreement

500
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,920
registered in your name.

501
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,600
I’ve thought it over.

502
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,320
If you don’t want to

503
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,600
work in the investment bank in the future,

504
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,800
just give me a word

505
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,200
and I will resign with you immediately.

506
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,680
Then we can set up a small company

507
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,400
of our own together.

508
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,600
You

509
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,120
will be the boss.

510
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,320
You go earn money

511
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,520
and keep me at home.

512
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,720
You’re dreaming.

513
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,600
You want me to work for you?

514
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,160
All the money you make in the future
will be mine.

515
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,360
You’re all mine.

516
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,920
Ok, ok.

517
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,720
I’m all yours.

518
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,190
Here.

519
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,260
<i>Party A: Jiang Jun</i>

520
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,440
Ok.

521
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,880
I envy you.

522
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,160
Congratulations!

523
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,160
Congratulations, Ms. Jiang.

524
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,200
You are here, too.

525
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,760
Congratulations!

526
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,560
It’s been a while, Linda.

527
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,800
It’s been a while.

528
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,600
I’m here to deliver flowers.

529
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Thanks.

530
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,160
Congratulations!

531
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,480
I made it!

532
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,040
It’s good to see you happy.

533
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,520
Silly girl,

534
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,720
both of us are happy.

535
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,160
You still call her Jun?

536
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,000
She is your sister-in-law now.

537
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,560
No!

538
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,240
I’ll just call her Jun.

539
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,160
Jun.

540
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,280
Yuan Shuai.

541
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,000
Please

542
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,520
take good care of Jun

543
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,680
and protect her.

544
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,880
Otherwise, even if you are Xiaochuan’s cousin,

545
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,560
I will not forgive you.

546
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,760
You can rest assured.

547
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,040
And you’d also

548
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,960
take good care of Xiaochuan.

549
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,800
Of course.

550
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,040
Don’t cry.

551
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,320
Come here.

552
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,680
It’s half an hour to half past five.

553
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
People who work in the investment bank

554
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,400
are particularly keen to use their time.

555
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,400
I’ve already done the math.

556
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,480
If we rush to the Civil Affairs Bureau
right now,

557
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,880
we might be able to

558
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,160
get our marriage licenses today.

559
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,320
But

560
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,440
my household register is still with my mother.

561
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,520
See?

562
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,220
What is this?

563
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,200
<i>Household Register</i>
What is this?

564
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,860
<i>Household Register</i>

565
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,400
I never fight a war without a chance to win.

566
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,040
How did you get it?

567
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,560
Your mother gave it to me

568
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,080
the first time I went to your house.

569
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,840
I…

570
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,040
I…

571
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,160
You…

572
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,480
So, what are you waiting for? Let’s go.

573
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,640
One last thing.

574

00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,520
I forgot my wallet.

Nothing.

614
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,840
I just suddenly thought of two friends,

one named Jiang Jun (General)
and the other named Yuan Shuai (Marshal).

616

And then I met you, the Commander today.

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,640

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,080

There’s something I want to tell you.

00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,280
Can I not listen?

624
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,880
You even don’t want to hear it before I say it?

625
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,600
Because every time you look like this,

628
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,720
No, I want to hear it.

629
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,070
No matter what you’ll say,

630

and don’t want to drive.

I want you to help me find a driver

635
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,960
to pick me up and drive me to work every day.

636
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,080
That’s all?

657

how about Li World?

It’s not unacceptable.

667
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,160
