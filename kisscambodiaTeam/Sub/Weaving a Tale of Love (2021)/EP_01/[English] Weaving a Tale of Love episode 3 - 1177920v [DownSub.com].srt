[Episode 3]

4
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,380
That housekeeper Sun is really weird wanting to do this too waiting for them to die.

5
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,650
If we took it earlier, wouldn't we need to come back again?

6
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,890
The door is unlocked. Take them away, it's really unlucky.

7
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,090
Yes! Yes!  We'll deal with it right now.

8
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,560
It's this way. Go.

9
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,730
Attire Expert An! Attire Expert An!

10
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,880
Housekeeper Sun sends this to you.

11
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,530
Liuli.

12
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,860
Eat this, quick.

13
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,380
Once you ate that pill, we'll be saved.

14
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,730
Trust Mommy.

15
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,090
Alright.

16
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,280
Lie down.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,160
Lie down.

18
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,470
I practiced martial arts. I must hang a little longer.

19
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,590
Only that way it will seem real.

20
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,940
It's bad! It's bad! A prisoner hung herself!

21
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,380
Come and save her!

22
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,590
It's bad! A prisoner hung herself!

23
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,360
Come and save her!

24
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,570
What's the ruckus about?

25
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,690
We passed by here when we recovered the corpse.

26
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,800
This person was already hanging there.

27
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,190
It looks this mother strangled to death her daughter first.

28
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,740
Then hung herself.

29
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,650
That mother is heartless enough.

30
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,410
She could even strangle to death her own daughter.

31
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,590
It's better than suffering and getting executed.

32
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,760
When the prisoner are alive, they are ours to deal with.

33
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,920
Once dead, they belong to your Courtyard of Misfortune.

34
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,250
Take them back together.

35
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,140
Saving me from going to report it to your master.

36
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,950
Yes! Yes! We will take those two prisoners.

37
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,160
Faster!

38
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,450
Be all quick.

39
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,030
Fast!

40
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,660
[Courtyard of Misfortune]

41
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,690
All get out first. Xiao Shunzi stay.

42
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,570
Yes!

43
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Why did it take so long?

44
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,360
If we don't give them the antidote, I'm afraid they won't be able to wake up.

45
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,900
Attire Expert An said to wait a little longer to make it look real since she practiced martial arts.

46
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,610
So I delayed a little.

47
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,250
What did she say?

48
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,780
Attire Expert An said that your master is a kind man.

49
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,910
He wants to preserve everything.

50
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,690
But forgot that this time, what he should protect is himself.

51
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,690
If something happens to him, neither of us will be able to live.

52
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,580
Attire Expert An is a virtuous woman.

53
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,540
She would rather give up on herself

54
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,280
to protect her daughter.

55
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,370
Protect us.

56
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,350
Quick. Quickly give the antidote to the child.

57
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,050
Housekeeper Sun.We heard the criminal Madam An and her daughter committed suicide in fear of punishment.

58
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,620
Since the Bureau of Imperial Attire was ordered to cooperate with the Court of Judicial Review to investigate this,

59
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,920
Attire Chief Lin and I must examine the corpses.

60
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,490
And confirm Madam An committed suicide in fear of punishment.

61
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,610
And that there's nothing suspicious.

62
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,810
If you need to examine, please do it quickly.

63
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,790
Since the criminal already committed suicide,

64
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,810
then let's go back to report on orders.

65
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,910
Attire chief, please wait!

66
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,950
I heard there's a pill to pretend death.

67
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,240
After eating it, the heart stops beating, there's no more breathing.

68
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,040
It looks like death, but after a short time,

69
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,540
eating the antidote, they could wake up.

70
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,980
Gossip! That's sheer nonsense!

71
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,430
Where on Earth would there be such a pill? Did you really see it?

72
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,560
Madam An killing herself like this,

73
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,360
I feel uneasy.

74
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,310
Attire Chief, if we cut the weed without pulling out the roots,

75
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,020
I'm afraid of the future trouble.

76
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,920
Then, based on what you saw?

77
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,840
Cremate the corpses. Burning them to ashes saves us from all the troubles.

78
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,270
Even if they took a faking death pill, they can't call back their soul.

79
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,010
That's ridiculous!

80
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,540
All the dead that came into the Courtyard of Misfortune always have been buried.

81
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,810
There's no etiquette for cremation. It won't do!

82
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,440
Even if the Bureau of Imperial Attire have extremely big powers,

83
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,580
You can't change the etiquette of the Courtyard of Misfortune!

84
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,950
My apologies, Housekeeper Sun.
[Court of Judicial Review]

85
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,880
The Bureau of Imperial Attire is commissioned to help the Court of Judicial Review.

86
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,160
That mission order,

87
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,080
how many heads do you have to dare resist?

88
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,930
I finally understand why you absolutely wanted to cremate the bodies.

89
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,790
When Madam An and her daughter were sent to jail,

90
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,870
you must have already searched their bodies.

91
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,060
But you didn't find that golden needle that you want.

92
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,380
So figured out that they hid it in their corpse.

93
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,540
It is said that real gold don't fear fire. You want to use the public office for your personal gain.

94
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,340
Once you found the golden needle, you'll take it for yourself.

95
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,380
Only by clearing completely this affair,

96
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,430
can you and I rest easily.

97
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,140
Otherwise, I'm afraid there will be no end to our troubles.

98
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,960
Take her up. Burn them together!

99
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,120
Xiao Shunzi!

100
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,430
Eunuch Sun!

101
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,320
Eunuch Sun, your Courtyard of Misfortune has a blazing fire.

102
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,300
What is it for?

103
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,430
Eunuch Gao asked me to notify you.

104
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,730
Today is the auspicious day for the newly conferred Talented Lady Wu to enter the palace.

105
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,680
All funeral related ceremonies are forbidden in the palace

106
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,410
to avoid all filthy things.

107
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,840
Hurry! Extingush the fire!

108
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,330
Zhuo Jinniang, this matter ends here.

109
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,730
If the gold needle isn't inside the An woman's body, it wouldn't be inside her daughter's body.

110
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,040
No mother in the world would let her daughter

111
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,750
suffer the pain of swallowing a needle.

112

May Your Majesty live 10,000 years and many more.

115
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,650
You may rise.

Thank you, Your Majesty.

117
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,130
So beautiful like a peach and pear.

118
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,450
Pure like the autumn's chrysanthemum.

119
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,660
The auspicious gown you're wearing is particularly alluring but not trendy, uniquely charming.

120
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,520
Talented Lady Wu, I bestowed you the name of Meiniang.

121
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,920
Do you like it?

122
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,640
Meiniang thanks Your Majesty for the bestowed name.

123
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,280

will the swallowed antidote still work?

127
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,590
I hope this child will be lucky.

This is the Courtyard of Misfortune.

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,910
Where is my mother? I want to find my mother.

142
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,250
Child, child, don't be anxious, let me tell you slowly.

143
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,040
I have to tell you something.

Child, don't be sad.

148

We will be your family in the future.

149
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,560
Don't worry, we will definitely take good care of you.

150

You can't cry so loud.

151

You are still in danger.

152
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,330
You must not let other people know that you're still alive.

154
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,470
You must learn to be strong.

Xiao Douzi, alright?

160
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,660
From now on, you must forget that you are a girl.

161
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,320
Forget that you are Attire Expert An's daughter.

162
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,450
Forget that you are named Liuli.

163
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,530
This is the way that you can survive in the palace.

164
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,560
I don't want to live by myself!

165
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,340
I only want to be with Mother.

This is left by your mother before she died.

169
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,650
I know that you are feeling really sad now.

170
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,840
But, you must know that

171
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,890
your mother sacrificed her own life

172
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,940
so that your life is protected, child.

173
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,420
You must not disappoint her.

174
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,550
You must live on and live well.

175
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,890
Liulu, when you open this purse,

176
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,580
Mother will be gone already.

177
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,780
You must live on.

Salute him as your Foster Father.

181
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,790
Leave the palace once you reach the age of 18.

182
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,120
Go far from Chang'an.

183

00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,820
Greetings, Attire Expert Zhuo.

190
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,780
Please instruct us, Attire Expert Zhuo.

[Courtyard of Misfortune]

[Talented Lady Wu]

194
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,820
Talented Lady Di, there isn't much friendliness in the palace.

195
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,230
You and I were like sisters here.

196
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,370
I didn't know you would depart first.

197
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,600
I came here today to send Older Sister off.

198
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,260
I know that you've always been frugal.

199
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,940
I brought over a pretty gown.

200
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,870
Consider it as my last token of sisterly bond to you.

201
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,140
- Eunuch Sun. 
 - Present.

202
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,400
Where did Talented Lady Di get this clothing?

203
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,800
I've never seen her wear this before.

204
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,480
Replying to Talented Lady Wu,

205
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,590
this must be the needlework by our Physician Dou.

206
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,020
Our Physician Dou specializes in dressmaking and embroidery.

207
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,260
All the brothers at the Courtyard of Misfortune say that his skills

208
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,110
- can surpass that of the Bureau of Imperial Attire— 
 - You talk too much!

209
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,470
Physician Dou?

210
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,310
Who is he?

211
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,070
Why would a physician in the Imperial Academy of Medicine do needlework?

212
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,170
Replying to Talented Lady Wu,

213
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,650
this Physician Dou is the Courtyard of Misfortune's

214
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,670
physician that does sanitation work for the corpses.

215
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,740
Even though he belongs to the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

216
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,930
but he is stationed at the Courtyard of Misfortune.

217
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,280
Most of the Imperial Physicians came from renowned medical families

218
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,110
with a noble status.

219
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,460
But our Courtyard of Misfortune is a filthy place.

220
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,310
So the imperial physicians don't want to be assigned here.

221
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,840
Sanitizing the corposes to prevent contamination

222
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,240
doesn't require complicated medical skills.

223
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,020
It's the same procedure.

224
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,070
So gradually,

225
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,930
the Courtyard of Misfortune has had to find someone for this position on our own.

226
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,530
The master teaches the disciple.

227
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,710
We only need to notify the Imperial Academy of Physicians.

228
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,770
The more you say, the more confused I get.

229
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,300
So how does this Physician Dou have such an excellent dressmaking skill?

230
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,140
It looks to surpass the skills at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

231
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,190
Replying to Talented Lady Wu, there are no palace maids in the Courtyard of Misfortune.

232
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,980
This Physician Dou is more clever

233
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,830
with his hands than ordinary people.

234
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,970
He is also willing to mend clothings for the people here.

235
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,620
How can this be compared to the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

236
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,050
So that's how it is.

237
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,980
In this inner palace, it's easier to get treasures

238
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,520
than true feelings.

239
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,840
Compared to his skills,

240
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,530
this sense of compassion is so touching.

241
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,450
I want to see this Physician Dou

242
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,920
and thank him on behalf of Talented Lady Di.

243
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,230
Yes.

244
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,020
Who are you?

245
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,280
How dare you bother my meditation?

246
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,360
Immortal, please have mercy.

247
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,330
I am Xiao Shunzi and I didn't know Immortal is meditating here.

248
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,390
Immortal, please have mercy. I'm leaving now.

249
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,800
Speak!

250
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,310
Which coffin am I in?

251
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,030
If you guess it wrong,

252
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,800
you will come inside to stay with me.

253
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,900
 - Xiao Shunzi! 
 - Don't scare me! I'm a coward.

254
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,120
I'll find someone who is brave to play with you, alright?

255
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,260
Someone who is brave?

256
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,580
- Who? 
 - Xiao Douzi. He is the bravest.

257
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,870
I will find him to play with you.

258
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,980
Stop it.

259
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,090
Ghost! Master!

260
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,340
Save me!

261
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,910
Save me, Master!

262
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,910
If you stop, I'll let you out.

263
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,600
What are you crying about?

264
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,010
Master, there is a ghost, a ghost!

265
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,800
Evertime I ask you to inventory the supplies,

266
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,910
you always get into a ruckus.

267
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,830
How many times have I told you?

268
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,080
I don't know if there are ghosts in the world.

269
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,600
After all these years in the palace,

270
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,590
I just know that sometimes people are more scary that ghosts.

271
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,710
Our Courtyard of Misfortune is actually the cleanest place in the palace.

272
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,000
What is there to be afraid of?

273
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,920
No, Master, there is really a ghost.

274
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,850
Where is Xiao Douzi?

275
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,220
You, Xiao Douzi, it's you playing me again.

276
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,150
What's this mess? I asked you, where is Xiao Douzi?

277
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,960
Hurry and come out.

278
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,170
You, you... 
 [Physician Dou]

279
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,650
I told you to hide your talent, and not show off your magnificent skill in dressmaking.

280
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,310
You just wouldn't listen even when I've said so many times. Watch how I'll punish you later.

281
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,760
Foster Father,

282
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,650
I pitied Talented Lady Di.

283
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,040
Now,

284
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,740
Talented Lady Wu wants to see you.

285
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,710
Physician Dou, raise your head.

286
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,220
Physician Dou, you look familar to me.

287
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,600
But I can't remember where I've seen you.

288
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,920
Physician Dou.

289
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,020
Don't be rude in front of Talented Lady Wu.

290
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,390
Don't forget your status.

291
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,020
Please don't blame us, Talented Lady Wu. My foster son

292
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:46,010
grew up in the Courtyard of Misfortune. He has never seen the outside and doesn't understand rules.

293
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,920
It's alright. Physician Dou,

294
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,730
how did you meet Talented Lady Di?

295
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,480
I did not know Talented Lady Di.

296
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,060
You did not know her? Then why did you make a dress for her?

297
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,020
Replying to Talented Lady Wu, there isn't much friendliness inside the palace.

298
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,540
But after Talented Lady Di died,

299
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,720
all the maids and eunuchs who had served her came crying to bid farewell to her.

300
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,870
They kneeled to thank her for taking care of them.

301
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,900
They also recounted many touching tales in front of the coffin.

302
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,140
Even though I didn't know Talented Lady Di, but I admired her.

303
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,060
I didn't have the heart to see her depart in a simple and old dress.

304
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,610
So I decided on my own to make her a new dress.

305
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,130
There really aren't many kindhearted people like you in the palace.

306
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,900
I thank you on behalf of Talented Lady Di.

307
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,010
In the future, if you run into any difficulty in the palace,

308
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,430
you can come to the Hall of Sunset Pool to find me.

309
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,120
I will definitely repay your favor on behalf of Talented Lady Di.

310
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,370
Thank you, Talented Lady Wu, for your grace.

311
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,580
[Eternal Peace Room, Courtyard of Misfortune]

312
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,080
Do you realize you almost revealed your identitiy just now and made a huge mistake?

313
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,070
She is the Older Sister Wu who saved me years ago.

314
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,760
She is a good person. She won't hurt me.

315
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,620
If I can reacquaint with Older Sister Wu,

316
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,360
then I can find that savior who took me out of Wu Manor back then.

317
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,110
Then I can find Mother's gold needle!

318
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,310
People's hearts can change. She helped you 11 years ago,

319
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,780
it doesn't mean that she won't hurt you 11 years later.

320
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,980
You know what this place is? The palace.

321
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,530
The biggest taboo is to reveal your weakness to others.

322
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,280
Your identity is your biggest weakness.

323
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,440
I don't believe Older Sister Wu will hurt me.

324
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,090
Even if she won't hurt you,

325
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,860
but once your identity is revealed,

326
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,560
it will attract deathly danger to those who had helped you and saved you.

327
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,630
If you reacquaint yourself with Talented Lady Wu, it will bring danger to her.

328
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,370
Understand?

329
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,890
Foster Father, I know I'm wrong.

330
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,370
Foster Father.

331
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,320
Remember it well.

332
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,630
Embroidery is using the needle instead of a pen.

333
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,120
the silk instead of paper,

334
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,820
using the silk threads to color.

335
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,390
A good result of embroidery

336
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,980
must reach the level of excellent in both form and style.

337
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,080
Compared to a famous scholar's books and paintings,

338
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,730
embroidery is on the same level.

339
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,940
Therefore, it is also called

340
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,190
"Elite Arts in a Lady's Room."

What are you doing?

343
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,840
I-I-I...

344
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,490
give it.

345
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,270
Master.

346
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:17,220
I originally wanted to embroider by copying this purse.

347
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,140
But I don't know why, no matter how I embroider,

348
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,080
I just can't make it as lively as this purse.

349
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,300
Qiniang,

350
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,550
where did this purse come from?

351
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,280
To tell you the truth,

352
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,480
this embroidery style on this purse

353
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,890
has disappeared for many years.

354
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,540
The last person who had mastered this skill

355
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,440
was my teacher,

356
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,380
Number One Needle in the World, Attire Expert An.

357
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,900
This purse, from craftsmanship to embroidery,

358
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,890
is clearly what she personally made.

359
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,840
Eleven years ago,

360
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:06,720
my teacher committed a high crime of treason and committed suicide in jail.

361
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,050
Qiniang, what the An woman committed was a crime that would eliminate nine generations.

362
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,260
You could be connected.

363
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,850
Have you thought it over?

364
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,500
I...

365
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,850
Master, please have mercy. I have nothing to do with this purse. I found it.

366
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,920
A few days ago, I walked past the frontdoor of the Courtyard of Misfortune.

367
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,400
I happened to bump into a little physician.

368
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,580
That little physician was in a hurry.

369
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,460
After he left, I found this.

370
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,880
Then you should find that little physician and inquire thoroughly.

371
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,090
If this purse really belongs to him,

372
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,410
you would be in the clear.

373
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,050
Yes.

374
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,090
Are you looking for this?

375
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,270
Is this purse yours?

376
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,820
That's right.

377
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,690
How did you get this purse?

378
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,060
Why are you asking so many questions?

379
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,200
The embroidery on this purse can't even be done at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

380
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,100
Attire Expert Zhuo said that this kind of embroidery

381
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,720
has disappeared after the death of Attire Expert An.

382
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,870
If you won't tell me the origin of this purse,

383
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,030
then you won't get it back.

384
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,410
This purse... I bought this purse.

385
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,280
You bought it?

386
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,310
Where did you buy it?

387
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,580
I-I bought it from Xiao Shunzi of the Courtyard of Misfortune. If you don't believe, just ask him.

388
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,000
Xiao Shunzi?

389
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,220
You are the royal family's physician?

390
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,830
Wait!

391
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
You said the Attire Expert Zhuo.

392
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,200
Why must she need to know where this sachet came from?

393
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Attire Expert Zhuo is the only disciple of the An Family.

394
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,700
This satchet was made by the An Family.

395
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Since she saw it, he obviously must get a clear explanation.

396
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,400
Father! Father. Father.

397
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,700
Father!

398
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,200
Little bean. What is it that is making you so excited?

399
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,600
Father. It turns out that mother had a disciple.

400
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Who said this?

401
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Is it possible that you knew way earlier on?

402
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

403
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,800
So it turns out that Zhuo Jiniang is the disciple of my mother.

404
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
Then she must know about my mother's past.

405
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,770
Maybe she also knows

406
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,000
who killed mother.

407
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,800
As soon as Zhuo Jiniang saw my mother's sachet, she immediately got people to come and get news.

408
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,600
You can tell immediately that this person is kind and caring.

409
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,800
Nonsense. Go.

410
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,300
I want to ask myself

411
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,380
Disciple knows I am wrong.

412
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,000
It is disciple who didn't do things well.

413
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,800
Zhuo Jiniang saw the sachet your mother left for you?

414
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Yes!

415
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,400
You mustn't go and find Zhuo Jininang.

416
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,800
You cannot let Zhuo Jiniang know your real identity.

417
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,700
Why?

418
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,400
There is no why!

419
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,200
My good daughter,

420
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,600
listen to what father has to tell you. What is the point of finding her?

421
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,800
She doesn't know who killed your mother.

422
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,600
If she did know,

423
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
then would she still be alive until now?

424
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
She would have been pulled down years ago.

425
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,000
Listen to what I told you about not being able to be connected with people who practice martial arts.

426
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,300
You cannot go and meet Zhuo Jiniang either. You might harm her instead!

427
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,800
Right. I cannot go and meet Zhuo Jiniang.

428
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,700
I cannot harm her.

429
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,190
That's right.

430
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
I'm only afraid that even though we do not go to find her,

431
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,400
but she will try to come and find you.

432
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,500
We need to think of a plan.

433
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,800
We cannot let her know your real identity.

434
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,900
I have an idea!

435
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,800
This sachet, did you really purchase it from the a Hu vendor in the West Market?

436
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,200
Obviously it is.

437
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,600
If you don't believe, have a look. I have a few more here.

438
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,000
I often go out with my master to do some stuff.

439
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,600
So when I see something interesting, I will buy some back home.

440
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,200
And then I give some to those people who cannot leave.

441
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,400
I thought this sachet was pretty so I bought a few more.

442
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,600
Attire Expert Zhuo. If you like it,

443
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,500
You can buy a few more. I can give you the chepeast price.

444
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,950
Thank you for looking after our business.

445
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,400
These sachets

446
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,600
Do you remember which West Market stall you bought it from?

447
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,400
Usually the Hu Vendors will bring goods from the Western Regions to Chan An and

448
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,800
After they sell out, they leave. There isn't a fixed shop.

449
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,600
I just met it coincidentally.

450
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,400
Attire Expert Zhuo, if you don't have anything else,

451
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
Then I will leave first.

452
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,500
You can go.

453
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,100
Send people to the Northern Market and

454
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,000
Go to every single stall and find it for me.

455
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,700
Be it a store or a Hu vender stall,

456
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
Don't leave any one of them.

457
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,600
I must found out where these sachets came from.

458
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,400
Otherwise I cannot be at ease.

459
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,100
[West Market]

460
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Have you seen these sachets before?

461
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,600
 Have you seen this before?

462
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,900
 No.

463
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
 Have you seen this before?

464
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,200
 Have you seen this before?

465
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,800
 Have you seen this before?

466
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,780
Little bean.

467
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,800
What master just says. You must remember it.

468
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,600
Attire Expert Zhuo is the disciple of my mother.

469
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
Then she is my family. What is there to be scared about?

470
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,600
Little bean!

471
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,800
Don't worry. I won't let him know who I am.

472
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,600
This way, I can emphasise more

473
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,020
This way, when you walk,

474
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,000
you are even more beautiful towards others.

475
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,570
- I greet Talented Lady Wu. 
 - Greet Talented Lady Wu.

476
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
All rise.

477
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,600
Check if the waist and the length of the dress fits well

478
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,800
Yes. Talented Lady Wu, please follow me.

479
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,200
You lost that sachet?

480
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,900
Yes. I accidentally lost that sachet a few days ago.

481
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,400
She said that you were so upset while searching for the sachet that you almost started crying

482
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,800
Is this sachet that important to you?

483
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,600
It is because she had money in the sachet at that time.

484
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,070
I have let Attire Expert Zhuo see something hideous.

485
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,700
You claim that these sachets were purchased at the West Market?

486
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,000
But when sent people to check all over the West Market, they were not able to find it.

487
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,800
Don't tell me you think that I am trying to snatch your business?

488
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,000
And so you purposely lied to me?

489
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,200
I do not dare. The sachet really was bought there.

490
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,200
that made you feel so intrigued that it made you search a whole town?

491
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,600
I actually want to have a look at it.

492
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,300
I followed master and bought one from there as.

493
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,400
Why would she have to by a sachet from another place?

494
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,200
The way to make this sachet has already been lost. Even master doesn't know.

495
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,190
So master wants to try and

496
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,800
find who made these sachets.

497
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,100
It's nothing.

498
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm not rushed. I have more than enough time.

499
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,800
Think slowly. Once you have thought about it clearly,

500
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,400
where did you buy these sachets. And how many times did you go and buy them?

501
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,200
Was it from the same place,

502
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,800
or was it from another place as well?

503
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,400
I bought it many times

504
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,800
and I think... it was...

505
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,100
I think it was from one place.

506
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,300
Every few years, they will come once or twice.

507
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,600
He has weird movement and travel plans. If you couldn't find them, it's not weird either.

508
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Who knows, he might come back soon.

509
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,800
So you've brought it from the same person every couple of years as he comes around?

510
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,400
If you put it like this, you are very close with this person?

511
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,400
I'm not that close. I only know their face.

512
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,000
No. No. No. I also know him.

513
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,910
After a while,

514
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,000
I might now know either.

515
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,500
Attire Expert Zhuo. Why must you need to find this stall?

516
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,200
I am looking at how these sachets were made so nicely.

517
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,600
I just want to buy some more.

518
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,830
I still have some left. I will give all of them to you.

♫  Borrow from the relentless of the night  ♫

527
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,900
♫  To exchange for the certainty of a promise  ♫

528
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,400
♫  There are too many bumpy roads along the way  ♫

529
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,600
♫  The more twists, the deeper it is  ♫

530
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,400
♫  Breaking up and making up is like an illusion  ♫

531
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:24,400
♫  Resembles a traveler traveling through this life  ♫

532
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,000
♫  Time ignores everything including obsession  ♫

533
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,200
♫  With the candlelight flickering indefinitely  ♫

534
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,000
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

535
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:48,000
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫

536
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,600
♫  After the fire, there was only one thing left  ♫

537
00:44:52,600 --> 00:45:03,100
♫  A bright moon that makes one's heart tingle  ♫
