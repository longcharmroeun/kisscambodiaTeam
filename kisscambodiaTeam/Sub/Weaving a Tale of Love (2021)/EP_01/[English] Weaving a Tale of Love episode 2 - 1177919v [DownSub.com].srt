[Weaving a Tale of Love]

3
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,100
[Episode 2]

4
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,030
Young Master Pei, why are you still here?

5
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,790
the general and the Buddhist master are playing chess for a few days, so I'll wait here during this time.

6
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,200
This Buddhist Temple has four gates in north, south, east, and west directions.

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,290
How will you know which gate the general will leave from?

8
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,040
This...

9
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,360
Please tell me.

10
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,530
How can I predict what General Su thinks?

11
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,970
Unless... you wait outside the chamber where General Su and Buddhist Master are playing chess without stepping away.

12
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,840
Then I will wait outside the chess chamber without stepping a single step away.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,830
General Su ordered that you cannot step inside the temple.

14
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,730
General Su only said that I cannot step inside.

15
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,820
He didn't say I couldn't enter.

16
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,000
My courtesy name is Shouyue, meaning "keeping promise," so I will definitely keep my promise.

17
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,660
Hey, what are you doing?

18
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,110
If General asks about it in the future, you will have to testify for me.

19
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,590
I will not step a single step inside the temple.

20
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,550
It isn't breaking my promise. Now that I've already entered inside,

21
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,540
I hope you'll tell me where the chess chamber is.

22
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,860
I wonder which young lady's embroidery skill

23
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,740
can actually turn out such life-like result.

24
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,880
You, you, you've really hurt me greatly.

25
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,780
Brother!

26
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,470
Brother, how

27
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,430
I don't know either. They are playing blind chess.

28
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,000
What? The general and the Buddhist master are playing blind chess?

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,460
Becuase it is blind chess, that's why others

30
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,100
have no idea when the chess game will finish.

31
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,780
Buddha, everyone says you can protect the good people.

32
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,350
My mother is the best and kindest person in this whole world.

33
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,280
Now that my mother has run into dangers.

34
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,150
I am very worried about her.

35
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,810
I am also very afraid, and don't know the future

36
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,590
is lucky or disasterous. Please show a sign, Buddha.

37
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,650
[Bad]

38
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,170
[Bad]

39
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,020
[Good]

40
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,010
[Number 19 - Good]

41
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,880
Isn't this the handkerchief that I embroidered?

42
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,050
Why is it here?

43
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,340
It must be that Buddha has noticed my sincerity

44
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,980
and manifasted a sign to help me.

45
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,630
What Buddha wants to say must be in this devination stick.

46
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,910
[Number 19 - Good]

47
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,240
Thank you, Buddha, for your blessing. As long as my mother is safe,

48
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,920
I will have no more fear.

49
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,880
This little girl looks so young,

50
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,950
but she is so skilled that she can embroider such a lifelike camilla flower.

51
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,590
You've waited for three days here,

52
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,790
but you failed at the last moment.

53
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,690
With such little skill,

54
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,040
how can you want to be my disciple?

55
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,860
I am ashamed, so I concede my loss.

56
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,910
I was going to just leave,

57
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,140
but I also want to know something.

58
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,580
Why did you change that little girl's devination stick?

59
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,430
Replying to General,

60
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,220
that little girl clearly has encountered a difficulty in her life.

61
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,310
Regardless of what the devination stick says,

62
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,920
it won't change her situation.

63
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,580
But a good devination stick will give her the courage to face the danger.

64
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,760
I saw that she was really afraid,

65
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,280
so I wanted to give her some courage.

66
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,640
Tell me then, what is courage?

67
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,100
Courage means

68
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,750
you would do something even though it cannot be done.

69
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,780
Years ago, General Su led two hundred cavalrymen and dared to ambush the camp of East Turkestan

70
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,980
and made their Khan run away in a panic.

71
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,160
General Li's troops came after that

72
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,750
and were able to kill more than 10,000 of the enemies and took more than 100,000 prisoners in a great victory.

73
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,930
May I ask, didn't General Su do something that you knew could not be done?

74
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,170
Clearly there is nothing that is for certain in this world.

75
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,750
It just depends on how you do it.

76
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,360
Excellent!

77
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,250
You said it well!

78
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,090
I'm accepting you as disciple!

79
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,850
Really? General Su is really accepting me as disciple?

80
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,320
Master, please let me bow to salute you.

81
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,570
My good nephew.

82
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,500
This nephew Pei Xingjian greets Madam Yang.

83
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,940
Madam, how has your health been?

84
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,680
No need for such formalitiy. You've endured a hard journey from the faraway Shanxi.

85
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,560
Yuanhua greets Older Brother Pei.

86
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,320
It's been many years, Mother has always mentioned Brother Pei.

87
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,110
We've missed you.

88
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,090
Greetings, Younger Sister Wu.

89
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,740
My father was old friends with Uncle Wu. My father died early.

90
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,690
When I was young and living in Chang'an, I was taken care of by Uncle and Aunt.

91
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,640
Uncle Wu passed away three years ago.

92
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,610
I was far away in Hedaodong and couldn't come to pay my respect.

93
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,260
This time, I came to participate in the imperial exam and will live in Chang'an from now on.

94
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,780
That's why I came to visit you in order to burn an incense for Uncle

95
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,660
and also greet Madam and younger sister.

96
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,700
My good nephew, you are thoughtful. Come, sit down.

97
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,210
Please.

98
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,120
This disciple greets Teacher.

99
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,350
It's been seven days.

100
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,590
I wonder if Teacher has modified

101
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,790
the pheasant robe well.

102
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,450
Teacher really has masterful fingers and divine needles. 
 (T/N: highly skilled)

103
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,310
This disciple is truly far behind.

104
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,080
Teacher, please teach me.

105
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,030
How can this disciple ever reach your level of expertise?

106
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,820
Your skill is already very good.

107
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,910
But the highest level isn't attained by the fingers,

108
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,690
but by the heart. Once your heart can attain that level,

109
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,000
your dressmaking skill will also reach a higher level.

110
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,320
Ultimately,

111
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,540
Teacher still wouldn't show me everything.

112
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,540
That's why you use these mysterious words

113
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,380
to refuse me?

114
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,050
If you really think so, then I don't need to explain.

115
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,070
This pheasant robe is enough for you to fulfill your duty.

116
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,370
Do not forget the agreement between us.

117
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,400
Do not ever mention to anyone that I have a daughter.

118
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,860
Thank you, Teacher, for helping me.

119
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,170
What Teacher has ordered me, of course

120
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,830
this disciple will hold it to heart.

121
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,300
Talented Lady Wu, you are really beautiful.

122
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,730
When you wear this auspicious gown, you look like a fairy from the painting.

123
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,900
I could not have imagined that you are so skilled at this young age.

124
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,780
After I've entered the palace, I will send for you

125
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,530
and make clothes only for me. Do you want to?

126
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:48,590
My mother has said that the palace is the most extravagant and richest place.

127
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,890
It has the most beautiful halls, the most luxuriant clothes,

128
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,820
and the most briliant jewelry.

129
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,340
But, it is the heaviest shackel

130
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:05,310
and the strongest prison. I don't want to live in a prison where I have no freedom.

131
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,270
Where do you want to go then?

132
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,000
Mother said that Gaochang is her hometown.

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,420
It is truly the most beautiful place in the world.

134
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,580
We can live a free life in Gaochang.

135
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,920
Your mother is right, but not entirely right.

136
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,860
Freedom is not only about high sky, huge land,

137
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,530
being carefree.

138
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,750
The palace is the most luxuriant place

139
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,630
but also the place with the most power.

140
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,520
Why should I talk about this with a little child?

141
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,290
Perhaps it's because we really get along.

142
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,010
I really like your personality.

143
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,450
That's why I couldn't help but speak of these things with you.

144
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,190
Liuli, don't call me Talented Lady Wu from now on.

145
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,870
Just call me Older Sister Wu then.

146
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,580
Older Sister Wu, even though I've only stayed with you for the short seven days,

147
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,720
but I also like Older Sister very much.

148
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,910
Your dream is in Gaochang,

149
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,610
but my dream is in the palace.

150
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,200
Now that you have this older sister,

151
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,630
but it seems that we may not be able to see each other again.

152
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,380
I hope that we will each get our wish.

153
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,130
You and your mother can live a simple happy life.

154
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:39,110
And I, will stand at the summit of power one day,

155
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,700
not only be the master of my own life,

156
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,820
but also have the freedom to discuss mountains and rivers. 
 (T/N: decide on national affairs)

157

[Hall of Gentle Breeze]

158
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,290
Greetings, Consort Yang.

159
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,000
Is there a reason for Attire Chief Lin to come here today?

160
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,300
This servant is here to present a gift to Consort Yang.

161
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,110
A gift?

162
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,370
Please look, Consort Yang.

163
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,890
This pheasant robe is a celebratory gift from the Bureau of Imperial Attire to Consort Yang.

164
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,480
We wish for Consort Yang to reach the seat of empress soon,

165
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,930
and be the motherly role model for the world.

166
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,140
This is a gift from the Bureau of Imperial Attire?

167
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,090
Yes.

168
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,820
This consort greets Your Majesty.

169
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,150
Greetings, Your Majesty.

170
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,570
What a most beautiful pheasant robe for the empress!

171
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,810
If I didnt see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.

172
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,880
So you've been so anxiously eyeing the empress position?

173
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,000
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

174
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,250
I've never ordered the Bureau of Imperial Attire to make the pheasant robe.

175
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,270
It-It's the Bureau of Imperial Attire that did it without my knowledge.

176
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,760
I am innocent. Please, Your Majesty, judge wisely

177
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,180
and vindicate me.

178
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,610
Making the pheasant robe is such a serious matter. How could you not have known beforehand?

179
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,530
Your Majesty, I am willing to swear to Heaven,

180
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,060
that I never ordered the Bureau of Imperial Attire to make the pheasant robe.

181
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,110
If Your Majesty won't believe me,

182
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,940
I am willing to die to prove my innocence!

183
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,760
Consort Yang!

184
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,450
- A'Chuan, hurry and call for the Imperial Physician. 
 - Yes.

185
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,570
You created this trouble. Hurry and admit guilt now so as not to drag down the entire Bureau of Imperial Attire.

186
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,030
I am a member of the Bureau of Imperial Attire. If I am convicted,

187
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,770
how can you stay safe yourself?

188
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,080
Speak.

189
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,030
Whose idea was it to make the pheasant robe?

190
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,490
In front of His Majesty, you should tell everything clearly.

191
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,380
Did I order you to make the pheasant robe for the empress?

192
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,320
Reply-Replying to Your Majesty,

193
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,360
Consort Yang never ordered the Bureau of Imperial Attire

194
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,320
to make the pheasant robe for the empress.

195
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,510
If she didn't do it,

196
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,190
who ordered you then?

197
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,890
Your Majesty...

198
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,920
Your Majesty,

199
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,460
it was Zhuo Jinniang.

200
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,570
It was this servant Zhuo Jinniang's Teacher,

201
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,130
the former Attire Expert, Madam An.

202
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,190
Madam An?

203
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,960
Your Majesty, this pheasant robe for the empress

204
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,920
is made by my teacher, Madam An, the Number One Needle in the World.

205
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,480
Teacher's skill is renowned in the world, and her embroidery is peerless.

206
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,650
Other than Teacher, no one else can embroider such an exquistely beautiful pheasant robe.

207
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,480
This servant would not dare to lie.

208
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,380
I remember this Attire Expert An.

209
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,790
Back then, Empress Zhangsun liked the gowns she made very much.

210
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,900
But didn't she receive the permission from the late empress years ago

211
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,080
to leave the palace?

212
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,100
Replying to Your Majesty, my teacher was impulsive back then

213
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,050
and begged the late empress to let her leave the palace.

214
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,730
But atter she left the palace, she couldn't handle the difficult civililan life and quickly regretted.

215
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,380
But she couldn't find a good opportunity to return to the palace.

216
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,450
A few days ago,

217
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,620
there were many rumors within and outside the palace that Consort Yang was about to become the empress.

218
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,000
Teacher must have heard those rumors and wanted to appease Consort Yang

219
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,030
so that she could return to the Bureau of Imperial Attire, that's why she exceeded the etiquette boundary to make this robe.

220
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,750
She order this servant to offer it to Consort Yang.

221
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,250
When Teacher gave me this pheasant robe, she only said that

222
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,790
it was a gown that she especially made for Consort Yang.

223
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,990
She told me to personally offer to Consort Yang. I didn't inspect it clearly first

224
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,430
and brought it into the palace.

225
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,360
I almost cause Consort Yang to be innocently convicted.

226
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,690
I should be dead. Please have mercy, Your Majesty. Spare me, Consort Yang.

227
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,510
I almost mistakenly blamed you.

228
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,360
Your Majesty.

229
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,090
- Guards! 
 - Present.

230
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,630
Drag out these two servants from the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

231
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,860
Hand them to the Chief Eunuch to question their crimes.

232
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,050
Your Majesty, no, this incident has nothing to do with me, I'm innocent!

233
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,580
Your Majesty, I was momentarily careless and got used by my teacher and almost hurt Consort Yang.

234
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,590
Although I should die and still not clear my guilty, but, Your Majesty,

235
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,020
if this incident is blamed onto the Bureau of Imperial Attire and more,

236
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,320
won't it substantiate all those speculation against Consort Yang? Your Majesty!

237
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,420
Your Majesty, so that Cosnort Yang is not misunderstood by the others,

238
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,650
- please spare this servant and I will repay by doing a good deed. 
 - Your Majesty, I didn't deliberately do it.

239
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,430
Wait.

240
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,280
Your Majesty is wise. Now that you've exonerated me,

241
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,230
I plea that Your Majesty

242
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,580
will spare these two servants from the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

243
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,190
If they are blamed,

244
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,420
I'm afraid that the rumors won't cease and there'll be further turbulence.

245
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,780
I don't want to cause more instability

246
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,600
within the palace over the matter of empress conferral.

247
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,630
Forget it then, I'll listen to you, Beloved Consort.

248
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,560
I'll temporarily pardon these two servants.

249
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,850
But that Madam An who has left the palace

250
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,760
but still cause all this trouble for her shallow fame,

251
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,640
she is truly despicable.

252
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,830
I order you two to assist the Court of Judicial Review

253
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,800
to arrest Madam An and thoroughtly investigate this incident.

254
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,890
- You can atone for your guilt. 
 - Thank you, Your Majesty.

255
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,610
Dalang! Dalang! Something really bad has happened.

256
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,160
The Court of Judicial Review's constables are here to make arrests.

257
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,820
Dalang!

258
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,720
Dalang!

259
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,440
Hurry and bring that divorce letter.

260
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,110
Attire Expert An, if you don't come out quickly,

261
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,650
we will go inside to arrest you.

262
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,710
Are you the Number One Needle in the World, Attire Expert An?

263
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,210
Yes, I am.

264
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,150
To appease the noble lady in the inner palace,

265
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,330
you crossed etiquette boundary to make the pheasant robe for the empress. We have both witness and evidence.

266
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,300
Do you acknowledge your crime?

267
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,570
Constable, you said that I secretly made the robe,

268
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,230
the witness and evidence are both present,

269
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,430
is she the witness?

270
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,730
Zhuo Jinniang, apparently you made a mistake when you tried to appease your higher-ups.

271
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,340
That's why you hurriedly disassociate your guilt

272
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,440
and hurriedly push me up as your scapegoat.

273
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,890
We are teacher and disciple. Where is your conscience?

274
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,940
We were teacher and disciple.

275
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,230
When did you ever treat me as a disciple and teach me everything?

276
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,150
Now that you've committed a high crime,

277
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,530
the nation's law will not tolerate you,

278
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,820
this disciple can't help but kill family for grand justice. 
 (T/N: place justice above personal relationship)

279
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,640
Teacher.

280
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,410
You are a smart person.

281
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,190
If you don't want to drag in your family members,

282
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,880
it's best that you admit your guilt quickly.

283
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,880
What I promised you before, I'll still abide by it.

284
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,710
If Teacher won't recognize the realities,

285
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,000
and randomly accuse others and refuse to admit guilty,

286
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,530
then don't blame me to be

287
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:30,070
unfaithful, unjust, and unfeeling.

288
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,380
Where is your husband? With something this big happening,

289
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,010
what, we don't even see his shadow.

290
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,940
Here, I'm here!

291
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,360
Kudi Yanzhong greets Constable from the Court of Judicial Review.

292
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,080
Reporting to Official, I discovered this An woman making clothes at home for the palace a few days ago.

293
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,230
I felt it was inappropriate at that time. Although I didn't know it was the pheasant robe,

294
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,230
I tried to dissuade her but she stubbornly did it her way.

295
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,360
I immediately wrote a divorce letter at that time

296
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,200
to divorce this An woman. Please look, Official.

297
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,960
From now on, the An woman and Kudi family

298
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,830
will not be related at all.

299
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,400
Every word I've said is true.

300
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,830
All the servants here and the neighbors can testify.

301
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,860
Take the An woman away.

302
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,920
Get away.

303
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,300
Female Officer, why are you back?

304
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,890
The An woman has a gold needle.

305
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,950
- Do you know where it's hidden? 
 - I don't know.

306
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,580
A'Cao, do you know?

307
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,030
If Husband doesn't know,

308
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,940
I wouldn't know at all.

309
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,570
The gold needle is an important evidence of the An woman's treachery.

310
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,810
If you dare to hide it, the entire household is punishable by death.

311
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:56,210
I don't dare to lie. I really don't know.

312
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,070
Don't know?

313
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,480
There are all kinds of tortures in the Court of Judicial Review.

314
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Maybe they will help you remember where the gold needle is.

315
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,530
Perhaps the gold needle...

316
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,770
Perhaps it is with the daughter of the An woman, Liuli.

317
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,190
No.

318
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,170
You can't sacrifice the whole household's lives for one Liuli, right?

319
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,920
That's right.

320
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,580
Teacher's daughter.

321
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,440
How could I have forgotten such an important thing?

322
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,630
Speak! Where is Liuli now?

323
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,820
Former Female Officer An with the Bureau of Imperial Attire plotted treachery.

324
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,110
She has been arrested for treason by the Court of Judicial Review.

325
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,120
The An woman's daughter, Liuli, is an important witness to this case.

326
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,960
Someone has reported that Liuli is making clothes in your manor.

327
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,450
We have been ordered to arrest her, please help us.

328
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,360
Constable, we do not dare to block your investigation.

329
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,820
However, the fourth lady at the Wu Manor is the new Talented Lady conferred by His Majesty.

330
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,000
How can you barge into a noble lady's residence?

331
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,960
Please wait a moment to let us report about this matter.

332
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,680
Alright, go quickly to report. We will wait here.

333
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,170
None of us can bear the responsibily of delaying the Court of Judicial Review's work.

334
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,720
Yes.

335
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,000
Older Brother Pei!

336
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,670
Younger Sister Wu.

337
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,330
I just bid farewell from Madam,

338
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,890
and I was just about to come say goodbye to you.

339
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,470
I've inconvenienced you during the past few days of staying at your manor.

340
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,380
I've already found an inn where exam candidats stay. I'm moving there today.

341
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,170
Please wait, Older Brother Pei, I have something to ask for your help.

342
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,180
Young Sister Wu, what would you like me to do?

343
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,740
Liuli!

344
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,240
Older Sister Wu, has my mother come to pick me up?

345
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,180
Liuli, something bad has happened to your mother.

346
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,600
The constable is already outside our manor to arrest you.

347
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,120
Right now there is nothing more important to save your life.

348
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,190
I have already arranged a man to take you away. You must trust him.

349
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,100
Older Sister Wu, what's happened to my mother?

350
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,870
I beg you, Older Sister Wu.

351
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,490
I only want to be with my mother.

352
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,900
Liuli, listen to me. You are still a child and you can't save your mother.

353
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,120
If you stay here, it will only let you and your mother

354
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,900
both get embroiled into danger. Even know I don't know your mother,

355
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,650
but you told me before that your mother told you

356
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,570
to go to Gaochang to live a free life.

357
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,060
I believe that your moother's biggest wish right now

358
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,480
is definitely for you to stay live and live free.

359
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,240
No, I only want to be with Mother.

360
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,620
You can't barge inside! You can't barge inside!

361
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,020
Hurry and go!

362
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,620
Go! Hurry!

363
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,620
You can't barge inside! You can't barge inside!

364
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,220
You can't barge inside! You can't barge inside!

365
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,170
You can't barge inside!

366
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,670
Greetings, Talented Lady Wu.

367
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,820
This servant really couldn't block these constables.

368
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,430
I heard that the constables from the Court of Judicial Review came to our manor to arrest some criminals.

369
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,330
How can our Wu Manor be connected with some criminals?

370
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,580
Constables, search carefully.

371
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,310
Search every room thoroughly.

372
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,110
It's important to arrest the important witness to this case of treachery.

373
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,390
We can't help but offend Talented Lady.

374
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,620
Please forgive us.

375
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,890
We've searched all the rooms. The criminal wasn't there.

376
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,470
We discovered fresh signs of horseshoes near the backdoor. Shallow on the left, deep on the right.

377
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,840
It seems that someone hurriedly took someone or some baggage in leaving.

378
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,810
- Chase! 
 - Yes.

379
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,040
Liuli, I can only do this much for you.

380
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,500
I hope that you'll stay safe and sound.

381
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
Capture them!

382
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,370
Move aside!

383
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,120
Hurry and catch up to them! Don't let them escape!

384
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,980
Kind person, go ahead and let me down.

385
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,100
The chasers are catching up. I don't want to drag you into this.

386
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,780
I definitely will not drag in Older Sister Wu. Thank you both.

387
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,900
Don't be afraid. I won't abandon you.

388
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,150
Kind person, what is your name?

389
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,680
Saving you is a simple gesture.

390
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,360
Don't mention it. You don't need to worry about it.

391
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,800
No need to know my name either.

392
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,000
Hide right away.

393
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,930
Hurry with the chase!

394
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,540
We must catch up to them. Don't let them get away!

395
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,090
Giddy up!

396
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,850
Chase!

397
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,570
Kind person, thank you.

398
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,530
Catch up!

399
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,760
Sorry.

400
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,200
She is so brave at such a young age.

401
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,830
I couldn't keep you safe.

402
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,990
I can't only hope that you will survive this calamity.

403
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,830
Don't let him get away!

404
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,640
Madam Cao, do you see her clearly?

405
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,730
Who is she?

406
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
She is...

407
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,610
She is the An woman's daughter, Liuli.

408
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,940
Bother mother and daughter are now in my hands.

409
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,880
I just don't believe that I won't find the gold needle.

410
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,040
Take her back first.

411
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,200
We couldn't catch up to that horserider. His face was covered and we couldn't see his face.

412
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,440
When we go back, how do we report to the higher-ups what happened during the arrest?

413
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,100
Wu Manor is rich and powerful.

414
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,760
Their daughter is also a newly conferred noble lady.

415
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,940
It's best that we don't offend them.

416
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,430
Besides, His Majesty means to

417
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,250
keep this pheasant robe case small and manageable.

418
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,010
Only the An woman will be blamed.

419
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,830
Now that this criminal is captured in the street,

420
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,890
we don't need to bother the Wu Manor.

421
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,380
Yes.

422
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,880
Bring her up.

423
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,510
Liuli!

424
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,110
Liuli!

425
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,860
Liuli!

426
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,410
She only fainted.

427
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,900
It's no big deal.

428
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,190
Liuli.

429
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,280
Teacher, are you willing now

430
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,090
to use the Number One Needle and the dressmaking secrets

431
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,440
to exchange with this disciple whose heart is not in the right place?

432
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,280
Once I get what I want,

433
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,720
I will definitely find a way to keep your daughter alive.

434
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,810
Zhuo Jinniang, you've sworn the oath

435
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:39,330
that as long as I am your scapegoat, you won't drag my daughter and other innocent people into this.

436
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,290
I can still remember your voice, but you would reneg so soon?

437
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,680
Are you even a human being?

438
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,990
To become the Number One Needle in the World

439
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,980
and sit in the seat of Attire Expert at the Bureal of Imperial Attire is my life's wish.

440
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,500
Not to mention taking the life of innocent strangers,

441
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,660
I would even sacrifice my own life for it.

442
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,580
You are so dilusional in a frenzy,

443
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,160
you will eventually get your retribution.

444
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,900
Zhuo Jinniang,

445
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,410
we have nothing more to say.

446
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,930
- Liuli, Liuli. 
 - Since Teacher

447
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,470
won't fulfill this disciple's wish,

448
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,970
then don't blame me

449
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,560
for being ruthless.

450
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,750
There are still four hours until sunrise.

451
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,210
Teacher, you still have some time to think it over.

452
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,070
After sunrise, I will come to ask you again.

453
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,410
Teacher, you have no other choice.

454
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,810
If you want to livle, you can only beg me.

455
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,130
Liuli.

456
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,020
Anyone? Anyone there, prison guard?

457
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,960
Anyone there?

458
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,070
Not sleeping in the middle of night, what are you being noisy about?

459
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,850
May I trouble you to ask Sun Decheng from the Courtyard of Misfortune to come here.

460
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,210
I would like to ask him to arrange a good funeral for me,

461
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,260
so that I won't have a bad fate in the next life

462
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,460
and can be reborn in a good family.

463
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,750
For the sake of the gold hairpin, I'll go there for you.

464
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,740
But, Eunuch Sun has an odd temper.

465
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,740
The gold hairpin is mine regardless if he comes or not.

466
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,700
I am dying soon, what's the use of keeping the gold hairpin?

467
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,280
Please go there for me.

468
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,050
It's actually her.

469
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,540
I didn't know that this little girl seeking the devination stick from Buddha

470
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,300
was actually for today's incident.

471
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,820
That day, I kept changing her devination stick,

472
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,540
did I actually help her or hurt her?

473
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,590
Such a smart girl, staying calm during danger,

474
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,740
and could even arrange matters thoroughtfully.

475
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,530
I hope that you will survive this calamity

476
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,200
and come to retrieve the gold needle someday.

477
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,350
Eunuch Sun is here. Say what you want to say quickly.

478
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,430
This is the death row. Once you're in, don't expect to leave here alive.

479
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,690
Don't play any tricks on me.

480
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,400
[Sun Decheng]

481
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,620
Eunuch Sun, I know that

482
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,220
my daughter and I are dying soon.

483
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,010
I beg you.

484
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,970
After we're dead, please

485
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,120
select a good coffin for us,

486
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,700
provide some daily items for burial,

487
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,260
so that we won't live a harsh life

488
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,630
in the netherworld.

489
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,900
As I've accepted your payment,

490
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,190
I will definitely do as you wish.

491
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,200
The Courtyard of Misfortune is the most heartless place,

492
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,540
but it's also a place that most emphasizes rules.

493
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,810
I rely on you then, Eunuch Sun.

494
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,630
Since everything has been talked about, Attendant Sun should leave quickly then.

495
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,960
After all, this is the death row. I can't do my job if you delay too long.

496
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,840
Oh yes, the prisoner next to you just died.

497
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,640
Can you please go ahead and take away the corpse?

498
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,400
It'll save me from running over there to tell you.

499
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,680
That person hasn't totally died.

500
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,970
The Courtyard of Misfortune works on sending dead people off.

501
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,690
But as long they are still breathing, we won't touch them.

502
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,930
- Otherwise it would bring back luck. 
 - But, Attendant Sun...

503
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,270
He will totally die in another two hours.

504
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,100
I'll let my disciples come over to collect the corpse at that time.

505
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,680
[Courtyard of Misfortune]

506
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,200
Master, that prisoner was clearly dead.

507
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,770
Why didn't we go ahead and bring him back?

508
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,430
[Courtyard of Misfortune]

509
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,830
Because, if he dies after another two hours,

510
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,410
two lives can be saved.

511
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,520
- Mother. 
 - Liuli.

512
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,080
Liuli, wake up.

513
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,210
- Mother. 
 - Liuli.

514
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,870
Mother.

515
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,770
Liuli.

516
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,900
Mother, Older Sister Wu said that you were in trouble.

517
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,290
I was so worried.

518
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,540
Mother is fine.

519
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,660
Mother, where are we?

520
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,080
I want to go home.

521
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:14,170
Liuli, be good, don't be afraid.

522
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,510
Every word that Mother is going to tell you,

523
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,540
you must remember it well.

524
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,430
Sun Decheng from the Courtyard of Misfortune looks cold but is warmhearted.

525
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,910
He is a good person, and he will save you.

526
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:32,260
From now on, you must listen to him.

527
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,450
Do you understand?

528
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:40,080
From now on, no matter what problems you run into,

529
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,180
you must be courageous and strong.

530
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,360
No matter how difficult or how harsh it is,

531
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,340
you must live on.

532
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,180
When you grow up, you must find a way to leave the palace

533
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,520
and live a free life.

534
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,850
Eunuch Sun will help you.

535
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,310
You must remember this,

536
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,430
don't ever try to revenge for me.

537
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:13,310
Remember this, Mother only wants you to be safe,

538
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,640
and grow up happily.

539
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,090
and live a life of happiness and freedom.

540
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,590
Understand?

541
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,060
Mother, why are you saying these things to me?

542
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,360
I only want to be with Mother. I only want to stay with Mother

543
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,940
and live a happy and free life.

544
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,670
Liuli.

545
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,810
You must remember what Mother said.

546
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,170
Mother, I only want to be with you.

547
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,910
I will listen to what you say from now on.

548
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,860
Please don't leave me behind.

549
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,380
Liuli.
