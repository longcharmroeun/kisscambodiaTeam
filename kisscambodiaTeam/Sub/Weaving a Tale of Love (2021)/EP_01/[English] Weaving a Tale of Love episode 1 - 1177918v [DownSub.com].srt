Greetings, esteemed customers. I am the owner of the Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

The shop is small and simple. I hope you are not slighted.

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,640
I've heard about the dresses made by your store. Not only is the embroidery exquisite,

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,500

 [Madam An]

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,010
The wedding gown I want not only has to adhere to the etiquette rules in the palace,

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,090
but it also cannot follow the stale traditional style and look dull.

22
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,910
It must be auspicious and opulent,

23
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,780
but it cannot be vulgar and old-fashioned.

24
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,400
It must be restrained, not intentional,

25
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,060
but show creativity in its minute details.

26
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,350
It must charm anyone who sees it and leave an unforgettable impression.

a light punishment may be just a beating,

Could it be the rumor in the palace is true?

Even though our small shop's clothes are considered high quality in the market place,

68
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,250

Don't worry. As long as my daughter is pleased with the auspicious gown,

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,280
It's really because our dressmaker has limited ability in making clothes.

If my mother is willing to make Older Sister's wedding gown,

Older Sister will definitely become the most beautiful bride in the entire Chang'an.

you decline because you look down at our payment.

Instead, they will only say that you have limited abilities and can only make common clothes.

92
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,170
If esteemed customers don't mind, Older Brother, you can let me give it a try.

93
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,410
It's just that if my skill cannot be acceptable to esteemed customers,

94
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,740
it's because I have inadequate ability.

95
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,370
Please don't drag down Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's reputation at that time.

96
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,390
This is the first time I've seen such a cautious shop.

Attire Chief,

103
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,930
this servant has seen you looking worried these days.

104
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,980
Are you worried about Consort Yang's pending ascension to become the empress?

105
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,990
Consort Yang's status is awkward. The inner palace also always emphasizes people's respectability by rank.

106
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,310
We used to be neglectful toward her.

107
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,070
Now, it appears that Consort Yang will become the leader of the inner palace.

108
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,920
Our Bureau of Imperial Attire's future is...

109
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,670
This servant has an idea.

110
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,180
It just might please Consort Yang,

111
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,790
so that she won't blame you for past grievances.

112
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,170
What is the idea?

113
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,330
Immediately prepare for Consort Yang

114
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,360
a pheasant robe worn for the conferral of empress ceremony.

115
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,030
A pheasant robe?

116
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,290
But, so far it is just a rumor that Consort Yang will become the empress.

117
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,040
His Majesty has not sent a decree to announce it to the court and the inner palace.

118
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,690
If the Bureau of Imperial Attire prepares a pheasant robe for Consort Yang now,

119
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,730
if the responsibility is tracked down later, it is a serious crime of transgression.

120
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,350
It is precisely because the decree hasn't been issued

121
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,720
that it shows how thoughtful the Bureau of Imperial Attire is in handling matters,

122
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,160
and that we are loyal to the new empress.

123
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,910
This way, the new empress will remember how good you are, Attire Chief.

124
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,400
As soon as the decree to confer the new empress is issued, making the pheasant robe

125
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,630
will become the task for our Bureau of Imperial Attire.

126
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,550
Who will even care about forgiving past grievances?

127
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,000
This servant believes this is the best opportunity for our bureau.

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,540
If we don't do it now,

129
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,130
when will we do it?

130
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,930
You are always quiet every day,

131
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,830
but you have good ideas at the most critical moments.

132
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,770
What you say makes sense.

133
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,130
Too bad that the "Number One Needle in the World" Attire Expert An left the palace many years ago.

134
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,460
Who can be in charge of the pheasant robe for the empress now?

135
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,690
This servant Zhuo Jinniang will volunteer

136
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,220
to do this work for Attire Chief.

137
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,400
You?

138
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,120
I am the only disciple of "Number One Needle in the World" Attire Expert An.

139
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,160
A few years ago, after my teacher resigned from her position at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

140
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,230
her whereabouts are still unknown,

141
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,630
the only one who can make the pheasant robe for the empress

142
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,400
is me, the only disciple who was personally taught by Attire Expert An.

143
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,750
It's a formidable job to sew the pheasant robe for the empress.

144
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,910
Are you perfectly certain about it?

145
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,340
This servant is confident.

146
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,760
I will let you. If, this time,

147
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,610
the pheasant robe you make can please the new empress,

148
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,230
I will definitely help you get promoted

149
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,720
to be Attire Expert.

150
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,650

 [Young Shanhu]

155
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,490
Older Sister, your embroidery skill has reached such a miraculous stage.

156
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,560
Your mother even lied that she has never taught you.

157
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,990
I am going to ask my father for justice.

158
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,810
Young Sister, don't be mistaken.

159
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,550
Indeed, my mother has never taught me.

160
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,330
I secretly learned it.

161
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,710
Don't fool me.

162
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,630
How can you secretly learn to have such fine skill?

163
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,630
This is nothing special. If my mother didn't forbid me to use needles and threads,

164
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,410
and she also knows exactly how many needles there are in the needle case,

165
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,390
I wouldn't have stolen a blunt-tipped needle which hurts my craft.

166
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,310
Are you talking about that gold needle,

167
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,730
the token that symbolizes your mother as the number one in the world?

168
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,890
Even though that gold needle is pretty, but it's a blunt-tipped needle and not easy to use.

169
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,810
But, it's the only needle that my mother won't frequently check.

170
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,390
So I can only make do with it.

171
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,080
If you want to learn, I can teach you.

172
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,220
But, you must not tell my mother.

173
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,640
You will really teach me?

174
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,400
Why not?

175
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Older Sister, if you really mean it, then give that camellia silk handkerchief to me.

176
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,830
If you go back on your word later,

177
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,580
I will show this handkerchief to your mother and my father,

178
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,350
let them punish you. How's that?

179
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,290
All right then. Since you want it,

180
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,670
I will give it to you.

181
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,570
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

182
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,650
Attire Chief, the pheasant robe for the new empress is completed.

183
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,270
Attire Chief, please inspect it

184
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,350
to check for any imperfections.

185
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,580
Attire Chief, are you dissatisfied with the pheasant robe I made?

186
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,450
You are "Number One Needle in the World" Attire Expert An's only disciple?

187
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,930
How did you not learn

188
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,590
even a tenth of your teacher's skill?

189
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,040
Back then, the pheasant robe that Expert An made for Empress Zhangsun,

190
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,670
after all these years,

191
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,500
it is still memorable to people who had seen it. But you?

192
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,230
It's like mud compared to clouds.

193
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,010
Yes.

194
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,640
Too bad that Attire Expert An wished to live outside the palace.

195
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,080
She found a chance to plea for Empress Zhangsun to let her leave the palace those years ago.

196
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,490
From then on, there has never been anyone in the palace who could surpass Expert An's exquisite needle craft.

197
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,190
Attire Chief, I will do my best to fix it.

198
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,550
Do your best! Do your best! Is this all you can say?

199
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,050
Zhuo Jinniang, I think your hard work

200
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,080
cannot make up for inadequate talent, and you can't handle any important work.

201
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,440
I think it's useless for you to keep fixing it.

202
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,650
It will only waste time for nothing.

203
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,910
The only way to save the Bureau of Imperial Attire now

204
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,490
is to find your teacher.

205
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,430
Ask her to come back and modifiy this pheasant roble for the new empress.

206
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,070
B-But...

207
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,050
my teacher left the palace many years ago.

208
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,740
Besides, she has disappeared. How can I find her?

209
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,330
This is a question for you, the only disciple of hers.

210
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,210
I just don't believe that, after all these years,

211
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,100
you don't have even a single bit of her news?

212
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,320
Attire Chief... I...

213
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,700
Don't think that I don't understand your sneaky mind.

214
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,600
You are afraid that your teacher will come back,

215
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,720
and you will be further and further away from the Attire Expert's position.

216
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,950
I'm warning you, Zhuo Jinniang.

217
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,260
This is not the time to be clever.

218
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,030
The Attire Expert's position is good, but you have to have the fate to be in it.

219
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,760
If you can't make a pheasant robe that pleases the new empress,

220
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,580
you can be convicted at the least with the inability to fulfill your duty, or more seriously,

221
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,680
the crime of disrespecting the new empress.

222
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,570
At that time, you will lose your head!

223
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,880
I...

224
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,640
Find your teacher, or lose your head.

225
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,340
You choose.

226
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,850
I told you, I am Attire Expert's old acquaintance and I have an urgent request. 
[Kudi Residence]

227
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,030
This is how you treat guests at the Kudi Residence?

228
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,930
I've already told you, we don't have any Attire Expert An here.

229
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,690
Make way.

230
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,800
You can't go inside!

231
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,710
You realy can't go inside.

232
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,960
I am a female officer in the palace. How dare a lowly servant like you grab me. Let go of me.

233
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,460
This servant doesn't dare to offend a female officer, but this is a private residence.

234
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,590
We really don't have who you are looking for. Please be understanding.

235
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,600
I've run around all day, and my legs are almost broken from walking.

236
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
If I weren't totally sure, I wouldn't have come here.

237
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,860
Don't fool me.

238
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:08,720
♫  The world in April will be at its fullest  ♫

239
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,740
♫  The mountain temple is in full bloom  ♫

240
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:22,630
♫  The constant regret in spring is everlasting  ♫

241
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,750
♫  Don't know how it has turned out this way  ♫

242
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,220
Disciple Zhuo Jinniang greets Master.

243
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,740
It's been many years. How is Master?

244
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,680
Since it's been many years,

245
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,840
why have you suddenly come here to disturb my peace?

246
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,830
A'Ye, Liuli is still playing outside. She'll probably come back soon.

247
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,640
Go find her and tell her to come back a little later.

248
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,890
Don't let her bother my nostalgic chat with an old friend.

249
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,610
Yes.

250
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,060
Master, you are really observant.

251
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,110
To be honest, the ceremony to confer the new empress is coming up soon.

252
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,320
Attire Chief Lin entrusted this disciple with the important task of making the pheasant robe for the new empress.

253
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,090
Too bad that this disciple is incapable.

254
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,730
The pheasant robe that I made displeases Attire Chief Lin.

255
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,810
Therefore, I especially came today to beg Master

256
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,370
to save me, save the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

257
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,990
Help this disciple modify the pheasant robe.

258
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,740
Have you forgotten?

259
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,920
I left the palace years ago upon Empress Zhangsun's benevolent permission.

260
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,050
From then on, nothing with the palace or the Bureau of Imperial Attire concerns me.

261
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,820
Excuse me for not being able to help.

262
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,000
The one who permitted you to leave the palace

263
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,940
was the late empress.

264
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,540
But now, the inner palace will get a new leader.

265
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,560
If the new empress is dissatisfied with the pheasant robe that this disciple makes,

266
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,910
then... this disciple can't help

267
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,110
but let the new empress remember Master.

268
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,500
The new empress is well aware of Master's outstanding skill.

269
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,960
At that time, the new empress will issue an edict

270
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,310
to order Master to enter the palace to work.

271
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,600
At that time, if Master disobeys the decree,

272
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,570
it will be a crime punishable by death.

273
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,560
Zhuo Jinniang, are you threatening me?

274
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,990
This disciple wouldn't dare.

275
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,800
This disciple is only explaining the realities to Master.

276
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,370
As long as Master can help this disciple make a pheasant robe that pleases the new empress,

277
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,910
all of the troubles will be avoided.

278
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,640
You can continue to say among the civilians and live your carefree life.

279
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,320
This disciple will definitely

280
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,400
not tell anyone of Master's whereabouts.

281
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,060
Master, just now,

282
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,190
this disciple seemed to hear you talk to a maid

283
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,240
about a girl named Liuli.

284
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,060
It sounds like a girl's name.

285
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,540
Could she be Master's daughter?

286
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,860
Master, even if you don't consider for yourself,

287
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,290
you should consider your family members.

288
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,340
We haven't seen each other for ten years, but your words

289
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,760
have become more fierce, and especially vicious.

290
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,480
As it is now, it's useless to talk more.

291
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,790
I only have one request.

292
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,550
If you promise, then I'll agree to modify the pheasant robe.

293
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,400
Master, please say it.

294
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,830
Don't tell anyone that I have a daughter.

295
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,010
This disciple swears that I will not mention it to anyone.

296
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,660
If I break this oath, I will be hit by Heaven and struck by lightning.

297
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,100
This is good.

298
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,240
Leave the pheasant robe that you made here.

299
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,220
Come to get it seven days later. I will fix it well.

300
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,800
I have something else to remind you.

301
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,570
If you want to sit in the seat of Attire Expert at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

302
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,550
then never mention me to the new empress.

303
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,210
This pheasant robe is totally made by you alone.

304
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,840
Thank you, Master, then this disciple will bid you farewell.

305
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,190
Seven days later, I shall return to visit you.

306
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,780
I won't walk you out then.

307
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,240
Master, I have another unreasonable request that I beg you to agree to.

308
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,030
Master, will you transfer the token that represents "Number One Needle" to this disciple?

309
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,010
If I have this gold needle in my hand, then I can rightfully

310
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,840
become the Attire Expert at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

311
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,990
If I can sit in the seat of the Attire Expert, it will be Master's honor.

312
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,960
It will also be our sect's honor. Please fulfill my wish, Master.

313
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,460
"The valley is too deep to fill, what's the use of one needle?" (She is not talented.)

314
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,190
Liuli!

315
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,880
This gold needle is only a status symbol. It cannot be used to sew or embroider.

316
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,800
Tell Mom, what were you doing sneaking out with it?

317
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,110
Mother, you forbid me to use needles and threads.

318
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,480
I couldn't help but suddenly wanted to sew a handkerchief.

319
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,420
I thought this one needle would be the only one that Mother won't check.

320
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,910
That's why I took it.

321
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,060
Mother, I did wrong. I shouldn't have secretly taken the gold needle.

322
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,190
Are you saying that you took this gold needle to embroider the handkerchief?

323
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,900
Where is the handkerchief? Let me see.

324
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,940
Liuli did wrong. Please don't be angry, Mother.

325
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,420
This gold needle is blunt-tipped.

326
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,910
But you actually embroidered such a beautiful handkerchief.

327
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,880
You...

328
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,870
How many times have I told you?

329
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,660
Don't learn sewing! Dont learn embroidery! Why won't you listen?

330
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,770
Why do you make me angry?

331
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,200
Why?

332
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,290
Why can Shanhu learn sewing and embroidery,

333
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,150
and her mother won't scold her and hit her, and even begs Mother to teach her?

334
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,290
All the other girls have to learn needlework.

335
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,440
Why am I the only one who can't?

336
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,860
Learning to sew and embroider is not bad.

337
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,980
Of course, sewing and embroidery are not bad.

338
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,890
But, a common person isn't guilty, yet a common person with a jade is guilty.

339
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:03,600
An outstanding skill in sewing is that jade. My daughter,

340
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,490
can you understand it?

341
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,470
Back then, when I left the palace,

342
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,940
it was because of my skill

343
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,500
that I was helplessly involved in the life-or-death battles inside the palace.

344
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,740
I didn't want to participle in those battles.

345
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,720
I further didn't want to become

346
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,470
the tool used by those people to fight.

347
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,670
Mother.

348
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,380
My daughter.

349
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,910
The more endowed you are with this talent,

350
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,850
the more worried that I am.

351
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,430
I am really scared.

352
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,750
I am so scared!

353
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,460
[Young Pei Xingjian]

354
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,610
This is my entry permit.

355
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,400
[Su Dingfang]

356
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,290
Welcome, General Su.

357
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,580
General Su?

358
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,350
That is the renowned meritorious General Su Dingfang.

359
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,360
Amitabha, you've endured an arduous journey, General.

360
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,680
It's been a year. How is your health, Buddhist Master?

361
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,610
General, don't worry. For our annual chess game,

362
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,490
I will stay healthy and strong.

363
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,700
- Please. 
 - Please. 
 - General!

364
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,210
General Su, please wait!

365
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,770
General Su.

366
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,720
I am Pei Xingjian, with courtesy name Shouyue.

367
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,550
I have long admired General Su. Please accept me as your disciple.

368
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,480
I don't take in disciples. Go on home.

369
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,250
I have studied martial training for many years, in the hope that one day

370
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,670
I could become a brave warrior like General Su to guard our land.

371
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,970
You said you've studied martial training for many years.

372
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,010
I'll test you a little then.

373
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,450
That camilla tree is blooming now.

374
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,380
If you can shoot down that tallest and most beautiful camilla flower with one arrow,

375
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,220
then I will consider accepting you as a disciple.

376
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,720
I will let you take five steps.

377
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,590
It's too close.

378
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,050
General.

379
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,330
This camilla flower is embroidered so beautifully that it appeared to be the real flower.

380
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,670
Young Master Pei's archery skill is excellent. Will General give him another chance?

381
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,000
I asked you to shoot down the most beautiful camilla flower, but you shot down a handkerchief.

382
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,560
Even though it's understandable, but we are not fated to become master and disciple.

383
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,890
You should go back.

384
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,280
General Su, I came to Chang'an this time to participate in the imperial exam.

385
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,490
But my lifetime dream is to become a general riding a horse and wielding a blade to secure Great Tang's boarders

386
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,630
in order to protect the people to avoid harm from family separations and chaos.

387
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,480
I just entered the city and accidentally encountered General.

388
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,660
I think this is actually fate. It's meant by Heaven's will.

389
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,900
General, look at the camilla tree.

390
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,100
There are hundreds of flowers on it.

391
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,880
But he shot down the one and only fake flower.

392
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,170
Whether this is fate or not fate,

393
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,630
who can really tell the difference?

394
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,590
Since Buddhist Master has spoken, I'll give you another chance.

395
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,870
I will be here for the next few days. Perhaps it's just one day,

396
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,040
or three, or five days.

397
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,160
If we are really fated to meet again,

398
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,290
then the fate is certain.

399
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,270
However, let me tell you,

400
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,860
you cannot step inside the temple at all.

401
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,890
- Please. 
 - Respectfully say goodbye to General.

402
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,570
Thank you, Buddhist Master, for saying a good word for me.

403
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,360
Then, based on what you're saying,

404
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,390
we still don't know it will be fortune or disaster after you fix the pheasant robe for the new empress.

405
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,150
There won't be fortune.

406
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,750
As long as there is no disaster, it will be a blessing from the ancestors.

407
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,800
Older Sister's status as the Number One Needle in the World

408
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,020
never brought any benefit to the Kudi family.

409
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,060
Now, it even endangers our entire family of old and young.

410
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,180
It's no big deal that we suffer,

411
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,280
but the good reputation of Kudi family's ancestors

412
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,580
should not be allowed any damage.

413
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,790
Husband, please think of an idea.

414
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,780
As things are now, you don't need to prattle.

415
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,560
Don't just talk. Let's think of a solution fast.
 [Madam Cao]

416
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,850
I do have an idea, but if I tell you, 
 [Kudi Yanzhong]

417
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,510
Older Sister and Husband, please don't blame me.

418
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,200
Why are you holding back at a time like this? Hurry and tell us.

419
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,820
Husband, please write a divorce letter for Older Sister in advance.

420
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,860
What nonsense are you saying?

421
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,550
Husband, please let me explain.

422
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,110
Older Sister, please don't blame me as coldhearted.

423
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,450
I am only doing this for the whole family's sake.

424
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,240
Even if Older Sister can stand dragging down the entire family,

425
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,410
you would at least feel for your own daughter, Liuli.

426
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,970
Writing the divorce letter is just for in case. In case of Consort Yang isn't chosen as the empress,

427
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,400
Husband can show people the divorce letter that's written today,

428
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,120
and totally disassociate involvement with Older Sister.

429
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,500
This way, you can protect the whole family.

430
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,630
A'Cao seems to make sense.

431
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,570
This is just for in case. If we get through this problem, our family can still be—

432
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,780
Husband, you need not say more.

433
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,500
A'Cao really has a good scheme.

434
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,420
Good trick.

435
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,610
Husband, go ahead and write the divorce letter to break up our relationship.

436
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,840
It will be the best evidence for Husband

437
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,210
to prove your innocence later.

438
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,300
A'Cao is vicious.

439
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,860
Husband is selfish and cowardly.

440
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,330
Liuli, Liuli.

441
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,120
I don't care about staying alive.

442
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,430
But you are the one I worry the most about.

443
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,120
I must make an appropriate arrangement for you.

444
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,640
You have such a talent for dressmaking.

445
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,790
This is also fate.

446
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:07,370
It is time for me to transfer the unique dressmaking skill to you,

447
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,890
so that you have the skill to make a living.

448
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,470
This robe wasn't made by Mother.

449
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,740
How did you know that I didn't make it.

450
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,790
The birds that Mother embroider are alive and can fly.

451
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,920
Not like these. They don't look lively.

452
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,070
Liuli is right.

453
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,960
This robe, made by someone else, isn't satisfactory.

454
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,940
That's why they asked me to modify it for them.

455
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,280
Mother, are you going to make these birds come alive?

456
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,090
If these birds can be alive,

457
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,110
will they become noisy?

458
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,990
Mother, I have a solution.

459
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,860
How about embroidering a big bird?

460
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,660
Let them have a mother to watch over them.

461
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,130
My daughter, you have such a great talent.

462
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,380
I really don't know if it will be fortunate or disastrous.

463
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:27,510
Liuli, I will take you to stay in a safe place for a few days, all right?

464
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,250
Mother, where are you sending me to?

465
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,230
Don't you want to learn dressmaking with me?

466
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,190
If you are good,

467
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,240
I will teach you the skills.

468
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,580
Mother, you will really teach me?

469
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,790
Mother, can't you teach me at home?

470
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,070
The place I'm sending you to is a good place.

471
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,330
When you go there, you can make clothes for other people, just like mother does.

472
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,990
Mother, can't you go with me?

473
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,580
Greetings, Madam Yang. Greetings, Talented Lady Wu.

474
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,960
I impudently came to your residence so that Madam Yang and Talented Lady Wu

475
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,030
can personally inspect the auspicious gown that our shop has carefully made.

476
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,930
So quickly done?

477
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,150
Hurry and show me.

478
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,540
This is the auspicious gown that Ruyi Resist Dye Shop made for Talented Lady Wu.

479
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,150
Please view it, Madam Yang and Talented Lady Wu.

480
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,260
The peach tree is full of young sprouts. How brilliantly bright are the flowers!  
 [Tao Yao, Ode to Peach Blossom]

481
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,380
This young lady is going to marry. How fitting she will be at her future home!

482
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,120
Embroidering the poem into the silk, turning it into clothes.

483
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,040
It is indeed new and creative. It is not shallow.

484
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,220
This Ode to Peach Blossom is also very approriate.

485
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,550
Even though this Ode to Peach Blossom has a good meaning,

486
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,380
but the auspicious gown is embroidered only with one peach flower.

487
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,810
Isn't it too lonely, not as lively for a celebratory event?

488
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,720
If it is embroidered with a tree of peach flowers,

489
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,930
full of peach blossom's splendor, that's how an auspicious gown should present.

490
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,000
Could it be that you deliberately cut the work to neglect us?

491
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,520
Replying to Madam, a tree of blooming flowers may look lively,

492
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,190
but there is no clear difference between the primary and secondary themes.

493
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,590
It won't make it unforgettable to the viewers.

494
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,060
Even though there is only one peach flower on this auspicious gown,

495
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,970
it is the fruit of exquisite craftsmanship.

496
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,320
It symbolizes one rising up among the many.

497
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,530
It will let all the viewers linger and find it unforgettable.

498
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,040
One rising up among the many...

499
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,300
Well said!

500
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,350
In the inner palace where there are as many beauties as the clouds,

501
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,350
don't any of the concubines want to be one rising up among many?

502
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,140
Servants, bring the reward.

503
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,330
Madam, wait.

504
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,770
The collar and the sleeves on this auspicious gown

505
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,870
still need to be modified to be more fitting

506
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,940
according to Talented Lady's body.

507
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,020
My mother ordered me to stay in your residence for a few days

508
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,690
to do the finetuning work according to Talent Lady's measurements.

509
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,600
Once the auspicious gown is completed, and Madam and Talented Lady are satisfied,

510
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,070
at that time, Liuli will kneel to thank Madam's reward.

511
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,000
You?

512
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,480
You are still such a young child.

513
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,260
No matter how outstanding your mother's skill is,

514
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,400
how can I believe that a baby can make clothes?

515
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,200
Madam, don't look down at me. Such a small task

516
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,220
is easy to me.

517
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,920
This child...

518
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,020
Madam, don't underestimate this child.

519
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,850
She is the daughter of Number One Needle in the World.

520
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,540
She has been personally taught by her mother.

521
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,480
Madam An finished the major parts of this gown.

522
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,260
The child can totally take on the wrapping-up work.

523
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,580
That day, the one who took my measurements,

524
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,750
was the famous Number One Needle in the World?

525
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,690
Precisely.

526
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,280
- Why don't we— 
 - In that case,

527
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,650
just let this child stay in our manor then.

528
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,250
I also want to see her skills.

529
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:15,820
If you do a good job to finish the auspicious gown, I will reward you handsomely.

530
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,260
If you make a mistake, I will also punish you harshly. Are you afraid?

531
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,550
Such a small task is nothing difficult.

532
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,530
Madam Yang and Talented Lady Wu, please wait to see it.

533
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,140
Liuli, from this moment on, everything I say,

534
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,100
you must remember it well.

535
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,840
Tomorrow, I will ask Uncle to take you to the Wu Manor. Stay there for seven days

536
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,150
to mend the auspicious gown for Miss Wu.

537
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,520
Mother, are you really letting me use the needle?

538
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,060
This is my insight from many years of dressmaking.

539
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,020
I'm giving it to you.

540
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,950
When you are in the Wu Manor, remember everything thoroughly in your head.

541
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,030
After that, burn it. You must do it.

542
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,200
You must not show anyone else the dressmaking secrets in it.

543
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,680
Remember what I said.

544
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,160
This gold needle was bestowed to me

545
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,140
by His Majesty and the late empress.

546
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,330
It is a token that symbolizes Number One Needle in the World.

547
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,960
I am giving it to you. In the future,

548
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,280
you will safeguard it.

549
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,350
After seven days, Mother will come personally to pick you up.

550
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,580
After seven days, if it's someone else that comes to pick you up, you must not come back here.

551
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,830
At that time, beg Talented Lady Wu to send you to a nunnery

552
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,940
to seek sheltering from Buddha.

553
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,530
Don't tell anyone

554
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,490
that you are the daughter of Number One Needle in the World. Understand?

555
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,040
No, Mother, I don't want to go to the Wu Manor to mend the auspicious gown.

556
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,890
I also don't want to live there for seven days. I don't want to leave Mother!

557
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,460
Liuli, you must listen to Mother this time.

558
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,500
What I'm doing is for your safety. Understand?

559
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,270
Mother...

560
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,430
Mother...

561
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,780
I promise you.

562
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,600
After seven days, I will come for you.

563
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,510
Mother.

564
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,950
Mother!

565
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,320
Mother!
