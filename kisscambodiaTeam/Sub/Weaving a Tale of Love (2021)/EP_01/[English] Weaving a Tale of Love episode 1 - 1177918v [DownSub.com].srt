Greetings, esteemed customers. I am the owner of the Ruyi Resist Dye Shop.

8
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,800
The shop is small and simple, hope you are not slighted. 
 [Young Liuli]

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,640
I've heard about the dresses made by your store. Not only is the embroidery exquisite,

10
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,500
the design is particularly new and unique. 
 [Wu Yuanhua]

11
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,160
It's quite popular among the ladies in the officials and merchants' household,

12
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,560
so that it's difficult to obtain a dress.

13
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,050
My mother and I came here today to custom order

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,310

Please rest assured, esteemed customers. I am not boasting,

16

Don't promise too much, shopkeeper.

How do you know that I will definitely be satisfied? 
 [Madam An]

20
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,010
The wedding gown I want not only has to adhere to the etiquette rules in the palace,

21
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,090
but it also cannot follow the stale traditional style and look dull.

22
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,910
It must be auspicious and opulent,

23
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,780
but it cannot be vulgar and old-fashioned.

24
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,400
It must be restrained, not intentional,

25
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,060
but shows creativity in its minute details.

26
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,350
It must charm anyone who sees it and leave an unforgettable impression.

Each of the embroidered item in your hands is at least as important as your own life.

a light punishment may be just a beating,

36
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,290
but a heavy punishment will cost your life.

37
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,740

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,960
it is a blessing that Ruyi Resist Dye Shop can't even beg for.

Even though our small shop's clothes are considered high quality in the market place,

67
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,250

I can't help but decline.

74
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,280
It's really because our dressmaker has limited ability in making clothes.

My mother's skill is peerless in the world, and her also has the kindest heart.

Older Sister will definitely become the most beautiful bride in the entire Chang'an.

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,840
I'm afraid no one will say that

89

you decline because you look down at our payment.

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,550
Instead, they will only say that you have limited abilitlies and can only make common clothes.

91
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,170
If esteemed customers don't mind, Older Brother, you can let me give it a try.

92
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,410
It's just that, if my skill cannot be acceptable to esteemed customers,

93
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,740
it's because I have insufficient ability,

94
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,370
please don't drag down Ruyi Resist Dye Shop's reputation at that time.

95
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,390
This is the first time I've seen such a cautious shop.

96
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,590
Go ahead and do it. As long as you put your whole heart into it,

This servant has seen you looking worried these days.

103
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,980
Are you worried about Consort Yang's pending ascension to become the empress?

104
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,990
Consort Yang's status is awkward. The inner palace also always emphasizes people's respectability by ranks.

105
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,310
We used to be neglectful toward her.

106
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,070
Now, it appears that Consort Yang will become the leader of the inner palace.

107
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,920
Our Bureau of Imperial Attire's future is...

108
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,670
This servant has an idea.

109
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,180
It just might please Consort Yang,

110
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,790
so that she won't blame you for past grievances.

111
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,170
What is the idea?

112
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,330
Immediately prepare for Consort Yang

113
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,360
a pheasant robe worn for the conferral of empress ceremony.

114
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,030
A pheasant robe?

115
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,290
But, so far it is just a rumor that Consort Yang will become the empress.

116
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,040
His Majesty has not sent a decree to announce it to the court and the inner palace.

117
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,690
If the Bureau of Imperial Attire prepares a pheasant robe for Consort Yang now,

118
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,730
if the responsibility is tracked down later, it is a serious crime of transgression.

119
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,350
It is precisely because the decree hasn't been issued

120
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,720
that it shows how thoughtfulness the Bureau of Imperial Attire is in handling matters,

121
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,160
and that we are loyal to the new empress.

122
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,910
This way, the new empress will remember how good you are, Attire Chief.

123
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,400
As soon as the decree to confer the new empress is issued, making the pheasant robe

124
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,630
will become the task for our Bureau of Imperial Attire.

125
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,550
Who will even care about forgiving past grievances?

126
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,000
This servant believes this is the best opportunity for our bureau.

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,540
If we don't do it now,

128
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,130
when will we do it?

129
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,930
You are always quiet every day,

130
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,830
but you have good ideas at important moments.

131
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,770
What you say makes sense.

132
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,130
Too bad that the "Number One Needle in the World" Attire Officer An left the palace many years ago.

133
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,460
Who can be in charge of the pheasant robe for the empress now?

134
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,690
This servant Zhuo Jinniang will volunteer

135
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,220
to do this work for Attire Chief.

136
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,400
You?

137
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,120
I am the only disciple of "Number One Needle in the World" Attire Officer An.

138
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,160
A few years ago, after my teacher resigned her position at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

139
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,230
her whereabouts is still unknown,

140
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,630
the only one who can make the pheasant robe for the empress

141
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,400
is me, the only disciple who was personally taught by Attire Officer An.

142
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,750
It's a formidable job to sew the pheasant robe for the empress.

143
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,910
Are you perfectly certain about it?

144
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,340
This servant is confident.

145
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,760
I will let you. If, this time,

146
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,610
the pheasant robe you make can please the new empress,

147
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,230
I will definitely help you get promoted

148
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,720
to be Attire Officer.

149
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,650

Liuli! 
 [Shanhu]

154
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,490
Older Sister, your embroidery skill has reached such a miraculous stage.

155
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,560
Your mother even lied that she has never taught you.

156
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,990
I am going to ask my father for justice.

157
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,810
Young Sister, don't be mistaken.

158
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,550
Indeed, my mother has never taught me.

159
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,330
I secretly learned it.

160
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,710
Don't fool me.

161
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,630
How can you secretly learned to have such fine skill?

162
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,630
This is nothing special. If my mother didn't forbid me to use needles and threads,

163
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,410
and she also knows exactly how many needles there are in the needle case,

164
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,390
I wouldn't have stolen a blunt-tipped needle which hurts my craft.

165
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,310
Are you talking about that gold needle,

166
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,730
the token that symbolizes your mother as the number one in the world?

167
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,890
Even though that gold needle is pretty, but it's a blunt-tipped needle and not easy to use.

168
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,810
But, it's the only needle that my mother won't frequently check.

169
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,390
So I can only make do with it.

170
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,080
If you want to learn, I can teach you.

171
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,220
But, you must not tell my mother.

172
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,640
You will really teach me?

173
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,400
Why not?

174
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Older Sister, if you really mean it, then give me that camellia silk handkerchief to me.

175
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,830
If you go back on your word later,

176
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,580
I will show this handkerchief to your mother and my father.

177
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,350
Let them punish you. How's that?

178
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,290
Alright then. Since you want it,

179
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,670
I will give it to you.

180
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,570
[Bureau of Imperial Attire]

181
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,650
Attire Chief, the pheasant robe for the new empress is completed.

182
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,270
Attire Chief, please inspect it

183
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,350
to check for any imperfections.

184
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,580
Attire Chief, are you dissatisfied with the pheasant robe I made?

185
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,450
You are "Number One Needle in the World" Officer An's only disciple?

186
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,930
How did you not learn

187
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,590
even a tenth of your teacher's skill?

188
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,040
Back then, the pheasant robe that Officer An made for Empress Zhangsun,

189
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,670
after all these years,

190
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,500
it is still memorable to people who had seen it. But you?

191
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,230
It's like mud compared to cloud.

192
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,010
Yes.

193
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,640
Too bad that Attire Officer An wished to live outside the palace.

194
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,080
She found a chance to plea for Empress Zhangsun to let her leave the palace those years ago.

195
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,490
From then on, there has never been anyone in the palace who could surpass Officer An's exquisite needle craft.

196
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,190
Attire Chief, I will do my best to fix it.

197
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,550
Do your best! Do your best! Is this all you can say?

198
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,050
Zhuo Jinniang, i think your hard work

199
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,080
cannot make up for insufficient talent, and you can't handle any important work.

200
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,440
I think it's useless for you to keep fixing it.

201
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,650
It will only waste time for nothing.

202
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,910
The only way to save the Bureau of Imperial Attire now

203
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,490
is to find your teacher.

204
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,430
Ask her to come back and modifiy this pheasant roble for the new empress.

205
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,070
B-But,

206
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,050
my teacher left the palace many years ago.

207
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,740
Besides, she has disappeared. How can I find her?

208
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,330
This is a question for you, the only disciple of hers.

209
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,210
I just don't believe that, during all these years,

210
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,100
you don't have even a single bit of her news?

211
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,320
Attire Chief...

212
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,700
Don't think that I don't understand your sneaky mind.

213
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,600
You are afraid that your teacher will come back,

214
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,720
and you will be further and further away from the Attire Officer's position.

215
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,950
I'm warning you, Zhuo Jinniang.

216
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,260
This is not the time to be clever.

217
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,030
The Attire Officer's position is good, but you have to have the fate to be in it.

218
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,760
If you can't make a pheasant robe that pleases the new empress,

219
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,580
you can be convicted at the least with the inability to fulfill your duty, or more seriously,

220
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,680
the crime of disrespecting the new empress.

221
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,570
At that time, you will lose your head!

222
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,880
I...

223
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,640
Find your teacher, or lose your head,

224
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,340
you choose.

225
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,850
I told you, I am Attire Officer's old acquaintance and I have an urgent request. 
[Kudi Residence]

226
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,030
This is how you treat guests at the Kudi Residence?

227
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,930
I've already told you, we don't have any Attire Officer An here.

228
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,690
Make way.

229
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,800
You can't go inside!

230
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,710
You realy can't go inside.

231
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,960
I am a female officer in the palace. How dare a lowly servant like you grab me. Let go of me.

232
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,460
This servant doesn't dare to offend a female officer, but this is a private residence.

233
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,590
We really don't have who you are looking for. Please be understanding.

234
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,600
I've run around all day, and my legs are always broken from walking.

235
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
If I weren't totally sure, I wouldn't have come here.

236
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,860
Don't fool me.

237
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,220
Disciple Zhuo Jinniang greets Teacher.

238
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,740
It's been many years, how is Teacher?

239
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,680
Since it's been many years,

240
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,840
why have you suddenly come here to disturbe my peace?

241
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,830
A'Ye, Liuli is still playing outside. She'll probably come back soon.

242
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,640
Go find her and tell her to come back a little later.

243
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,890
Don't let her bother my nostalgic chat with an old friend.

244
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,610
Yes.

245
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,060
Teacher, you are really observant.

246
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,110
To be honest, the ceremony to confer the new empress is coming up soon.

247
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,320
Attire Chief Lin entrusted this disciple with the important task of making the pheasant robe for the new empress.

248
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,090
Too bad that this disciple is incapable.

249
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,730
The pheasant robe that I make displeases Attire Chief Lin.

250
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,810
Therefore, I especially came today to beg Teacher

251
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,370
to save me, save the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

252
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,990
to help this disciple modify the pheasant robe.

253
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,740
Have you forgotten?

254
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,920
I left the palace years ago upon Empress Zhangsun's benevolent permission.

255
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,050
From then on, nothing with the palace or the Bureau of Imperial Attire concerns me.

256
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,820
Excuse me for not being able to help.

257
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,000
The one who permitted you to leave the palace

258
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,940
was the late empress.

259
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,540
But now, the inner palace will get a new leader.

260
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,560
If the new empress is dissatisfied with the pheasant robe that this disciple makes,

261
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,910
then... this disciple can't help

262
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,110
but let the new empress remember Teacher.

263
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,500
The new empress is well aware of Teacher's outstanding skill.

264
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,960
At that time, the new empress will issue an edict

265
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,310
to order Teacher to enter the palace to work.

266
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,600
At that time, if Teacher disobeys the decree,

267
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,570
it will be a crime punishable by death.

268
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,560
Zhuo Jinniang, are you threatening me?

269
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,990
This disciple wouldn't dare.

270
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,800
This disciple is only explaining the realities to Teacher.

271
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,370
As long as Teacher can help this disciplem make a pheasant robe that pleases the new empress,

272
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,910
all of the troubles will be avoided.

273
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,640
You can continue to say among the civilians and live your carefree life.

274
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,320
This disciple will definitely

275
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,400
not tell anyone of Teacher's whereabouts.

276
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,060
Teacher, just now,

277
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,190
this disciple seemed to hear you talk to a maid

278
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,240
about a girl named Liuli.

279
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,060
It sounds like a girl's name.

280
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,540
Could she be Teacher's daughter?

281
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,860
Teacher, even if you don't consider for yoruself,

282
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,290
you should consider your family members.

283
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,340
We haven't seen each other for ten years, but your words

284
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,760
have become more fierce, and especially vicious.

285
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,480
As it is now, it's useless to talk more.

286
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,790
I only have one request.

287
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,550
If you promise, then I'll agree to modify the pheasant robe.

288
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,400
Teacher, please say it.

289
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,830
Don't tell anyone that I have a daughter.

290
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,010
This disciple swears that I will not mention it to anyone.

291
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,660
If I break this oath, I will be hit by Heaven and struck by lightening.

292
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,100
This is good.

293
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,240
Leave the pheasant robe that you made here.

294
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,220
Come to get it seven days later. I will fix it well.

295
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,800
I have something else to remind you.

296
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,570
If you want to sit in the seat of Attire Officer at the Bureau of Imperial Attire,

297
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,550
then never mention me to the new empress.

298
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,210
This pheasant robe is totally made by you alone.

299
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,840
Thank you, Teacher, then this disciple will bid you farewell.

300
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,190
Seven days later, I shall return to visit you.

301
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,780
I won't walk you out then.

302
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,240
Teacher, I have another unreasonable request that I beg you to agree.

303
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,030
Teacher, will you transfer the token that represents "Number One Needle" to this disciple?

304
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,010
If I have this gold needle in my hand, then I can rightfully

305
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,840
become the Attire Officer at the Bureau of Imperial Attire.

306
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,990
If I can sit in the seat of the Attire Officer, it will be Teacher's honor.

307
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,960
It will also be our sect's honor. Please fulfill my wish, Teacher.

308
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,460
"Thr valley is too deep to fill, what's the use of one needle?" 
 (T/N: She is not talented.)

309
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,190
Liuli!

310
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,880
This gold needle is only a status symbol. It cannot be used to sew or embroider.

311
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,800
Tell Mom, what were you doing sneaking out with it?

312
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,110
Mother, you forbid me to use needles and threads.

313
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,480
I couldn't help but suddently wanted to sew a handkerchief.

314
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,420
I thought of this one needle would be the only one that Mother won't check.

315
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,910
That's why I took it.

316
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,060
Mother, I did wrong. I shouldn't have secretly taken the gold needle.

317
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,190
Are you saying that you took this gold needle to embroider the handkerchief?

318
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,900
Where is the handkerchief? Let me see.

319
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,940
Liuli did wrong. Please don't be angry, Mother.

320
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,420
This gold needle is blunt-tipped.

321
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,910
But you actually embroidered such a beautiful handkerchief.

322
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,870
How many tims have I told you?

323
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,660
Don't learn sewing! Dont learn embroidery! Why won't you listen?

324
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,770
Why do you make me angry?

325
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,200
Why?

326
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,290
Why can Shanhu learn sewing and embroidery,

327
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,150
and her mother won't scold her and hit her, and even begs Mother to teacher her?

328
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,290
All the other girls have to learn needlework.

329
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,440
Why am I the only one who can't?

330
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,860
Sewing and embroidery are not wrongdoings.

331
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,980
Of course sewing and embroidery are not wrongdoings.

332
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,890
But, a common person isn't guilty, but a common person with a jade is guilty.

333
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:03,600
An outstanding skill in sewing is that jade. My daughter,

334
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,490
can you understand it?

335
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,470
Back then, when I left the palace,

336
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,940
it was because of my skill

337
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,500
that I was helplessly involved into the life-or-death battles inside the palace.

338
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,740
I didn't want to participle in those battles.

339
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,720
I further didn't want to become

340
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,470
the tool used by those people to fight.

341
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,670
Mother.

342
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,380
My daughter.

343
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,910
The more endowed you are with this talent,

344
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,850
the more worried that I am.

345
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,430
I am really scared.

346
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,750
I am so scared!

347
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,460
[Young Pei Xingjian]

348
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,610
This is my entry permit.

349
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,400
[Su Dingfang]

350
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,290
Welcome, General Su.

351
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,580
General Su?

352
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,350
That is the renowed meritorious General Su DIngfang.

353
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,360
Amitabha, you've endured an arduous journey, General.

354
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,680
It's been a year. How is your health, Buddhist Master?

355
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,610
General, don't worry. For our annual chess game,

356
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,490
I will stay healthy and strong.

357
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,700
- Please. 
 - Please. 
 - General!

358
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,210
General Su, please wait!

359
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,770
General Su.

360
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,720
I am Pei Xingjian, courtesy name Shouyue.

361
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,550
I have long admired General Su. Please accept me as your disciple.

362
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,480
I don't take in disciples. Go on home.

363
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,250
I have studied martial training for many years, in the hope that oneday

364
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,670
I could become a brave warrior like General Su to guard our land.

365
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,970
You said you've studied martial training for many years.

366
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,010
I'll test you a little then.

367
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,450
That camilla tree is blooming.

368
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,380
If you can shoot down that tallest and most beautiful camilla flower with one arrow,

369
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,220
then I will consider accepting you as a disciple.

370
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,720
I will let you take five steps.

371
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,590
It's too close.

372
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,050
General.

373
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,330
This camilla flower is embroidered so beautifully that it appeared to be the real flower.

374
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,670
Young Master Pei's archery skill is excellent. Will General give him another chance?

375
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,000
I asked you to shoot down the most beautiful camilla flower, but you shot down a handkerchief.

376
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,560
Even though it's understandable, but we are not fated to become master and disciple.

377
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,890
You should go back.

378
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,280
General Su, I came to Chang'an this time to participate in the imperial exam.

379
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,490
But, my lifetime dream has been to become a general riding a horse and wielding a blade to secure Great Tang's boarders

380
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,630
in order to protect the people to avoid harms from disasters.

381
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,480
I just entered the city and accidentally encountered General.

382
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,660
I think this is actually fate. It's meant by Heaven's will.

383
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,900
General, look at the camilla tree.

384
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,100
There are hundreds of flowers on it.

385
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,880
But he shot down the one and only fake flower.

386
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,170
Whether this is fate or not fate,

387
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,630
who can really tell the difference?

388
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,590
Since Buddhist Master has spoke, I'll give you another chance.

389
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,870
I will be for the next few days. Perhaps it's just one day,

390
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,040
or three, or five days.

391
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,160
If we are really fated to meet again,

392
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,290
then the fate is certain.

393
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,270
However, let me tell you,

394
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,860
you cannot step inside the temple at all.

395
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,890
- Please. 
 - Respectfully say goodbye to General.

396
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,570
Thank you, Buddhist Master, for saying a good word for me.

397
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,360
Then, based on what you're saying,

398
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,390
we still don't know it will be fortune or disaster after you fix the pheasant robe for the new empress.

399
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,150
There won't be fortune.

400
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,750
As long as there is no disaster, it will be a blessing from the ancestors.

401
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,800
Older Sister's status as the Numbre One Needle in the World

402
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,020
never brought any benefit to the Kudi family.

403
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,060
Now, it even endangers our entire family of old and young.

404
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,180
It's no big deal that we suffer,

405
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,280
but the good reputation of Kudi family's ancestors

406
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,580
should not be allowed any damage.

407
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,790
Dalang, please think of an idea.

408
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,780
As things are now, you don't need to prattle.

409
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,560
Don't just talk. Let's think of a solution.

410
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,850
I do have an idea, but if I tell you,

411
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,510
Older Sister and Dalang, please don't blame me.

412
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,200
Why are you holding back at a time like this?

413
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,820
Dalang, please write a divorce letter for Older Sister in advance.

414
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,860
What nonsense are you saying?

415
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,550
Dalang, please let me explain.

416
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,110
Older Sister, please don't blame me as coldhearted.

417
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,450
I am only doing this for the whole family's sake.

418
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,240
Even if Older Sister can stand dragging down the entire family,

419
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,410
you would at least feel for your own daughter, Liuli.

420
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,970
Writing the divorce letter is just for in case. In case Consort Yang isn't chosen as the empress,

421
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,400
Dalang can show people the divorce letter that's written today.

422
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,120
Totally disassociate from Older Sister.

423
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,500
This way, you can protect the whole family.

424
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,630
A'Cao seems to make sense.

425
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,570
This is just for in case. If we get through this problem, our family can still be—

426
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,780
Dalang, you need not say more.

427
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,500
A'Cao really has a good scheme.

428
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,420
Good trick.

429
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,610
Dalang, go ahead and write the divorce letter to break up our relationship.

430
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,840
It will be the best evidence for Dalang

431
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,210
to prove your innocence later.

432
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,300
A'Cao is vicious.

433
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,860
Dalang is selfish and cowardly.

434
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,330
Liuli, Liuli.

435
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,120
I don't care about staying alive.

436
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,430
But you are the one I worry the most about.

437
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,120
I must make an appropriate arrangement for you.

438
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,640
You have such a talent for dressmaking.

439
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,790
This is also fate.

440
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:07,370
It is time for me to transfer the unique dressmaking skill to you,

441
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,890
so that you have a skill to make a living.

442
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,470
This robe wasn't made by Mother.

443
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,740
How did you know that I didn't make it.

444
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,790
The birds that Mother embroider are alive and can fly.

445
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,920
Not like this one. They don't like lively.

446
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,070
Liuli is right.

447
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,960
This robe, made by someone else, isn't satisfactory.

448
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,940
That's why they asked me to modify it for them.

449
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,280
Mother, are you going to make these birds come alive?

450
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,090
If these birds can be alive,

451
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,110
will they become noisy?

452
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,990
Mother, I have a solution.

453
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,860
How about embroider a big bird?

454
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,660
Let them have a mother to watch over them.

455
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,130
My daughter, you have such a great talent.

456
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,380
I really don't know if it will be fortunate or disasterous.

457
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:27,510
Liuli, I will take you to stay in someplace safe for a few days, alright?

458
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,250
Mother, where are you sending me to?

459
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,230
Don't you want to learn dressmaking with me?

460
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,190
If you are good,

461
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,240
I will teach you the skills.

462
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,580
Mother, you will really teach me?

463
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,790
Mother, can't you teach me at home?

464
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,070
The place I'm sending you to is a good place.

465
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,330
When you go there, you can make clothes for other people, just like Mom does.

466
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,990
Mother, can't you go with me?

467
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,580
Greetings, Madam Yang. Greetings, Talented Lady Wu.

468
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,960
I impudently came to your residence so that Madam Yang and Talented Lady Wu

469
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,030
can personally inspect the auspicious gown that our shop has carefully made.

470
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,930
So quickly done?

471
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,150
Hurry and show me.

472
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,540
This is the auspicious gown that Ruyi Resist Dye Shop made for Talented Lady Wu.

473
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,150
Please view it, Madam Yang and Talented Lady Wu.

474
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,260
The peach tree is full of youong sprouts. How brilliantly bright are the flowers!  
 [Tao Yao, Ode to Peach Blossom]

475
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,380
This young lady is going marry. How fitting she will be at her future home!

476
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,120
Embroidering the poem into the silk, turning it into clothes.

477
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,040
It is indeed new and creative. It is not shallow.

478
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,220
This Ode to Peach Blossom is also very approriate.

479
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,550
Even though this Ode to Peach Blossom has a good meaning,

480
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,380
but the auspicious gown is embroidered only with one peach flower.

481
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,810
Isn't it too lonely, not as lively for a celebratory event.

482
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,720
If it is embroidered with a tree of peach flowers,

483
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,930
full of peach flower splendor, that's how an auspicious gown should present.

484
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,000
Could it be that you deliebrately cut the word to neglect us?

485
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,520
Replying to Madam, a trea of blooming flowers may look lively,

486
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,190
but there is no clear difference between the primary and secondary theme.

487
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,590
It won't make it unforgettable.

488
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,060
Even though there is only one peach flower on this auspicious gown,

489
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,970
it is the fruit of exquisite craftsmanship.

490
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,320
It symbolizes one rising up among the many.

491
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,530
It will let all the viewers linger and find it unforgettable.

492
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,040
One rising up among the many...

493
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,300
Well said!

494
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,350
In the inner palace where there are as many beauties as the clouds,

495
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,350
doesn't any of the concubines want to be one rising among many?

496
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,140
Servants, bring the reward.

497
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,330
Madam, wait.

498
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,770
The collar and the sleeves on this auspicious gown

499
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,870
still need to be modified to be more fitting

500
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,940
according to Talented Lady's body.

501
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,020
My mother ordered me to stay in your residence fora few days

502
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,690
to do the finetuning work according to Talent Lady's measurements.

503
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,600
Once the auspicious gown is completed, and Madam and Talented Lady are satisfied,

504
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,070
at that time, Liuli will kneel to thank Madam's reward.

505
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,000
You?

506
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,480
You are still such a young child.

507
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,260
No matter how outstanding your mother's skill is,

508
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,400
how can I believe that a baby can make clothes?

509
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,200
Madam, don't look down at me. Such a small task

510
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,220
is easy to me.

511
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,920
This child...

512
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,020
Madam, don't underestimate this child.

513
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,850
She is the daughter of Number One Needle in the World.

514
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,540
She has been personally taught by her mother.

515
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,480
Madam An finished the major parts of this gown.

516
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,260
The child can totally take on the wrapping-up work.

517
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,580
That day, the one who took my measurements,

518
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,750
was the famous Number One Needle in the World?

519
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,690
Precisely.

520
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,280
- Why don't we— 
 - In that case,

521
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,650
just let this child stay in our manor then.

522
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,250
I also want to see her skills.

523
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:15,820
If you do a good job to finish the auspicious gown, I will reward you handsomely.

524
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,260
If you make a mistake, I will also punish you harshly. Are you afraid?

525
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,550
Such a small task is nothing difficult.

526
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,530
Madam Yang and Talent Lady Wu, please wait to see it.

527
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,140
Liuli, from this moment on, everything I say,

528
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,100
you must remember it well.

529
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,840
Tomorrow, I will ask Uncle to take you to the Wu Manor. Stay there for seven days

530
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,150
to mend the auspicious gown for Miss Wu.

531
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,520
Mother, are you really letting me use the needle?

532
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,060
This is my insight from many years of dressmaking.

533
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,020
I'm giving it to you.

534
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,950
When you are in the Wu Manor, remember everything throughly in your head.

535
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,030
After that, burn it. You must do it.

536
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,200
You must not show anyone else the dressmaking secrets in it.

537
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,680
Remember.

538
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,160
This gold needle was bestowed by His Majesty

539
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,140
by His Majesty and the late empress.

540
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,330
It is a token that symbolizes Number One Needle in the World.

541
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,960
I am giving it to you. In the future,

542
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,280
you will safeguard it.

543
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,350
After seven days, Mother will come personally to pick you up.

544
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,580
After seven days, if it's someone else that comes to pick you up, you must not come back here.

545
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,830
At that time, beg Talented Lady Wu to send you to a nunnery

546
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,940
to seek sheltering from Buddha.

547
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,530
Don't tell anyone

548
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,490
that you are the daughter of Number One Needle in the World. Understand?

549
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,040
No, Mother, I don't want to go to the Wu Manor to mend the auspicious gown.

550
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,890
I also don't want to live there for seven days. I don't want to leave Mother!

551
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,460
Liuli, you must listen to Mother.

552
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,500
What I'm doing is for your safety. Understand?

553
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,270
Mother...

554
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,430
Mother...

555
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,780
I promise you.

556
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,600
After seven days, I will come for you.

557
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,510
Mother.

558
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,950
Mother!

559
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,320
Mother!

560
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:59,000
