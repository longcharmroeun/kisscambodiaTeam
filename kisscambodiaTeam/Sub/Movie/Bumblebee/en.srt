3
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:55,539
They've broken through
the front lines!

4
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,175
I've lost contact
with the capital!

5
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:58,711
There's too many of them!

6
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:02,115
Stand fast!

7
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:06,317
Finish them!

8
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:19,632
Where's B-127?

9
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,179
Sorry I'm late.
I hit a little traffic.

10
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:37,148
Get down!
Incoming!

11
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,151
Uh, Optimus.

12
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:44,389
Decepticons, attack!

13
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:49,028
Autobots, fall back!
Get to the tower!

14
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,134
Destroy the launch pad!
Let none escape!

15
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:03,041
Cybertron has fallen.
Get to the escape pods.

16
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:06,244
There are other Autobots
scattered across the galaxy.

17
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:08,578
We must reach them
if we hope to survive.

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,117
Optimus, this is our home.
We have to fight for it.

19
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:20,892
We will fight on. But we
must find refuge first.

20
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:24,562
I found a planet that's well hidden.
Earth.

21
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:27,498
You will travel there and
establish a base for us.

22
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,301
Once we've gathered the
others, we'll join you.

23
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,136
You must protect
the planet.

24
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:37,176
If the Decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.

25
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:38,545
Now go!

26
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:57,130
Good luck, soldier.
I'll buy you some time.

27
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:01,493
No!

28
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:02,927
Ow! Ow! Ow!

29
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:03,795
Okay, okay!

30
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:05,799
I'm dead already,
man!

31
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,067
Oh, not just you.

32
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,601
Being the overachiever
that you are,

33
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:12,871
you managed to get your
whole squad killed, Danny.

34
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:13,739
Bravo.

35
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:14,973
Come on, man.
Those things sting.

36
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:16,942
- What things? These things?
- Ow!

37
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:19,078
You know, I wouldn't know. I haven't been hit yet.

38
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,646
Ow! Okay, you know what? That's too close, man.

39
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:22,981
You could've taken out an eye.

40
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:25,350
I got a date tonight, man.
This ain't sexy!

41
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,618
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Ow!

42
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,920
That one was on me.

43
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:30,888
That's a malfunctioning
trigger.

44
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,025
This weapon is just faulty. Someone
is going to get a talking to...

45
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:35,193
Man, would you stop?

46
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,031
All right, just stop.

47
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:40,299
I should've
let you die in Grenada.

48
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,067
If you did, we wouldn't be
able to come to the forest,

49
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,103
run around and play
these awesome games.

50
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:45,304
Exactly.

51
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:48,107
Oh, I hate you.

52
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:51,376
Wow, man, that hurts.
'Cause I love you.

53
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:54,179
But you refuse to let it in
'cause you got intimacy issues.

54
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:56,048
A therapist will probably tell you
you weren't hugged enough as a kid.

55
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,918
- Look, man.
- Danny, I know I look stupid, but...

56
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:02,087
Hey, yo, take cover!

57
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:16,203
Danny.

58
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:18,270
You okay?

59
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:20,007
Uh, yeah, man.

60
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,511
This is Agent Jack Burns.

61
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:26,412
I need medical
up here now.

62
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:27,679
We have
a projectile strike

63
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:29,715
in the northwest corner
of the training course.

64
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,584
Multiple injuries.

65
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:36,455
And would someone please explain to me
why you dropped napalm on your own guys!

66
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:39,925
<i>Negative. There are no
live fire drills in the northwest sector.</i>

67
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:41,929
What the hell hit us, then?

68
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,243
Target on your right!

69
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:15,397
I need all of you to fan out
and track that thing down now!

70
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,733
Drive!

71
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:27,274
There!

72
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,144
What the hell?

73
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:33,247
Take it down!

74
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,887
Get down there now
and flush that thing out!

75
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:42,022
There it is!

76
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,967
<i>Target has been located, sir.</i>

77
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,436
Light it up!

78
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:07,282
Damn it!

79
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:19,760
Oh, no.

80
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:33,208
It's going for the mine!
Cut it off!

81
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,124
Move, move!

82
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:05,037
Please.

83
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,874
This is a mistake.

84
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:10,476
Stay cool.
Hold your fire.

85
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:12,412
I don't want
to hurt anyone.

86
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,289
Who called in the Air Force?

87
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,329
That's not the Air Force.

88
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,967
Run.

89
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,224
Did you think you could hide?

90
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:10,970
Now you'll die screaming.

91
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:13,174
Like your friends!

92
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:50,943
Tell me where
your friends are hiding.

93
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:52,679
I'll never talk.

94
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:54,417
Is that right?

95
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,251
Then let's
make it official.

96
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:29,883
B-127...

97
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:32,418
As a member
of the Autobot resistance,

98
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,887
you are a traitor
to Cybertron

99
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,391
and are hereby sentenced

100
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:38,394
to death.

101
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:46,402
No!

102
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:48,471
No!

103
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:22,665
Ugh.

104
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:24,833

Gross, Ron.

121
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,551
Excuse me.

122
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,654
Are those
your diving trophies?

123
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:54,454
Taking up too much space
in my room.

124
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:56,458
You're gonna
regret doing that.

125
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:58,860
Where's breakfast?

126
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:03,064
Breakfast is conveniently located
in the cupboards and the fridge.

127
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,164
- Ah.
- Try to help out...

128
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,799
- Yeah.
- ...a little.

129
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:08,869
Since I'm such a big kid now, making
my own breakfast and what have you,

130
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:12,807
you know how I could be an even
bigger help around here, Mom?

131
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,142
If I had a car.

132
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,275
Charlie.

133
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:17,078
What do you know,
it's my birthday tomorrow,

134
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,480
perfect timing
for a large cash gift.

135
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,916
You know, $500 is really all
I need to finish the Corvette.

136
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:26,353
I don't have $500. You
know how much nurses make.

137
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:28,923
"Half as much as doctors
for twice the work," right?

138
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:30,223
Tell you what, kiddo...

139
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,692
I got another
job interview tomorrow.

140
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:34,128
If all goes well, I'll have
you swimming in car parts.

141
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,897
I prefer cash, Ron.

142
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:37,732
Don't be rude.
Feed the dog.

00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:40,168

Can you drop your brother at
karate on your way to work, please?

149
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:56,150
Um, I could if I had a car.

150
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:59,787
Just let him follow you on your
bike so nobody abducts him.

151
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:02,924
Abducts him? You just
said he's a grown man now.

152

227
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:02,353

00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:13,151

I'm gonna be late for work.

00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:25,995

258
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:29,999
about people on mopeds getting run
over and their brains smashed in.

259
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,801
You got to wear this

the law. It's our law.

261
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:36,841
Plus, look how cute it is.

262
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:40,243
Yeah.

263
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:41,811
Happy birthday.

264
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:44,113
I actually got you
a little gift, too, Charlie.

265
00:23:44,115 --> 00:23:47,186
I mean, it's small,
but, it's from the heart.

266
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:55,793
A smile is a powerful thing.

267
00:23:56,794 --> 00:23:58,327
It releases endorphins.

268
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,532
It says to the world,
"I'm fun and approachable."

269
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:07,970
You know, there's a whole chapter in here
about how people who smile more often

270
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:09,773
actually have more friends.

271
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:11,942
That's unbelievable.

272
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:13,909
I really think it's gonna
change your whole outlook

273
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,180
if you smile more often.

274
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,065
I want the Beetle.

275
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,167
- What?
- The yellow Beetle, I want it.

276
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:39,403
I'll make you a deal. If I get
that thing started, it's mine.

277
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:42,339
That's no deal. That's
just you taking my car.

278
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:46,343
If I get it started, I keep it and
I work here every day for a year!

279
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:48,478
I'll scrub the grease
off the floors, okay?

280
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,581
I will pick up and organize every
scrap of paper in this place.

281
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:55,320
I'll even detail your
horrible, disgusting toilets.

282
00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:59,491
Please.
It's my birthday.

283
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:01,593
Sorry, no deal.

284
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:04,829

You don't know

I'm gonna call you that
from now on.

354
00:32:14,695 --> 00:32:15,796
Bumblebee.

00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:43,289
<i>♪ All my exes live in Texas ♪</i>

357
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,526
I want a divorce, Roy!

358
00:32:47,528 --> 00:32:49,694
Come on, Amber.
Give me one good reason.

359
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:51,830
You tried to sleep
with my sister!

360
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:53,231
Unsuccessfully!

361
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:55,699
Yeah, you're unsuccessful
at everything.

362
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:58,370
That down payment was for a house.
You bought a car.

363
00:32:58,372 --> 00:33:01,907
How stupid are you, Roy?
We don't need a car. God!

364
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:05,512
Now, just settle down for
one second and hear me out.

365
00:33:07,347 --> 00:33:10,050
- What the hell is that?
- What?

366
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:16,054
Oh, God, Roy, that thing
is coming right for us!

367
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:17,856
No, no, no, no, no...

368
00:33:17,858 --> 00:33:19,657
Not my car. Not my car.

369
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:21,995
Please, God, no, not my car!

370
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,975
Oh, thank God, my car.

371
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:37,409
Yeah, I'm okay.

372
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:40,479
Oh, that's good, baby.
That's good.

373
00:33:41,447 --> 00:33:43,083
Run. Run!

374
00:33:55,096 --> 00:33:56,363
Oh...

375
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:01,001
God!

376
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:03,904
Is that my car?

377
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:07,941
Hello...

378
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:23,421
Jeez!

379
00:34:23,423 --> 00:34:24,956
Earth.

380
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,892
- Roy!
- Oh!

381
00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:28,293
How underwhelming.

382
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:31,832
The indigenous life is even
more primitive than I expected.

383
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:34,767
Hey...

384
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:40,172
Hmm. I like
the way they pop.

385
00:34:40,174 --> 00:34:41,773
Focus, comrade.

386
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:47,179
B-127's distress signal came from
the western coast of this continent.

387
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:49,917
For now, we head west.

388
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:06,431
When do they start
letting you use nunchucks?

389
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:07,900
I don't know,
but I hope soon.

390
00:35:07,902 --> 00:35:10,704
- Morning! See you guys later.
- Where you off to so fast?

391
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:13,774
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

392
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:17,177
Morning...

393
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:20,847
Bee?

394
00:35:23,518 --> 00:35:25,184
Bee, where are you?

395
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:30,356
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

396
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:31,424
Bee!

397
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:33,094
Where did you go?

398
00:35:38,899 --> 00:35:40,598
Otis!

399
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,500
Have you seen my car?

400
00:35:42,502 --> 00:35:43,702
Unfortunately, yes.

401
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:45,804
No, have you seen
my car today?

402
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:48,107
It was in the garage.
Someone stole it!

403
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:49,775
No, idiot. Mom took it.

404
00:35:49,777 --> 00:35:51,243
She had to bring Conan to the vet

405
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:53,346
because he swallowed, like,
a rubber glove or something

406
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,214
and Ron needed
the station wagon.

407
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:56,650
Thank God.

408
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:00,520
Wait.

409
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:08,059
Hi. Excuse me.
It's me again.

410
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:10,330
- We never officially met, but...
- I can't right now. Sorry.

411
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:11,998
Nope. Yep.

412
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,499
Okay.

413
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:19,007
I know, buddy. Hang in there.

414
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:23,675
You can't eat
everything you see.

415
00:36:23,677 --> 00:36:26,813
Just let this be
a good life lesson for you.

416
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:31,685
Oh, my God. Stop it!
Don't do that!

417
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:37,158
Bee, no!

418
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,931
- Mom?
- Whoa!

419
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:47,299
Jesus! Charlie,
what are you doing?

420
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:48,633
Mom, you gotta pull over.

421
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:51,603
- What the hell is going on?
- Just pull the car over.

422
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:54,541
Okay, okay. All right.

423
00:36:57,111 --> 00:37:01,080
Would you put that robot junk away?
What are you thinking?

424
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:02,681
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

425
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:04,183
I thought
I was being carjacked.

426
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:05,785
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

427
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:09,855
I can't believe you would take him
without me. Mom, I'm so worried about him!

428
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:11,624
He's my dog, too, you know.

429
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:14,226
What happened to Conan
being Otis's dog?

430
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:16,128
Mom, you're
being hysterical, okay?

431
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,431
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

432
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:20,268
I know how you get
during emergencies.

433
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:22,271
I'm a nurse.

434
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:25,606
Not of animals.

435
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:33,112
Oh, okay. I'm happy
for you to drive.

436
00:37:33,114 --> 00:37:35,449
You weren't wearing
your helmet, by the way.

437
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:37,018
- I saw that.
- Oh, shoot.

438
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:41,520
Keep it together, Bee.

439
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:50,165
Sir?

440
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:52,566
Sir.

441
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:54,969
I thought you'd want
to see this immediately.

442
00:37:59,907 --> 00:38:01,774
- They sure?
- Yes, sir.

443
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:03,909
Two of them just
made contact in Texas.

444
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:06,145
Intel says they're heading
west fast.

445
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:07,748
Saddle up, Simmons.

446
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,152
We're going to Texas.

447
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:14,922
Okay, Bee, we need
to go over a few things.

448
00:38:20,828 --> 00:38:22,697
Okay. We're all clear.

449
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,267
All right.
I'm re-thinking the beach.

450
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:29,270
Ugh.

451
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,705
Oh, I'm good.

452
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:34,309
No, I'm good, thanks.

453
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:40,247
People can be terrible about
things they don't understand.

454
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:42,948
If they find you, they'll probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

455
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,650
and cut you
into tiny little pieces.

456
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:47,722
It'll be bad, trust me.

457
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:54,962
The only person you can show
yourself around is me, okay?

458
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:59,232
So let's practice.
You ready?

459
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,303
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

460
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:06,908
Great. Perfect.
Come back now.

461
00:39:08,976 --> 00:39:11,844
Okay, so let's say we're
driving and all of a sudden...

462
00:39:11,846 --> 00:39:14,383
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here!
Hide, Bee, hide!

463
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:28,263
You serious?

464
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,735
Bee, it's too late.
You're already dead.

465
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:40,005
It's all right.

466
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:43,943
That's why we're practicing.
You'll get it.

467
00:39:43,945 --> 00:39:47,749
<i>Fox-2 on approach.
Non-biologicals are inbound.</i>

468
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:08,167
The goal, sir, should be
to communicate with them.

469
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:11,771
First contact
with an alien species.

470
00:40:11,773 --> 00:40:14,841
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

471
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:18,046
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.

472
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:36,664
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill them.

473
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:40,269
Not yet. B-127's
signal has gone silent.

474
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:43,138
I have an idea.

475
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:48,041
Listen up! I'm Agent Burns
and this is Dr. Powell.

476
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:51,844
We currently have 100 guns
pointed right at your head!

477
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:53,747
So state your business.

478
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:55,615
People of Earth,

479
00:40:55,617 --> 00:40:59,819
we are Decepticon peacekeepers
patrolling the galaxy.

480
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:01,756
What are you doing?

481
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,823
This is humiliating.

482
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:06,960
We believe a dangerous
criminal from our world

483
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:10,096
is hiding somewhere
on yours.

484
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:11,967
How is it you think
we can help?

485
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:15,904
We need your eyes.

486
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:17,904
Wait.

487
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:20,173
You want access
to our satellites?

488
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:22,842
Our scanners'
range is limited.

489
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:26,179
Your infrastructure
is primitive.

490
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:30,050
But combined, they
could be quite powerful.

491
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,686
No way!
Out of the question!

492
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:34,655
We have a common enemy,
Agent Burns.

493
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:36,990
There's a war raging
on our planet.

494
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:41,796
If B-127 isn't found, that
war may find its way here.

495
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:43,930
Perhaps...

496
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:47,134
We can find a way
to help one another.

497
00:41:47,136 --> 00:41:49,035
We'll talk it over
with our superiors.

498
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:52,072
In the meantime,
if you could follow us.

499
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:54,742
Very well,
friend Powell.

500
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:56,579
Take us to your leader.

501
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:10,226
Must suck being
cooped up in a VW all day, huh?

502
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:14,095
Is there anyone
that can help you?

503
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:15,730
Do you have a family?

504
00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:18,833
You know, like a mom,
dad, siblings?

505
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,235
You all love each other?

506
00:42:22,772 --> 00:42:24,204
Or drive each other crazy

507
00:42:24,206 --> 00:42:27,042
and you can't wait to get away
and start a whole new life.

508
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:35,051
Do you want me
to see if I can fix it?

509
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:38,988
I'll be gentle, I promise.

510
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:50,063
Whoa.

511
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:55,303
You lay down, okay?

512
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,176
Hold still.

513
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,647
I think maybe
there's something...

514
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:21,962
<i>B-127,
I pray this message finds you.</i>

515
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:25,533
<i>Our war rages on.</i>

516
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:27,003
<i>...planet Earth...</i>

517
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,372
<i>...survival...</i>

518
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,066
Ravage, eject!

519
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,484
<i>...your mission...</i>

520
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:17,819
<i>...soldier...</i>

521
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,088
<i>I...</i>

522
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:24,792
Are you okay?

523
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:29,430
Who was that?

524
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:32,435
That voice said something
about a war.

525
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,371
Do you remember anything?

526
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:42,779
Is the VW Beetle
some kind of disguise?

527
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,182
Are you hiding
from something?

528
00:44:49,185 --> 00:44:50,553
Are you scared?

529
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:04,501
It's broken.

530
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,068
It's okay.

531
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,137

An advance on Washington.

606

- New York. An advance on Chicago!
- That's not gonna happen.

613
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:26,316
they'll just take their technology
to the Russians instead.

614
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,787
Do you really want to go down in history
as the man who cost us the Cold War?

615
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:35,192
Fine.

616
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,796
We'll help them
find their fugitive.

617
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,996
And when it's done,

618
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:43,134
you can do all the
experiments you want. Hmm?

619
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:47,471
Yes, sir.

631
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:28,579
The telephones? Yes, why?

632
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:35,885
You got to pick
a station, man.

633
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:37,553

a lot of choices.

634

635
00:52:41,126 --> 00:52:42,292
Okay, uh...

637
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,464

Yeah, I can't explain.
But here's the deal.

655

01:11:51,147 --> 01:11:52,381
Oh, my God!

882
01:11:55,117 --> 01:11:56,984
- Mom...
- What happened?

883
01:11:56,986 --> 01:11:59,219
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

884
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:00,587
What'd you do to my TV?

885
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:04,258
Look, Mom, I can explain. We will
talk about this later, all right?

886
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,560
- Now, I have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

887
01:12:06,562 --> 01:12:07,961
No. You're not
going anywhere.

888
01:12:07,963 --> 01:12:10,764
- It's about my car. It's really important.
- About your car?

889
01:12:10,766 --> 01:12:15,068
That you spend all day and night shut in
that garage, doing God-knows-what with?

890
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:17,171
Mom, I can't.
I really can't right now.

891
01:12:17,173 --> 01:12:19,607
Oh, no, you really can,
Charlie.

892
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:21,643
You really can.

893
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:22,809
I have had it!

894
01:12:22,811 --> 01:12:25,379
Your attitude,
your always sulking around.

895
01:12:25,381 --> 01:12:29,016
You brought home that piece of
crap without even asking me!

896
01:12:29,018 --> 01:12:32,053
Everyone in this family
is trying to be happy,

897
01:12:32,055 --> 01:12:34,656
and all you want to do
is make things harder.

898
01:12:34,658 --> 01:12:36,457
You know, Mom,
just because you've moved on

899
01:12:36,459 --> 01:12:40,027
and you're happy with your
new life doesn't mean I have!

900
01:12:40,029 --> 01:12:42,796
You've found a replacement
for my dad and I haven't,

901
01:12:42,798 --> 01:12:43,931
okay, and I never will!

902
01:12:43,933 --> 01:12:46,300
So I'm sorry if that
makes things harder,

903
01:12:46,302 --> 01:12:48,068
but in ten months from now

904
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:49,972
you won't even have
to deal with me!

905
01:12:51,706 --> 01:12:53,108
Charlie!

906
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:04,454
Hey, you okay?

907
01:13:06,222 --> 01:13:07,323
Yeah.

908
01:13:10,025 --> 01:13:12,059
I just feel like
ever since my dad died,

909
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:15,231
I've become this drain
on everyone, and I hate it.

910
01:13:16,699 --> 01:13:18,098
It's like everybody expects me

911
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,201
to act like
nothing ever happened,

912
01:13:20,203 --> 01:13:22,838
and it's impossible
to do that.

913
01:13:24,974 --> 01:13:28,178
About your dad,
I'm really sorry.

914
01:13:28,645 --> 01:13:30,645
Thanks.

915
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:33,416
You know, there's
this quote that I like.

916
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:38,487
"The darkest nights
produce the brightest stars."

917
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:44,261
That's nice.

918
01:13:45,161 --> 01:13:47,097
My mom got it
from Weight Watchers.

919
01:14:01,877 --> 01:14:04,579
Get out and move
away from the vehicle.

920
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:07,581
Stay cool, Bee.

921
01:14:16,693 --> 01:14:17,759
What's going on?

922
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:20,161
Hey!

923
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:21,930
- Come on!
- Stop it!

924
01:14:22,599 --> 01:14:24,231
Let go of me!

925
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,502
- Weapons now! Take it down!
- Run!

926
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:29,369
No, don't run.
Do not run!

927
01:14:33,243 --> 01:14:34,309
She ran.

928
01:14:57,834 --> 01:14:59,436
Please tell me
they're on our side.

929
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:14,449
No more running.

930
01:15:14,451 --> 01:15:16,551
No more hiding.

931
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:24,827
B-127, you're a traitor
and a coward.

932
01:15:24,829 --> 01:15:27,230
Tell us where
Optimus Prime is hiding.

933
01:15:30,266 --> 01:15:32,302
Bee, look out!

934
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:36,037
Why isn't he fighting back?

935
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:37,904
Why don't you fight?

936
01:15:37,906 --> 01:15:39,509
Leave him alone!
Please!

937
01:15:43,513 --> 01:15:44,946
Again.

938
01:15:48,318 --> 01:15:49,319
Hit it again!

939
01:15:50,821 --> 01:15:52,420
Stop! Stop it!

940
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:25,820
Your daughter stole
government property, Mrs. Watson.

941
01:16:25,822 --> 01:16:28,122
She's been
having trouble adjusting,

942
01:16:28,124 --> 01:16:30,825
but we had no idea
it was this serious.

943
01:16:30,827 --> 01:16:32,059
I...

944
01:16:32,061 --> 01:16:33,462
Charlie. Honey.

945
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:36,632
I didn't steal anything,
and he doesn't belong to them.

946
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,032
- "He?"
- Ma'am.

947
01:16:38,034 --> 01:16:40,435
I can assure you
that it is an "it".

948
01:16:40,437 --> 01:16:42,571
And "it" is a highly dangerous
war machine.

949
01:16:42,573 --> 01:16:45,908
No, he isn't, okay, Mom?
He's not some "war machine."

950
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:49,343
I don't know
what he is, but...

951
01:16:49,345 --> 01:16:51,045
He's my friend.

952
01:16:51,047 --> 01:16:53,915
Ma'am, your daughter's had
a traumatic experience today.

953
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:56,118
Maybe doesn't understand
everything she's seen.

954
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,419
She's disoriented.

955
01:16:57,421 --> 01:17:00,087
No, I'm fine, Mom.
I'm completely fine, okay?

956
01:17:00,089 --> 01:17:02,957
You have to believe me, please.
I didn't steal anything!

957
01:17:02,959 --> 01:17:05,295
Stop! Just go
to your room.

958
01:17:12,302 --> 01:17:14,370
When I was going
through puberty,

959
01:17:15,605 --> 01:17:17,672
I stole things, too.

960
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:20,544
- Stole a box of Mallomars once.
- Yeah, we know.

961
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,321
Boom.

962
01:18:06,389 --> 01:18:07,991
Caught you.

963
01:18:07,993 --> 01:18:09,926
Oh, Mom's gonna love this.

964
01:18:09,928 --> 01:18:11,693
Look, Otis, you need
to go home and...

965
01:18:11,695 --> 01:18:13,195
Mom!

966
01:18:13,197 --> 01:18:16,097
No, Otis, stop it! Why would you do that?

967
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:18,834
Let go of me! You're touching my buttocks!

968
01:18:18,836 --> 01:18:21,672
I will tell you a secret
if you shut up.

969
01:18:22,873 --> 01:18:26,742
Okay, so, um,
this is my room.

970
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,409
Just make yourself at home.

971
01:18:28,411 --> 01:18:30,511
These are actually
my sister's stuff.

972
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:33,482
She likes playing pranks, like
putting her stuff over here.

973
01:18:33,484 --> 01:18:35,684
- Can I, uh, sit down?
- Yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

974
01:18:35,686 --> 01:18:37,352
<i>Residents of
Brighton Falls have been witness</i>

975
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:39,755
<i>to an unusual sight
this evening.</i>

976
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:43,258
<i>Armed Forces pouring into town
as part of what we are told</i>

977
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,160
<i>is a routine military exercise</i>

978
01:18:46,162 --> 01:18:48,897
<i>setting up camp
at our own McKinnon Air Base.</i>

979
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:52,166
If Bumblebee's still alive,
that's where they're keeping him.

980
01:18:52,168 --> 01:18:54,268
We have to go.
We have to try and save him.

981
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,173
Count me in. I'll take point.

982
01:18:57,174 --> 01:18:58,841
- No, you won't.
- Come on.

983
01:18:58,843 --> 01:19:00,275
No, Otis.

984
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,678
- But I can help. Master Larry says I...
- I need someone here.

985
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,882
I need someone reliable to make sure that
Mom and Ron don't know that I'm gone.

986
01:19:06,884 --> 01:19:08,385
I'm someone reliable.

987
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:11,488
Hell, yeah, you are.

988
01:19:16,427 --> 01:19:17,628
Good luck.

989
01:19:18,161 --> 01:19:19,762
You, too.

990
01:19:19,764 --> 01:19:21,231
Get over here.

991
01:19:26,071 --> 01:19:27,436
Oh.

992
01:19:27,438 --> 01:19:28,606
Let's do this.

993
01:19:31,175 --> 01:19:32,240
Tell us where

994
01:19:32,242 --> 01:19:34,242
Optimus Prime
and the rebels are hiding,

995
01:19:34,244 --> 01:19:37,214
and we can end this war.

996
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:40,315
Talk!

997
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,551
Who is Optimus Prime?

998
01:19:42,553 --> 01:19:45,155
This doesn't
concern you, human Powell.

999
01:19:45,523 --> 01:19:47,626
Last chance.

1000
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:56,598
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

1001
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,700
It's a terrible idea,
but I've got to try it.

1002
01:19:58,702 --> 01:20:01,403
You can't get... Well, why
don't you... Stop, stop, wait...

1003
01:20:01,405 --> 01:20:04,508
- How'd you know the power was off?
- I didn't. Let's go.

1004
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:11,346
Can I?

1005
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,618
His memory cells are fried.

1006
01:20:14,485 --> 01:20:15,752
Finish him.

1007
01:20:21,993 --> 01:20:27,195
<i>We will fight on. Regroup,
rebuild, and retake our home.</i>

1008
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,798
<i>But we must find refuge first.</i>

1009
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,401
<i>You will travel to Earth.</i>

1010
01:20:31,403 --> 01:20:34,103
<i>Once we've gathered
the others, we'll join you.</i>

1011
01:20:34,105 --> 01:20:36,304
<i>You must protect the planet.</i>

1012
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:41,878
<i>If the Decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.</i>

1013
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,147
<i>Stay safe, soldier.</i>

1014
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:46,550
<i>I am coming.</i>

1015
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,852
Prime is coming here?

1016
01:20:50,854 --> 01:20:53,055
They're all coming here.

1017
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:57,293
This is our chance to wipe out
the Autobot resistance for good.

1018
01:20:57,295 --> 01:21:00,930
We'll burn the whole
planet to cinders.

1019
01:21:00,932 --> 01:21:03,331
We must get word
to Cybertron immediately.

1020
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:04,466
<i>This is Burns.</i>

1021
01:21:04,468 --> 01:21:07,170
Tell them to bring an army.

1022
01:21:07,172 --> 01:21:09,571
Burns, we made
a terrible mistake.

1023
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:10,672
Powell?

1024
01:21:10,674 --> 01:21:13,508
And thanks to
our human allies,

1025
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:16,012
I know just how to get
the message home.

1026
01:21:16,014 --> 01:21:18,313
They're using our satellites.

1027
01:21:18,315 --> 01:21:19,882
<i>They're calling an army.</i>

1028
01:21:19,884 --> 01:21:22,151
They're gonna kill us all.

1029
01:21:22,153 --> 01:21:27,123
Thank you for your
hospitality, friend Powell.

1030
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:28,693
He's all yours.

1031
01:21:30,028 --> 01:21:31,259
- No.
- <i>Powell?</i>

1032
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,795
- <i>You have to stop them!</i>
- Powell!

1033
01:21:37,334 --> 01:21:38,700
Where's the Krazy Glue?

1034
01:21:38,702 --> 01:21:41,338
What, did she cut
the wire to the TV?

1035
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,306
Ron.

1036
01:21:43,308 --> 01:21:45,708
Charlie!

1037
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:46,776
Charlie!

1038
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:50,281
Nice! Reel-to-reel still works.

1039
01:21:51,116 --> 01:21:53,716
Where is
your sister?

1040
01:21:53,718 --> 01:21:57,053
Charlie's fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

1041
01:21:57,055 --> 01:22:00,890
She wishes not to be troubled.
Keep clear of her chambers.

1042
01:22:00,892 --> 01:22:01,926
What?

1043
01:22:06,197 --> 01:22:07,630
Charlie has fallen ill

1044
01:22:07,632 --> 01:22:10,500
and must stay in her bedroom
for the rest of the evening.

1045
01:22:10,502 --> 01:22:13,035
- She wishes not to...
- Otis!

1046
01:22:13,037 --> 01:22:15,205
Are you on drugs? Hmm?

1047
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:16,639
No, no. Mom, Mom, Mom.

1048
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:18,441
- Please stop. Stop!
- Charlie!

1049
01:22:18,443 --> 01:22:20,543
- Mom, there is no reason to go...
- Where is she?

1050
01:22:20,545 --> 01:22:22,647
- Mom, stop!
- Quit it, Otis.

1051
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:29,854
Where is she?

1052
01:22:31,022 --> 01:22:32,390
Uh...

1053
01:22:33,558 --> 01:22:34,859
Otis?

1054
01:22:37,362 --> 01:22:40,029
I found a tower
to transmit our message.

1055
01:22:40,031 --> 01:22:42,064
It's close.

1056
01:22:42,066 --> 01:22:46,769
Oh. B-127.
I almost forgot.

1057
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:48,070
I didn't.

1058
01:22:50,275 --> 01:22:51,810
No! Don't shoot!

1059
01:22:53,812 --> 01:22:55,111
No!

1060
01:23:10,662 --> 01:23:11,796
Bee!

1061
01:23:14,232 --> 01:23:15,767
Talk to me, Bee, talk to me.

1062
01:23:22,174 --> 01:23:25,042
I can fix this.
I can fix this.

1063
01:23:29,148 --> 01:23:30,280
Charlie.

1064
01:23:30,282 --> 01:23:33,749
You got to wake up, Bee.
You got to wake up.

1065
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:34,752
Please.

1066
01:23:36,588 --> 01:23:38,456
Charlie, we got to go.

1067
01:23:42,994 --> 01:23:44,261
- The gun.
- What?

1068
01:23:44,263 --> 01:23:45,831
The electric gun. Get it.

1069
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,601
I can fix you.

1070
01:23:52,104 --> 01:23:53,436
Come on, Bee.

1071
01:23:53,438 --> 01:23:54,939
Come back to me.

1072
01:24:01,112 --> 01:24:02,914
Come on, give me
the other one.

1073
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:10,890
Bee, come on.

1074
01:24:13,025 --> 01:24:14,793
I can't lose you, too, Bee.

1075
01:24:15,227 --> 01:24:16,628
Please, Bee!

1076
01:24:30,842 --> 01:24:31,844
I'm sorry.

1077
01:24:45,991 --> 01:24:47,126
Oh.

1078
01:24:56,835 --> 01:24:58,669
Oh, my God.

1079
01:24:58,671 --> 01:25:00,873
Come on, Bee, we've got
to get you out of here.

1080
01:25:13,085 --> 01:25:16,320
Charlie, there's like
a million guys out there!

1081
01:25:16,322 --> 01:25:18,621
We got to move, now.

1082
01:25:18,623 --> 01:25:20,759
Come on, Bee, you've gotta get up.
Can you get up?

1083
01:25:21,627 --> 01:25:23,629
There's a door in my way.

1084
01:25:26,065 --> 01:25:27,097
They've got bombs!

1085
01:25:27,099 --> 01:25:28,867
- We got to go.
- Bee, come on.

1086
01:25:30,836 --> 01:25:31,768
Charlie!

1087
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:33,138
You've gotta get up, come on.

1088
01:25:34,039 --> 01:25:35,638
- Three.
- Charlie!

1089
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,374
- Two.
- Come on.

1090
01:25:37,376 --> 01:25:38,474
One.

1091
01:25:38,476 --> 01:25:39,811
- Charlie!
- Come on.

1092
01:25:56,862 --> 01:25:58,063
Memo?

1093
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,401
Memo. Memo, wake up.

1094
01:26:06,005 --> 01:26:07,273
Easy.

1095
01:26:10,377 --> 01:26:11,577
Easy.

1096
01:26:14,146 --> 01:26:15,480
Hold your fire!

1097
01:26:15,482 --> 01:26:17,216
Get the kid out of here.

1098
01:26:18,517 --> 01:26:21,718
Memo! Wake up, Memo!

1099
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:22,986
Come on, kid.

1100
01:26:22,988 --> 01:26:24,156
Hey! No!

1101
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:26,058
Bee!

1102
01:26:26,291 --> 01:26:27,391
Run!

1103
01:26:29,527 --> 01:26:30,728
Bee!

1104
01:26:31,965 --> 01:26:33,164
Run!

1105
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:35,135
- Let go of me!
- You need to get away from that thing.

1106
01:26:38,103 --> 01:26:40,239
- Take it down!
- No, stop!

1107
01:26:41,774 --> 01:26:44,574
- Stop it!
- Contain it and dismantle it!

1108
01:26:44,576 --> 01:26:46,877
Strip it down to parts!

1109
01:26:46,879 --> 01:26:49,613
Leave him alone!
You don't understand.

1110
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,581
Fight back, Bee!

1111
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:55,019
- Bee!
- Kid, stop! It's a machine!

1112
01:26:55,021 --> 01:26:57,554
He's more human
than you'll ever be!

1113
01:26:57,556 --> 01:26:59,656
That is enough!

1114
01:27:22,614 --> 01:27:23,915
Oh, shit.

1115
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:36,161
Open fire!

1116
01:27:49,309 --> 01:27:51,277
Fall back! Take cover!

1117
01:28:06,925 --> 01:28:07,927
Bee!

01:28:35,221 --> 01:28:38,055
You remember, don't you?

1121
01:28:42,495 --> 01:28:44,097
They're coming back.

1122
01:28:49,402 --> 01:28:50,769
Oh, God.

1123
01:28:51,271 --> 01:28:52,738
Are you okay?

1124
01:28:53,373 --> 01:28:55,940
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1125
01:28:55,942 --> 01:28:57,911
We need to get out of here.

1126
01:28:59,012 --> 01:29:01,014
We've got to get you
someplace safe.

1127
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:06,884
Bee, stop. They will kill you!

1128

01:29:13,892 --> 01:29:16,762
Okay.
Then we fight.

1131
01:29:24,672 --> 01:29:26,638
Let's go, get in.

1132
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:30,877
Go on. I'll buy you
some time with these guys.

1133
01:29:41,787 --> 01:29:43,257
You just kiss me?

1134
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:45,756
On the cheek.

1135
01:29:45,758 --> 01:29:47,227
Still counts.

1136
01:29:53,634 --> 01:29:54,834
Still counts.

1137
01:30:04,577 --> 01:30:05,777
Halt!

1138
01:30:07,181 --> 01:30:08,513
Stop.

1139
01:30:13,354 --> 01:30:14,821
Well, that didn't work.

1140
01:30:21,662 --> 01:30:22,929
Move, move!

1141
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:40,847
Faster, Bee, faster!

1142
01:30:43,484 --> 01:30:45,349
We should really look
into getting seatbelts.

1143
01:30:45,351 --> 01:30:46,784
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

1144
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:49,053
It's okay. She's gonna steal the
robot back, fight off the police,

1145
01:30:49,055 --> 01:30:51,155
kill two bigger robots,
and come right back home.

1146
01:30:51,157 --> 01:30:52,223
Shut up, Otis.

1147

<i>Folks, this just breaking.</i>

1148
01:30:53,559 --> 01:30:56,662

Closer. Closer.

1152

You lose that car,

1153
01:31:15,749 --> 01:31:17,917
I will
personally rip your face off.

- Charlie!
- Mom?

1157
01:31:29,697 --> 01:31:31,896
You pull that car over
right this second.

1158
01:31:31,898 --> 01:31:34,065
This is very unsafe,
what you're doing.

1159
01:31:34,067 --> 01:31:35,900
Mom, you got to get
out of here, okay?

1160
01:31:35,902 --> 01:31:38,037
Whoa! Whoa!

Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing?

1168
01:31:59,926 --> 01:32:01,495
I saw this on <i>Miami Vice.</i>

1176
01:32:40,134 --> 01:32:43,135
Ron! We have
a kid in the car!

1177
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:46,003
I was trying to save
the other kid! What was I...

1178
01:32:46,005 --> 01:32:47,739
It was a lose-lose.

1179

Otis? Otis,
are you all right?

1180
01:32:51,812 --> 01:32:55,115
That was radical.

1182
01:33:43,997 --> 01:33:46,033
Okay. What's the plan?

1183
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:55,540
This is the plan? I hate this plan.

been a Camaro this whole time?

1235
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:20,522
Oh, my God!

1245
01:47:06,802 --> 01:47:08,338
Here you go, ma'am.

1246
01:47:16,446 --> 01:47:17,946
Baby.

1247
01:47:17,948 --> 01:47:19,881
Thank God you're all right.

1248
01:47:19,883 --> 01:47:21,118
Thanks for coming, Mom.

1249
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:28,724
That was some driving, Ron.

1250
01:47:28,726 --> 01:47:31,161
Well, I've taken a few notes.

1251
01:47:33,597 --> 01:47:34,797
Otis.

1252
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:37,867
They forced me to tell.

1253
01:47:40,237 --> 01:47:42,103
I'm glad they did.

1254
01:47:42,105 --> 01:47:43,775
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

1255
01:47:48,979 --> 01:47:50,414
Hey, Charlie.

1256
01:47:55,952 --> 01:47:57,554
I'll be right back,
okay?

1257
01:48:01,091 --> 01:48:04,492
Wow, um,
what happened to you today?

1258
01:48:04,494 --> 01:48:05,994
Oh, this?

1259
01:48:05,996 --> 01:48:10,335
Oh, you know, robot fights, high-speed
chases, international disasters.

1260
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:12,802
The usual.

1261
01:48:12,804 --> 01:48:14,369
- Right.
- Yeah.

1262
01:48:25,817 --> 01:48:27,248
Ooh, um...

1263
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:28,882
Yeah, hmm...

1264
01:48:28,884 --> 01:48:30,119
- Not quite there yet.
- Nope.

1265
01:48:30,121 --> 01:48:31,556
- Yep. Okay, okay.
- No. Yeah.

1266
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:54,143
Old friend,
you kept this planet safe.

1267
01:48:54,145 --> 01:48:59,248
Because of you,
we have a future, B-127.

1268
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,750
<i>My name...</i>

1269
01:49:00,752 --> 01:49:01,883
<i>Is...</i>

1270
01:49:01,885 --> 01:49:03,252
<i>Bumblebee.</i>

1271
01:49:29,079 --> 01:49:30,880
Let's see
if we got something.

1272
01:49:30,882 --> 01:49:33,418
Oh, my God, yes!

1273
