1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,240
This is New Berk
at Snoggletog.

2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,348
<i>The greatest time of the year.</i>

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,591
<i>The lights. The hunting songs.</i>

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,383
<i>The holiday shopping.</i>

5
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:19,226
<i>The yak nog shooters.</i>

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,823
- Another round!
- Make mine a double!

7
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,130
<i>The only thing missing, was dragons.</i>

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,038
<i>It's been ten years since Vikings
and dragons agreed to live apart.</i>

9
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:32,434
<i>But that doesn't mean we've
forgotten our flying friends.</i>

10
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,271
And the best part of it all, Nuffink,

11
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:36,904
- was on Snoggletog Eve...
- Yeah?

12
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,210
I'd make Toothless his favourite meal.

13
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,410
- What was it?
- Lake trout.

14
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,975
- Yeah?
- With a side of Sea trout.

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,180
- Yeah?
- On a bed of Brook Trout.

16
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:45,813
We all like trout.

17
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,652
Even though he's gone,
I still make it for him.

18
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,894
A lot of families do stuff like this.

19
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:54,460
It keeps our loved ones in our hearts,
even though they're far away.

20
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:58,298
So, wanna help me catch some fish?

21
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:00,462
Good on yea. We gonna feed Toothless.

22
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:02,130
I don't need a fishing pole, Dad.

23
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:04,504
I'll just butt the wee fishes
with my own wee head.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,776
Come on, Nuffink.
Let's get Toothless a snack.

25
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:14,083
<i>We were excited about making
a traditional dragon feast.</i>

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,346
<i>And then it hit me.</i>

27
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:21,647
<i>Not everyone was on board.</i>

28
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:23,425
<i>Yes, it worked.</i>

29
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:25,318
Zephyr. What are you doing?

30
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,955
Testing my dragon defense system.

31
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:31,168
You and all the grown ups in New Berk
are leaving them snacks.

32
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:32,258
What if one shows up?

33
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,771
That would be great. We love dragons.

34
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,998
Why? They're monsters.

35
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,275
<i>I found this in the attic.</i>

36
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:46,642
It was grandpa's.

37
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,152
How come you never told us
the truth about dragons?

38
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,712
But we did. Dragons are wonderful,
they're our friends.

39
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,050
Tell me this, are they giant?

40
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:58,561
- Well, yeah.
- Razor sharp teeth, breathe fire?

41
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,029
- I supposed so.
- Claws?

42
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,259
- That'd be yes.
- What happened to your leg?

43
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,796
That's what I thought.

44
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:07,836
Maybe we don't leave
fish snacks around to attract them,

45
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:10,806
cause you know who doesn't want to be
dragon dessert?

46
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:11,864
Me.

47
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,538
Nuffink, do you want to be dessert
for a dragon?

48
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:17,878
Me thinks I don't.

49
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,742
Let's kill the dragons!

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,080
How did this happen?

51
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:26,856
Our ancestors were terrified of dragons
because they didn't know them.

52
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,992
Astrid, we can not let our kids
go down that road.

53
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:33,789
Remember when we were kids,
back in Old Berk,

54
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,094
how we use to put on that pageant
at Snoggletog.

55
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,896
Oh yeah. Those were fun.

56
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,834
What if we brought the pageant back?

57
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:43,965
We showed the children of New Berk
how humans and dragons became friends?

58
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:45,470
That's a great idea.

59
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:47,875
But we've only got four days
until Snoggletog.

60
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,808
Three, if you don't count
Black Plague Friday.

61
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,711
Yeah, nothing gets done.

62
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,979
Everybody's just shopping and coughing.

63
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,382
I think we could do this.
Let's talk to Gobber.

64
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:07,263
- You got me.
- Kid can take a hit.

65
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,535
- Hey, are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

66
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:16,562
<i>Just, all this talk of dragons,
kinda makes me miss him.</i>

67
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,809
It's hard at the holidays, you know.

68
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,939
I wonder if Toothless ever misses me?

69
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,060
Hit his nose.

70
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:51,661
Yeah. It's two for me.

71
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:54,135
Curse ye hellions!

72
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:58,437
How dare ye desecrate the statue of
Stoick the Vast?

73
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,867
- Who?
- Stoick.

74
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,603
The bravest viking
in the history of Berk.

75
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,013
He put the "king" in Viking.

76
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,384
Oh my dear mate. I miss you so.

77
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,954
Remember the time we were
at that meat house

78
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,049
and those two
Visigoths wagered

79
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:19,585
I couldn't hold my left elbow
in a boiling pot of grill for 5 minutes?

80
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,492
Good times.

81
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,693
Ahem. Gobber.

82
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:24,694
Hey, kids.

83
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,863
I was just talking to a statue of your father
as if he were really here.

84
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,835
It pains me how the wee ones
of this town have forgotten Stoick.

85
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,743
I know. And Zephyr is afraid of dragons.

86
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:39,840
That's why we want to bring back
the Snoggletog Pageant.

87
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,544
You're in luck.

88
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,849
The script I wrote for the last pageant.

89
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:49,558
Die, you evil beasts
with twisted souls.

90
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:53,628
Vikings will forever swim in rivers
of your blood.

91
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:55,957
That's nasty.

92
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,500
This has not aged well.

93
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,527
We may need to start from scratch.

94
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,972
Why don't we show when everything changed?

95
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,234
Oh that would be fantastic.

96
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,303
- Like when I met Toothless and...
- Maybe more big picture, Honey.

97
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,938
When all Vikings and dragons
became friends.

98
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,680
Oh, Astrid, I love that.

99
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:15,582
I'll start writing immediately.
This is going to be just what we need

100
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,520
to honour our friendship with dragons
and of course...

101
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:22,158
my great friend, Stoick.

102
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:25,019
Okay.

103
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,404
Hiccup, I've been up all night.

104
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:11,330
It's just the first draft,
but I'm gonna be honest,

105
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:12,806
it's brilliant!

106
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,970
Toothless?

107
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,415
Pretty great, right?

108
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,009
Amazing!

109
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,276
Wait a minute, I've got an idea.

110
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,912
We should use this for the pageant.

111
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,580
Well, yeah, that's.. that's...

112
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,022
Gee, I never would've thought of that.

113
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,961
I'm gonna make him looks
so much like Toothless

114
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,227
Zephyr's gonna fall in love with him.

115
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,924
He's beautiful.

116
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:40,770
But cogs and gears can't bring back
the warmth of your friend's nose

117
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,430
or the light in his eyes.

118
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,336
Or the sound of your best friend's voice.

119
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,304
Yeah, I miss my dad too, Gobber.

120
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,344
Ah, we'll make them both proud.

121
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,816
<i>It was a couple of days before Snoggletog</i>

122
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,047
<i>and I was getting excited about the pageant.</i>

123
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:01,883
<i>And then it hit me.</i>

124
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,030
<i>Yes, it works.</i>

125
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,828
We're gonna catch a dragon, Dad.

126
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,799
Knock 'im cold so he can't eat us.

127
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,859
Zephyr designed the whole trap herself.

128
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,499
Ah, so proud.

129
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,265
Come on, Nuffink.
Let's set some traps outside.

130
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,934
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm gonna kill a dragon.

131
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,103
What did I say about using

132
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,804
- the good knives?
- A little help here...

133
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:24,108
- Kids...
- Has anybody...

134
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,207
- We're gonna catch a dragon!
- Okay. This pageant better work.

135
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,839
Coming through.

136
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,074
Great news, Chief.

137
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,175
After exhaustive casting,
we found our Hiccup.

138
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,084
Yeah. Gobber, actually, I wanted to ask you

139
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,453
about the whole Hiccup character
in the story.

140
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,492
Hiccup, present yourself.

141
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:12,921
- Tuffnut?
- Tuffnut, give us a taste.

142
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,257
A dragon is coming.

143
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,890
Help me. Help...

144
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,795
Line?

145
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,600
- "Me."
- Right.

146
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,965
Me.

147
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,908
Great. Now let's see you
run away in fear.

148
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,637
- Look at those knock knees.
- Okay...

149
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,307
- The splayed gait of a newborn lamb.
- I don't...

150
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,009
I do not run like that.

151
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,678
Do I run like that?

152
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,945
Which brings me to a bigger point.

153
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,350
I've read the script, Gobber.
And I have some notes.

154
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,854
I'm not sure the character of Hiccup
is coming through, uh,

155
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,927
quite as heroic as I was.

156
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:48,896
I was pretty heroic, no?

157
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:51,491
Oh, mate, I think we get the gist of it.

158
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,434
But thats not in any way.. me.

159
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,903
Hey, Hiccup, I was...

160
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,469
- Are you serious?
- Coming through.

161
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,183
Better luck next time, Haggis.
Nice effort.

162
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,449
Who's next?

163
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:20,428
Fishlegs Ingerman reading for the role
of Stoick the Vast.

164
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,228
If I don't return... Nope. Nope.

165
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,802
If I don't return,

166
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,504
know that all I am,
all I do,

167
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,338
is for you,

168
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,842
my precious Hiccup.

169
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,678
So, you thinking what I'm thinking?

170
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:44,286
Yes I am.

171
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:47,154
- This isn't working.
- What? Not working?

172
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,385
You're right. I should do it.

173
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,223
No, no, don't try and talk me out of it.

174
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,423
I knew Stoick best.

175
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,066
If I don't return,

176
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,596
know that all I am,

177
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,869
all I do...

178
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,805
I miss him so much.

179
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,142
Just need a moment.

180
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,942
We're doomed.

181
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,595
Gobber, the pageant's tonight. So...

182
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,102
Are you sure you're gonna be able
to do this?

183
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,365
I hoped it wasn't noticeable.

184
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:36,906
You know, it is. But...

185
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:40,443
<i>Gobber, think of the kids.
We're doing this for them.</i>

186
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:44,046
Aye, Hiccup. Brilliant, as always.

187
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,148
It's gonna be fine.

188
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:02,825
What?

189
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:05,657
Okay, people.

190
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,601
Two minutes to curtain.

191
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,864
Has anyone see my fur?

192
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:05,524
Hiccup, today is the day everything changes.

193
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,087
I have tamed a dragon.

194
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,897
I am so tiny and afraid.

195
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,397
What is that? What is that?
That never happened.

196
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,371
So Gobber took a few liberties.

197
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,241
I don't know. There were dragons
everywhere, and people doubting me.

198
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,576
Especially my own father.

199
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:27,139
And then I stood my ground
and touched one. I touch a dragon.

200
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,045
- That's hardcore.
- He's got the spirit of the story.

201
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,782
And that's what this pageant is really about,
isn't it?

202
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,050
Yeah. I guess so.

203
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:38,126
Hiccup, you are weak
and fear dragons.

204
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,160
I am strong and understanding.

205
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,927
Honey, I don't know if I wanna go through with this.

206
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,595
- You're on.
- Yeah, I, I... No, ah..

207
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:47,966
Astrid, I, I...

208
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,338
A dragon.

209
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,012
Here he is.

210
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,414
The Nightfury.

211
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,346
It's Toothless.

212
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,588
- Nope.
- Whatever.

213
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,398
This pageant is bringing up the feelings.

214
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:22,561
Stoick would've loved this.

215
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,705
The only thing vaster than his presence,

216
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,575
was his capacity for mirth.

217
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,451
Thank you, Love.

218
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:51,428
Brave Father, I remember your wise words.

219
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:53,863
Hiccup, you can be a giant.

220
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:56,997
But face thy enemies with care.

221
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:03,476
Hiccup, you can be a giant butt face.

222
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:15,047
Hiccup, you can be a giant butt face.

223
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:17,423
Don't panic.
It's just part of the show.

224
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,782
Do something!

225
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,254
I got it, maybe this one.

226
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,994
What? Why would you gave it
that functionality?

227
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,028
I'm on it.

228
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,930
I got it.

229
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,439
Oh oh no no no...

230
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,789
Gobber, is that you?

231
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,961
Thank you for helping out there.

232
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,292
What, did you have raw trout for lunch?

233
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:33,192
Let me just shift my weight
so I can...

234
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:36,127
Gobber?

235
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,800
How did you lose your last
two limbs, Gobber?

236
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,277
- Oh, it was a pageant.
- Gobber?

237
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,440
Hiccup?

238
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,955
Nice one, Hiccup.

239
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,201
Greetings, magnificent creature,

240
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:12,707
will you allow Stoick to tame you
with his gentle touch?

241
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:35,325
Let man and dragon be forever bonded

242
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,166
in trust and love.

243
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,910
Thank you. Thank you very much.

244
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,347
That was amazing.

245
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,650
I'm so excited,
I could fly!

246
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:03,418
It's just a show, Nuffink.
It's just dad in a suit.

247
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,859
Way to go, Dad!

248
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:08,524
<i>Hey, Dad. Dad?</i>

249
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,872
Hi.

250
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,643
A little help here. Gobber?

251
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,914
Anyone?

252
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:32,683
Literally anyone.

253
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,442
I love dragons, and I love Toothless.

254
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,276
He's beautiful.

255
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,909
Why didn't you tell me
you were really going to bring him here?

256
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,849
I have literally no idea
what she's talking about.

257
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:07,749
This whole thing was not what I expected.

258
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,256
I'm Stoick the Vast.

259
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,766
I'm Toothless.

260
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,401
Let's be friends.

261
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:24,767
You were right.
It was exactly what everyone needed.

262
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,907
For the kids,
and for the memory of my father.

263
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:35,613
Gobber, you have well honoured my father,
and your friend.

264
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,778
It was my deepest privilege to do so.

265
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:40,989
Thank you, Hiccup.

266
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,823
Well, guess I'll be heading home.

267
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,728
Alone.

268
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:51,592
The best Snoggletogs
are spent in solitary.

269
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,297
Caverness, silence.

270
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,770
- Gobber...
- Well if you're free tonight...

271
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:56,965
I'd love to.

272
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,097
Gobber, wait!

273
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:05,074
- Oh that's clever.
- And...

274
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,311
You're good.

275
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,345
So proud.

276
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,987
Look at that.

277
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,285
So cool.

278
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,220
It's beautiful.

279
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,353
Hiccup, did you do this?

280
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,124
- No.
- The bowl.

281
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,593
It's empty.

282
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,163
- Toothless?
- Can it be?

283
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,308
Toothless!

284
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,776
<i>And then it hit me.</i>

285
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:42,477
<i>Our loved ones are always nearby</i>

286
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,581
<i>when we hold them in our hearts.</i>

287
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,848
Maybe it's our turn to visit them?

288
