This is CNN breaking news.

Navy's Fourth Fleet

is deployed off
the southeastern seaboard

193
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,291
of the U.S. after last night's
sudden Godzilla attack.

194
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,083
A time of
relative peace shattered

195
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,582
when the massive Titan,

196
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,166
once thought to be
a hero to humanity,

197
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,374
made landfall
in Pensacola, Florida.

198
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,250
While the damage
was largely contained

199
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,000
to the U.S. headquarters
of Apex Cybernetics,

200
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,790
governments around the world
aren't taking any chances

201
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,000
after the first substantiated
Titan sighting

202
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,499
in over three years.

203
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:49,666
CEO Walter Simmons
had this to say.

204
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:53,624
It's about working together
to ensure a safer world.

205
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,166
Godzilla's a threat
to humanity,

206
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,166
and Apex has a plan
to deal with it,

207
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,333
-once and for all.

Students and faculty,
please be advised

00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,333

00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:11,333
[Bernie on speaker]
Welcome back, loyal listeners,

215
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,042
to Titan Truth Podcast,
episode 246.

216
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,624
Oh, my God. I was there.

217
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,416
Godzilla's Apex attack.
I saw it go down!

218
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,707
You think it's a coincidence
that he reappears

219
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,416
and just so happens to destroy
that specific facility?

220
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:27,208
Ha-ha, no, no, no, no.
No such thing as coincidence.

221
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,790
[Madison]
Dad, I'm telling you,
there's something

222
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:36,582
provoking him
that we're not seeing here.

223
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,042
Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

224
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,624
if there wasn't
another Titan around?

225
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:42,707
That podcast is filling
your head with garbage.

226
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,541
-You should be in school.
-I am just trying to help.

227
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,790
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

228
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:49,790
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

229
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:52,042
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

230
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,707
I don't have any more.

231
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,707
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

232
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,042
Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

233
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,416
How could you doubt him?

234
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,083
-There has to be a pattern.
-There doesn't.

235
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,125
-A reason why he was provoked.
-There isn't.

236
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,416
How do you know that?

237
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,374
Because creatures,
like people, can change.

238
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,874
And right now,
Godzilla's out there

239
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:11,000
and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

240
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,707
So cut your pop some slack,
would ya?

241
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,250
See you at home, Dad.

242
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,166
[Bernie] You wanna know
my theory?

243
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, of course you do.
That's why you're here.

244
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,499
Come on, it's all about
patterns and variables.

245
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:29,291
Oh, wait, stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back

246
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:31,083
to sixth grade with this,
okay?

247
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,582
Godzilla attacks when
provoked, that's the pattern.

248
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,291
Pensacola is
the only coastal Apex hub

249
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:37,541
with an advanced robotics lab.

250
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:38,874
That's the variable.

251
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:40,707
And add them up
and your answer is

252
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,416
that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.

253
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,582
-[faint beep]
-[door closes]

254
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:01,832
Can I help you?

255
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,291
If you want an appointment,

256
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:06,790
my office hours
are nine to five.

257
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:09,624
-[Walter] Please, Dr. Lind.
-What the f...

258
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,957
Guys like you and me,

259
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,042
we don't do normal hours,
do we?

260
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,291
I've been fixated
on Hollow Earth

261
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:19,790
for as long as you have.

262
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:22,874
Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans

263
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:24,166
is fascinating.

264
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,208
Your book was very impressive.

265
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,166
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
about 30 unsold boxes

266
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,832
in my apartment
if you want some.

267
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,000
[chuckles]

268
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,957
Walt Simmons.

269
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,832
I know who you are, sir.
It's an honor.

270
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:39,499
No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

271
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:42,874
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

272
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:45,874
These are dangerous times,
Dr. Lind.

273
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:47,333
Allow me to introduce

274
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:51,125
our Apex chief technology
officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

275
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,624
He has an interesting thing
to show you.

276
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,666
[beeps]

277
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,749
Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

278
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:05,374
You know what this is, right?

279
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,790
[Nathan] Hollow Earth.

280
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:10,166
[Walter] An ecosystem
as vast as any ocean,

281
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,749
right beneath our feet.

282
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,125
This energy signal
is enormous.

283
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,624
And almost identical
to readings from Gojira.

284
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:23,957
[Walter] As our sun
fuels the planet's surface,

285
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,333
this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth,

286
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:31,125
enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

287
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,166
If we can harness
this life force,

288
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,832
we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

289
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,083
I need your help to find it.

290
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,458
[chuckling]

291
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,832
I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

292
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,208
Did you read the reviews?

293
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,250
"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

294
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,874
Look where they put my office.

295
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:56,291
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

296
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:59,083
Besides, I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

297
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,499
And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

298
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,541
We tried.

299
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,582
I'm sorry about your brother.

300
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,582
He was a true pioneer.

301
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,749
Thanks.

302
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,749
[sniffles, clears throat]

303
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,624
See, all of our forward scans

304
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:23,000
suggest a habitable
environment down there.

305
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:28,749
So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

306
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,250
When they tried to enter,

307
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,957
they hit
a gravitational inversion.

308
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:39,333
A whole planet's worth
of gravity

309
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,541
reversed in a split second.

310
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:46,291
They were crushed
in an instant.

311
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,624
What if I told you
that we, at Apex,

312
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:53,790
have created
a phenomenal craft

313
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:56,499
which could sustain
such an inversion?

314
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,749
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicle.

315
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,541
HEAV.

316
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:07,666
We can make the journey

317
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:10,042
to Hollow Earth possible,
Dr. Lind.

318
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,666
But we need you
to lead the mission.

319
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,541
Help me.

320
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,499
Help everyone.

321
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:27,000
Finding this needle
in a haystack

322
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,333
is our best shot
against Godzilla.

323
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:33,208
Well, I, uh,
might have an idea.

324
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:35,166
But it's crazy.

325
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,874
I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

326
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:42,874
[Nathan] Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

327
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:45,749
It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

328
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,874
to return
to their evolutionary source.

329
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:49,291
Like spawning salmon.

330
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:53,582
Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

331
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,874
So if this is the Titans' home

332
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:58,083
and this life force
sustains them...

333
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,000
A Titan
could show you the way.

334
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,666
[Nathan] Yeah.

335
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:05,790
With a little help
of an old colleague.

336
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,790
[grunts softly]

337
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,582
[Ilene] Ugh, where is it?

338
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,666
[receptionist] Dr. Andrews,
you have a visitor
waiting for you at security.

339
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:48,541
[in sign language]

340
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,582
[sighs] Okay.

341
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,416
[chuckles softly]

342
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,250
[thunder rumbles]

343
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,416
[Ilene] A power source
in Hollow Earth?

344
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,707
This sounds nuts, Nathan,
even for you.

345
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,707
[Nathan] It's there! We just
need Kong to bring us to it!

346
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,291
[Ilene] The second you take
Kong out of containment,

347
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:18,832
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

348
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:20,374
[Nathan] You said you can't
keep him here forever.

349
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,416
No. Our meddling
has already wreaked havoc

350
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:23,624
on Kong's habitat.

351
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:25,125
No way am I
letting you drag him

352
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,832
halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

353
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,291
[Nathan] No, not as a weapon.

won't cut it.

531
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:58,250
I need my bleach in bulk!

532
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,374
Because spy dust
is real, people!

533
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,083
I mean, come on,
invisible to the naked eye...

534
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,790
-[turns off stereo]
-That's how we find him.

535
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:05,790
-The bleach.
-Bleach?

536
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,790
He consumes a ton of bleach.

537
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:09,333
He drinks bleach?

538
00:31:10,374 --> 00:31:11,749
Showers with it.

539
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:14,624
Oh! Yeah, I shower
with bleach. No, what?

540
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,582
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

541
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,083
See? Tradecraft.

542
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,749
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

543
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,291
[Madison] Come on,
just one more place.

544
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:32,874
Madison, this is getting old.

545
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,250
Hey, you sell bleach?

546
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,458
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

547
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,250
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

548
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,957
I didn't know
they were gonna eat them.

549
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:43,291
I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

550
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:44,707
Look, we're looking for a guy

551
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,291
who works
for Apex Cybernetics.

552
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:49,208
Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

553
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,666
He's probably paranoid,

554
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,957
high-strung,
doesn't like daylight.

555
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:55,083
You know, has a lot of crumbs
in his beard,

556
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,291
if he has a beard.

557
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,915
Okay, look,
you kids want some candy?

558
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,666
Because I can help you
with candy.

559
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:03,000
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

560
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,499
Yeah, we want lots of candy.

561
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,874
What are you doing?
You think...?

562
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:11,250
Oh, you mean Bernie.

563
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,250
Yeah, I know that guy.

564
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,874
He buys,
like, a ton of bleach.

565
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:16,374
I know where he is, too.

566
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,666
If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

567
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,707
[banging on door]

568
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,374
[Madison] Bernie?

569
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,000
[Bernie] Mister...
[clears throat] Mis...

570
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,333
-[thud]
-[Bernie groans]

571
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:27,749
[in deep voice]
Mister Bernie not home.

572
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:29,125
Yep, that was
definitely Mister Bernie.

573
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,624
Yeah. Um...

574
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:35,000
Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.

575
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,125
[Bernie] No. No. No.

576
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:41,000
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

577
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,208
[Josh] For knocking on a door?

578
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:43,499
[Bernie chuckles] No. No.

579
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:45,666
Bernie, you don't trust
the authorities.

580
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,666
My name is Madison Russell.

581
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:50,707
My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

582
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,915
Emma Russell, right?

583
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,624
Before we go any farther,
I got one question.

584
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,915
Tap or no tap?

585
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,541
No tap.

586
00:33:01,624 --> 00:33:03,957
-Excuse me, what is "tap"?
-Water.

587
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,250
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

588
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,083
Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

589
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,790
Oh, I drink tap water.

590
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:13,166
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

591
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,749
But she does the thinking
for both of you,

592
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:16,707
so it should be all right.

593
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,624
-Thanks.
-Okay.

594
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:19,832
What you got?

595
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,166
I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks

596
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,499
haven't just been random.

597
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:26,499
I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

598
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:28,042
I'm of the same opinion.

599
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,458
But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

600
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,083
For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

601
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,250
trying to figure out
what their game was.

602
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,832
Then, last week...

603
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,042
I saw this.

604
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:43,416
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

605
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:44,915
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong,

606
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,374
which makes no sense

607
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,291
because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

608
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:49,624
-Then what?
-And then boom!

609
00:33:49,707 --> 00:33:51,416
Godzilla shows up.

610
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:52,915
Caved in half the facility,

611
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,749
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

612
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,416
which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

613
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:58,458
I mean, some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

614
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:00,749
Yeah, but what is that?

615
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:06,083
That's, um...

616
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,874
That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

617
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:12,250
Yeah, but it's
in a gun holster.

618
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,333
It was a gift from my Sara.

619
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,499
You have a Sara?

620
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:17,125
She was my wife.

621
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,291
Um, she passed on.

622
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,790
[Bernie sighs]

623
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,499
She was my rock.

624
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:26,915
My truth.

625
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,042
I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

626
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:32,083
that's the day
you know I've given up.

627
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,915
[Madison] Bernie.

628
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,790
I think we can
help each other.

629
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,166
Okay, I guess
now that we're a team,

630
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,624
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

631
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:51,000
We're breaking into Apex.

632
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,208
-[Josh] Wait, what?
-[Bernie] You heard her.

633
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,000
Tap water.

634
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,541
Shit.

635
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,790
[groans]

636
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,000
[grunts contentedly]

637
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,707
[Ilene] Hey.

638
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,083
[in sign language]

639
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,042
Thank you.

640
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:13,000
How is she?

641
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:16,083
Calm. So calm, it's scary.
[chuckles]

642
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,250
That was extraordinary.

643
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:22,083
I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

644
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,707
I thought that he showed
recognition, but he never...

645
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,707
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

646
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,083
No.

647
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,291
I knew that they had a bond.

648
00:36:31,374 --> 00:36:32,832
He trusts her.

649
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:35,125
Without her, he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

650
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:39,915
You know, Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

651
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,125
When the storm
took over the island,

652
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,957
it wiped out
the native people.

653
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:45,416
But Kong saved her.

654
00:36:45,499 --> 00:36:47,582
She had nowhere to go.

655
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,083
So I made a promise,

656
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,666
then and there,
to protect her.

657
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:55,915
And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

658
00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:01,125
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

659
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:04,707
No.

660
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,458
If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

661
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,749
Yeah, no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

662
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,832
And she's a child.

663
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,083
[distant, muffled pulsing]

664
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:35,707
[muffled groaning]

665
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:43,166
[Nathan] I know
Jia is only a child.

666
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,166
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

667
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,291
And we need Kong
to find that power source.

668
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:54,000
The world needs him.

669
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:57,582
[alarm blaring]

670
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,291
[muffled moaning]

671
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,042
[indistinct shouting]

672
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:08,707
What's she saying?

673
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,915
Godzilla.

674
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,374
[roaring]

675
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,957
[urgent chatter]

676
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,458
-[Kong grunts]
-[metal clangs]

677
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:20,874
Did we change course?

678
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:22,749
No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

679
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:24,749
It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.

680
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:26,042
[Ilene] He's not coming for us.

681
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,416
Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

682
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:30,707
How about we throw you off
instead, huh?

683
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,624
[roars]

684
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:33,874
We have to release him.

685
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:35,458
If we lose Kong,
the mission is over.

686
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:36,832
He's a sitting duck out there.

687
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,874
We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

688
00:38:38,957 --> 00:38:40,790
[weapons firing]

689
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:42,790

[Godzilla groans]

701
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,790
[Ilene] Oh, my God, Jia!

702
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:36,000
Nathan?

703
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,874
[roars]

704
00:41:04,957 --> 00:41:06,374

[Godzilla screeches]

718
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,416
He needs our help.

719
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:31,541
There must be some way
to disorient Godzilla.

720
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:33,250
Depth charges.

[Nathan] He's circling back.

728
00:45:45,749 --> 00:45:48,832
This won't end

730
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:53,374

-What?

731
00:45:53,915 --> 00:45:55,208
All of it.

732
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:57,000
Guns, engines.

733
00:45:57,083 --> 00:46:00,042
-Shut it down. Right now.
-If we do that, we're dead.

734
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,832
No, we're playing dead.

735
00:46:01,915 --> 00:46:03,790
And we're making him think
that he's won.

[mic whines]

737
00:46:07,707 --> 00:46:10,166
Cut the power.
Cut the engines.

[Ilene] As soon as we move,
he'll be back.

745
00:47:20,957 --> 00:47:23,624
How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

746
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,416
How's Kong with heights?

747
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:44,083
So, what's the plan?

748
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:46,790
[Bernie] We find out
what's on Sublevel 33.

749
00:47:46,874 --> 00:47:48,042
-[bottle clinks]
-[Josh] Ow.

750
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,957
Keep it moving, tap water.

751
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,374
Go ahead.

All right, Mad Hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

754
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,208
Okay. We got this.

755
00:48:09,874 --> 00:48:11,125
Oh, my God!

756
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,291
[Josh] Are you sure
we can trust this guy?

757
00:48:12,374 --> 00:48:13,790
Yeah, why?

758
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:15,458
Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

759
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:16,832
and carries
a bottle of whiskey

760
00:48:16,915 --> 00:48:18,915
from his dead wife like a gun.

761
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,666
I think it's romantic.

Whoo-hoo!

769
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,624
[Josh] Uh, what are
we looking at?

770
00:48:57,707 --> 00:49:00,125
[Bernie] No, no, no, no.
No, it was here.

771
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:03,000
I swear to God, it was...
it was right there.

Anyone know
where this leads to?

775
00:49:10,957 --> 00:49:12,208
You believe me, right?

776
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,749
'Cause I know that
there was something here.

777
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:16,666
[Josh] I'm gonna get a migraine
from that torch.

778
00:49:16,749 --> 00:49:20,166
"Sublevel." How deep
does this thing go, Bernie?

779
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,458
Hell. Goes to hell.

What is all this?

787
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,208
It's breakaway civilization.

788
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:46,707
I mean, come on.
This is page one

789
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,541
in the Apex-playing-God
handbook. Huh?

790
00:49:49,624 --> 00:49:52,749
I mean, the Illuminati
running shadow economies

791
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:55,083
all to fund a hidden colony

-[engine humming]
-No way. No, no, no. Come on.

Okay, guys,
I think we're moving.

810
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,374
It says we're headed

-[Bernie] Hong Kong.

813

get some answers.

It's not working.

Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

834
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:01,666
What if she tells him

835
00:54:01,749 --> 00:54:03,624
there are others
down there like him?

836
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:05,790
But you don't know that.

837

We lost our entire fleet
getting here.

There's no way back for him.

839

This is HEAV 3,

893
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,250
we're getting some
strange radar activity.

894
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:50,874

Kong's on the move.

915
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:25,790

Well, he seems to know
where he's going.

919
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,666

Yeah.

Oh, no!

942
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:16,208
It's just so massive.
It's so stupid.

943
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:17,915
So, what is this place?

944
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,166
Well, if there's
a corporate-friendly term
for "sacrifice pit,"

945
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,749
I'd say we are in it.

That's robot Godzilla.

966
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:09,083
Oh, no. That's...

967
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,042

[Walter] Oh, I know.

988
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,291
As expected.

989
01:07:37,374 --> 01:07:38,874
Don't worry.

991
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,749
our power troubles

will once again...

01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:57,582
be the apex species.

997
01:07:57,666 --> 01:08:01,624
This is why Godzilla attacked
the Apex facility.

1003
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,042
[tech on radio] Sir,
Godzilla just made
an abrupt change

1004
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,749
in direction.
He's moving very fast.

1005
01:08:37,832 --> 01:08:40,166
Projections show he's likely
headed to Hong Kong.

1006
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,208
Transport is ready and waiting

We were right.

1019
01:11:08,749 --> 01:11:10,166
He's home.

1020
01:12:33,832 --> 01:12:35,582

All personnel must display

[Josh gasps]

1026
01:12:46,707 --> 01:12:48,749
[Bernie] The exit's this way.

1027

Guys. Madison!

1028
01:13:00,749 --> 01:13:02,582
Oh, my God.

1029
01:13:04,874 --> 01:13:07,291
[Bernie] Bitch, what?

1030
01:13:07,374 --> 01:13:08,832
[Josh] It's a Titan skull.

1031
01:13:08,915 --> 01:13:12,125
[Bernie] No, no, no.
That's not just any Titan.

1032
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:13,707
That's Monster Zero.

1033
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:16,166
[gasps] Ghidorah.

1034
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:22,458
[Bernie]
They hardwired its DNA.

01:13:26,832 --> 01:13:28,915
[Josh] Okay, I'm smart,
but I only go to high school.

1038
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,291
-It's a living supercomputer.
-[Josh] Shh.

1039
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,291
[gasps in disbelief]

1040
01:13:34,374 --> 01:13:36,666
[Bernie] It had three heads.

1041
01:13:36,749 --> 01:13:37,957
Its necks were so long,

1042
01:13:38,042 --> 01:13:40,291
they communicated
telepathically.

1043
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:41,749
And there's one here

1044
01:13:41,832 --> 01:13:43,707
and another one
inside of that thing.

1045
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:46,208
Yeah, it could be
a psionic interface.

1046

[exclaims] Oh, my God.

1047
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,458
[whispers] Careful.

1048
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:52,624
[Madison] It's a pilot.

1049
01:13:52,707 --> 01:13:55,957
[Bernie] Yeah.
He's in a trance.

1050
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:57,915
That's a psionic uplink.

1051
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:01,499
It follows his will.

1052
01:14:01,582 --> 01:14:03,957
Oh, Apex, what have you done?

I've given the order, Doctor.

1067

[Ilene] It's the axe.

It's drawing radiation
from the core

1069
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:59,166
