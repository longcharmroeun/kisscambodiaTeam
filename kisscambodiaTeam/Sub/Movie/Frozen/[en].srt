because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

bless the marriage, and...

Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?

809
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,660
Yeah.
Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,

810
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:54,745
and then she tried to walk away,

811
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:55,787

Yes. Pay attention.

But the thing is,
she wore the gloves all the time,

817
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,425
so I just thought,
maybe she has a thing about dirt.

warn you about strangers?

1080
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:28,711
It's too steep.

1081
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:31,255
I've only got one rope and you don't
know how to climb mountains.

1085
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:39,430
I'm going to see my sister.

1086

You're gonna kill yourself.

- I wouldn't put my foot there.

- Or there.

Elsa even wants to see you?

1094
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:57,699
Nobody wants to be alone.

Except maybe you.

1096
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:02,453
I'm not alone. I have friends, remember?

1098
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,375
Yes, the love experts.

Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,

1106
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:23,182
but I found a staircase that leads exactly

1107

No, no, no. It's okay.

without hurting anybody.
