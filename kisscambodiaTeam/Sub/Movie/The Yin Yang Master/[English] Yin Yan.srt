3
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,791
YIN YANG MASTERS USE
THE DOCTRINE OF FIVE ELEMENTS

4
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,166
TO DISTINGUISH MEN FROM MONSTERS.

5
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,458
RIGHTEOUS MEN GATHER
IN THE YIN YANG BUREAU

6
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,833
TO TRAIN AND CAPTURE EVIL SPIRITS.

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,833
Qingming.

8
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,750
What have you done?

9
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,125
Cimu…

10
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,041
was killed.

11
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:19,916
Cimu.

12
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,791
What did you do to Cimu?

13
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,541
It's not me.
A monster broke out of the Subduing Cell.

14
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,083
It stole the Scale Stone.

15
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,416
So many people are dead.

16
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,250
Why are you the only one alive?

17
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,375
It wasn't me.

18
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,083
-I didn't do it.
-You will never change.

19
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,416
You are the true monster.

20
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,250
No…

21
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,250
No, I'm not!

22
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,125
Baini.

23
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,500
What happened?

24
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,041
Qingming killed Cimu
and tried to steal the Scale Stone.

25
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:04,875
That's impossible.

26
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,166
-It can't be him.
-He has already fled.

27
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,916
You can't be the chief
if you can't tell right from wrong.

28
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,791
The bellflower bracelet.

29
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,333
SEVEN YEARS LATER

30
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:43,458
PINGJING CITY

31
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,125
<i>When Pangu opened the heavens</i>

32
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,166
<i>men and monsters coexisted in harmony.</i>

33
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,541
<i>But the evil monster, Xiangliu,</i>

34
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,125
<i>claimed to be the Monster Emperor.</i>

35
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,458
<i>This nine-headed serpent</i>

36
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,958
<i>hypnotized other monsters</i>

37
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,291
<i>and ravaged human lands.</i>

38
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,208
<i>Fortunately, Yin Yang Masters fought back</i>

39
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,541
<i>and created a powerful weapon,</i>

40
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,625
<i>the Tushan Sword.</i>

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,833
<i>They decapitated Xiangliu</i>

42
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,916
<i>and drove back the monsters.</i>

43
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,083
<i>From then on, the worlds of men
and monsters were separated.</i>

44
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,041
<i>Humans lived within the city,</i>

45
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,791
<i>while monsters lived in the Monster Realm.</i>

46
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,291
<i>Each side kept to its own.</i>

47
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,125
<i>Any monster that crossed the border</i>

48
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,250
<i>would be seen as a remnant
of the Monster Emperor.</i>

49
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,083
<i>They would be captured immediately</i>

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,375
<i>and imprisoned in the Subduing Cell.</i>

51
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,125
{\an8}Move aside.

52
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,791
{\an8}Capital Guards are under orders
to escort tributes out of the city.

53
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,375
{\an8}Move aside.

54
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,750
{\an8}Capital Guards are under orders
to escort tributes out of the city.

55
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,416
MONSTER REALM IS DANGEROUS

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
LEAVE AT YOUR OWN RISK

57
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,083
It's the ghost festival period now.

58
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,625
Yet our Captain volunteered
to deliver the offerings.

59
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,250
This is simply

60
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,541
looking for trouble.

61
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,125
I agree. Why must we do this errand?

62
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,666
It's the Yin Yang Bureau's job.

63
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,208
There's something in the forest.

64
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,625
Who is it?

65
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,625
Go!

66
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:09,791
Look here.

67
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,875
If you dare to mess
with the Capital Guards,

68
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,791
this is what will happen to you.

69
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,208
Good!

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,416
Sword!

71
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,875
Give me the sword!

72
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,791
Those are imperial tributes.

73
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,750
How dare you!

74
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,958
I'm just a passerby.

75
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,916
Let's help each other.

76
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,583
Good sir.

77
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,916
You're welcome.

78
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,000
Hey!

79
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,916
What are you doing?

80
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,583
Hey!

81
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,166
I helped to get rid of the monsters.

82
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,166
It's nothing.

83
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,791
I'm not asking for payoffs.

84
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,416
I'll just pick a few things here.

85
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,458
No one is paying you.

86
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,333
Who…

87
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,291
Sir.

88
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,083
You are in the wrong here.

89
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,708
Those who escaped monsters' fangs

90
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,458
usually show their gratitude.

91
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,500
This took me a while, but you

92
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,166
are being stingy.

93
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,125
These are imperial tributes.

94
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,333
We can't give them away.

95
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,083
The three ferret monsters knew you.

96
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,458
Perhaps,

97
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,458
you are a monster in human guise.

98
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,708
Sir.

99
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,708
You are being small-minded.

100
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,500
No more excuses.

101
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,250
Judgment awaits you.

102
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,375
Sir, if you keep pestering,

103
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,625
you will fall

104
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,458
as soon as you take a step.

105
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,833
You are with the Yin Yang Bureau.

106
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,958
You dare knowingly break the law?

107
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,541
Evil thief!

108
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,875
What's your rank in the Yin Yang Bureau?

109
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,083
Tell me your name!

110
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,458
My name

111
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,875
is Qingming.

112
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,666
Qingming?

113
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,541
I'll never forget you.

114
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,458
I feel bad to see you fall.

115
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:19,958
That will be all

116
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,250
for today.

117
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,583
The Capital Guards,

118
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,208
where the hell are they?

119
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,958
Master doesn't like us
to keep things for ourselves.

120
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,916
Will we get busted for stealing this much?

121
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,666
Don't say a word.

122
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,333
Don't mess around.

123
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,125
There are more here?

124
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,750
YIN YANG BUREAU

125
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,708
YIN YANG BUREAU

126
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,875
SCALE STONE WARD

127
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,916
Something is wrong in the Subduing Cell.

128
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,166
SUBDUING CELL

129
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,833
Move aside.

130
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,208
Return to purity,

131
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,125
seal!

132
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,541
-Monsters have broken in.
-Chief.

133
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,666
Who is guarding the Scale Stone?

134
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,083
-Sunless day, moonless night.
-Sunless day, moonless night.

135
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,958
-All laws unravel, all gods retreat.
-All laws unravel, all gods retreat.

136
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,625
-Order to break.
-Order to break.

137
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,750
Return to the right path,
purity inside out.

138
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,750
Order to seal.

139
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,500
About nine <i>li</i>
to the northeastern direction.

140
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,541
{\an8}Take it out.

141
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,083
What is that?

142
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,708
The Scale Stone.

143
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,750
{\an8}It's so shiny.

144
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,458
{\an8}It's precious.

145
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,041
Don't touch the Scale Stone.

146
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,250
I got you.

147
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,666
-It's mine.
-I saw it first.

148
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,708
Let go!

149
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:37,958
Ferret monster.

150
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:38,875
Put it down!

151
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,166
Stop!

152
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,458
What happened to you?

153
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,333
I have failed and should be punished.

154
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,541
I took the Scale Stone
from the Yin Yang Bureau,

155
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,500
but I ran into three ferret monsters.

156
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,541
I don't know whose order they followed,

157
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,500
but they took the Scale Stone and fled.

158
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,916
"Three ferret monsters"?

159
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
Those must have been Qingming's.

160
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,916
He saw through my plan.

161
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,416
How could you ruin

162
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,250
something so simple?

163
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,333
The Raven Hound twins.

164
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,583
The best fighters in the Monster Realm.

165
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,166
Everyone says you both are invincible.

166
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,625
But it seems like

167
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,791
both of you are unremarkable.

168
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,166
The Scale Stone has been removed
from the Ward.

169
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,416
Raven Hound, your trip was worth it.

170
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,708
You can rest now.

171
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,708
<i>Do it again.</i>

172
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,166
<i>Don't stop.</i>

173
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,416
<i>Lift it higher.</i>

174
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,416
<i>Stab forward.</i>

175
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,083
<i>Stab sideward.</i>

176
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,125
Taking the tribute isn't enough.

177
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,750
Master expects greater things from you.

178
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,041
Lift it higher.

179
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,916
We practice

180
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,041
and train for the battle

181
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,750
to prepare for the future.

182
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,416
Lift your arms.

183
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,291
Use your strength.

184
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,958
Where are you aiming at?

185
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,958
If it wasn't for Master who took you in

186
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,458
as familiars,

187
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,791
each and every one of you

188
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,166
would still be strays

189
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,416
and bullied by all.

190
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,541
Come.

191
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,375
Stab forward.

192
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,291
Again.

193
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,833
Where did you go?

194
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,166
What's the matter?

195
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,791
Stop.

196
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,125
Someone fell. Who fell?

197
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,250
He ate something.

198
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,500
And you hit someone.

199
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,708
<i>We meet again,</i>

200
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,166
<i>Qingming.</i>

201
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,833
<i>The Scale Stone has finally left
the Yin Yang Bureau's control.</i>

202
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,458
<i>You must help me return to the world.</i>

203
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,500
<i>This is your destiny.</i>

204
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,875
<i>Do you understand?</i>

205
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,583
<i>Qingming.</i>

206
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,208
Light of the North Star,

207
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,875
order to seal.

208
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,583
Did something go wrong?

209
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,833
Look after the Ferrets.

210
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,541
It's about the Scale Stone.

211
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,291
I'm going to the Monster Realm.

212
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,791
<i>The bureau lost the Scale Stone</i>

213
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,916
<i>and Subduing Cell has been
in chaos ever since.</i>

214
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,875
<i>The Protectors used spells
to contain them.</i>

215
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,625
<i>It took them all night.</i>

216
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,041
<i>I refuse to believe it is a coincidence.</i>

217
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,416
Qingming's monsters

218
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,208
stole the Scale Stone.

219
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,291
Evidently,

220
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,500
he failed seven years ago

221
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,875
and now he wants payback.

222
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,541
The loss of the Scale Stone is a disaster.

223
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,083
It's hard to guard
against traitors from within.

224
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,125
If there was no traitor within the bureau,

225
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,791
how else could
the Raven Hound break the seal

226
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,583
and use our spells to destroy the Tower?

227
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,625
The Scale Stone was just stolen,

228
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,666
but the ferret monsters acted right away.

229
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,958
The bureau should have captured
that traitor years ago,

230
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,208
but Chief is softhearted.

231
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,541
Xican.

232
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,875
The thief now leaves unpunished.

233
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,166
Elder, you don't need to worry
about my past with Qingming.

234
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,583
-It's a reminder--
-Elder Xican.

235
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,708
Please mind your words.

236
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,583
I will handle this issue.

237
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,166
<i>A hundred years ago,</i>

238
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,583
the elders at the bureau

239
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,083
sacrificed their lives

240
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,333
one after another

241
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,583
to cut off the head
of the monster named Xiangliu.

242
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,166
But the serpent has nine heads

243
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,000
and its power was great.

244
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,083
Although its body was destroyed,

245
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,291
its power was not so easily dispersed,

246
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,583
so it was refined into
the Scale Stone in the end.

247
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,833
The Scale Stone was sealed
within this Tower.

248
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,500
{\an8}Hence, defending the Tower

249
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,375
{\an8}and keeping the Scale Stone safe

250
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,125
{\an8}is the Yin Yang Bureau's
greatest responsibility.

251
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,583
It will be up to you in the future.

252
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,375
You can never be careless in your duties.

253
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,250
Cimu.

254
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,875
Please lead everyone
in the protection spell chant.

255
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes, Elder.

256
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,458
<i>Black Turtle holds the north,
Vermilion Bird calms the south.</i>

257
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,291
-Black Turtle holds the north,
-Black Turtle holds the north,

258
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,000
-Vermilion Bird calms the south.
-Vermilion Bird calms the south.

259
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,166
Return to the right path,
purity inside out.

260
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,083
-Return to the right path,
-Return to the right path,

261
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,625
-purity inside out.
-purity inside out.

262
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,083
<i>Qingming.</i>

263
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,625
<i>-Don't chant along with them.</i>
-Order to seal.

264
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,041
-<i>You are a monster,</i>
-Order to seal.

265
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,750
<i>a monster with my blood.</i>

266
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,750
<i>-Release me</i>
-Black Turtle holds the north,

267
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,750
<i>-and join me.</i>
-Vermilion Bird calms the south.

268
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,375
-No!
-Vermilion Bird calms the south.

269
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,875
What's wrong?

270
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,375
Qingming.

271
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,666
<i>-Qingming.</i>
-Qingming, stop playing around.

272
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,166
-This is the Scale Stone Ward.
<i>-Qingming.</i>

273
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,166
He's a half-monster.

274
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,250
He carries the blood of monsters.
Did it call out to you?

275
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,041
What did Xiangliu say to you?

276
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,583
That's nonsense.
Qingming will be a Yin Yang Master.

277
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,083
He was an abandoned infant
who came from nowhere.

278
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,375
The bureau only kept him

279
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,291
-to check on him.
-Silence, all of you!

280
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,958
-That's an order.
-Baini, you are not the chief yet.

281
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,166
-You can't order--
-Shut up.

282
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,166
Sit down.

283
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,208
-Yes, Cimu.
-Yes, Cimu.

284
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,500
Qingming.

285
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,583
Qingming!

286
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,208
Return to the right path,
purity inside out.

287
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,125
Order to seal.

288
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,250
Qingming.

289
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,416
Do not speak

290
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,375
of what happened today.

291
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,708
-Yes, Cimu.
-Yes, Cimu.

292
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,791
Whether you are a man or a monster,

293
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,166
you must control yourself.

294
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,625
Otherwise,

295
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,125
you will destroy yourself.

296
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,458
TOMB OF CIMU

297
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,041
Cimu.

298
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,833
I won't let you die in vain.

299
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,333
Qingming didn't leave us with any choice.

300
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,833
Yin Yang Bureau should be ashamed
for not capturing the traitor

301
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,458
for the past seven years.

302
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,125
We will scour the entire Monster Realm

303
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,708
to bring him in.

304
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,000
COURT OF THE GUARDS

305
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,166
<i>Give us the order.</i>

306
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,541
<i>What order?</i>

307
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,416
For us to go to the Yin Yang Bureau,

308
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,083
arrest the monster thief,

309
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,291
and retrieve the tributes.

310
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,083
There was an emergency
at the Yin Yang Bureau last night.

311
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,166
How would they have time
to bother about the tributes?

312
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,666
I hereby order

313
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,291
Seventh-Rank captain Yuan Boya

314
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,583
to be suspended for investigations.

315
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,250
If he does not return
the tributes within three days,

316
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,833
confiscate his possessions.

317
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,750
You tried hard to think of ways
to achieve your ambitions.

318
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,333
See what happens now.

319
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,958
You don't know your limits.

320
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,625
I'll bring that monster back here.

321
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:12,791
You'll see.

322
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,750
<i>Sir, I'll be honest with you.</i>

323
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,791
I have always received
my goods from Yanyan Le.

324
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,500
What? Who is he?

325
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,000
A mystic and an expert on monsters.

326
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,791
-"Expert on monsters"?
-Yes.

327
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,083
-Come.
-Take a look!

328
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,958
His tent is over there.

329
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,666
Ask him about Qingming if you want.

330
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,458
Quit wasting your breath.

331
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:38,375
Hurry up and talk.

332
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,708
There is no road to the Monster Realm.

333
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:44,250
-Will you talk or not?
-That's painful!

334
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,291
No.

335
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:56,875
You who are in there.

336
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,666
I'm Yuan Boya of the Capital Guard.

337
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:00,791
I'm here on court orders.

338
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,125
Where are your manners?

339
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,708
The burning big incense stick outside
means we have guests.

340
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:09,791
You can't just barge in here.

341
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,250
Are you that mystic named Yan Lele?

342
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,916
I'm here to ask you about someone

343
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,916
called Qingming.

344
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,500
Do you know where he lives?

345
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:19,750
The one you are asking about

346
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,416
is the Yin Yang Master, Qingming.

347
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,541
That's him. I fought with him last night.

348
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,708
He fled in defeat,

349
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,750
-so I must bring him in.
-Liar!

350
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,666
Don't hide back there.

351
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,958
Come out here and talk!

352
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:34,916
How dare you

353
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,416
attack an imperial official!

354
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,666
I'm going to take you in.

355
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,125
If you can't even beat me,

356
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,833
why would Qingming flee then?

357
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,541
Are you Yan Lele?

358
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,416
I'm the only one who gets to talk here.

359
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,083
I'm here to find Yan Lele. Hurry--

360
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,500
Shut up!

361
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,583
His name is Yanyan Le.

362
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,000
Isn't that what I just said?

363
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,291
You are not very smart
for a Capital Guard.

364
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:08,791
That's why I need you.

365
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:10,750
Are you going to tell me? Or should I

366
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,583
-No.
-use my umbrella again?

367
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,041
It's right behind me,

368
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,875
inside that pile of fur.

369
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,250
If you had said this earlier,
I wouldn't have hurt you like this.

370
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,750
Not just anyone can enter
the Monster Realm.

371
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,375
The map won't help you.

372
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,958
How does Qingming get in and out then?

373
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,708
Qingming is a half-monster.

374
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,916
-"A half-monster"?
-And he has the bureau's spells.

375
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,416
"Spells"?

376
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:40,375
I have a spell.

377
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:41,833
You have a spell?

378
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,500
I…

379
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,291
-Where is it?
-You…

380
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,000
Untie me.

381
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,000
Untie me.

382
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,041
My young captain,

383
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,833
I can see that you're something special
and not ordinary at all.

384
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,833
Stand back!

385
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,250
This is it.

386
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,041
Sir.

387
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,958
I, Shenle, am willing to help you
get into the Monster Realm

388
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,375
and arrest Qingming.

389
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,500
If I get to the Monster Realm,

390
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,708
will I be able to find Qingming?

391
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,916
I knew right from the start
that he was a bad guy.

392
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,583
But he turns out to be
the son of a man and a monster?

393
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,583
<i>What do you know?</i>

394
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,791
<i>Qingming's bloodline is rare.</i>

395
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,291
<i>Only he can command monsters.</i>

396
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,375
All right.

397
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,625
He chose to be a monster
when he could be a man.

398
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:43,916
The next time I see him,

399
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,458
I'll kill him immediately.

400
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,958
<i>Here. Check the map.</i>

401
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:50,333
Just how much farther is it?

402
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,375
How can I check when I'm tied up?

403
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,333
I tied you up to protect you.

404
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,541
<i>The map says to walk</i>

405
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,666
<i>about 35 </i>li <i>past the Temple of Earth</i>

406
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,166
and we'll see the statues at the entrance.

407
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,958
CRUMBLING CLIFF

408
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,208
See, we are here.

409
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,583
This…

410
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,500
It looks like we found the entrance.

411
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,750
The problem is…

412
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,375
How can we cross?

413
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,250
Hey, you.

414
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,416
Give me the spell.

415
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,541
Hurry up.

416
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,208
A halo of golden light engulfs me.

417
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,500
Flying within and beyond the three realms.

418
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,500
The sun travels and the shadow changes.

419
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,291
A halo of golden light engulfs me.

420
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,666
Flying within and beyond the three realms.

421
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,250
The sun travels and the shadow changes.

422
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,208
The spell. Why…

423
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,791
Why did it burn away? You…

424
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,375
You are a liar!

425
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:31,583
-Come--
-You are the liar.

426
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,250
You don't even have a badge.

427
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,458
Behave yourself.

428
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,125
-Stop messing around.
-Let me go!

429
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,333
Isn't this a path?

430
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,500
It takes some time, you know.

431
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,083
Don't make a fuss if you know nothing.

432
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,791
Are you coming or not?

433
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,416
The bridge will disappear
if you don't come now.

434
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,416
"Disappear"?

435
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:51,125
There is no way you knew this was here.

436
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,416
What is that?

437
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,416
Plum leaf water.
It covers the human scent.

438
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,875
Why didn't you do it earlier?

439
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,416
I was so excited, I forgot about it.

440
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,333
Give me some.

441
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,458
Here we are.

442
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,583
{\an8}The Red Tower.

443
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,625
{\an8}The one in charge of the Monster Realm,

444
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,291
the Port Master, lives here.

445
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,875
Qingming does business with him.

446
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,375
Fish-eye earrings.

447
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,583
How much is it?

448
00:34:58,666 --> 00:34:59,916
Can you focus here?

449
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,833
How does it look?

450
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,125
It's horrible.

451
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,125
Qingming won't show up at this time.

452
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,208
Go to the bridge and check
if you are worried.

453
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,666
Hey!

454
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,166
Take a bite.

455
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,041
It's all right.

456
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,416
What is it made from?

457
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
-Jeez. You--
-Go away.

458
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,083
All right.

459
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:15,375
Here. Try putting this belt on.

460
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:17,708
What is this?

461
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,000
A present.

462
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,375
You look handsome.

463
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,833
I like it.

464
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,916
We have serious things to do

465
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,916
-and you are confessing--
-Master!

466
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,125
Master, I'm Shenle!

467
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,583
The thief?

468
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,583
Master.

469
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,625
Master, I've finally found you.

470
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,208
This is a gift I bought for you.
Please accept it.

471
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,000
I can finally capture you, thief.

472
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,458
Go away.

473
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,208
Stay away from my master.

474
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,041
Master, this Capital Guard
is trying to harm you.

475
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,000
I came to warn you.
Remember my contribution.

476
00:36:58,916 --> 00:36:59,916
You monster thief

477
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and freak.

478
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,833
I, Yuan Boya, am taking you in.

479
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:04,750
{\an8}What's your name again?

480
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,291
{\an8}Yuan Boya.

481
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,208
{\an8}I'm a Seventh-Rank captain. Hey!

482
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,125
{\an8}-Give it back…
-Is your name written like this?

483
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,416
{\an8}Let go.

484
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,041
Are you using monster magic again?

485
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:23,750
It's familiar spell.

486
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,291
-What spell?
-Familiar spell is cast on you.

487
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:26,208
What spell?

488
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,250
Master, cast it on me too.

489
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,708
-I'm willing to give my life to you.
-I can't control my limbs.

490
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:36,416
-Free me from it!
-Master!

491
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,375
Master.

492
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,458
Master…

493
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,083
What are you doing?

494
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,416
Hey, stop it!

495
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,666
-Thieving monster!
-Master!

496
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,041
Master!

497
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:50,708
Master.

498
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,125
Thieving monster, remove it!

499
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,666
Let go of me, Yuan Boya!

500
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,791
An honored guest has arrived.

501
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,958
I'm honored to welcome you.

502
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,291
We were apart for one day,

503
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:09,708
but it feels like forever.

504
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,291
Your familiars sent me two carts
of tributes just yesterday,

505
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,208
and you are here in person today.

506
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,125
Could it be

507
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,583
that you have brought me another treasure?

508
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,541
This time,

509
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,916
I have come to get something.

510
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,416
Everything changes

511
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,916
and change brings opportunity.

512
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,708
So tell me, what do you want?

513
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:31,666
The Tushan Sword.

514
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,958
Mentioning it is taboo here.

515
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,208
How can I have it?

516
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:41,958
Think twice before you answer.

517
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,041
My precious treasures!

518
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,375
Back then, you swore your loyalty
to the Yin Yang Bureau.

519
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,333
They lent you the sword
to lead the monsters,

520
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:49,875
but you have only made it your own.

521
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:52,666
Stop playing dumb.

522
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,041
It's a trivial matter.

523
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,833
I'm surprised you remember it.

524
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:08,666
The Tushan Sword killed
the Monster Emperor a hundred years ago.

525
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,958
The Monster Realm has never recovered.

526
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,375
The Monster Emperor is dead

527
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,625
so everyone has forgotten about the sword.

528
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:17,000
What would you need it for?

529
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,125
The monster's body may be dead,
but its soul still lives.

530
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,291
It doesn't hurt to be prepared.

531
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,125
I can't offend the Yin Yang Bureau.

532
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:27,333
I'm warning you.

533
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,791
Don't overstep your bounds.

534
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,750
You are in the Monster Realm,

535
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,500
which is my domain.

536
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,375
I have the final say.

537
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,541
Don't break anything.

538
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,875
You have to negotiate to do business.

539
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,375
You can't leave me at a loss.

540
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,375
I'll give you two live humans.

541
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,250
"Two live humans"?

542
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:55,791
Would you be more amenable

543
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:56,750
about the deal?

544
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,083
Master!

545
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,083
Master!

546
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,000
Master!

547
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,166
Master, look here!

548
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,416
Master!

549
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,541
Hey!

550
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:26,458
Help!

551
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,375
Help!

552
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,541
Where did this come from?

553
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,583
It doesn't look like a monster at all.

554
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:54,250
Yuan Boya, be careful!

555
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,208
What are you doing?

556
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,291
-Let her go!
-You should worry about yourself!

557
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:05,291
My fellow monsters.

558
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,666
This is an unprecedented fight
between a man and a monster.

559
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,250
A fight until death.

560
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:13,208
It is an amazing sight to behold.

561
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,000
Hurry and place your bets!

562
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,833
You are a capital guard, right?

563
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,500
Fight with all you got,

564
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,875
or your friend will pay the price.

565
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,916
I present to you the Evil Red Ghost.

566
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,458
He has never left the arena since birth

567
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,166
and he has never lost a fight.

568
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,208
Only one of you

569
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,208
may leave this arena alive.

570
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,833
{\an8}The more Red Ghost gets hit,
the bigger he becomes.

571
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,375
That is his ultimate tactic.

572
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,000
It's no wonder why he never loses.

573
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:03,875
The Tushan Sword's energy is too great.

574
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:05,875
I won't be going in.

575
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:48,541
You came here quickly.

576
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,041
Who knew the Yin Yang Bureau
was so capable?

577
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:06,708
The light shines.

578
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:07,791
Open.

579
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:33,958
Master's spell?

580
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,333
Three Thousand Miles of Universe, break!

581
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,875
I hope you're doing well.

582
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,458
I'm not here to reminisce.

583
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,000
Return the things

584
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:30,416
that do not belong to you.

585
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,083
Freeze!

586
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:18,250
So, you want this sword too?

587
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,166
Stop playing dumb.

588
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,541
I want the Scale Stone.

589
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:23,833
"The Scale Stone"?

590
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,000
What does that have to do with me?

591
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,625
Stop pretending.

592
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:28,875
Talk to your Ferrets.

593
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:30,791
"My Ferrets"?

594
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,666
Although they are mischievous,
they won't steal the Scale Stone.

595
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:37,083
Do you trust your monsters that much?

596
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,875
Of course.

597
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,708
I've made them my familiars.

598
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,458
They are not hateful monsters.

599
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:49,958
Familiars go through life and death
with their masters

600
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:52,041
and never betray them.

601
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,458
That's what you taught me.

602
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:31,500
Its nose!

603
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:32,416
Hit its nose!

604
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:05,166
Nicely hit!

605
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,958
What kind of fight is this?

606
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:09,458
It's a scam!

607
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:17,666
End it!

608
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,083
Loser!

609
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:21,833
Kill it!

610
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:25,875
Finish it!

611
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:26,833
Kill it!

612
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,375
The rules state

613
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:32,708
that only the winner can leave.

614
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:58,625
Let's go!

615
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:02,333
Stop them!

616
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:05,041
Don't let them escape!

617
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,000
Be careful!
This guy is hard to fight against!

618
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:09,750
Where are you going?

619
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:13,625
Don't move!

620
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,166
Be careful!

621
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:11,750
-The Tushan Sword!
-Why is it here?

622
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:35,916
This monster is helping you!

623
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I don't need its help!

624
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:43,416
Whoever brings back the sword
will be rewarded.

625
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,208
Monster thief!

626
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:04,708
You are walking into your own trap.

627
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:06,625
Capital Guard.

628
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:10,083
That thing you are carrying
is worth more than your life.

629
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,291
Give it to me.

630
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,791
-Is it yours?
-It is mine.

631
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,458
You lost something
and now you are worried?

632
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:19,791
Hurry up and give it to me.

633
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:22,375
Come with me to the Court of the Guards
and prove my innocence.

634
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:25,500
All right.

635
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:28,125
Yin Yang Bureau is here!

636
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:39,958
Chief.

637
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:45,625
Baini!

638
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,000
Baini.

639
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:13,416
Follow them quickly!

640
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:36,041
Why did it follow us?

641
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:42,541
This…

642
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,125
What is this place?

643
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,583
This is Master's home.

644
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,333
The stolen tributes
are definitely here then.

645
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:06,791
No, we are on the same side.
Don't hurt each other.

646
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,541
Although you followed Master,
we are not friends.

647
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,541
I don't want to be your friend.

648
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:14,958
I recognize all your faces for sure.

649
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:17,708
You are the filthy monster thieves
who stole my tributes.

650
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,083
Who are you calling a thief?

651
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,041
I'll rip your mouth!

652
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:22,750
Shut up.

653
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:24,708
Pretty monster,

654
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:26,750
please forgive this fool.

655
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:28,500
They are guests.

656
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:33,791
Let them in.

657
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:34,833
All right.

658
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,625
Thank you, miss.

659
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,250
We will just look around.

660
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,000
We won't cause any trouble.

661
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:22,500
Baini.

662
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:27,708
Is there still a place for me
in the bureau?

663
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:32,958
What is this?

664
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,208
It's a token of my trust.

665
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:36,041
These are for girls. I don't want it.

666
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:38,375
This bellflower bracelet
makes you my familiar.

667
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,583
This spell is to be used on monsters.

668
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,583
I'm human.

669
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,583
You are a half-monster. That counts too.

670
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:44,916
I'm not a monster!

671
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,500
I'll never be a monster!

672
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:48,750
Qingming, it's all right to be a monster.

673
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:51,125
Be my familiar, and I'll be your master.

674
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,083
Don't you know?

675
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,916
If a monster has a master,

676
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,583
it has a home,

677
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,333
so it will never turn evil.

678
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,833
In that case,

679
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,791
I,

680
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:08,833
Qingming,

681
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,833
from this day forward

682
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:12,458
will be the familiar of Baini.

683
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:15,208
{\an8}Our alliance is sealed.

684
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,458
{\an8}Let's live and die as one,
and never betray each other.

685
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,833
<i>Never betray each other.</i>

686
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,041
Be careful with your wound.

687
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:42,375
I promise

688
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:44,583
that I'll help you find the truth.

689
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:45,833
Your promises

690
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:47,625
are worthless.

691
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,166
If you don't believe me,

692
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:52,083
why did you save me?

693
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm looking for the Scale Stone.

694
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:57,458
Everyone knows you and your monsters

695
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,875
are stealing everywhere.

696
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:01,375
You must be involved.

697
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:02,708
All the monsters here

698
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:03,958
are like me.

699
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,375
They can't enter Pingjing City

700
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,208
and they don't belong
in the Monster Realm.

701
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,166
They don't have a home.

702
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,541
Theft and robbery

703
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:12,666
are for survival.

704
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,583
{\an8}-We have no choice.
-So now you stand with the monsters.

705
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,458
{\an8}You and I made an oath together long ago.

706
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,000
You chose to go astray

707
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:22,958
and ruined everything.

708
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:32,583
{\an8}<i>I left the Yin Yang Bureau</i>

709
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:33,875
{\an8}<i>as a last resort.</i>

710
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,666
{\an8}<i>That night, seven years ago,</i>

711
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,916
{\an8}<i>it was my turn to guard
the Scale Stone seal.</i>

712
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,333
{\an8}<i>I ran into Cimu.</i>

713
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:42,541
Qingming.

714
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,666
<i>As always,
he showed concern for my situation.</i>

715
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,583
Cimu.

716
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:50,750
Are you still bothered by Xiangliu?

717
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:55,208
The ghost festival

718
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,000
brings extra discomfort.

719
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,666
Thank you for teaching me
the protection spell.

720
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:01,333
I often chant it recently.

721
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:05,166
Stay away from trouble.

722
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,666
If you truly lose control one day,

723
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,666
it would be better
to reverse the spell and self-destruct

724
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,250
than to let Xiangliu possess you.

725
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,166
"Reverse the spell"?

726
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,666
I'll guard the Ward
instead of you tonight.

727
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:36,291
<i>But unexpectedly,</i>

728
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:38,291
<i>the monster's voice that night</i>

729
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,875
<i>was especially powerful.</i>

730
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,291
<i>I knew</i>

731
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,625
<i>that something had happened.</i>

732
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,583
The Tower.

733
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:01,166
<i>My comrades' bodies were everywhere.</i>

734
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,500
<i>I tried to find Cimu,</i>

735
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,208
<i>but the Tower had already melted.</i>

736
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,166
<i>The evil in the Scale Stone</i>

737
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,541
<i>drove me insane.</i>

738
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,875
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

739
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,875
<i>Poor Qingming.</i>

740
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:28,833
<i>You are treated as an outcast
in the human world,</i>

741
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:31,333
<i>but little do you know</i>

742
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:33,916
<i>that you belong to a rare
and treasured bloodline.</i>

743
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,458
Purity inside out.

744
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:36,916
Order to seal.

745
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,750
<i>Don't bother with that useless spell.</i>

746
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,833
<i>You are a monster,</i>

747
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:45,583
<i>a monster with my blood.</i>

748
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,041
<i>Yet another thief for the Scale Stone.</i>

749
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,000
<i>It was the Snow Lady.</i>

750
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:57,000
<i>She should be locked in the Subduing Cell.</i>

751
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:59,083
<i>How did she get into this place?</i>

752
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,041
Cimu.

753
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,750
-Cimu!
-Qingming, go!

754
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:05,208
<i>That was the last time I saw Cimu.</i>

755
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,166
<i>I was forced to act in defense,</i>

756
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:20,750
<i>but I ended up watching Cimu</i>

757
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:22,625
<i>being shattered into pieces by me.</i>

758
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:25,041
<i>The Snow Lady also disappeared.</i>

759
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:35,291
I desperately tried to find the Snow Lady
in the past seven years.

760
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,250
"The Snow Lady"?

761
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,208
Who else besides you

762
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:40,375
could send monsters to get past the seal?

763
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,166
Cimu died because of you seven years ago.

764
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:45,958
Now, seven years later,

765
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:47,875
more tombstones have been raised
because of you.

766
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,875
You are not innocent.

767
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,041
If you are so sure,

768
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:56,791
why do you still have this token?

769
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,875
It's this thing again.

770
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,958
Something is wrong.

771
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:21,958
Don't touch anything in the courtyard.

772
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:24,750
I just did.

773
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:26,541
Maybe the stolen tributes are inside.

774
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:32,208
It's not your turn.

775
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,916
<i>Qingming.</i>

776
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:20,750
The Tushan Sword!

777
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,708
The Ferret has mutated.

778
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:26,416
Stab him!

779
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:11,250
What more do you have to say?

780
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:18,083
If the Yin Yang Bureau had done its job,

781
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:20,125
the Ferret wouldn't have
ended up like this.

782
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,291
I won't pester you today.

783
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:28,541
I'll let your monsters have
a few more days of peace.

784
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,333
But when I return,

785
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:31,833
I'll destroy this courtyard.

786
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:53,791
My brother.

787
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:56,208
This token of you and Master,

788
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:58,541
I'll leave it with you.

789
01:05:58,625 --> 01:05:59,958
You were Master's familiar

790
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,000
until death.

791
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,208
{\an8}Every monster needs a master

792
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:04,416
{\an8}in its life.

793
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:06,083
If it has a home,

794
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:08,833
it will never turn evil.

795
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:13,000
But back then,

796
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:15,916
my fellow monster sisters

797
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,291
didn't even get a proper burial.

798
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,833
"Your monster sisters"?

799
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,458
I was an orphan.

800
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,416
I had to beg for food.

801
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,166
One time,

802
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,583
I was chased by a dog.

803
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:29,000
In the end,
I passed out in front of a house.

804
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,208
I remember how good it smelled.

805
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,166
It filled me with energy

806
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,291
and my wounds didn't hurt at all.

807
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,291
You must have been dreaming.

808
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,083
It was better than a dream.

809
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,666
That place was called the Courtyard.

810
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,166
"The Courtyard"?

811
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:49,166
Isn't that a famous brothel?

812
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:52,916
How could a brothel be good?

813
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:54,875
It was great

814
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,250
because they treated me well.

815
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:12,375
When I was seven years old,

816
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:15,416
the Yin Yang Bureau came.

817
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,000
Those people said my sisters

818
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:19,791
were monsters lurking in the city,

819
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:21,458
and they must leave Pingjing City.

820
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:24,208
Those who cooperated were sealed away.

821
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,458
And those who fought

822
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:27,833
were killed.

823
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:33,166
But among them,

824
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,916
there was this young man.

825
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:37,416
He was also trembling.

826
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,583
He was a Yin Yang Master,

827
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:43,208
but he didn't harm my sisters.

828
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,666
Instead, he picked me up.

829
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:49,750
He also picked up my sisters' umbrellas.

830
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:52,833
Since that day,

831
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:55,000
I saw him as my master.

832
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:57,458
Wherever my master goes

833
01:07:58,625 --> 01:07:59,833
will be my home.

834
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,625
I'm no one's master.

835
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,000
Must you interrupt now?

836
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,583
You are the problem.

837
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:11,125
If you are a monster,
why are you acting like a Yin Yang Master?

838
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,958
If you are a human,

839
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:15,041
why would you keep all these monsters?

840
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:17,375
-It's ridiculous.
-We were both abandoned.

841
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:19,666
Why must we insult each other?

842
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:21,166
How can you compare me to you?

843
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,500
Aren't we both

844
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,541
oddballs that got expelled?

845
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,541
I…

846
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,333
Come.

847
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:30,166
Let's drink.

848
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,000
What's the matter?

849
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,000
Are you afraid that I've poisoned it?

850
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,833
-I'm not afraid of you.
-Yuan Boya.

851
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,083
Stop it.

852
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:43,875
Let's drink.

853
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,000
I'm not afraid.

854
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:47,291
Stop getting into trouble.

855
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,708
The chief left with serious wounds.

856
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,916
I've already cast a spell to stop her.

857
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,791
The Scale Stone must not be returned
to the Yin Yang Bureau.

858
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:38,916
After this round,

859
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,291
I'll take you back

860
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:41,500
and close the case.

861
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:45,333
Even the person closest to me

862
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:47,250
said that I betrayed her,

863
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,875
yet you still believe

864
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,583
that I'll keep my promise.

865
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,500
You promised me.

866
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,750
Are you going to break it?

867
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,333
If you have any gratitude,

868
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:59,166
you should toast to my master now.

869
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,708
Did you think you can defeat Red Ghost?

870
01:10:02,458 --> 01:10:04,708
It was my master's spell that helped you.

871
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:12,125
Hurry up and take off this spell.

872
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:15,041
A grown man wearing a red thread

873
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,708
is embarrassing.

874
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,416
Don't be an ingrate.

875
01:10:19,291 --> 01:10:20,708
Master, I want it.

876
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,250
That's not a familiar spell.

877
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,166
That red thread

878
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,333
is just the master's joke on him.

879
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:29,625
So, you fooled me?

880
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:31,916
-It isn't a spell?
-Only monsters can be familiars.

881
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:33,916
It's impossible for humans.

882
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:36,791
-That's all right.
-We, humans,

883
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,916
don't even qualify to be familiars?

884
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,708
The human heart changes easily.

885
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:43,166
A sealing alliance that lasts until death,

886
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,875
how could a human manage that?

887
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,000
Don't look down on humans.

888
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:49,625
If you say we are mean,

889
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:53,625
then your master is half-mean.

890
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,916
And if I say monsters are fools,

891
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,708
then your master is half a fool.

892
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,125
He is that

893
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:05,958
mean and foolish

894
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,208
freak.

895
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:10,166
Well said.

896
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:13,375
I really am a freak.

897
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:17,375
From one freak to another, let's toast.

898
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,750
I'm a freak as well.

899
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:21,125
I should have a drink too.

900
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,291
Foolish monster.

901
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,375
You little monster.

902
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:36,250
Would you like a drink?

903
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:39,250
-You are a fool.
-Little monster.

904
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,250
Why am I here?

905
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,666
-Chief.
-Chief.

906
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,250
-Chief.
-Chief.

907
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:10,166
Chief.

908
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,208
We rushed here once we had located you.

909
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,375
Chief, are you all right?

910
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,541
It is dangerous here.

911
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:18,666
We shouldn't stay.

912
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,750
Take this.

913
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,291
It's the Scale Stone.

914
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,250
Return it to the bureau.

915
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:32,583
Watch out!

916
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,541
Behind you!

917
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,041
The Scale Stone is important.

918
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:34,291
Chief, please go.

919
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:33,708
Baini!

920
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:40,291
It's you again.

921
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,125
What a misfortune to see you.

922
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:45,250
If you can kill her

923
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,416
and retrieve the Scale Stone for Master,

924
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:50,291
you'll surely be rewarded.

925
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,791
The grudges from seven years ago.

926
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:54,875
Let's…

927
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:57,083
settle them today.

928
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,250
Come with me if you want your revenge.

929
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,208
It's my fault for not trusting you.

930
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,125
The Scale Stone is still here.
We can still win this.

931
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:16,875
Snow Lady mentioned a master.

932
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,958
-I'll investigate it.
-Qingming.

933
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:23,833
When this is over,

934
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:26,708
this bellflower bracelet

935
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:29,416
will be yours once again.

936
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,250
Without this bracelet,

937
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:38,125
you are still my master.

938
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,583
Let's live and die as one,

939
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,833
and never betray each other.

940
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,041
I'll be back.

941
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:10,791
Where is your master?

942
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,250
There is no need to rush.

943
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:16,541
You will bow to him soon.

944
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:19,791
The entire world will bow to him.

945
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:33,875
Who is it?

946
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,958
The Scale Stone doesn't belong to humans.

947
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:38,833
It should be returned to where it belongs.

948
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:41,958
Where does it belong to then?

949
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:44,833
To the world's
most powerful monster, of course.

950
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,041
Whoever your master is,

951
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,500
today, the old debts must be paid.

952
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,916
You fool.

953
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:45,041
The master took good care of you
in the bureau.

954
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,333
Weren't you always

955
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:50,083
grateful for this?

956
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,958
Cimu.

957
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,583
I joined the bureau at the age of nine.

958
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:09,166
At the age of 30,

959
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,458
I became the youngest Protector.

960
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:13,666
But what did it matter?

961
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,500
My future
at the Yin Yang Bureau meant nothing.

962
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,333
The mundane attachments,

963
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:20,458
in my eyes,

964
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:21,958
are mere distractions.

965
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:24,750
I know you are obsessed with Qingming,

966
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:28,583
but I have my own obsessions.

967
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,833
<i>That scorned monster only exists</i>

968
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:38,708
<i>to show the greatness
of the monsters' power.</i>

969
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,958
<i>If the young Qingming had such power,</i>

970
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:51,458
then with Xiangliu's aid,

971
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:55,125
what could possibly be out of reach?

972
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:57,541
What I need

973
01:18:58,416 --> 01:18:59,500
is…

974
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:01,583
the Scale Stone's power.

975
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:13,666
Cimu.

976
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,250
Master Cimu

977
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,041
<i>is our savior.</i>

978
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,666
Do you hear my master's call?

979
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,875
Nonsense.

980
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:05,083
That night,

981
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,458
Cimu died

982
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,000
right in front of me.

983
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,416
It was a simple illusion.

984
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:19,250
Master.

985
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:21,791
SNOW LADY

986
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:36,625
I, Snow Lady, hereby vow

987
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,208
that I will serve

988
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,375
Master Cimu forever.

989
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,541
He has succeeded.

990
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,125
I…

991
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:51,333
I cannot live

992
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:53,583
until the day I witness

993
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,833
my master rule over all.

994
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:21,416
Mother.

995
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,583
Mother, I'm so scared.

996
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,458
Mother, hurry up. I want to go home.

997
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,416
I long for a world
under the Monster Emperor's rule,

998
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,333
but I was born at the wrong time

999
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:46,125
and became the bureau's lackey.

1000
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:48,750
If the Monster Emperor returns,

1001
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,625
I will sacrifice my life for him.

1002
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:01,791
Where is my wine?

1003
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:03,958
Wine…

1004
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:05,541
-Why are you still lying there?
-Wine…

1005
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:08,125
Hurry up
if you don't want to be barbecued.

1006
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:09,958
-Hurry up.
-Wine…

1007
01:23:10,041 --> 01:23:11,375
-He is heavy.
-Barbecue?

1008
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:12,583
Where is the barbecue?

1009
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:18,333
Let's go.

1010
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,083
What…

1011
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:22,458
What is going on?

1012
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,333
What happened?

1013
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:28,291
What are you distributing?

1014
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,500
Attach the spell to your nostrils

1015
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:33,916
to avoid mutation.

1016
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:37,833
-Give me one.
-Humans don't need it.

1017
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:39,500
Why?

1018
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:40,791
Again, you are excluding us.

1019
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:43,208
An evil monster
has obtained the Scale Stone

1020
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:45,125
and opened the gates to Monster Realm.

1021
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:47,541
The monsters are going to invade us.

1022
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:48,458
Invade?

1023
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:50,250
Why are they invading?

1024
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:52,250
Master didn't forget his responsibilities.

1025
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:53,500
He prepared you for war.

1026
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:54,791
In the face of this danger,

1027
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:57,166
we must protect Pingjing City

1028
01:23:57,708 --> 01:23:59,041
on Master's behalf.

1029
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,291
"Pingjing City"?

1030
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:02,166
Who will invade Pingjing City?

1031
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,583
Today is the day.

1032
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:05,750
-Guard the Spirit Bridge.
-"Guard the Spirit Bridge"?

1033
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:06,666
Familiars,

1034
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,458
fight with your lives.

1035
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:17,375
The courtyard is destroyed.

1036
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:19,750
There's no way out.

1037
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,583
Hey!

1038
01:24:29,041 --> 01:24:30,666
Shenle! Where are you all going?

1039
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,375
They are using this excuse to flee.

1040
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,000
You are not one of us.

1041
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:37,708
Go back to the Capital Guards.

1042
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:41,250
You're right.

1043
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:42,583
I'm not one of them.

1044
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:48,750
What?

1045
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:49,875
What do you mean?

1046
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:52,666
Keep an eye on them?

1047
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:55,041
I should do that.

1048
01:24:58,875 --> 01:24:59,833
Hurry up.

1049
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,208
<i>Cimu,</i>

1050
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:36,166
I have a question for you.

1051
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,583
We are not at the Yin Yang Bureau.

1052
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:42,083
Addressing me like that

1053
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:45,083
is inappropriate.

1054
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,333
Seven years ago,

1055
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:49,125
as a Protector at the Yin Yang Bureau,

1056
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:50,458
you colluded with Snow Lady

1057
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:53,541
<i>and killed other Protectors</i>

1058
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,041
<i>to steal the Scale Stone.</i>

1059
01:25:58,291 --> 01:25:59,458
Order to break!

1060
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:07,125
Master.

1061
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:08,875
Humans can't handle the Scale Stone.

1062
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:10,291
It must be a monster.

1063
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:12,166
-Let me do it.
-Back off.

1064
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:20,208
Master, let go.

1065
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:21,125
Let go!

1066
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,250
You will die!

1067
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:26,166
Master.

1068
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:29,500
The alarm has sounded.

1069
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:30,416
Let's retreat.

1070
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,125
Yet another thief for the Scale Stone.

1071
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:02,375
<i>I lost an arm,</i>

1072
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,541
but I got this strange arm.

1073
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:05,833
It was worth it.

1074
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,958
You showed me

1075
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,333
the wonder of monsters' power.

1076
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:15,625
You failed to follow your nature

1077
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,958
and that's why
you have ended up so pitiful.

1078
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,750
Actually, I'm the one

1079
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,750
who finds you

1080
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:25,208
far more pitiful.

1081
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:34,333
You are now a monster with nowhere to go.

1082
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:37,958
Maybe my courtyard

1083
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,833
can take you in.

1084
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:42,041
Take me in?

1085
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,708
I heard Xiangliu's call.

1086
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:50,250
I tortured myself

1087
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:53,541
to create this monstrous body,

1088
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:56,625
and now I have the Scale Stone's power.

1089
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:00,375
You, right now,

1090
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:03,958
are only the mud under my feet.

1091
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:05,333
Xiangliu summoned you?

1092
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,458
He said it was my destiny.

1093
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,500
I'll become the strongest in the world.

1094
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:16,791
Both men and monsters

1095
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,500
must bow to me,

1096
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:20,666
or they will die.

1097
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:04,333
A trick of disguise.

1098
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:21,000
I never expected

1099
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,125
to use this sword to kill you.

1100
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,375
{\an8}The Scale Stone

1101
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:37,208
{\an8}has been refined
over the hundreds of years.

1102
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:40,833
{\an8}What can this Tushan Sword

1103
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,666
do to me?

1104
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:52,291
You should know

1105
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:55,375
you will never see Baini again.

1106
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,375
Your beloved,

1107
01:29:58,458 --> 01:29:59,875
your master,

1108
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,583
is gone.

1109
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,000
How is it at this timing

1110
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:36,500
that the freak is missing?

1111
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:37,791
Move aside.

1112
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:41,375
Looks like it's up to me

1113
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:43,958
to handle the situation now.

1114
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:12,500
Will this work?

1115
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:15,250
They are chewing like there's no tomorrow.

1116
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:17,333
-This…
-Chew harder!

1117
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,000
Don't let them cross the bridge!

1118
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,375
<i>What is happening?</i>

1119
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:23,375
<i>It's terrifying.</i>

1120
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:25,166
{\an8}A cloud is coming from Monster Realm.

1121
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,708
{\an8}-It's a monster cloud!
-Monster cloud?

1122
01:33:27,416 --> 01:33:28,291
{\an8}Is it poisonous?

1123
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:30,083
{\an8}Are the monsters attacking?

1124
01:33:58,583 --> 01:33:59,583
Shenle!

1125
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:03,916
I'm here!

1126
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:16,500
Shenle!

1127
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:17,625
If we survive this,

1128
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:19,000
give me that belt.

1129
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:19,958
What? A bell?

1130
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:30,208
{\an8}What bell are you talking about?

1131
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,000
I said Red Ghost is indeed my familiar.

1132
01:34:35,208 --> 01:34:36,541
He's faster than a bell ring.

1133
01:34:56,583 --> 01:34:57,625
Why did everyone stop?

1134
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,125
Watch out for tricks.

1135
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:09,125
What is that?

1136
01:35:26,166 --> 01:35:27,666
It's Master.

1137
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:41,166
Master.

1138
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:52,208
Master!

1139
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:54,958
{\an8}Master!

1140
01:36:02,166 --> 01:36:03,416
{\an8}Master!

1141
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:15,250
Master.

1142
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,625
Master.

1143
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:20,625
Master!

1144
01:36:22,291 --> 01:36:24,333
Master…

1145
01:36:34,416 --> 01:36:36,041
Master told me

1146
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:41,666
that if he dies,

1147
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:43,791
all of you

1148
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:45,666
have to go your own way.

1149
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:48,875
You shouldn't die with him.

1150
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:11,750
It doesn't make a difference if I go back.

1151
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:14,583
I might as well die fighting here.

1152
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:20,000
You can't defend the city without me.

1153
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:31,916
I love watching useless struggles.

1154
01:37:33,208 --> 01:37:34,583
It's so much fun.

1155
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:48,958
The bridge is going to break. Retreat!

1156
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:07,708
Shenle.

1157
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:10,333
I will remember you.

1158
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:13,833
I hope you will remember me too.

1159
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:16,708
{\an8}Yuan Boya!

1160
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:21,875
Destroy the bridge!

1161
01:38:21,958 --> 01:38:23,666
Stop them from crossing the bridge!

1162
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,375
<i>Qingming.</i>

1163
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:42,541
<i>Qingming.</i>

1164
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:46,541
{\an8}Baini?

1165
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:48,791
What is this place?

1166
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:53,208
You are awake.

1167
01:38:54,166 --> 01:38:55,583
I have been waiting for you.

1168
01:38:56,916 --> 01:38:58,625
You finally made it here.

1169
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:02,125
Forget about your familiars.

1170
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:04,708
Forget about the Yin Yang Bureau
and Pingjing City.

1171
01:39:04,791 --> 01:39:06,291
Just the two of us,

1172
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:08,875
we can be together forever.

1173
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:11,000
Isn't this

1174
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:12,333
what we have always wanted?

1175
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:18,291
You are not Baini.

1176
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,833
Baini would never turn her back
on the world.

1177
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,458
-Are you sure of that?
-Are you sure of that?

1178
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,083
<i>Evil monster.</i>

1179
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:40,250
<i>You must replace Cimu</i>

1180
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:43,958
<i>and join me.</i>

1181
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:45,666
"Replace Cimu"?

1182
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:51,666
You were the one controlling Cimu,

1183
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,083
driving him insane.

1184
01:39:53,166 --> 01:39:55,041
<i>You kept denying your nature</i>

1185
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:58,166
<i>and refusing my call.</i>

1186
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:02,458
Now, Cimu has struck you
through the heart.

1187
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:05,625
You and I are finally connected.

1188
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:09,958
This is the perfect time to merge with me.

1189
01:40:10,041 --> 01:40:11,791
Why does it have to be me?

1190
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:14,875
Cimu has not inherited my blood.

1191
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:16,750
Only you

1192
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:21,208
can truly bring me back to life.

1193
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:22,625
No.

1194
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:24,291
I would rather reverse the spell

1195
01:40:24,875 --> 01:40:26,083
and destroy myself

1196
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,583
than become your puppet.

1197
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:33,500
<i>But what about them?</i>

1198
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:36,125
<i>Must they be destroyed too?</i>

1199
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:51,750
I made a pact with Baini

1200
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:53,541
to never become an evil monster.

1201
01:40:55,541 --> 01:41:00,375
Baini's life is also in your hands.

1202
01:41:00,458 --> 01:41:01,625
No.

1203
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:02,583
No!

1204
01:41:03,166 --> 01:41:04,083
No!

1205
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:11,166
Cimu has the Scale Stone's power.

1206
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,458
I am no match for him.

1207
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:20,958
Join me

1208
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:23,791
and become a real monster.

1209
01:41:23,875 --> 01:41:26,291
Acknowledge me as your master

1210
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:32,208
and you still have a chance.

1211
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:33,875
Acknowledge you as my master?

1212
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:39,041
Will you be a weak human

1213
01:41:40,125 --> 01:41:43,375
or a monster that can save the world?

1214
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:48,333
Which one would you choose?

1215
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:04,666
Yuan Boya!

1216
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:23,250
Red Ghost!

1217
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:05,875
The bridge is broken.

1218
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:08,250
We'll protect the city

1219
01:43:09,916 --> 01:43:11,666
with our lives.

1220
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:15,958
Do you think you can stop me?

1221
01:43:34,916 --> 01:43:37,583
I, Seventh-Rank captain Yuan Boya,

1222
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:40,625
will fight alongside you

1223
01:43:41,916 --> 01:43:43,333
and die without regret!

1224
01:44:06,041 --> 01:44:07,125
Freak.

1225
01:44:07,208 --> 01:44:08,416
You pretended to be dead.

1226
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:17,666
How did you…

1227
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:40,958
I was supposed to control both worlds

1228
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:43,333
and rule over all.

1229
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:47,500
Your heart is hollow

1230
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:49,791
and you have no respect for the world

1231
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:52,250
nor attachment to anything.

1232
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:55,416
How could you be worthy enough
to rule the world?

1233
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:57,625
The Scale Stone

1234
01:46:57,708 --> 01:46:59,125
cannot be yours.

1235
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:44,666
Chief,

1236
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:45,875
we defended the bridge

1237
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:47,875
and saved the city, thanks to Master.

1238
01:48:00,833 --> 01:48:02,041
Take the Scale Stone

1239
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:03,708
and return to the bureau with me.

1240
01:48:14,458 --> 01:48:15,291
Master.

1241
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:31,833
Qingming.

1242
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:35,208
You have promised

1243
01:48:35,291 --> 01:48:37,833
to go through life and death with me
and to never betray me.

1244
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,500
Have you forgotten?

1245
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:41,416
Freak!

1246
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,500
That stupid familiar spell of yours,

1247
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:45,958
I thought it was real.

1248
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:49,916
And all of them could make it until now
because they are your familiars.

1249
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,541
Which one would you choose?

1250
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,416
You actually used

1251
01:48:58,041 --> 01:48:59,916
Cimu to threaten me.

1252
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,875
You let him cause chaos in both worlds

1253
01:49:01,958 --> 01:49:03,750
just to force me under your control.

1254
01:49:22,583 --> 01:49:26,666
Are you really reversing
the protection spell?

1255
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:29,708
You will destroy yourself!

1256
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:32,375
Both my body and spirit

1257
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:34,583
will be destroyed.

1258
01:49:34,666 --> 01:49:36,083
And you

1259
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:37,166
will be trapped

1260
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:39,875
within Cimu's body forever.

1261
01:49:42,166 --> 01:49:46,041
What are you thinking?

1262
01:49:48,333 --> 01:49:50,041
{\an8}If you want me to free you,

1263
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:52,416
{\an8}you should be the one to call me Master

1264
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,083
and listen to my orders.

1265
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Stop now!

1266
01:49:58,083 --> 01:49:59,291
Will you obey or not?

1267
01:50:00,083 --> 01:50:00,916
{\an8}Answer me!

1268
01:50:01,958 --> 01:50:03,625
Qingming.

1269
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:05,750
If I become your familiar,

1270
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:08,833
you will continue my evil work,

1271
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:10,458
cut off all feelings,

1272
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:13,875
and forever become an enemy of mankind.

1273
01:50:18,125 --> 01:50:19,208
I'm asking you,

1274
01:50:19,708 --> 01:50:21,208
will you obey or not?

1275
01:50:35,708 --> 01:50:37,750
I, Xiangliu,

1276
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:42,250
will be the familiar of Qingming
from this day onward.

1277
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:45,000
Live and die as one

1278
01:50:45,083 --> 01:50:48,166
and never betray each other.

1279
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,083
The familiar spells

1280
01:51:23,708 --> 01:51:25,000
have been revoked.

1281
01:51:26,666 --> 01:51:28,666
Master!

1282
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:33,583
<i>As of now, we are no longer connected.</i>

1283
01:52:41,666 --> 01:52:43,458
<i>In the seventh month of Gengxu year,</i>

1284
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:45,375
<i>a disaster struck Pingjing City.</i>

1285
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:46,791
<i>There were hurricanes</i>

1286
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:47,958
<i>and tornadoes.</i>

1287
01:52:49,083 --> 01:52:51,041
<i>The above was what the historians wrote.</i>

1288
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:53,458
<i>It was completely different</i>

1289
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:54,791
<i>from my report.</i>

1290
01:52:55,625 --> 01:52:56,875
<i>The battle at Spirit Bridge</i>

1291
01:52:57,375 --> 01:52:58,875
<i>decided the fate of the world.</i>

1292
01:52:59,458 --> 01:53:02,166
<i>Qingming and his familiars
fought with their lives,</i>

1293
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:05,000
<i>but somehow I was seen</i>

1294
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:06,583
<i>as the great hero.</i>

1295
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,833
<i>Qingming.</i>

1296
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:11,625
<i>What had happened to you?</i>

1297
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:13,708
<i>I'm still not sure.</i>

1298
01:53:15,625 --> 01:53:17,333
<i>But to see you so determined</i>

1299
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:19,083
<i>to cut off your familiars,</i>

1300
01:53:20,041 --> 01:53:21,875
<i>I'm sure it wasn't what you wanted.</i>

1301
01:53:28,083 --> 01:53:29,041
<i>Your sacrifice</i>

1302
01:53:29,625 --> 01:53:31,166
<i>brought peace to the people,</i>

1303
01:53:32,166 --> 01:53:34,041
<i>but the familiars were cast to the winds.</i>

1304
01:53:35,291 --> 01:53:38,583
<i>I, too, no longer have a home.</i>

1305
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:11,833
<i>Qingming.</i>

1306
01:54:12,416 --> 01:54:13,875
<i>No matter who is the master</i>

1307
01:54:13,958 --> 01:54:15,000
<i>and who is the familiar,</i>

1308
01:54:16,166 --> 01:54:18,333
<i>we all hope for your return.</i>

1309
01:54:18,833 --> 01:54:20,833
<i>We are willing to share all your burdens.</i>

1310
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:26,125
<i>Isn't the purpose of the familiar spell</i>

1311
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:28,250
<i>to go through joy and sorrow as one,</i>

1312
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,166
<i>live and die as one,</i>

1313
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:31,541
<i>and never betray each other?</i>

1314
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:59,208
Qingming’s New Year divination
is about to begin.

1315
02:00:03,291 --> 02:00:06,375
<i>It seems that the story is not over yet.</i>
