00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,637
<font color="#ffff00">Jules Verne once wrote</font>

2
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:02,064
<font color="#ffff00">Put two ships in the open sea</font>

3
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,078
<font color="#ffff00">without wind or tide,
it will come together.</font>

4
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,345
<font color="#ffff00">That's how my parents met.</font>

5
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:33,702
<font color="#ffff00">Like two ships destined for each other.</font>

6
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:50,102
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, it's ok.</font>

7
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:58,139
<font color="#ffff00">Easy, easy, easy.</font>

8
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,693
<font color="#ffff00">You weren't breathing.</font>

9
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,961
<font color="#ffff00">They were from different worlds.</font>

10
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:21,584
<font color="#ffff00">But life, like the sea,
has a way of bringing people together.</font>

11
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,480
<font color="#ffff00">I was gonna make you some eggs.</font>

12
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:13,584
<font color="#ffff00">Just don't eat my dog, ok?</font>

13
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,664
<font color="#ffff00">It's ok. It's ok. I made tea.</font>

14
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:27,897
<font color="#ffff00">Come, try it. It'll
make you better.</font>

15
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,441
<font color="#ffff00">So, who are you?</font>

16
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:55,527
<font color="#ffff00">Atlantian.</font>

17
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,395
<font color="#ffff00">Queen of Atlantis.</font>

18
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:07,910
<font color="#ffff00">Wow. I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.</font>

19
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:43,850
<font color="#ffff00">She had fled an arranged marriage,
left her whole world behind.</font>

20
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,034
<font color="#ffff00">But in my father's lighthouse,
she found something</font>

21
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:49,006
<font color="#ffff00">unexpected.</font>

22
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,845
<font color="#ffff00">And my father, found
the love of his life.</font>

23
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:06,916
<font color="#ffff00">How about Arthur?</font>

24
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,979
<font color="#ffff00">After the hurricane.</font>

25
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:13,053
<font color="#ffff00">Afterall, he's a king, no?</font>

26
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,926
<font color="#ffff00">He's more than that.</font>

27
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:19,843
<font color="#ffff00">He's living proof our people
can co-exist.</font>

28
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:22,974
<font color="#ffff00">He could unite our worlds
one day.</font>

29
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:34,899
<font color="#ffff00">And the Trident could only be wielded
by the strongest Atlantean.</font>

30
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:39,973
<font color="#ffff00">And it gave the king mastery
of the seven seas.</font>

31
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:44,828
<font color="#ffff00">Made him so powerful.
the ocean became so jealous,</font>

32
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:48,924
<font color="#ffff00">and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.</font>

33
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:50,936
<font color="#ffff00">Down it fell to the bottom of the ocean.</font>

34
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:53,069
<font color="#ffff00">But legend has it that one day</font>

35
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,072
<font color="#ffff00">a new king will come</font>

36
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,144
<font color="#ffff00">who will use the power of the Trident</font>

37
00:05:57,154 --> 00:06:00,958
<font color="#ffff00">to put Atlantis back together again.</font>

38
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,877
<font color="#ffff00">Tom, take him!</font>

39
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:28,890
<font color="#ffff00">Queen Atlanna.</font>

40
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,151
<font color="#ffff00">By the authority of King Orvax,</font>

41
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:33,164
<font color="#ffff00">You re ordered to return to Atlantis.</font>

42
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:35,067
<font color="#ffff00">Atlanna!</font>

43
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:01,876
<font color="#ffff00">Tom! Here!</font>

44
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:30,970
<font color="#ffff00">The two worlds were never meant to meet</font>

45
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,783
<font color="#ffff00">and I was a product of a love that
never should have been.</font>

46
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:36,916
<font color="#ffff00">You don't have to do this,
Atlantean. Please.</font>

47
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:42,993
<font color="#ffff00">Tom. They will always find me.
Next time they will send an army.</font>

48
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:46,868
<font color="#ffff00">I have to go back.</font>

49
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,851
<font color="#ffff00">It's the only way to save him.</font>

50
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:53,986
<font color="#ffff00">To save you.</font>

51
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,974
<font color="#ffff00">Where I come from,</font>

52
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:04,938
<font color="#ffff00">the sea carries our tears away.</font>

53
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:12,035
<font color="#ffff00">Not here. You'd feel it.</font>

54
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:24,830
<font color="#ffff00">I will return to you
when it's safe.</font>

55
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,092
<font color="#ffff00">One day.</font>

56
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:29,105
<font color="#ffff00">Right here. At sunrise.</font>

57
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,911
<font color="#ffff00">We'll be together again.</font>

58
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:40,058
<font color="#ffff00">You stay strong, my little prince.
I'll always be with you.</font>

59
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:52,010
<font color="#ffff00">Don't let him forget me.</font>

60
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:29,095
<font color="#ffff00">Now today, we have better maps of Mars
than our own sea floor.</font>

61
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,939
<font color="#ffff00">Come on. Come over here.
Boys, stop.</font>

62
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:39,143
<font color="#ffff00">Hi, fishy.</font>

63
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:44,060
<font color="#ffff00">My name's Arthur. What's yours?</font>

64
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,001
<font color="#ffff00">You guys hungry?</font>

65
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:50,136
<font color="#ffff00">Check it out. Arthur is
talking to the fish.</font>

66
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:52,049
<font color="#ffff00">You're such a prick, Arthur.</font>

67
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,952
<font color="#ffff00">Stop! Stop it!</font>

68
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:58,055
<font color="#ffff00">Stop! Let me go!</font>

69
00:11:54,737 --> 00:12:00,623
<font color="#ffff00">Move it! Come on, hurry up!</font>

70
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,595
<font color="#ffff00">Sir, we've secured the captain.</font>

71
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,738
<font color="#ffff00">Distress signal disabled.
We're running dark in here.</font>

72
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:16,781
<font color="#ffff00">Well they heard it, you can count on it.</font>

73
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,813
<font color="#ffff00">I'll make you a deal.</font>

74
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,696
<font color="#ffff00">I won't tell you how to captain,</font>

75
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,829
<font color="#ffff00">and you don't tell me how to pirate.</font>

76
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:40,739
<font color="#ffff00">Where's the rest of the crew? They've
sealed themselves up in the torpedo bay.</font>

77
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:41,870
<font color="#ffff00">Our reputation precedes us.</font>

78
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,744
<font color="#ffff00">Your reputation. This is your win.</font>

79
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,691
<font color="#ffff00">Here.</font>

80
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:56,736
<font color="#ffff00">You take this piece of junk,
this is part of your life.</font>

81
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,900
<font color="#ffff00">I never told you the story behind it.</font>

82
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,784
<font color="#ffff00">This was your grandfather's.</font>

83
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,821
<font color="#ffff00">He was one of the navy first
fought in World War 2.</font>

84
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:08,849
<font color="#ffff00">He was so stealthy in the water.</font>

85
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,774
<font color="#ffff00">His unit nicknamed him Manta.</font>

86
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:16,749
<font color="#ffff00">But after the war, his country
forgot about him</font>

87
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:20,654
<font color="#ffff00">So he went back to the seas,
scavenging and surviving with his wit.</font>

88
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:26,829
<font color="#ffff00">And this knife, he gave it to me
when I was your age.</font>

89
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:30,865
<font color="#ffff00">And now, it's yours, son.</font>

90
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:01,810
<font color="#ffff00">We just hit something.</font>

91
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,846
<font color="#ffff00">- No. Something hit us.
- Sir, there's something out there.</font>

92
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:10,889
<font color="#ffff00">- Another submarine?
- No. I think it's a man.</font>

93
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:00,856
<font color="#ffff00">That's not a man.</font>

94
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,044
<font color="#ffff00">Stopper, to the right.
Bravo team, clear the passageway.</font>

95
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,041
<font color="#ffff00">Permission to come on board.</font>

96
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:35,189
<font color="#ffff00">I've waited a long time for this.</font>

97
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:50,086
<font color="#ffff00">Am I supposed to know who you are?</font>

98
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:53,070
<font color="#ffff00">I scavenge the high seas.</font>

99
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,203
<font color="#ffff00">You're the Aquaman.</font>

100
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:57,975
<font color="#ffff00">We're about to meet at some point.</font>

101
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,221
<font color="#ffff00">Let's not make it happen.</font>

102
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:01,116
<font color="#ffff00">Ow!</font>

103
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,335
<font color="#ffff00">Dad!</font>

104
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:18,345
<font color="#ffff00">Dad.</font>

105
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:23,253
<font color="#ffff00">That's your kid?</font>

106
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:29,368
<font color="#ffff00">Shame on you.</font>

107
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,372
<font color="#ffff00">You get yourself into this mess,
get yourself out of this.</font>

108
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,185
<font color="#ffff00">Bastard!</font>

109
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,204
<font color="#ffff00">Wait! Help me he's trapped!</font>

110
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:03,305
<font color="#ffff00">You can't leave him like this!</font>

111
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,149
<font color="#ffff00">Please!</font>

112
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:08,182
<font color="#ffff00">You killed innocent people.</font>

113
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:10,356
<font color="#ffff00">You ask the sea for mercy.</font>

114
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,222
<font color="#ffff00">Get out of here!</font>

115
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:27,223
<font color="#ffff00">I'll never leave you.</font>

116
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:30,397
<font color="#ffff00">You need to live so that you can kill
that son of a bitch.</font>

117
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:37,404
<font color="#ffff00">Now, go!</font>

118
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:46,365
<font color="#ffff00">Go!</font>

119
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:05,246
<font color="#ffff00">Damn you!</font>

120
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:07,218
<font color="#ffff00">Go.</font>

121
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:27,379
<font color="#ffff00">I'll always know where to find you.</font>

122
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,381
<font color="#ffff00">Old habits.</font>

123
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,571
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.</font>

124
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:47,380
<font color="#ffff00">You want me to hand it
in a sippy cup for you.</font>

125
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:53,538
<font color="#ffff00">How is it that I could breathe underwater
and lose the drink on the table with you.</font>

126
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,312
<font color="#ffff00">That's my superpower.</font>

127
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:03,118
<font color="#ffff00">The same pirate who are suspected</font>

128
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:05,872
<font color="#ffff00">in connection with the
disappearance of the Navy's</font>

129
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:08,405
<font color="#ffff00">high classified prototype
stealth submarine.</font>

130
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:11,608
<font color="#ffff00">And in further development, we
now have unconfirmed reports</font>

131
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:15,522
<font color="#ffff00">that the meta-human dubbed by social media
as the Aquaman</font>

132
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:18,355
<font color="#ffff00">was responsible for this daring rescue…</font>

133
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,516
<font color="#ffff00">It's not me.</font>

134
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:23,471
<font color="#ffff00">Oh shit. You're doing it, aren't you?</font>

135
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,404
<font color="#ffff00">What Vulco trained you to do.</font>

136
00:23:26,444 --> 00:23:30,349
<font color="#ffff00">I knew you couldn't stand
on the sidelines forever.</font>

137
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:32,854
<font color="#ffff00">Your mother always
knew you were special.</font>

138
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:33,554
<font color="#ffff00">Don't even start.</font>

139
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:37,467
<font color="#ffff00">She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.</font>

140
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,440
<font color="#ffff00">Please, stop.</font>

141
00:23:41,512 --> 00:23:45,417
<font color="#ffff00">Whatever Atlantis's problem
are, you're bigger than them.</font>

142
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,479
<font color="#ffff00">Atlantis murdered my mother.</font>

143
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,422
<font color="#ffff00">- You didn't know that for sure.
- Yes, I do.</font>

144
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,406
<font color="#ffff00">They took her, for loving
you and having me.</font>

145
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:57,399
<font color="#ffff00">And you know it.</font>

146
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:04,490
<font color="#ffff00">Son, one day you'd have
to stop blaming yourself.</font>

147
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:12,529
<font color="#ffff00">Hey buddy.</font>

148
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:16,411
<font color="#ffff00">You'd that fish boy from the TV?</font>

149
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:18,484
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, great.</font>

150
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,566
<font color="#ffff00">Hey fish man. What'd you want?</font>

151
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:29,666
<font color="#ffff00">I'll tell you what I want.</font>

152
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,555
<font color="#ffff00">Can I get a picture with you?</font>

153
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:37,584
<font color="#ffff00">You're like our local hero, man.</font>

154
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:42,440
<font color="#ffff00">It'll be quick.</font>

155
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:48,938
<font color="#ffff00">- Whatever.
- Alright. Let's do this.</font>

156
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:49,689
<font color="#ffff00">Dont' touch me.</font>

157
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,623
<font color="#ffff00">Right, that's exactly what
I'd want to do down here.</font>

158
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:53,683
<font color="#ffff00">Here we go.
Everybody smile.</font>

159
00:25:47,544 --> 00:25:50,637
<font color="#ffff00">He understands the
significance of this meeting.</font>

160
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:52,619
<font color="#ffff00">He'll hear you out.</font>

161
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:14,604
<font color="#ffff00">King Orm.
- King Nereus.</font>

162
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:17,629
<font color="#ffff00">You pick a meeting place too close to the
surface to my liking.</font>

163
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,630
<font color="#ffff00">You don't recognise the
council of the kings?</font>

164
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,716
<font color="#ffff00">At the site where the seven kings were
one. Our ancestors gathered here.</font>

165
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,829
<font color="#ffff00">…Sat here at the head of the table.</font>

166
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:33,306
<font color="#ffff00">Xebel were always by his side.</font>

167
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,806
<font color="#ffff00">Brine, Fishermen,</font>

168
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:39,332
<font color="#ffff00">Deserters and Trench had not yet followed.
Lost nations had not yet vanished.</font>

169
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:43,416
<font color="#ffff00">Together we were the greatest
empire the world had ever seen.</font>

170
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:48,274
<font color="#ffff00">But now, several long wars shattered
by archaic laws and politics</font>

171
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:50,334
<font color="#ffff00">While the threat above
us grows undeniable.</font>

172
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,437
<font color="#ffff00">Violence has always plagued the surface.</font>

173
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,280
<font color="#ffff00">They will destroy themselves.</font>

174
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,412
<font color="#ffff00">Not before destroying us first.</font>

175
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:00,326
<font color="#ffff00">We have been hiding long enough.</font>

176
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:04,333
<font color="#ffff00">The time has come for
Atlantis to rise again.</font>

177
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,343
<font color="#ffff00">We honour you King Nereus…</font>

178
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:12,578
<font color="#ffff00">by inviting Xebel to be the first kingdom
to join King Orm's alliance.</font>

179
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:15,352
<font color="#ffff00">As if you have a choice, Vulko.</font>

180
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:18,496
<font color="#ffff00">By law you need four to seven
kingdoms to send an attack.</font>

181
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:21,409
<font color="#ffff00">The lost nations and the
Deserters have long perished.</font>

182
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,501
<font color="#ffff00">The Trench were nothing but anglers.</font>

183
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:26,455
<font color="#ffff00">The Brine wouldn't join you, and
the Fishermen are cowards.</font>

184
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:28,517
<font color="#ffff00">With only my army to convince them,</font>

185
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:31,390
<font color="#ffff00">your plans are still burnt.</font>

186
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:33,563
<font color="#ffff00">But I know what you really want.</font>

187
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:36,436
<font color="#ffff00">Once you'd obtained the
pledge of the four kingdoms,</font>

188
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:38,469
<font color="#ffff00">you will be deemed</font>

189
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:41,482
<font color="#ffff00">Ocean Master.</font>

190
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:45,587
<font color="#ffff00">That's merely a title.- I'm
not a fool King Orm.</font>

191
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:50,332
<font color="#ffff00">As Ocean Master you'll be commander of the
greatest military might on this planet.</font>

192
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:53,365
<font color="#ffff00">I'm the natural choice to lead it.</font>

193
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:56,348
<font color="#ffff00">Are you?</font>

194
00:27:56,348 --> 00:27:59,383
<font color="#ffff00">What about the rumours there is another?</font>

195
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:02,415
<font color="#ffff00">An Atlantian living on the surface</font>

196
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:05,369
<font color="#ffff00">One of royal blood.</font>

197
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:09,363
<font color="#ffff00">You may sit on the throne of Atlantis.</font>

198
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,726
<font color="#ffff00">But your claim is just weak. How can
you possibly hope to unite the empire?</font>

199
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:15,079
<font color="#ffff00">My mother's bastard has never
even been to Atlantis.</font>

200
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,151
<font color="#ffff00">His loyalty is to the…</font>

201
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,145
<font color="#ffff00">Surface dwellers! Move out!</font>

202
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,062
<font color="#ffff00">The king is injured!</font>

203
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:53,200
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not trying to start a war.</font>

204
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,106
<font color="#ffff00">The war has already begun.</font>

205
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:59,136
<font color="#ffff00">Then it's time to send them
a message that we're here.</font>

206
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:07,116
<font color="#ffff00">Here's the key.- Thank you.</font>

207
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:09,188
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go home.</font>

208
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:10,800
<font color="#ffff00">If your grandpa's still alive,</font>

209
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,182
<font color="#ffff00">he'd be banging our heads
when we're not finishing it.</font>

210
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,049
<font color="#ffff00">Tell you what. There's still
plenty of time for that.</font>

211
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,111
<font color="#ffff00">Got to get you to bed.</font>

212
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:24,154
<font color="#ffff00">Got it.</font>

213
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,275
<font color="#ffff00">I've been looking for you.-
Oh no. No. No.</font>

214
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:36,048
<font color="#ffff00">I need you to come with
me to Atlantis.- Listen.</font>

215
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:39,122
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to tell you the same thing
I told that rusty starfish Vulko.</font>

216
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:41,034
<font color="#ffff00">It's been nice meeting you, lady.</font>

217
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:42,266
<font color="#ffff00">No, thank you. I'm not interested.</font>

218
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:46,140
<font color="#ffff00">You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.</font>

219
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,042
<font color="#ffff00">That had nothing to do with Atlantis.</font>

220
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:50,145
<font color="#ffff00">Your half brother, Raja Orm,
is about to declare war</font>

221
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:53,157
<font color="#ffff00">with the surface world.
Billions will die.</font>

222
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:55,220
<font color="#ffff00">Your people and mine.</font>

223
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,134
<font color="#ffff00">We must stop him.</font>

224
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:04,240
<font color="#ffff00">And how do you propose we do that?</font>

225
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,243
<font color="#ffff00">You re the first born son of
Queen Atlanna.</font>

226
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,086
<font color="#ffff00">The throne is yours by birthright.</font>

227
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:12,259
<font color="#ffff00">The only way to stop this war</font>

228
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:15,202
<font color="#ffff00">and save both worlds</font>

229
00:31:15,232 --> 00:31:18,306
<font color="#ffff00">is for you to take your rightful
place as King.</font>

230
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:25,123
<font color="#ffff00">You think if I just show up,
Orm will give up the throne?</font>

231
00:31:25,153 --> 00:31:28,127
<font color="#ffff00">I'm the bastard son of a
queen your people executed.</font>

232
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:31,330
<font color="#ffff00">Trust me. I'm no king.
I agree.</font>

233
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,343
<font color="#ffff00">That's awesome. Go.</font>

234
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:37,078
<font color="#ffff00">But, Vulko seems to believe
in you for some reason.</font>

235
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:40,121
<font color="#ffff00">And that's why I'm here.
Vulko has learnt of the location of</font>

236
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:43,183
<font color="#ffff00">the lost trident of
Atlantis.- Ooh, Fairy tales.</font>

237
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,137
<font color="#ffff00">It's a myth.- It's not a myth.</font>

238
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,328
<font color="#ffff00">With the sacred trident,
people will listen to you.</font>

239
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:49,170
<font color="#ffff00">You can then claim your birthright</font>

240
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,342
<font color="#ffff00">and dethrone Orm.</font>

241
00:31:50,382 --> 00:31:54,115
<font color="#ffff00">My birthright? It died with my mother.</font>

242
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:56,178
<font color="#ffff00">But I'll promise you this.</font>

243
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:58,221
<font color="#ffff00">If Orm attacks, I'll
treat him the same way</font>

244
00:31:58,231 --> 00:32:00,323
<font color="#ffff00">your people treated her.</font>

245
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:03,136
<font color="#ffff00">With no mercy.</font>

246
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:05,205
<font color="#ffff00">That submarine was barely operational.
But it served its purpose.</font>

247
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:08,339
<font color="#ffff00">One of your kind intervened.</font>

248
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:13,345
<font color="#ffff00">He is not one of us.- He killed my father.</font>

249
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:16,389
<font color="#ffff00">Our transaction has ended.</font>

250
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:22,245
<font color="#ffff00">Keep the money.</font>

251
00:33:22,405 --> 00:33:24,438
<font color="#ffff00">I want Aquaman.</font>

252
00:34:34,597 --> 00:34:36,429
<font color="#ffff00">Dad!</font>

253
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:42,536
<font color="#ffff00">Dad!</font>

254
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:29,539
<font color="#ffff00">He;s not breathing.- Move! Let me help.</font>

255
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:08,393
<font color="#ffff00">You know I don't even know your name.</font>

256
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:14,530
<font color="#ffff00">You may call me Mera.</font>

257
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:17,532
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you, Mera.</font>

258
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:40,489
<font color="#ffff00">My god.</font>

259
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,623
<font color="#ffff00">This was Orm's doing.</font>

260
00:36:43,574 --> 00:36:46,505
<font color="#ffff00">The worst has yet to come.</font>

261
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:57,600
<font color="#ffff00">There's a flash flood…
- Building has been destroyed…</font>

262
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,761
<font color="#ffff00">….unprecedented sites from
all over the world today…</font>

263
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:04,646
<font color="#ffff00">we're seeing warships and trash washed up
by massive waves.</font>

264
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,552
<font color="#ffff00">Garbage in multiple counties.</font>

265
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:13,698
<font color="#ffff00">Decades of pollution has
been thrown back to land.</font>

266
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,499
<font color="#ffff00">Question,
was this a natural disaster</font>

267
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:17,600
<font color="#ffff00">or something else.</font>

268
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,513
<font color="#ffff00">No. This was no natural disaster.</font>

269
00:37:19,543 --> 00:37:21,677
<font color="#ffff00">They threw out our garbage and warships.</font>

270
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:23,747
<font color="#ffff00">This was our first contact with the
people of Atlantis.</font>

271
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:27,592
<font color="#ffff00">Here you go again, with your
insane Atlantean theory.</font>

272
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:29,566
<font color="#ffff00">You have absolutely no proof of this.</font>

273
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:30,595
<font color="#ffff00">Open your eyes.</font>

274
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:32,467
<font color="#ffff00">We already have an Atlantean
living among us</font>

275
00:37:32,507 --> 00:37:33,739
<font color="#ffff00">and his name is Aquaman.</font>

276
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,788
<font color="#ffff00">What is it?</font>

277
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:46,602
<font color="#ffff00">This is the exact spot that Vulko gave me
my first formal lesson.</font>

278
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:50,597
<font color="#ffff00">You have to forgot all the
teachings of the surface world.</font>

279
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:55,583
<font color="#ffff00">Go deeper, to uncover
your Atlantean instinct.</font>

280
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:56,784
<font color="#ffff00">But I already know how to swim.</font>

281
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:59,658
<font color="#ffff00">Not even close.</font>

282
00:38:02,771 --> 00:38:08,741
<font color="#ffff00">So, we're clear.</font>

283
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:12,663
<font color="#ffff00">Help you stop this war, then I'm done.
Maybe that's for the best.</font>

284
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:35,828
<font color="#ffff00">The ocean is more than our life soul.
It's who we are.</font>

285
00:38:35,868 --> 00:38:38,712
<font color="#ffff00">Wait. You can talk underwater?</font>

286
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:41,655
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, I can talk underwater too!</font>

287
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:42,776
<font color="#ffff00">This is awesome!</font>

288
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:46,762
<font color="#ffff00">No. We can do more than just talk.</font>

289
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:57,842
<font color="#ffff00">Being an Atlantean means being more
than just able to breathe in water.</font>

290
00:38:57,882 --> 00:39:02,831
<font color="#ffff00">Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold, and pressure.</font>

291
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:06,673
<font color="#ffff00">And your eyes adjust to see in the dark.</font>

292
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:31,682
<font color="#ffff00">This is awesome!</font>

293
00:39:58,714 --> 00:40:01,915
<font color="#ffff00">SO Vulko, when can I meet my mother?</font>

294
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:06,793
<font color="#ffff00">Soon, my young prince.</font>

295
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:11,796
<font color="#ffff00">When you're ready, I will take you to
Atlantis to meet the Queen.</font>

296
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,699
<font color="#ffff00">I hid my ship in here.</font>

297
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:26,843
<font color="#ffff00">Listen. I'm not getting in that thing.</font>

298
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:28,848
<font color="#ffff00">Well to get to where we're going,
you're gonna have to.</font>

299
00:40:28,848 --> 00:40:32,810
<font color="#ffff00">Your fish ship has been marinated in chump
butter. I might come out like small bud.</font>

300
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,822
<font color="#ffff00">That's be an improvement.</font>

301
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:40,929
<font color="#ffff00">Yup.</font>

302
00:42:37,841 --> 00:42:40,714
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome home.</font>

303
00:43:27,977 --> 00:43:29,751
<font color="#ffff00">There is a safe house
down in the old city.</font>

304
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:32,922
<font color="#ffff00">The high ones never
ventured to the sea floor.</font>

305
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:34,955
<font color="#ffff00">We're here.</font>

306
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:05,119
<font color="#ffff00">What is this?</font>

307
00:44:05,129 --> 00:44:07,994
<font color="#ffff00">These are air pockets we used as
natural air precaution.</font>

308
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:10,054
<font color="#ffff00">Only the high ones can breathe on air.</font>

309
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,837
<font color="#ffff00">Plus, it keeps the animals out.</font>

310
00:44:12,877 --> 00:44:14,900
<font color="#ffff00">They get kind of messy.</font>

311
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,885
<font color="#ffff00">Vulko. Here I am old man.</font>

312
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:22,950
<font color="#ffff00">After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.</font>

313
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:28,996
<font color="#ffff00">Arthur, I wish it was under
better circumstances.</font>

314
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:31,111
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe Orm attacked.</font>

315
00:44:31,111 --> 00:44:34,982
<font color="#ffff00">It wasn't an attack.
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.</font>

316
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:37,055
<font color="#ffff00">What he did to your surface warships</font>

317
00:44:37,055 --> 00:44:39,861
<font color="#ffff00">was merely a warning.-
What provoked him?</font>

318
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:42,781
<font color="#ffff00">King Orm and your father were
ambushed by the surface.</font>

319
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:45,934
<font color="#ffff00">The surface? I don't think so.</font>

320
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,288
<font color="#ffff00">I'd still think that's
Atlantis fairytale.</font>

321
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:49,108
<font color="#ffff00">I was there.</font>

322
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:51,951
<font color="#ffff00">A surface warship fired at us.</font>

323
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:54,927
<font color="#ffff00">Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis.</font>

324
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:59,169
<font color="#ffff00">Giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.</font>

325
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:03,944
<font color="#ffff00">If we're gonna prevent this war,
you must dethrone him now.</font>

326
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:06,077
<font color="#ffff00">How many times do I have to tell you,
I don;t want to be king.</font>

327
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:11,595
<font color="#ffff00">Once he's named Ocean Master,
that'll be too late.</font>

328
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:14,597
<font color="#ffff00">The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you've ever seen.</font>

329
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:17,612
<font color="#ffff00">I'm from the surface. No one's
gonna take me seriously.</font>

330
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:18,754
<font color="#ffff00">Heck, I'd don't even know where to begin.</font>

331
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:21,715
<font color="#ffff00">By winning the hearts
and minds of the people</font>

332
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:24,588
<font color="#ffff00">by proving to them that you're worthy.</font>

333
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:25,751
<font color="#ffff00">By retrieving this.</font>

334
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:34,672
<font color="#ffff00">I already got one of those.</font>

335
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,813
<font color="#ffff00">Not like this one you don't.</font>

336
00:45:37,823 --> 00:45:40,757
<font color="#ffff00">This is the lost Trident of Atlantis.</font>

337
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:43,559
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I know the story.-
It's more than a story.</font>

338
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:44,791
<font color="#ffff00">It's real.</font>

339
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:49,839
<font color="#ffff00">It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.</font>

340
00:45:50,778 --> 00:45:53,721
<font color="#ffff00">Crafted from Poseidon's steel.</font>

341
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:57,658
<font color="#ffff00">For King Atlan,
the first ruler of Atlantis.</font>

342
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:00,759
<font color="#ffff00">Legend says, the Trident
was build with the power</font>

343
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:03,642
<font color="#ffff00">to command the sea.</font>

344
00:46:04,614 --> 00:46:05,636
<font color="#ffff00">So what happened to it?</font>

345
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:08,807
<font color="#ffff00">To know that, is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall.</font>

346
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:12,825
<font color="#ffff00">When King Atlan ruler over all that was,</font>

347
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:16,767
<font color="#ffff00">the Kingdoms of Atlantis were one.</font>

348
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,706
<font color="#ffff00">It was a time of great prosperity and
technological advancement.</font>

349
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:28,693
<font color="#ffff00">We've unlocked the secret
to unlimited energy</font>

350
00:46:28,693 --> 00:46:32,605
<font color="#ffff00">when the rest of the world still thought
the earth was flat.</font>

351
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:37,711
<font color="#ffff00">But we became too ambitious,</font>

352
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,843
<font color="#ffff00">too hungry for power.</font>

353
00:46:56,682 --> 00:47:00,649
<font color="#ffff00">…Swallowed us and Atlantis sank.</font>

354
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:03,740
<font color="#ffff00">But the very power that
collapsed our civilisation</font>

355
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,874
<font color="#ffff00">also paved the way
to our future.</font>

356
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:11,719
<font color="#ffff00">It gave us ability to breathe underwater.</font>

357
00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:13,852
<font color="#ffff00">And so, we evolved.</font>

358
00:47:14,723 --> 00:47:15,886
<font color="#ffff00">Others regressed.</font>

359
00:47:15,926 --> 00:47:18,697
<font color="#ffff00">Became savage.</font>

360
00:47:18,897 --> 00:47:24,672
<font color="#ffff00">And the king lived out the remainder of
his days in self imposed exile.</font>

361
00:47:24,682 --> 00:47:27,917
<font color="#ffff00">Neither he, nor the Trident
were ever seen again.</font>

362
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:33,663
<font color="#ffff00">One of our archeological team
uncovered this a few months ago.</font>

363
00:47:33,693 --> 00:47:37,728
<font color="#ffff00">It's an ancient recording dating
back to the first dynasty.</font>

364
00:47:37,738 --> 00:47:40,911
<font color="#ffff00">I believe it contained Atlan's
final message to it's people</font>

365
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:45,787
<font color="#ffff00">and the whereabouts of the sacred
Trident.- So what does it say?</font>

366
00:47:45,787 --> 00:47:46,851
<font color="#ffff00">We don't know.</font>

367
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:48,760
<font color="#ffff00">The technology's too old.</font>

368
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,794
<font color="#ffff00">The cylinder bears the marking of the
Deserter Kingdom.</font>

369
00:47:51,804 --> 00:47:54,870
<font color="#ffff00">You must take it there
to retrieve the message.</font>

370
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,972
<font color="#ffff00">The clue to Atlan's final resting
place is inside this.</font>

371
00:48:16,952 --> 00:48:19,895
<font color="#ffff00">You're under arrest for
illegal entry.- Go.</font>

372
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:23,900
<font color="#ffff00">You must be seen here.</font>

373
00:49:19,954 --> 00:49:22,826
<font color="#ffff00">I don't suppose you want to
talk about this, do you?</font>

374
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:27,963
<font color="#ffff00">Neither do I.</font>

375
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:12,933
<font color="#ffff00">In the name of His Highness King Orm,
I place you under arrest.</font>

376
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:35,879
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to Atlantis,</font>

377
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,054
<font color="#ffff00">Brother.</font>

378
00:50:42,035 --> 00:50:45,029
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe you're finally here.</font>

379
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:49,013
<font color="#ffff00">I've heard so many stories about you.</font>

380
00:50:54,922 --> 00:51:01,067
<font color="#ffff00">All these years, I'm ashamed of
my mother's surface brother.</font>

381
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:08,115
<font color="#ffff00">Ashamed of the fact that I have a half breed
brother I want to run my Trident through.</font>

382
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:12,029
<font color="#ffff00">But now that you're
finally here before me,</font>

383
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,092
<font color="#ffff00">I must admit…</font>

384
00:51:20,148 --> 00:51:22,140
<font color="#ffff00">I'm conflicted.</font>

385
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:27,095
<font color="#ffff00">You want conflict, will you take
these chains off little brother?</font>

386
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,999
<font color="#ffff00">And we'll see what we can run through.</font>

387
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:36,006
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. I see you brought our mothers weapon.</font>

388
00:51:36,046 --> 00:51:40,081
<font color="#ffff00">Is that why you've come
here after all this time?</font>

389
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:42,156
<font color="#ffff00">To kill me?</font>

390
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:45,026
<font color="#ffff00">I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying my world.</font>

391
00:51:45,026 --> 00:51:46,969
<font color="#ffff00">I see.</font>

392
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:52,004
<font color="#ffff00">And how do you plan to stop the
atrocities by the surface to commit</font>

393
00:51:52,144 --> 00:51:58,092
<font color="#ffff00">over centuries polluted our waters</font>

394
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:01,034
<font color="#ffff00">and poisoned our children.</font>

395
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,169
<font color="#ffff00">Now the skies are burning our oceans</font>

396
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:10,144
<font color="#ffff00">You've come all this way to take
side against your own people?</font>

397
00:52:10,185 --> 00:52:12,249
<font color="#ffff00">There are no sides I don't want this.</font>

398
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:15,160
<font color="#ffff00">You've clearly chosen a side to
come here to challenge the throne</font>

399
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,034
<font color="#ffff00">Thats to stop your war.</font>

400
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:22,138
<font color="#ffff00">Are you invoking the combat of the Kings?</font>

401
00:52:22,148 --> 00:52:25,242
<font color="#ffff00">Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass whooping.</font>

402
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:29,059
<font color="#ffff00">Well then perhaps that's how we'll proceed</font>

403
00:52:29,098 --> 00:52:30,147
<font color="#ffff00">Your majesty!- Orm please.</font>

404
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:32,029
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you see?</font>

405
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:36,266
<font color="#ffff00">If I defeat the first born son
of Atlanna in front of everyone.</font>

406
00:52:36,276 --> 00:52:39,307
<font color="#ffff00">Then all seven kingdoms
will have to concede that</font>

407
00:52:39,317 --> 00:52:42,010
<font color="#ffff00">I, am the one true king.</font>

408
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,223
<font color="#ffff00">Your majesty. There is no victory
in feeding the ignorant.</font>

409
00:52:45,253 --> 00:52:48,127
<font color="#ffff00">Your brother is clearly an imbecile.</font>

410
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:51,302
<font color="#ffff00">Your Highness. He doesn't know our ways.</font>

411
00:52:51,343 --> 00:52:54,104
<font color="#ffff00">Then he'll about to get an education.</font>

412
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:58,249
<font color="#ffff00">Are you officially challenging me?-
Hell yes, I'll challenge you.</font>

413
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:01,052
<font color="#ffff00">And when I win, if you win.</font>

414
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:04,196
<font color="#ffff00">I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.</font>

415
00:53:04,236 --> 00:53:07,231
<font color="#ffff00">But if I win,</font>

416
00:53:08,073 --> 00:53:10,102
<font color="#ffff00">you're over.</font>

417
00:53:10,112 --> 00:53:13,176
<font color="#ffff00">Good.- So be it.</font>

418
00:53:13,216 --> 00:53:14,327
<font color="#ffff00">Challenge has been made,
and I accept.</font>

419
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,391
<font color="#ffff00">Prepare him for the ring of fire!</font>

420
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:20,423
<font color="#ffff00">Wait. What?</font>

421
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:43,410
<font color="#ffff00">How can you be so foolish to
let Orm bait you into a fight?</font>

422
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,185
<font color="#ffff00">It seems to me that'll
solve all our problems.</font>

423
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:49,216
<font color="#ffff00">I beat him in battle. War's over.
I'm getting home.</font>

424
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,259
<font color="#ffff00">You're a formidable fighter on land.</font>

425
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:53,360
<font color="#ffff00">But here, you're out of
your element literally.</font>

426
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,343
<font color="#ffff00">Orm has spent his entire life underwater.</font>

427
00:53:56,343 --> 00:53:59,217
<font color="#ffff00">Training to be a warrior.
Training to be the best.</font>

428
00:53:59,347 --> 00:54:01,481
<font color="#ffff00">You taught me how to fight.</font>

429
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:04,252
<font color="#ffff00">Let's see if you remember anything</font>

430
00:54:07,396 --> 00:54:10,432
<font color="#ffff00">What's with the big fork?
- That's a Trident.</font>

431
00:54:10,472 --> 00:54:12,272
<font color="#ffff00">Now defend!</font>

432
00:54:45,479 --> 00:54:49,446
<font color="#ffff00">The hell is this?- I'll teach you the
movement to master the Trident.</font>

433
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:00,536
<font color="#ffff00">It;s not fair.</font>

434
00:55:00,576 --> 00:55:03,350
<font color="#ffff00">This thing is too big.
Why can't I use a sword?</font>

435
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,513
<font color="#ffff00">That's your mother's Trident.</font>

436
00:55:04,523 --> 00:55:07,394
<font color="#ffff00">A traditional weapon of royalty.</font>

437
00:55:07,394 --> 00:55:10,298
<font color="#ffff00">You'll never be a King
until you mastered it.</font>

438
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:12,331
<font color="#ffff00">Why she never come to see me, ha?</font>

439
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:15,543
<font color="#ffff00">I told you, when you're ready…-
Stop lying to me!</font>

440
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:18,416
<font color="#ffff00">I've done everything you've asked.</font>

441
00:55:18,456 --> 00:55:21,361
<font color="#ffff00">And everytime I passed a
test, you make another one.</font>

442
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:22,490
<font color="#ffff00">When am I ever gonna be good enough?</font>

443
00:55:26,566 --> 00:55:29,338
<font color="#ffff00">Did she not love me?</font>

444
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:32,402
<font color="#ffff00">Your mother loved you more than
anything in the world.</font>

445
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,548
<font color="#ffff00">But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe.</font>

446
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:39,520
<font color="#ffff00">Her marriage to
King Orvax was arranged a long time ago</font>

447
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,407
<font color="#ffff00">so she had to marry him and bear him</font>

448
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,377
<font color="#ffff00">a son, Prince Orm.</font>

449
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,399
<font color="#ffff00">But Orvax eventually found out about you,</font>

450
00:55:47,409 --> 00:55:54,516
<font color="#ffff00">He became overwhelmed with jealousy and
sacrificed her to the creatures of the Trench</font>

451
00:55:56,569 --> 00:55:59,435
<font color="#ffff00">Are you saying they executed her</font>

452
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:03,377
<font color="#ffff00">because she had me?</font>

453
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:20,417
<font color="#ffff00">I remember, everything.</font>

454
00:56:23,462 --> 00:56:28,426
<font color="#ffff00">I have something for you.
It belonged to my mother.</font>

455
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:37,555
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me, do you think she would enjoy
watching her sons murder each other?</font>

456
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:42,501
<font color="#ffff00">I understand your fear,
your reluctance, Mera.</font>

457
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:44,433
<font color="#ffff00">I surely do.</font>

458
00:56:44,463 --> 00:56:46,408
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want war.</font>

459
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:48,668
<font color="#ffff00">Don't patronise me. I know you.</font>

460
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:52,553
<font color="#ffff00">What you're doing is against every advise
your mother gave us when we were children.</font>

461
00:56:52,553 --> 00:56:57,458
<font color="#ffff00">If she were her…- But
she's not here, is she.</font>

462
00:56:57,498 --> 00:57:00,632
<font color="#ffff00">What my mother taught us was treason.</font>

463
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:03,545
<font color="#ffff00">Don't follow her ways.</font>

464
00:57:04,145 --> 00:57:07,209
<font color="#ffff00">Alright, the feared ring of fire, huh?</font>

465
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:11,212
<font color="#ffff00">How it works…
Let's keep your ass right here.</font>

466
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:20,113
<font color="#ffff00">Vulko, will you escort my
betrothed to the royal box.</font>

467
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:33,171
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go, Lady Mera.</font>

468
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:43,059
<font color="#ffff00">Down here we have a
legend called Karathen.</font>

469
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:47,124
<font color="#ffff00">An ancient sea monster so powerful
that King Atlan himself feared it.</font>

470
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:52,079
<font color="#ffff00">So he imprisoned it.-
In the depths of the ocean.</font>

471
00:57:52,109 --> 00:57:56,286
<font color="#ffff00">And it that abyss, the creature
buys time waiting to rise again.</font>

472
00:57:56,286 --> 00:57:59,187
<font color="#ffff00">Atlantis has been lying and wait.</font>

473
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:02,291
<font color="#ffff00">And now the beast has awaken.</font>

474
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:11,081
<font color="#ffff00">You know, there was a time</font>

475
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:14,254
<font color="#ffff00">when I wanted to meet
you more than anything.</font>

476
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:17,288
<font color="#ffff00">To get to know my little brother.</font>

477
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:20,174
<font color="#ffff00">To let him know that he wasn't alone.</font>

478
00:58:20,174 --> 00:58:22,203
<font color="#ffff00">Then we run into together.</font>

479
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:28,122
<font color="#ffff00">For me I know what a dick
you turned out to be.</font>

480
00:58:30,262 --> 00:58:33,165
<font color="#ffff00">You're the reason our mother was executed.</font>

481
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:37,139
<font color="#ffff00">And I've hated you since the beginning</font>

482
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:42,316
<font color="#ffff00">But I do not want to kill you, Arthur.</font>

483
00:58:42,316 --> 00:58:46,190
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to give you one chance.</font>

484
00:58:47,662 --> 00:58:52,867
<font color="#ffff00">Go home. Do not ever
come back to Atlantis.</font>

485
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:55,741
<font color="#ffff00">You re not going to win it.</font>

486
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:59,658
<font color="#ffff00">The war is coming to the surface,
whether you like it or not.</font>

487
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:03,630
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm bringing the wrath
of the seven seas with me.</font>

488
00:59:04,702 --> 00:59:07,606
<font color="#ffff00">You know I can't let that happen.</font>

489
00:59:07,636 --> 00:59:09,626
<font color="#ffff00">I know.</font>

490
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,554
<font color="#ffff00">What the hell is that?</font>

491
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:18,486
<font color="#ffff00">The ring of fire.</font>

492
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,712
<font color="#ffff00">Shit.</font>

493
00:59:41,743 --> 00:59:47,478
<font color="#ffff00">People of Atlantis, hear me. My
brother has come from the surface</font>

494
00:59:47,518 --> 00:59:48,750
<font color="#ffff00">to challenge me for the throne!</font>

495
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:53,638
<font color="#ffff00">Let us settle this in the ancient way.</font>

496
00:59:53,638 --> 00:59:57,670
<font color="#ffff00">By bloodshed to the gods…</font>

497
01:00:32,752 --> 01:00:34,622
<font color="#ffff00">Never thought I'd see the
day when my own father</font>

498
01:00:34,622 --> 01:00:36,714
<font color="#ffff00">would bow to the King of Atlantis.</font>

499
01:00:36,724 --> 01:00:38,787
<font color="#ffff00">The surface dweller drew first blood.</font>

500
01:00:38,827 --> 01:00:42,601
<font color="#ffff00">What would you have us do?
Beg them for mercy?</font>

501
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:44,603
<font color="#ffff00">I detest the surface as much as you do.</font>

502
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:47,808
<font color="#ffff00">But don't you find the timing of
all of this a bit convenient?</font>

503
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:55,668
<font color="#ffff00">You wouldn't be that gullible, would you?</font>

504
01:00:57,668 --> 01:00:59,731
<font color="#ffff00">You want this war too, don't you?</font>

505
01:00:59,771 --> 01:01:02,643
<font color="#ffff00">It's past time the surface dweller
earn their place in the world.</font>

506
01:01:02,643 --> 01:01:05,746
<font color="#ffff00">If this is what must be
done, then so be it.</font>

507
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:16,769
<font color="#ffff00">That's my mother's Trident,
powerful but flawed like her.</font>

508
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:19,655
<font color="#ffff00">I wield my father's.</font>

509
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:22,626
<font color="#ffff00">And it has never known defeat!</font>

510
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,893
<font color="#ffff00">I promised Atlanna I'll protect him.</font>

511
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:24,685
<font color="#ffff00">This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.</font>

512
01:04:19,998 --> 01:04:24,911
<font color="#ffff00">I am the one true king!</font>

513
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:10,162
<font color="#ffff00">You waiting for an invitation? Get in!</font>

514
01:05:19,994 --> 01:05:22,968
<font color="#ffff00">Mera!</font>

515
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:30,037
<font color="#ffff00">So what's the plan?- The plan was to recover
Atlan's Trident. Then challenge Orm.</font>

516
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:32,988
<font color="#ffff00">Ok. So we do things not in order.
Shit happens.</font>

517
01:05:38,066 --> 01:05:41,908
<font color="#ffff00">Heads up. We got a bogey on our six.-
What does that even mean?</font>

518
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,970
<font color="#ffff00">Bad guys behind us.- We just did that.</font>

519
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,143
<font color="#ffff00">Bad guys behind us.</font>

520
01:06:53,089 --> 01:06:56,033
<font color="#ffff00">Woah, woah, wait. You said we
shouldn't go over these walls-I did.</font>

521
01:06:56,033 --> 01:06:58,093
<font color="#ffff00">We shouldn't hide these things.-
I did! Now shut up!</font>

522
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:35,107
<font color="#ffff00">We are not dead yet!</font>

523
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:38,248
<font color="#ffff00">Jump!</font>

524
01:07:44,295 --> 01:07:47,069
<font color="#ffff00">Here, hold this.</font>

525
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:51,086
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing?-
We're gonna follow Pinnochio.</font>

526
01:07:51,116 --> 01:07:53,316
<font color="#ffff00">Who?- Never mind, come here.
Get in. Come on.</font>

527
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:58,294
<font color="#ffff00">Great. So we are getting eaten.</font>

528
01:08:20,176 --> 01:08:23,339
<font color="#ffff00">How'd you even doing this
anyway?- I don't know.</font>

529
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:29,227
<font color="#ffff00">I can hear them sometimes. They can hear me-
Right. We're both is some animal stomach.</font>

530
01:08:29,227 --> 01:08:30,290
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, I just saved your life.</font>

531
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:32,099
<font color="#ffff00">I saved yours first.</font>

532
01:08:36,275 --> 01:08:41,120
<font color="#ffff00">He said, coast is clear.
So, where to now?</font>

533
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:45,187
<font color="#ffff00">To the ocean of sand, your
people called the Sahara.</font>

534
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:48,128
<font color="#ffff00">Right.</font>

535
01:09:15,258 --> 01:09:16,251
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks for the ride buddy.</font>

536
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:22,206
<font color="#ffff00">Are you ok?</font>

537
01:09:22,346 --> 01:09:25,281
<font color="#ffff00">I've never been so high up.</font>

538
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,383
<font color="#ffff00">We're so far from home.</font>

539
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:31,416
<font color="#ffff00">At least you have a home.</font>

540
01:09:31,426 --> 01:09:35,230
<font color="#ffff00">Not anymore. I can never go back.</font>

541
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,334
<font color="#ffff00">I betrayed everything when I
saved you at the Coliseum.</font>

542
01:09:42,318 --> 01:09:45,412
<font color="#ffff00">Kalau begitu, I have to take you back.</font>

543
01:09:45,462 --> 01:09:48,438
<font color="#ffff00">Atlantis is many wonderful things.</font>

544
01:09:48,468 --> 01:09:51,439
<font color="#ffff00">But forgiving does not.-
But you're royalty.</font>

545
01:09:51,469 --> 01:09:53,411
<font color="#ffff00">So is your mother.</font>

546
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:57,238
<font color="#ffff00">If I go back now, I would be sacrificed
for the Trench.</font>

547
01:09:57,248 --> 01:10:00,219
<font color="#ffff00">Even my own father wouldn't take me back.</font>

548
01:10:03,435 --> 01:10:08,429
<font color="#ffff00">Look on the bright side. You don't have
to marry someone you're obligated.</font>

549
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:11,284
<font color="#ffff00">Obligation isn't love.</font>

550
01:10:11,314 --> 01:10:14,347
<font color="#ffff00">This is my family and my nation.</font>

551
01:10:14,357 --> 01:10:16,449
<font color="#ffff00">And I've turned my back on both.</font>

552
01:10:18,432 --> 01:10:21,465
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes we have to do what's right,</font>

553
01:10:21,465 --> 01:10:25,409
<font color="#ffff00">even if your heart aches against it.</font>

554
01:10:40,245 --> 01:10:43,310
<font color="#ffff00">Your Highness.</font>

555
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:46,341
<font color="#ffff00">The tracking puts Princess Mera here.</font>

556
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,486
<font color="#ffff00">In the desert.</font>

557
01:10:48,526 --> 01:10:53,271
<font color="#ffff00">You aid she was dead.- Apparently not.</font>

558
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:57,315
<font color="#ffff00">Does your brother still lives as well?-
Not for long.</font>

559
01:10:57,315 --> 01:11:00,377
<font color="#ffff00">Captain Murk, assemble the
strike force immediately.- No!</font>

560
01:11:00,387 --> 01:11:03,520
<font color="#ffff00">Mira is to be arrested
and she returned to me.</font>

561
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,294
<font color="#ffff00">She betrayed the throne…</font>

562
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,287
<font color="#ffff00">She's the daughter of Xebel.</font>

563
01:11:07,337 --> 01:11:11,239
<font color="#ffff00">If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.</font>

564
01:11:11,269 --> 01:11:15,516
<font color="#ffff00">Your Highness, we are now entering
the waters of the Fisherman Kingdom.</font>

565
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:22,334
<font color="#ffff00">Securing the alliance of the other two
kingdoms should be our immediate concern.</font>

566
01:11:24,564 --> 01:11:27,407
<font color="#ffff00">My vizier is correct.</font>

567
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:30,343
<font color="#ffff00">As usual.</font>

568
01:11:31,414 --> 01:11:38,351
<font color="#ffff00">Arrest them and bring back King Nereus's
daughter unharmed.</font>

569
01:12:00,577 --> 01:12:01,738
<font color="#ffff00">We're here.</font>

570
01:12:03,718 --> 01:12:06,622
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, is there anything nearby?</font>

571
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:09,597
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing but deserts for hundreds
of… mate.- Nothing but deserts…</font>

572
01:12:09,637 --> 01:12:10,628
<font color="#ffff00">He's wrong!</font>

573
01:12:12,707 --> 01:12:13,759
<font color="#ffff00">Mera, no!</font>

574
01:12:16,684 --> 01:12:18,704
<font color="#ffff00">She just jumped without a parachute.</font>

575
01:12:18,744 --> 01:12:21,688
<font color="#ffff00">Redhead. You gotta love 'em.</font>

576
01:12:50,781 --> 01:12:52,783
<font color="#ffff00">You're crazier than I thought.</font>

577
01:12:55,598 --> 01:12:56,660
<font color="#ffff00">This way.</font>

578
01:13:17,874 --> 01:13:21,816
<font color="#ffff00">You were defeated the last time because
your surface weapons failed you.</font>

579
01:13:21,846 --> 01:13:23,878
<font color="#ffff00">Ours will not.</font>

580
01:13:26,764 --> 01:13:30,755
<font color="#ffff00">It's prototype armour for the next
generation Atlantean soldier.</font>

581
01:13:30,935 --> 01:13:34,672
<font color="#ffff00">Revenge is something we
Atlantean understand.</font>

582
01:13:34,682 --> 01:13:37,813
<font color="#ffff00">You will lead my finest
commandoes as your personal army,</font>

583
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:39,876
<font color="#ffff00">to hunt the half breed abomination.</font>

584
01:13:39,926 --> 01:13:42,792
<font color="#ffff00">I can't touch them but you can.</font>

585
01:13:42,832 --> 01:13:44,731
<font color="#ffff00">He's fled to your world.</font>

586
01:13:44,731 --> 01:13:46,724
<font color="#ffff00">Kill him and the woman he's with</font>

587
01:13:46,774 --> 01:13:47,895
<font color="#ffff00">and you will be rewarded.</font>

588
01:13:47,935 --> 01:13:50,781
<font color="#ffff00">Killing him is my reward.</font>

589
01:13:53,852 --> 01:13:57,659
<font color="#ffff00">The crown jewel is too experimental.</font>

590
01:13:57,829 --> 01:14:00,860
<font color="#ffff00">Converge water into beams
of energised plasma.</font>

591
01:15:13,952 --> 01:15:16,598
<font color="#ffff00">Hmm, I think we're gonna
need a bigger helmet.</font>

592
01:15:16,598 --> 01:15:21,240
<font color="#ffff00">One of the tribes of Atlantis broke off and settled
here when the region was still an inland sea.</font>

593
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:24,216
<font color="#ffff00">When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.</font>

594
01:15:24,216 --> 01:15:26,177
<font color="#ffff00">Perished? Yeah that's great.</font>

595
01:15:26,187 --> 01:15:28,247
<font color="#ffff00">We're getting close now.-
Yeah, close to what?</font>

596
01:15:28,247 --> 01:15:30,311
<font color="#ffff00">Dying of thirst?- I'm close
to punching your face.</font>

597
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:33,226
<font color="#ffff00">A fight club? I didn't know you knew
how things work up here.</font>

598
01:15:33,236 --> 01:15:35,165
<font color="#ffff00">Why don;t you look around, we are lost.</font>

599
01:15:35,195 --> 01:15:38,200
<font color="#ffff00">You see that over there.
What is that? Na-da.</font>

600
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:39,232
<font color="#ffff00">This place's a wasteland.</font>

601
01:15:39,383 --> 01:15:42,213
<font color="#ffff00">You're the one who call this
'wasteland' a home.</font>

602
01:15:42,253 --> 01:15:43,445
<font color="#ffff00">This isn't my home.</font>

603
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:46,189
<font color="#ffff00">The whole shore doesn't look like this.</font>

604
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:47,322
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, no. Of course not.</font>

605
01:15:47,362 --> 01:15:51,204
<font color="#ffff00">You also got disgusting cities with sewers
emptying out into our ocean</font>

606
01:15:51,234 --> 01:15:52,465
<font color="#ffff00">and whole mountains made out of thrash.</font>

607
01:15:52,475 --> 01:15:56,442
<font color="#ffff00">You got great factories, and…</font>

608
01:15:56,453 --> 01:15:58,412
<font color="#ffff00">Ok, ok, ok. Point taken. Listen.</font>

609
01:15:58,452 --> 01:16:01,327
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, we got some idiots running the show.
But there are good things too right.</font>

610
01:16:01,327 --> 01:16:03,320
<font color="#ffff00">We got green forest, big mountains,</font>

611
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,302
<font color="#ffff00">and beautiful lakes.</font>

612
01:16:04,332 --> 01:16:08,233
<font color="#ffff00">You'd love them. There are like baby
oceans.- Are you trying to provoke me?</font>

613
01:16:08,233 --> 01:16:10,437
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just trying to say don't judge
a place before you even see it.</font>

614
01:16:10,447 --> 01:16:12,470
<font color="#ffff00">You judged Atlantis on far less.</font>

615
01:16:16,492 --> 01:16:19,358
<font color="#ffff00">No, no, no. Will you
just stop it with that.</font>

616
01:16:19,398 --> 01:16:20,458
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

617
01:16:20,468 --> 01:16:23,460
<font color="#ffff00">Your stupid Atlantean GPS just told you to
jump out of an airplane</font>

618
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,376
<font color="#ffff00">over the middle of the desert.
And now we are stranded.</font>

619
01:16:29,447 --> 01:16:32,390
<font color="#ffff00">If you are the next
true king we're doomed.</font>

620
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:01,413
<font color="#ffff00">That was awesome.</font>

621
01:17:07,531 --> 01:17:10,303
<font color="#ffff00">Look what I found.</font>

622
01:17:10,303 --> 01:17:13,279
<font color="#ffff00">What you found?- Yeah.</font>

623
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,559
<font color="#ffff00">Check this place out.</font>

624
01:17:25,369 --> 01:17:28,345
<font color="#ffff00">This is badass!</font>

625
01:17:28,545 --> 01:17:34,380
<font color="#ffff00">This is the hall of armoury where the legend
says where Atlann's Trident was forged.</font>

626
01:17:36,324 --> 01:17:38,387
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think they are a legend anymore.</font>

627
01:17:44,374 --> 01:17:46,505
<font color="#ffff00">I was right.</font>

628
01:17:48,386 --> 01:17:50,378
<font color="#ffff00">It's real.</font>

629
01:18:28,601 --> 01:18:30,546
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing.</font>

630
01:18:30,546 --> 01:18:32,638
<font color="#ffff00">Of course it's not working.
It's been sitting here</font>

631
01:18:32,678 --> 01:18:35,409
<font color="#ffff00">collecting dust since before
the Sahara was a desert.</font>

632
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:42,467
<font color="#ffff00">Man.- Since before the Sahara
was a desert.</font>

633
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:44,528
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you for repeating what I just said.</font>

634
01:18:44,568 --> 01:18:46,563
<font color="#ffff00">It's completely dried out.</font>

635
01:18:48,546 --> 01:18:51,536
<font color="#ffff00">You do the best thinking when
you're not thinking at all.</font>

636
01:18:51,546 --> 01:18:53,580
<font color="#ffff00">Now hold still.</font>

637
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:56,495
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing?- We need water.</font>

638
01:18:56,635 --> 01:19:00,657
<font color="#ffff00">You are the closest source.
Now hold still.</font>

639
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,623
<font color="#ffff00">We could've just peed on it.</font>

640
01:19:50,646 --> 01:19:52,545
<font color="#ffff00">King Atlann.</font>

641
01:19:54,548 --> 01:19:59,495
<font color="#ffff00">In this Trident resides
the power of Atlantis.</font>

642
01:19:59,535 --> 01:20:03,669
<font color="#ffff00">In the wrong hands, it
would bring destruction.</font>

643
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:07,613
<font color="#ffff00">In the hands of the true heir,
it will unite all our</font>

644
01:20:07,643 --> 01:20:09,644
<font color="#ffff00">kingdoms above and below.</font>

645
01:20:09,654 --> 01:20:14,533
<font color="#ffff00">If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.</font>

646
01:20:14,563 --> 01:20:18,465
<font color="#ffff00">Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the hidden sea.</font>

647
01:20:18,505 --> 01:20:21,571
<font color="#ffff00">Look inside the bottle
for the chartered path.</font>

648
01:20:21,581 --> 01:20:24,571
<font color="#ffff00">Only in the hands of the true king,</font>

649
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:27,616
<font color="#ffff00">can he truly see.</font>

650
01:20:42,682 --> 01:20:44,786
<font color="#ffff00">We can't let Orm find this.</font>

651
01:20:46,727 --> 01:20:48,598
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, wait! No…</font>

652
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:50,692
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

653
01:20:50,702 --> 01:20:52,675
<font color="#ffff00">Shouldn't we have written it down first?</font>

654
01:20:52,705 --> 01:20:55,646
<font color="#ffff00">I memorised it. Didn't you?</font>

655
01:20:56,687 --> 01:20:58,551
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, yeah.</font>

656
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:00,765
<font color="#ffff00">What did it just said?</font>

657
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:05,598
<font color="#ffff00">Something something Trident.</font>

658
01:21:27,852 --> 01:21:30,588
<font color="#ffff00">It's our next stop.</font>

659
01:23:04,724 --> 01:23:06,886
<font color="#ffff00">I'm starting to think you actually
like the surface dwellers.</font>

660
01:23:06,896 --> 01:23:09,828
<font color="#ffff00">It'd be wrong to judge a place
I've never seen before.</font>

661
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:14,765
<font color="#ffff00">I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.</font>

662
01:23:34,817 --> 01:23:36,990
<font color="#ffff00">Well, apparently she's right up on the
hill in the old castle.</font>

663
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,931
<font color="#ffff00">I've just learnt something
very interesting.</font>

664
01:23:40,832 --> 01:23:42,706
<font color="#ffff00">Pinocchio.</font>

665
01:23:42,836 --> 01:23:45,871
<font color="#ffff00">You risk our lives on something you read
on a children's book?</font>

666
01:23:46,909 --> 01:23:50,715
<font color="#ffff00">Wait it's a book? How about that.</font>

667
01:23:50,986 --> 01:23:54,758
<font color="#ffff00">We have to go.</font>

668
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:02,967
<font color="#ffff00">King Nereus, I had hoped
that our people had evolved</font>

669
01:24:03,007 --> 01:24:06,012
<font color="#ffff00">that war with the surface is inevitable.</font>

670
01:24:06,052 --> 01:24:11,857
<font color="#ffff00">It is the position of the Fishermen that
when the time comes to make ourselves known</font>

671
01:24:11,867 --> 01:24:12,928
<font color="#ffff00">to the lands men.</font>

672
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,873
<font color="#ffff00">It shall be to educate them,</font>

673
01:24:15,043 --> 01:24:17,016
<font color="#ffff00">not destroy them.</font>

674
01:24:17,146 --> 01:24:20,978
<font color="#ffff00">I admire your lofty aspirations King…</font>

675
01:24:23,994 --> 01:24:29,057
<font color="#ffff00">But I suspect they are a cloud of
ink hiding the heart of coward</font>

676
01:24:29,067 --> 01:24:30,941
<font color="#ffff00">How dare you!</font>

677
01:24:33,043 --> 01:24:36,034
<font color="#ffff00">Please, I implore you.</font>

678
01:24:36,044 --> 01:24:40,081
<font color="#ffff00">Your kingdom's bloated
philosophers and flaccid moments</font>

679
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:43,893
<font color="#ffff00">whose waters have gone
stagnant and it sickens me.</font>

680
01:24:52,052 --> 01:24:53,075
<font color="#ffff00">My king!</font>

681
01:24:53,115 --> 01:24:54,958
<font color="#ffff00">The king is dead.</font>

682
01:24:55,158 --> 01:24:57,959
<font color="#ffff00">Long live the heir.</font>

683
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:04,098
<font color="#ffff00">Princess. Prepare your
armies, Your Highness.</font>

684
01:25:04,108 --> 01:25:07,911
<font color="#ffff00">We move against the Brine kingdom at once.</font>

685
01:25:15,969 --> 01:25:17,163
<font color="#ffff00">What are the records saying again?</font>

686
01:25:17,203 --> 01:25:21,105
<font color="#ffff00">Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the hidden sea.</font>

687
01:25:21,115 --> 01:25:23,107
<font color="#ffff00">Look into the bottle for
the chartered path.</font>

688
01:25:23,147 --> 01:25:25,142
<font color="#ffff00">Only in the hands of the true king,</font>

689
01:25:25,152 --> 01:25:27,124
<font color="#ffff00">can he truly see.</font>

690
01:25:29,094 --> 01:25:32,159
<font color="#ffff00">Look into the bottle for
the chartered path.</font>

691
01:25:36,242 --> 01:25:40,208
<font color="#ffff00">Oh man.- What?</font>

692
01:25:46,164 --> 01:25:49,039
<font color="#ffff00">But how do you know where
to point it…- Let me see.</font>

693
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:50,131
<font color="#ffff00">What's the last line?</font>

694
01:25:50,171 --> 01:25:52,941
<font color="#ffff00">Only in the hands of the true king,</font>

695
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,102
<font color="#ffff00">can he truly see.</font>

696
01:25:59,129 --> 01:26:01,220
<font color="#ffff00">He was a great General,
but he wasn't a king.</font>

697
01:26:06,178 --> 01:26:10,140
<font color="#ffff00">How do you know all this stuff?- My pops.
He make sure I know my history.</font>

698
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:15,256
<font color="#ffff00">None of these guys are
kings, except this guy.</font>

699
01:26:15,256 --> 01:26:18,170
<font color="#ffff00">Romulos, first king of Rome.</font>

700
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:22,167
<font color="#ffff00">Only in the hands of the true king,</font>

701
01:26:22,207 --> 01:26:24,106
<font color="#ffff00">can he truly see.</font>

702
01:26:33,196 --> 01:26:37,203
<font color="#ffff00">There it is. That's where we're heading.-
What? Let me see.</font>

703
01:26:44,091 --> 01:26:46,182
<font color="#ffff00">Not bad, for an imbecile huh?</font>

704
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:50,096
<font color="#ffff00">Not bad at all.</font>

705
01:31:52,415 --> 01:31:54,247
<font color="#ffff00">Go!</font>

706
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:08,343
<font color="#ffff00">I'll show you the same mercy
you showed my father.</font>

707
01:32:08,383 --> 01:32:11,319
<font color="#ffff00">And cut you like the fish you are.</font>

708
01:34:06,426 --> 01:34:08,490
<font color="#ffff00">Arthur!</font>

709
01:34:11,414 --> 01:34:15,437
<font color="#ffff00">Mera. They are tracking you.- What?</font>

710
01:34:15,487 --> 01:34:18,363
<font color="#ffff00">They are tracking you.</font>

711
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:31,575
<font color="#ffff00">Arthur! Stay with me.</font>

712
01:34:31,585 --> 01:34:34,460
<font color="#ffff00">Arthur, wake up.</font>

713
01:35:26,468 --> 01:35:28,501
<font color="#ffff00">Did you steal a boat?</font>

714
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:31,482
<font color="#ffff00">Are the boats at the
marina not for public use?</font>

715
01:35:31,482 --> 01:35:34,648
<font color="#ffff00">No. Those belong to people.</font>

716
01:35:37,661 --> 01:35:41,463
<font color="#ffff00">Those are Orm's elite commandoes.
The one who lead them</font>

717
01:35:41,463 --> 01:35:46,608
<font color="#ffff00">isn't Atlantean. I've never
seen him before.- Yeah, I have.</font>

718
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:50,415
<font color="#ffff00">He and his father were pirates.</font>

719
01:35:50,455 --> 01:35:53,656
<font color="#ffff00">He blames me for his father's death.</font>

720
01:35:53,696 --> 01:35:58,695
<font color="#ffff00">He pick a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.</font>

721
01:35:58,705 --> 01:36:02,507
<font color="#ffff00">It's not how I feels.</font>

722
01:36:02,547 --> 01:36:05,572
<font color="#ffff00">It was up to me, I let him die,</font>

723
01:36:06,654 --> 01:36:09,595
<font color="#ffff00">I could save him but I didn't.</font>

724
01:36:09,595 --> 01:36:15,635
<font color="#ffff00">I know I made an enemy. And he could
hurt you, knowing it's my fault.</font>

725
01:36:16,745 --> 01:36:18,735
<font color="#ffff00">Well he's behind us now.</font>

726
01:36:20,617 --> 01:36:23,683
<font color="#ffff00">It's what lies ahead
that should concerns us.</font>

727
01:36:24,622 --> 01:36:28,587
<font color="#ffff00">The chartered path leads to
the kingdom of the Trench.</font>

728
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,670
<font color="#ffff00">That's the same creatures
that killed my mother.</font>

729
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:36,516
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.</font>

730
01:36:36,516 --> 01:36:38,620
<font color="#ffff00">It has become a place of death.</font>

731
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:41,561
<font color="#ffff00">I know next to nothing
about what's down there.</font>

732
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:46,659
<font color="#ffff00">We should turn back.</font>

733
01:36:46,809 --> 01:36:49,740
<font color="#ffff00">We can still warn the surface, try to
prepare them for what's coming.</font>

734
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:52,776
<font color="#ffff00">Turn back?
- Look. I learn from a young age</font>

735
01:36:52,786 --> 01:36:55,519
<font color="#ffff00">about not to show weakness.</font>

736
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:58,529
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, it's not a problem
with my anger and my fist.</font>

737
01:36:58,529 --> 01:37:01,505
<font color="#ffff00">I'm a blunt instrument
and I'm damn good at it.</font>

738
01:37:01,535 --> 01:37:04,596
<font color="#ffff00">I've done nothing.
Getting my ass kicked</font>

739
01:37:04,606 --> 01:37:05,768
<font color="#ffff00">this whole trip.</font>

740
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:09,585
<font color="#ffff00">I'm no leader. I'm not a king.</font>

741
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:11,754
<font color="#ffff00">I do not work or play well with others.</font>

742
01:37:12,595 --> 01:37:14,618
<font color="#ffff00">And I”m not going to let you die</font>

743
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:16,763
<font color="#ffff00">trying to turn me into something I'm not.</font>

744
01:37:17,604 --> 01:37:22,347
<font color="#ffff00">You think you're unworthy to lead because
we're from two different worlds.</font>

745
01:37:22,477 --> 01:37:26,444
<font color="#ffff00">But that is exactly why you are worthy.</font>

746
01:37:26,454 --> 01:37:30,326
<font color="#ffff00">You are the bridge between land and sea.</font>

747
01:37:30,366 --> 01:37:32,531
<font color="#ffff00">I can see that now.</font>

748
01:37:32,571 --> 01:37:38,484
<font color="#ffff00">The only question is, can you?</font>

749
01:37:53,311 --> 01:37:57,349
<font color="#ffff00">The tracking on Lady Mera is still
dark, Your Highness.</font>

750
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:02,262
<font color="#ffff00">Vulko, my trusted vizier.</font>

751
01:38:02,302 --> 01:38:06,138
<font color="#ffff00">You stood by the throne since my father.</font>

752
01:38:07,337 --> 01:38:11,184
<font color="#ffff00">Have you any advise for
me since this war begins</font>

753
01:38:11,184 --> 01:38:14,056
<font color="#ffff00">I've already given it, my king.</font>

754
01:38:14,086 --> 01:38:17,288
<font color="#ffff00">That I will stand by
your decision as always.</font>

755
01:38:17,328 --> 01:38:20,324
<font color="#ffff00">My decision…</font>

756
01:38:20,334 --> 01:38:24,276
<font color="#ffff00">To protect it…</font>

757
01:38:25,177 --> 01:38:27,342
<font color="#ffff00">While you betray it.</font>

758
01:38:28,153 --> 01:38:32,095
<font color="#ffff00">You think I do not know of your treachery.</font>

759
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:36,403
<font color="#ffff00">That you ever made loyal to
my mother's bastard son.</font>

760
01:38:37,243 --> 01:38:43,120
<font color="#ffff00">That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me.</font>

761
01:38:45,192 --> 01:38:47,323
<font color="#ffff00">Do not deny it.</font>

762
01:38:49,366 --> 01:38:53,270
<font color="#ffff00">I do not.- Why?</font>

763
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:56,412
<font color="#ffff00">I am a pure blood.</font>

764
01:38:56,412 --> 01:39:00,378
<font color="#ffff00">I have devoted my life to Atlantis.</font>

765
01:39:00,418 --> 01:39:02,329
<font color="#ffff00">You wanted nothing to do with it.</font>

766
01:39:02,359 --> 01:39:04,191
<font color="#ffff00">You swore to serve the throne.</font>

767
01:39:04,191 --> 01:39:05,223
<font color="#ffff00">I do serve it.</font>

768
01:39:05,263 --> 01:39:07,297
<font color="#ffff00">Arthur may only be half Atlantean,</font>

769
01:39:07,307 --> 01:39:12,210
<font color="#ffff00">but he is already twice
the king you'll ever be.</font>

770
01:39:17,456 --> 01:39:19,328
<font color="#ffff00">Take him.</font>

771
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:23,466
<font color="#ffff00">But make sure he has a view.</font>

772
01:41:04,098 --> 01:41:07,900
<font color="#ffff00">What the hell are these
things?- The Trench! We're here!</font>

773
01:41:09,202 --> 01:41:12,148
<font color="#ffff00">There's too many of them!- Come on inside!</font>

774
01:41:21,398 --> 01:41:24,259
<font color="#ffff00">They re from the depths.
They are afraid of lights.</font>

775
01:41:42,321 --> 01:41:44,224
<font color="#ffff00">Get ready to jump.</font>

776
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,302
<font color="#ffff00">Over there!</font>

777
01:43:29,379 --> 01:43:33,346
<font color="#ffff00">That thing will tear us apart.
- We don't have a choice.</font>

778
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:55,401
<font color="#ffff00">Arthur!</font>

779
01:43:58,372 --> 01:43:59,474
<font color="#ffff00">Mera!</font>

780
01:44:30,408 --> 01:44:34,315
<font color="#ffff00">Mera! Mera!</font>

781
01:44:56,367 --> 01:44:57,601
<font color="#ffff00">Mera!</font>

782
01:45:44,634 --> 01:45:48,436
<font color="#ffff00">Arthur.- Mom.</font>

783
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:29,653
<font color="#ffff00">They sacrificed me to the Trench.</font>

784
01:46:29,693 --> 01:46:33,610
<font color="#ffff00">But I survived, fought my
way through like you did,</font>

785
01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:36,671
<font color="#ffff00">and I ended up here.- You've been here
alone for twenty years?</font>

786
01:46:36,711 --> 01:46:40,658
<font color="#ffff00">Yes. Come, sit here.</font>

787
01:46:44,599 --> 01:46:48,626
<font color="#ffff00">You must forgive me.
Forgive me for everything.</font>

788
01:46:48,676 --> 01:46:51,647
<font color="#ffff00">This happened because you had me.</font>

789
01:46:52,578 --> 01:46:54,552
<font color="#ffff00">Not for having you.</font>

790
01:46:54,582 --> 01:46:57,555
<font color="#ffff00">None of this is your fault.</font>

791
01:46:57,555 --> 01:46:58,715
<font color="#ffff00">I made a choice.</font>

792
01:46:58,725 --> 01:47:02,461
<font color="#ffff00">I had to leave to say you.</font>

793
01:47:02,502 --> 01:47:04,775
<font color="#ffff00">To save your father.</font>

794
01:47:06,504 --> 01:47:10,711
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me, tell me about him. Is he….</font>

795
01:47:14,593 --> 01:47:17,528
<font color="#ffff00">He still walks to the end of the dock…</font>

796
01:47:18,771 --> 01:47:20,762
<font color="#ffff00">Every morning.</font>

797
01:47:22,773 --> 01:47:24,644
<font color="#ffff00">…Every day.</font>

798
01:47:26,789 --> 01:47:29,720
<font color="#ffff00">Waiting for you.</font>

799
01:47:36,739 --> 01:47:38,730
<font color="#ffff00">Why didn't you ever come back?</font>

800
01:47:43,658 --> 01:47:47,590
<font color="#ffff00">Because the portal that brought you here
will never let us return.</font>

801
01:47:48,562 --> 01:47:51,668
<font color="#ffff00">The Trident is the only way back.</font>

802
01:47:51,678 --> 01:47:56,582
<font color="#ffff00">But it is guarded by the Karathen.</font>

803
01:47:57,584 --> 01:48:00,645
<font color="#ffff00">The creature from our legend is real.</font>

804
01:48:00,655 --> 01:48:03,718
<font color="#ffff00">It lies beyond the waterfall.</font>

805
01:48:07,644 --> 01:48:11,577
<font color="#ffff00">We'll go with you. We fight it together.
- No.</font>

806
01:48:11,577 --> 01:48:13,742
<font color="#ffff00">Its; too powerful.</font>

807
01:48:13,782 --> 01:48:16,753
<font color="#ffff00">I've tried many times over the years.</font>

808
01:48:17,664 --> 01:48:20,730
<font color="#ffff00">The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.</font>

809
01:48:23,602 --> 01:48:25,663
<font color="#ffff00">You're afraid.</font>

810
01:48:27,646 --> 01:48:29,640
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

811
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:32,581
<font color="#ffff00">Good.</font>

812
01:48:32,891 --> 01:48:34,884
<font color="#ffff00">You're ready.</font>

813
01:48:35,766 --> 01:48:38,740
<font color="#ffff00">Atlantis had always had a king.</font>

814
01:48:38,770 --> 01:48:41,610
<font color="#ffff00">Now it needs something more.</font>

815
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,704
<font color="#ffff00">What could be greater than a king?</font>

816
01:48:44,686 --> 01:48:47,657
<font color="#ffff00">A hero.</font>

817
01:48:47,687 --> 01:48:49,660
<font color="#ffff00">A king only fights for its nation.</font>

818
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:53,837
<font color="#ffff00">You fight for everyone.</font>

819
01:50:22,955 --> 01:50:27,733
<font color="#ffff00">You do not belong here.</font>

820
01:50:28,773 --> 01:50:36,782
<font color="#ffff00">I have guarded the Trident against false kings
since the beginning and for a thousand years.</font>

821
01:50:37,992 --> 01:50:42,729
<font color="#ffff00">I have seen the greatest champion tried,</font>

822
01:50:42,739 --> 01:50:43,900
<font color="#ffff00">and failed.</font>

823
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:49,887
<font color="#ffff00">But never have I sense
one as unworthy as you.</font>

824
01:50:49,887 --> 01:50:56,854
<font color="#ffff00">You dare to come here with your tainted
mongrel blood</font>

825
01:50:56,864 --> 01:51:00,898
<font color="#ffff00">to claim Atlantis's greatest treasure?</font>

826
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:04,905
<font color="#ffff00">So be it.</font>

827
01:51:05,786 --> 01:51:07,817
<font color="#ffff00">Half breed.</font>

828
01:51:26,897 --> 01:51:29,923
<font color="#ffff00">You thought yourself worthy?</font>

829
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:32,903
<font color="#ffff00">You thought yourself a king?</font>

830
01:51:32,944 --> 01:51:37,942
<font color="#ffff00">You dishonour this place
with your presence.</font>

831
01:51:45,941 --> 01:51:49,963
<font color="#ffff00">You're right. I am a half breed
mongrel.</font>

832
01:51:50,013 --> 01:51:54,979
<font color="#ffff00">But I did not come here because I
thought I was worthy. I know I'm not.</font>

833
01:51:55,019 --> 01:52:01,838
<font color="#ffff00">You understand me.-
I do.</font>

834
01:52:01,838 --> 01:52:08,876
<font color="#ffff00">No mortal has conversed
with me since King Atlan.</font>

835
01:52:09,117 --> 01:52:13,059
<font color="#ffff00">Who are you?</font>

836
01:52:13,089 --> 01:52:15,062
<font color="#ffff00">I'm nobody.</font>

837
01:52:16,866 --> 01:52:19,837
<font color="#ffff00">I came because I have no choice.</font>

838
01:52:21,138 --> 01:52:23,984
<font color="#ffff00">I came to save my home,</font>

839
01:52:24,014 --> 01:52:26,015
<font color="#ffff00">and the people that I love.</font>

840
01:52:28,186 --> 01:52:32,333
<font color="#ffff00">I came because the Trident
is our only hope.</font>

841
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:35,234
<font color="#ffff00">And if that's not good enough,</font>

842
01:52:37,176 --> 01:52:39,210
<font color="#ffff00">then screw you.</font>

843
01:52:41,152 --> 01:52:48,131
<font color="#ffff00">No man has ever freed the
Trident from Atlann's grip.</font>

844
01:52:48,171 --> 01:52:52,303
<font color="#ffff00">Should he deemed you unworthy,</font>

845
01:52:52,313 --> 01:52:58,150
<font color="#ffff00">Well I haven't insisted in yours</font>

846
01:52:58,190 --> 01:53:01,254
<font color="#ffff00">and I am damaged</font>

847
01:54:29,385 --> 01:54:33,217
<font color="#ffff00">The one true king.</font>

848
01:54:46,223 --> 01:54:53,462
<font color="#ffff00">Remember, the Brine are a powerful savage group It will sweep
us all and declare their leadership will turn the tide.</font>

849
01:54:53,472 --> 01:54:59,207
<font color="#ffff00">Defeat the Brine king and you will command
the greatest military might on this planet.</font>

850
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:02,480
<font color="#ffff00">Today we unite our kingdoms.</font>

851
01:55:03,491 --> 01:55:06,355
<font color="#ffff00">Tomorrow we scorch the surface!</font>

852
01:55:08,169 --> 01:55:13,301
<font color="#ffff00">Rise, Atlantians!</font>

853
01:55:35,357 --> 01:55:37,289
<font color="#ffff00">Go!</font>

854
01:56:51,414 --> 01:56:54,215
<font color="#ffff00">No, we need him.</font>

855
01:56:56,159 --> 01:57:01,293
<font color="#ffff00">You expect me to address
you as Your Highness?</font>

856
01:57:01,303 --> 01:57:03,206
<font color="#ffff00">Not Your Highness</font>

857
01:57:03,406 --> 01:57:08,351
<font color="#ffff00">Call me Ocean Master.</font>

858
01:57:08,351 --> 01:57:13,229
<font color="#ffff00">You can take my army,
you sub belly slut,</font>

859
01:57:13,269 --> 01:57:16,360
<font color="#ffff00">You will never have my allegiance!</font>

860
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,391
<font color="#ffff00">So be it!</font>

861
01:58:25,450 --> 01:58:27,481
<font color="#ffff00">The King has risen.</font>

862
01:58:35,269 --> 01:58:37,432
<font color="#ffff00">Attack!</font>

863
02:00:36,227 --> 02:00:38,429
<font color="#ffff00">There's too many casualties.
We have to stop fighting now.</font>

864
02:00:38,568 --> 02:00:41,561
<font color="#ffff00">I'll find my father.
You must defeat Orm.</font>

865
02:00:42,744 --> 02:00:46,617
<font color="#ffff00">And what if I can't?-
Last time you was in his element.</font>

866
02:00:47,588 --> 02:00:50,783
<font color="#ffff00">This time, make him fight in yours.</font>

867
02:01:19,654 --> 02:01:22,790
<font color="#ffff00">What's the plan again?-
Plan is not to get killed.</font>

868
02:01:23,731 --> 02:01:26,702
<font color="#ffff00">Ya. Good plan. Not get killed.</font>

869
02:01:59,669 --> 02:02:02,705
<font color="#ffff00">The Trident. He has the
Trident.- Impossible!</font>

870
02:02:19,654 --> 02:02:21,774
<font color="#ffff00">Stand down! Let her pass.</font>

871
02:02:21,784 --> 02:02:23,716
<font color="#ffff00">Please, father.</font>

872
02:02:23,726 --> 02:02:24,818
<font color="#ffff00">He has the Trident.</font>

873
02:02:24,858 --> 02:02:26,892
<font color="#ffff00">I know you think this was necessary.</font>

874
02:02:26,932 --> 02:02:29,863
<font color="#ffff00">But Arthur is king by our most sacred law.</font>

875
02:02:29,873 --> 02:02:31,896
<font color="#ffff00">And if you turn your back on that now</font>

876
02:02:31,906 --> 02:02:34,851
<font color="#ffff00">then the Atlantis you're fighting
for is already dead.- It's true.</font>

877
02:02:34,881 --> 02:02:38,653
<font color="#ffff00">The half breed wields King
Atlan's Trident.- He …the sea.</font>

878
02:02:39,925 --> 02:02:42,690
<font color="#ffff00">Then the half breed is your king.</font>

879
02:03:58,956 --> 02:04:02,056
<font color="#ffff00">Vulko! Come on, he needs our help.</font>

880
02:04:02,097 --> 02:04:04,069
<font color="#ffff00">We can't. Look.</font>

881
02:04:04,069 --> 02:04:07,105
<font color="#ffff00">The people must bear witness.</font>

882
02:04:11,988 --> 02:04:14,824
<font color="#ffff00">The Trident doesn't change what you are.</font>

883
02:04:15,094 --> 02:04:17,895
<font color="#ffff00">Half breed bastard.</font>

884
02:04:19,036 --> 02:04:22,972
<font color="#ffff00">Atlantis will never
accept you as it's King.</font>

885
02:04:25,044 --> 02:04:27,885
<font color="#ffff00">Well then my blood shed</font>

886
02:04:28,887 --> 02:04:31,122
<font color="#ffff00">will the gods make on your will.</font>

887
02:05:00,954 --> 02:05:02,016
<font color="#ffff00">Yield the throne.</font>

888
02:06:38,263 --> 02:06:41,066
<font color="#ffff00">Finish it.- Yield the throne.</font>

889
02:06:41,106 --> 02:06:43,170
<font color="#ffff00">Mercy is not our way.</font>

890
02:06:44,212 --> 02:06:47,153
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe you don't know this brother.</font>

891
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:54,221
<font color="#ffff00">But I'm not one of you.- Do it!</font>

892
02:06:57,173 --> 02:07:00,199
<font color="#ffff00">Kill me!- No!</font>

893
02:07:02,209 --> 02:07:04,271
<font color="#ffff00">That is enough killing!</font>

894
02:07:11,069 --> 02:07:12,331
<font color="#ffff00">Mother.</font>

895
02:07:13,273 --> 02:07:16,078
<font color="#ffff00">Orm, my son.</font>

896
02:07:24,127 --> 02:07:27,258
<font color="#ffff00">It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.</font>

897
02:07:28,199 --> 02:07:30,144
<font color="#ffff00">Come on.</font>

898
02:07:36,317 --> 02:07:43,325
<font color="#ffff00">I don't understand. We thought…-
I know. Arthur saved me.</font>

899
02:07:47,182 --> 02:07:50,203
<font color="#ffff00">You're with him?- I am.</font>

900
02:07:51,355 --> 02:07:56,092
<font color="#ffff00">You're both my children,
and I love you so much.</font>

901
02:07:56,361 --> 02:08:00,206
<font color="#ffff00">But you have been misguided.</font>

902
02:08:00,206 --> 02:08:05,341
<font color="#ffff00">Your father taught you that there
were two worlds. He was wrong.</font>

903
02:08:05,351 --> 02:08:13,089
<font color="#ffff00">The land and the sea are one.</font>

904
02:08:32,242 --> 02:08:34,175
<font color="#ffff00">My Queen.</font>

905
02:08:36,175 --> 02:08:37,236
<font color="#ffff00">Vulko.</font>

906
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:44,384
<font color="#ffff00">Take him. But make sure he has a view.</font>

907
02:08:51,312 --> 02:08:55,378
<font color="#ffff00">When you're ready… let's talk.</font>

908
02:09:11,426 --> 02:09:17,362
<font color="#ffff00">People of Atlantis, today
we gather in bloodshed.</font>

909
02:09:17,362 --> 02:09:22,338
<font color="#ffff00">I give you, King
Arthur, of Atlantis.</font>

910
02:09:22,378 --> 02:09:27,285
<font color="#ffff00">Hail to the King!</font>

911
02:09:36,405 --> 02:09:40,347
<font color="#ffff00">So what do I do now?-
Be their king.</font>

912
02:09:43,223 --> 02:09:45,354
<font color="#ffff00">This is gonna be fun.</font>

913
02:10:34,899 --> 02:10:37,895
<font color="#ffff00">I love you.-
I love you too.</font>

914
02:10:37,945 --> 02:10:40,006
<font color="#ffff00">You're back.- Yes.</font>

915
02:10:47,825 --> 02:10:49,886
<font color="#ffff00">My father was my housekeeper.</font>

916
02:10:50,866 --> 02:10:53,842
<font color="#ffff00">My mother was a queen.</font>

917
02:10:54,042 --> 02:10:56,034
<font color="#ffff00">They were never meant to meet.</font>

918
02:10:59,917 --> 02:11:02,913
<font color="#ffff00">But their love saved the world.</font>

919
02:11:04,862 --> 02:11:06,835
<font color="#ffff00">They made me what I am.</font>

920
02:11:06,865 --> 02:11:10,901
<font color="#ffff00">A son of the land, a king of the seas.</font>

921
02:11:12,811 --> 02:11:16,808
<font color="#ffff00">I am the protector of the deep.</font>

922
02:11:16,818 --> 02:11:21,809
<font color="#ffff00">I am Aquaman.</font>
