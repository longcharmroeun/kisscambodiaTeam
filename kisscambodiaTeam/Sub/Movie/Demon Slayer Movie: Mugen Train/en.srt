1
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:47,255
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,045
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:50,955
Minoru...

4
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:53,175
Masao...

5
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,045
Susumu...

6
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,345
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,455
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:01,595
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:03,475
Isao...

10
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:05,645
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:07,395
Yukio...

12
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:09,105
Takahiro...

13
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:24,045
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:26,625
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:33,905
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:43,925
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,305
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:57,355
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,025
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:09,855
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,345
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:57,905
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:25,025
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,745
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,525
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:36,505
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:37,705
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,345
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:42,545
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:47,595
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,045
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,375
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:09,475
So fast!

34
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,475
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:14,295
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,495
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,405
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,295
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:27,745
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:28,555
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:31,095
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:42,845
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:44,475
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,755
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:48,855
Sure,

46
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:52,905
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:54,155
Hey!

48
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,575
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,325
Delicious!

50
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:30,355
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:32,975
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:34,645
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:36,655
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:40,655
Delicious!

55
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:43,245
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:46,745
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:49,325
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:51,745
Delicious!

59
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,005
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:57,255
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:00,505
Delicious!

62
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:02,805
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,025
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,895
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,505
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:08,975
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:11,275
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:13,105
Delicious!

69
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,745
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:16,575
Delicious!

71
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:20,825
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,595
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,675
Yes.

74
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,455
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:39,345
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:43,375
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:44,595
Yes.

78
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:46,695
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:50,355
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:54,775
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,025
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:09,795
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,455
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:16,125
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:17,955
A mission?

86
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:20,395
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:26,975
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:30,595
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:31,725
Right.

90
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:34,755
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:37,945
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,905
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,605
About my father...

94
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:45,655
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,355
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,695
Was he really?

97
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,175
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:54,875
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,175
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:59,595
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:00,595
What's up?

102
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,705
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,255
Dance!

104
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:09,125
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:13,055
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,445
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:21,895
Right!

108
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:24,305
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:28,545
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:34,155
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:36,545
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:38,625
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:42,455
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:46,145
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:49,095
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,675
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:57,305
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,765 --> 00:08:58,755
Flame.

119
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,055
Water.

120
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:01,345
Wind.

121
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:02,655
Stone.

122
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:05,775
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:10,405
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,655
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:15,525
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:17,655
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:21,795
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,295
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,345
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,345
For real?

131
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,995
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:36,355
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,305
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:42,105
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,605
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,055
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:56,955
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,325 --> 00:10:00,405
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:06,875
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,575
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:13,475
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:16,395
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:20,145
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:26,645
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:28,405
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:29,575
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:34,245
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:35,995
Nooo!

149
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:37,745
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:43,275
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:47,845
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:50,755
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,845
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:09,945
May I...

155
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:11,525
see your...

156
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:13,395
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:15,805
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:20,245
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:32,625
Here.

160
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:58,105
What is this?

161
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:00,525
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,775
Thank you...

163
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:05,945
very much.

164
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:11,545
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,675
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:18,175
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:42,025
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,495
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:49,955
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:56,905
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,145
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:06,145
First Form...

173
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:28,775
Amazing.

174
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,275
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,275
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,955
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,255
All right!

178
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:45,205
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,695
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:13,625
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,545
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:21,045
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,125
All right!

184
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,455
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:26,495
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:29,055
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,525
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,945
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:51,945
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,045
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:04,045
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:31,225
Tha...

193
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:33,225
Tha...

194
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:37,155
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,995
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,795
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:44,795
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,325
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,245
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:51,745
Bro!

201
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:53,805
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,675
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,045
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,975
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:49,445
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:52,105
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,395
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:57,305
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,795
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,625
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:14,995
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:17,295
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:22,475
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:27,475
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:30,145
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:37,275
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:42,745
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:47,245
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:51,155
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:54,675
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:56,845
Okay.

222
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:55,895
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,525
Calm down.

224
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,405
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:07,855
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:19,255
Hey!

227
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,255
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,425
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:25,345
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,025
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:01,125
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:13,595
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:16,145
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:20,505
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:26,805
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:33,325
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,695
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,995
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:45,205
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:50,425
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:54,755
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:06,105
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,025
while you count.

244
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:14,025
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:15,805
One...

246
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:17,195
Two...

247
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:18,875
Three...

248
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:20,795
Four...

249
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,625
Five...

250
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,625
Six...

251
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:34,075
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,975
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:41,095
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:44,425
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:50,005
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:56,025
I'm all right.

257
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,525
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,075
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:02,745
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:04,905
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,905
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:15,705
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:21,675
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,045
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:28,805
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:35,225
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,805
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:43,555
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:46,075
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,325
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:56,825
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:59,325
They can...

273
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,425
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:04,095
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,315 --> 00:23:13,675
This way!

276
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:15,805
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,245
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:20,325
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:22,745
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:24,405
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,075
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:29,445
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,755
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:41,005
River?

285
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:45,255
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:48,005
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:53,025
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:56,025
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:01,525
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,025
Let's go!

291
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:21,125
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,995
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,905
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:26,745
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,255
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:29,055
Boss!

297
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:30,305
Boss!

298
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:34,055
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:38,725
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:42,225
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,915 --> 00:24:48,745
Here he is!

302
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:51,325
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:53,195
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:56,775
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,125
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,455
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,225
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:40,455
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,795 --> 00:25:42,955
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,375
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:07,555
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:13,355
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:15,025
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:19,025
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:21,325
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,525
nor I.

317
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:30,955
Brother...

318
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:36,005
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:42,255
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:47,305
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:51,895
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,775
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:59,105
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:01,475
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:06,955
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,995
Why?

327
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:17,955
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:22,225
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:28,055
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,475
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:37,075
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:40,525
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,195
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:47,445
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,695
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:53,705
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:55,705
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:00,455
You're not like me.

339
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:02,925
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,955
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,595 --> 00:28:10,805
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:13,225
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:14,445
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:16,645
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:18,945
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:27,655
Looking good.

347
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,125
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:34,545
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:39,875
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:45,225
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:51,595
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:02,155
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:04,275
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:06,945
Like this?

355
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,245
That's right.

356
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:12,155
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:15,205
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:18,795
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,705
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,925
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:31,095
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:39,025
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:41,945
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:47,695
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:56,205
There it is!

366
00:29:56,965 --> 00:30:00,705
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:07,045
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:13,845
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:25,925
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,515 --> 00:30:27,655
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:29,195
It's burning up.

372
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:31,495
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:49,045
Found it!

374
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,095
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:55,345
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,605
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:03,395
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,715 --> 00:31:32,325
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:39,175
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,255
Wow!

381
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:55,655
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,075
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,445 --> 00:32:02,855
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:05,325
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:08,275
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:10,295
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,845
Okay!

388
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,175
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:16,875
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,345
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:20,955
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:22,625
No fair!

393
00:32:36,475 --> 00:32:38,055
There.

394
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:41,275
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:51,625
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:55,795
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,405
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,595
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:05,225
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:10,345
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:13,345
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:15,755
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:19,695
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,105
Well...

405
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:23,575
Um...

406
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:24,775
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:26,855
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:29,695
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,245
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,125
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,845 --> 00:33:47,125
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:51,705
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,555
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:59,695
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:03,395
Wake up!

416
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:07,895
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:12,995
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:14,825
You're under attack!

419
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:16,075
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:17,575
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:22,075
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:25,245
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:27,095
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:28,595
Fight!

425
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:32,475
Fight!

426
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:39,005
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:39,015 --> 00:34:41,595
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:45,195
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:46,605
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:48,445
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:54,695
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:57,025
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:57,025 --> 00:34:59,195
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:02,205
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:21,775
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:00,975
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:03,095
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:12,945
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:14,195
Nezuko!

440
00:36:19,075 --> 00:36:20,075
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:21,525
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:23,745
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,355
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,045
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,925
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,095
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:32,295
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,345
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:36,045
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:42,875
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:45,895
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:47,305
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:49,055
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,395 --> 00:36:58,275
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:01,245
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:03,045 --> 00:37:05,295
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:09,825
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:25,095 --> 00:37:26,895
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:27,175 --> 00:37:29,895
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,765 --> 00:37:34,225
Mom?

461
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:37,005
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,695 --> 00:37:39,355
Big Bro...

463
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:49,905
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,955
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:04,755
forever.

466
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,145
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:15,645
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:17,555
Right here.

469
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:20,805
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:23,945
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:30,325
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:36,575
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:41,075
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,595
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,505
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:52,925
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:09,245
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:11,445
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,945 --> 00:39:16,355
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:19,375
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:26,795
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,425
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:34,045
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:39,525
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,395 --> 00:39:43,105
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:48,975
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:52,455
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:54,845
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:58,575
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,545 --> 00:40:00,575
So, please...

491
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,075
forgive me!

492
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:14,755
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,445 --> 00:40:36,495
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:40,995
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,505
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:44,015 --> 00:40:45,295
and...

497
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,295
also warm.

498
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:01,525
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:07,555
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:09,145 --> 00:41:12,805
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:15,395
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:24,155
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:26,825
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,595
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:45,345
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:49,095
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:54,275
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:56,355
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:00,075
What was that?

510
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:14,295
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:18,045
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:25,455
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:27,305
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:30,305
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:36,975
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:43,305
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:45,205
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:49,325
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:51,575
Oh well...

520
00:42:52,165 --> 00:42:56,075
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:01,095
Not here.

522
00:43:01,425 --> 00:43:03,805
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:05,675
What's this, though?

524
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:08,095
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:11,845
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,095
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,145
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,675 --> 00:43:18,605
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,245 --> 00:43:22,855
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:24,775
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,365 --> 00:43:29,745
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:33,245
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:36,625
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:41,045 --> 00:43:42,845
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:47,505
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,975 --> 00:43:59,805
There's something...

537
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:02,195
I must cut.

538
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:05,775
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:07,805
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:10,905
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:14,705
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,465 --> 00:44:18,955
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,495 --> 00:44:20,955
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,955
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:27,595
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:30,555
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,895 --> 00:44:32,175
In other words...

548
00:44:33,515 --> 00:44:34,845
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:40,305
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,745 --> 00:45:00,445
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:07,005
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,545
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,215 --> 00:45:14,625
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,425
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:18,355
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:24,525
Who are these people?

557
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:28,025
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:29,115 --> 00:45:30,705
Rope...

559
00:45:33,065 --> 00:45:34,355
What's this?

560
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,075
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:38,545
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,545
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:45,705
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:50,745
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:53,845
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:56,755
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,265 --> 00:46:02,305
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,255
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,815 --> 00:46:11,195
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,325 --> 00:46:14,995
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:17,355
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:27,345
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,595 --> 00:46:30,595
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:33,095 --> 00:46:35,455
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:37,705
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,595 --> 00:46:42,955
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:44,605
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,895 --> 00:46:46,475
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,895 --> 00:46:52,475
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,365 --> 00:46:54,725
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,725 --> 00:46:58,525
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:03,155
What are you doing?

583
00:47:06,075 --> 00:47:09,155
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,415 --> 00:47:10,955
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:15,045
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,575 --> 00:47:19,225
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,265 --> 00:47:22,595
This man, too?

588
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:27,645
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,505
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,575
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:38,775
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,405
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,245
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:47,905
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,445 --> 00:47:49,905
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:52,925
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,425 --> 00:47:56,005
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,095
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,925 --> 00:48:02,595
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,615 --> 00:48:27,795
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,515 --> 00:48:48,175
I was willing...

602
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:55,395
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,395
But it was warm...

604
00:48:59,995 --> 00:49:03,155
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:08,155
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:25,925
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:27,925
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:32,045 --> 00:49:36,055
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:43,395
No way!

610
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:46,725
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,025
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:57,075
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:01,155
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:04,905
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,915 --> 00:50:08,295
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:13,395
Right!

617
00:50:13,675 --> 00:50:14,805
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,615 --> 00:50:28,605
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:29,855
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:33,855
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:36,855
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:40,495
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,825 --> 00:50:42,355
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:42,995 --> 00:50:44,205
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,265 --> 00:50:46,595
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:48,375
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:53,505
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:55,505
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:56,045 --> 00:50:57,675
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,775
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:09,605
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:13,695
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,725 --> 00:51:16,195
It was him!

634
00:51:17,445 --> 00:51:19,125
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:24,125
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,465 --> 00:51:30,125
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,415 --> 00:51:32,905
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:35,555
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,345
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:44,595
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:55,855
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,415 --> 00:52:02,855
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,465 --> 00:52:10,375
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:19,625
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,425 --> 00:52:23,125
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,465 --> 00:52:28,145
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,775 --> 00:52:31,355
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:37,895
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,945 --> 00:52:41,195
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:45,995
And yet...

651
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:50,045
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,545 --> 00:52:53,905
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,575 --> 00:53:01,345
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:05,975
is so enormous!

655
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:11,175
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,845 --> 00:53:13,845
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:15,645
get away with this!

658
00:53:25,025 --> 00:53:26,855
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:30,405
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:33,105
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:33,115 --> 00:53:37,675
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:41,795
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,795 --> 00:53:46,675
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,295 --> 00:53:50,975
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:53,645
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:56,145
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:02,355
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:09,125
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:13,125
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,915 --> 00:54:23,155
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,895 --> 00:54:29,805
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,395 --> 00:54:38,305
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,395 --> 00:54:43,695
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:53,155
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,445
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:03,505
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,215 --> 00:55:13,425
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,395 --> 00:55:29,195
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:32,055
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,615 --> 00:55:34,825
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,245 --> 00:55:36,745
This brat...

682
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:40,655
is insane!

683
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:54,145
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:58,145 --> 00:56:02,005
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:08,775
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,445 --> 00:56:19,355
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,695 --> 00:56:21,775
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:32,505
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,345 --> 00:56:36,875
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,225 --> 00:56:48,645
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,225 --> 00:56:51,025
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:52,975
insult...

693
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:56,105
my family!

694
00:57:20,925 --> 00:57:22,805
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,225 --> 00:57:26,395
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,815 --> 00:57:30,755
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,845 --> 00:57:33,755
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,365 --> 00:57:39,355
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,525
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:47,025
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:51,355
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,925 --> 00:57:53,125
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,675 --> 00:57:56,295
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:59,705
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:06,455
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:11,055
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,645 --> 00:58:15,525
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:21,555
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:25,055
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:29,075
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,495 --> 00:58:32,575
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,245 --> 00:58:36,455
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:44,595
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,645 --> 00:58:47,145
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,475 --> 00:58:50,345
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:54,475
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:58,395
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:00,855
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,445 --> 00:59:05,405
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,415 --> 00:59:11,605
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,765 --> 00:59:24,925
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,465 --> 00:59:28,625
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:31,345
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:32,095 --> 00:59:35,555
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:36,145 --> 00:59:40,195
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,725 --> 00:59:42,105
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,945
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,575
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,915 --> 00:59:59,905
All right!

730
01:00:00,465 --> 01:00:02,125
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:05,325
Comin' through!

732
01:00:06,045 --> 01:00:09,095
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:09,095 --> 01:00:10,345
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,675 --> 01:00:12,845
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:13,095 --> 01:00:15,095
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,395 --> 01:00:17,845
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,845 --> 01:00:21,095
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:23,015 --> 01:00:26,655
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:30,655
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:35,025 --> 01:00:37,905
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,665 --> 01:00:40,405
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:48,425
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:50,485
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,845 --> 01:00:52,675
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,965 --> 01:00:54,675
Glorify me!

746
01:00:55,015 --> 01:01:00,005
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:02,775
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,315 --> 01:01:06,855
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,965 --> 01:01:34,375
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,395 --> 01:01:38,645
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,505
First Form...

752
01:01:40,765 --> 01:01:41,805
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,345 --> 01:01:46,345
No good.

754
01:01:46,645 --> 01:01:48,675
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,975 --> 01:01:51,005
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,575 --> 01:02:03,025
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,445 --> 01:02:06,855
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,865 --> 01:02:10,955
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,745 --> 01:03:30,325
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:32,445
First Form...

761
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:34,545
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,675 --> 01:03:39,795
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:41,545
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,795
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,675 --> 01:03:48,045
Protect...

766
01:03:54,895 --> 01:03:56,475
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,945 --> 01:03:58,305
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,315 --> 01:04:00,275
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,275 --> 01:04:02,145
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,645 --> 01:04:04,105
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:04,115 --> 01:04:05,395
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:11,075 --> 01:04:14,075
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,795 --> 01:04:16,405
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,415 --> 01:04:18,045
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:21,295
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,745 --> 01:04:22,705
Damn!

777
01:04:23,045 --> 01:04:24,575
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,395
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,765 --> 01:04:37,895
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,515 --> 01:04:40,475
How could this be?

781
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:43,405
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,865 --> 01:04:46,245
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,495 --> 01:04:49,905
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:58,075
What happened?

785
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:05,625
What was that?

786
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:07,255
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,545 --> 01:05:11,045
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,715 --> 01:05:14,045
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:17,775
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,775 --> 01:05:20,395
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,725 --> 01:05:22,975
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,975 --> 01:05:23,895
Okay!

793
01:05:24,275 --> 01:05:26,145
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,475 --> 01:05:28,395
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,775 --> 01:05:32,645
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:34,545
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,545 --> 01:05:38,455
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,795 --> 01:05:39,745
Head?

799
01:05:40,165 --> 01:05:41,205
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:44,995
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,415 --> 01:05:47,405
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,665 --> 01:05:49,545
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,225 --> 01:05:55,595
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,595 --> 01:05:58,975
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:02,475
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,765 --> 01:06:04,725
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,975 --> 01:06:09,825
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:10,075 --> 01:06:13,695
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,325 --> 01:06:17,945
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:24,075
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:27,205
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,595 --> 01:06:29,205
Somehow...

813
01:06:30,095 --> 01:06:31,955
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,295 --> 01:06:34,795
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:35,095 --> 01:06:38,425
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:40,255
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,515 --> 01:06:43,695
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,695 --> 01:06:45,695
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,945 --> 01:06:47,805
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:48,145 --> 01:06:51,225
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,225 --> 01:06:52,725
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,725 --> 01:06:55,555
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:56,115 --> 01:06:59,555
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,565 --> 01:07:01,905
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:04,455
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,465 --> 01:07:05,495
That's right!

827
01:07:05,495 --> 01:07:06,405
Understood!

828
01:07:06,965 --> 01:07:08,545
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:10,045
Forward!

830
01:07:22,095 --> 01:07:23,555
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:28,895
All right!

832
01:07:36,275 --> 01:07:37,355
Inosuke!

833
01:07:37,995 --> 01:07:40,605
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,945 --> 01:07:42,995
Especially around here!

835
01:07:42,995 --> 01:07:44,355
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:46,355
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,865 --> 01:07:48,355
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,695 --> 01:07:49,855
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,245 --> 01:07:51,625
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:57,755
Gross!

841
01:07:58,175 --> 01:08:00,095
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,005
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,595 --> 01:08:05,545
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,515 --> 01:08:11,305
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,645 --> 01:08:12,805
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,815 --> 01:08:22,445
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:24,945
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,945 --> 01:08:25,955
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,795 --> 01:08:29,905
It's here...

850
01:08:31,075 --> 01:08:32,375
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:34,545
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,545 --> 01:08:36,295
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:44,925
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,265 --> 01:08:48,055
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,175
Slice!

856
01:08:57,725 --> 01:08:58,675
It's the bone.

857
01:08:59,095 --> 01:09:00,575
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,365 --> 01:09:04,025
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,325 --> 01:09:05,355
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,865 --> 01:09:11,195
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:28,925
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,205
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,515 --> 01:09:35,895
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,225 --> 01:09:37,975
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:41,805
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,195 --> 01:09:46,555
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:49,275
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,545 --> 01:09:50,805
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,815 --> 01:09:51,955
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,575 --> 01:09:54,875
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,245
DREAM

872
01:10:02,795 --> 01:10:06,995
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,295 --> 01:10:08,505
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,475 --> 01:10:12,175
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:16,555
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,565 --> 01:10:17,925
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,725 --> 01:10:23,755
It's all right!

878
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:26,155
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:27,075 --> 01:10:32,155
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,365 --> 01:10:35,365
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:45,875
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,705
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,715 --> 01:10:50,505
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:53,295
No good!

885
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,625
Wake up!

886
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:56,375
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:57,375
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:58,875
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,265 --> 01:11:00,895
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,615 --> 01:11:02,975
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,945 --> 01:11:06,145
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,865 --> 01:11:14,805
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,195 --> 01:11:17,045
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:19,575
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,915 --> 01:11:27,075
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,415 --> 01:11:30,245
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,545 --> 01:11:33,375
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,715 --> 01:11:38,425
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,725 --> 01:11:42,505
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,975 --> 01:11:47,925
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:51,325
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,365 --> 01:11:59,855
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,865 --> 01:12:01,245
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,495 --> 01:12:05,695
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:08,195
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,595 --> 01:12:13,045
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,505
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:33,695
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:35,855
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:37,725
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:38,065 --> 01:12:39,605
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:15,175 --> 01:13:17,575
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,865 --> 01:13:19,075
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,915 --> 01:13:24,575
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,665 --> 01:13:29,275
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,625
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:36,175 --> 01:13:39,205
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,255
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,515 --> 01:13:43,375
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:47,045
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:12,075 --> 01:14:13,495
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:16,405
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:17,745
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:20,375
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,295 --> 01:14:23,455
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,245 --> 01:14:28,005
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,315 --> 01:14:29,425
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,315 --> 01:14:34,225
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:03,425
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,545 --> 01:15:07,425
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,425 --> 01:15:10,375
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,295
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:14,205
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,465 --> 01:15:16,255
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,615 --> 01:15:17,605
I'm...

936
01:15:17,945 --> 01:15:19,555
all right.

937
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:21,305
What about you?

938
01:15:21,565 --> 01:15:24,725
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:28,305
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,565 --> 01:15:32,225
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:35,655
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,795 --> 01:15:40,295
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,795
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,245
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,245 --> 01:15:49,875
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:53,305
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:56,005
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:56,015 --> 01:15:57,475
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,895 --> 01:16:01,595
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:02,095 --> 01:16:04,055
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:07,305
Please.

952
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:16,245
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,245 --> 01:16:17,905
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:20,155
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:24,575
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,325 --> 01:16:28,505
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,965 --> 01:16:35,095
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,505
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,755
We have to...

960
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:42,775
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:44,895
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:05,625
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,965 --> 01:17:07,745
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,715 --> 01:17:11,825
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:12,165 --> 01:17:13,005
Me?

966
01:17:13,665 --> 01:17:14,625
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:18,645
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:19,095 --> 01:17:22,145
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:22,145 --> 01:17:27,645
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,895 --> 01:17:30,645
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,895 --> 01:17:34,195
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,745 --> 01:17:36,155
It was him!

973
01:17:36,415 --> 01:17:38,275
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,665 --> 01:17:44,105
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:44,115 --> 01:17:45,575
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,405
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,825 --> 01:17:51,755
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,205
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,215 --> 01:17:59,755
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,765 --> 01:18:02,125
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:05,425
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:09,445
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:11,225
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:15,975
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,315 --> 01:18:18,725
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,725 --> 01:18:22,555
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,475
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:29,325
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,325 --> 01:18:33,545
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:35,745
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:38,825
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:39,165 --> 01:18:41,125
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,745 --> 01:18:46,505
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:52,505
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,925 --> 01:18:54,175
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:54,175 --> 01:18:57,895
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,895 --> 01:19:02,855
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,195 --> 01:19:05,855
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,615 --> 01:19:11,745
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,745 --> 01:19:16,925
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,925 --> 01:19:22,595
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:32,425
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,765 --> 01:19:34,395
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,525 --> 01:19:37,055
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,645 --> 01:19:40,525
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:43,895
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:45,145 --> 01:19:46,555
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,615 --> 01:19:49,445
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:50,025 --> 01:19:53,245
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,575 --> 01:19:56,745
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,465 --> 01:19:58,745
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:59,165 --> 01:20:00,795
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,745 --> 01:20:06,125
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,525 --> 01:20:27,855
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:39,855
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:40,115 --> 01:20:43,795
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,455
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:53,625
Right.

1019
01:20:55,515 --> 01:20:56,775
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:57,115 --> 01:20:59,975
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:01,025 --> 01:21:04,805
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,225 --> 01:21:10,725
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,345 --> 01:21:43,005
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,725 --> 01:21:45,725
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,695 --> 01:22:00,655
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,765 --> 01:22:16,425
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:20,205
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,595 --> 01:22:22,925
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,345 --> 01:22:24,675
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:29,225
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,315 --> 01:22:34,555
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,865 --> 01:22:37,145
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,475 --> 01:22:41,555
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,865 --> 01:22:45,955
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,905
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,495
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,965 --> 01:22:57,745
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,075 --> 01:23:00,595
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,925 --> 01:23:02,095
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,765 --> 01:23:05,925
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,925 --> 01:23:07,555
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,845 --> 01:23:10,345
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:13,005
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,395 --> 01:23:17,195
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,745 --> 01:23:19,655
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:20,995
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,445 --> 01:23:26,155
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,495 --> 01:23:27,995
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:31,275
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:32,995 --> 01:23:35,425
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,265 --> 01:23:40,845
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,845 --> 01:23:42,425
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:44,015 --> 01:23:48,925
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,265 --> 01:23:51,195
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,225 --> 01:23:58,645
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,945 --> 01:24:02,195
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,195 --> 01:24:05,695
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:11,795
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:17,955
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,415 --> 01:24:21,075
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,125
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:26,395
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,065 --> 01:24:30,975
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,815 --> 01:24:37,475
I see.

1065
01:24:39,425 --> 01:24:41,255
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,075 --> 01:24:45,325
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,895 --> 01:25:19,555
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,565 --> 01:25:23,475
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,195 --> 01:25:27,225
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:33,555
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,565 --> 01:25:37,875
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,465 --> 01:25:41,795
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,915 --> 01:25:51,175
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,175 --> 01:25:53,505
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,255
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,515 --> 01:25:58,345
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:01,015 --> 01:26:02,255
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,515 --> 01:26:04,845
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,165 --> 01:26:19,105
I see.

1080
01:26:21,445 --> 01:26:23,155
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,365 --> 01:26:24,655
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,665 --> 01:26:26,755
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,965 --> 01:26:32,095
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,345 --> 01:26:37,625
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:48,525
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,525 --> 01:26:49,775
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,195 --> 01:26:56,475
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,565 --> 01:27:00,125
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,965 --> 01:27:06,075
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:07,655
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,665 --> 01:27:09,155
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,415 --> 01:27:10,575
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:13,045
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:16,045
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,345
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,765 --> 01:27:19,925
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:23,305
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,725 --> 01:27:25,175
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,515 --> 01:27:30,175
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:43,945
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,115 --> 01:27:51,425
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,425 --> 01:27:52,795
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,345 --> 01:27:59,045
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,845 --> 01:28:07,175
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,065 --> 01:28:13,525
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,445 --> 01:28:16,775
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,115 --> 01:28:20,475
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:26,245
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,575 --> 01:28:33,155
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,165 --> 01:28:38,075
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:41,125
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:42,225
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,175
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,515 --> 01:28:53,675
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:54,015 --> 01:28:56,555
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,565 --> 01:28:59,325
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,575 --> 01:29:03,695
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:04,025 --> 01:29:05,695
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,945 --> 01:29:09,605
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,445 --> 01:29:14,075
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:20,125
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,465 --> 01:29:25,795
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,275 --> 01:29:36,855
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,115 --> 01:29:38,145
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,615 --> 01:29:42,775
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:45,475
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,465 --> 01:29:52,455
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,175
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,425 --> 01:30:16,895
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,315 --> 01:30:19,395
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,645 --> 01:30:21,725
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,925 --> 01:30:25,855
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,115 --> 01:30:28,445
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,165 --> 01:30:30,155
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,665 --> 01:30:35,245
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,115 --> 01:30:40,855
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,545 --> 01:30:59,975
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,715 --> 01:31:30,045
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,595 --> 01:31:38,095
No way!

1140
01:31:45,645 --> 01:31:48,095
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,895 --> 01:31:51,275
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,595 --> 01:32:11,045
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,425 --> 01:32:14,955
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,845 --> 01:32:26,195
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,315 --> 01:32:33,645
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,895 --> 01:32:35,975
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,975 --> 01:32:40,945
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,945 --> 01:32:43,155
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,465 --> 01:32:46,295
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:50,045
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,295 --> 01:32:54,245
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,665 --> 01:32:58,745
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,925
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,265 --> 01:33:06,345
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,345 --> 01:33:09,395
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,915 --> 01:33:25,105
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,525 --> 01:33:32,105
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,365 --> 01:33:35,755
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:40,595
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,845 --> 01:33:42,005
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,795 --> 01:33:52,195
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,195 --> 01:33:55,105
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,115 --> 01:33:57,105
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,365 --> 01:34:00,105
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,475 --> 01:34:06,105
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,365 --> 01:34:09,375
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,715 --> 01:34:11,205
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,215 --> 01:34:13,955
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,915 --> 01:34:21,125
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:23,575
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:25,095
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,395 --> 01:34:26,725
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,775 --> 01:34:45,105
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,365 --> 01:35:19,525
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,775 --> 01:35:26,275
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,725 --> 01:35:29,945
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,195 --> 01:35:31,025
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,365 --> 01:35:32,395
goku...

1179
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:48,375
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,375
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:51,645
You are...

1182
01:35:52,015 --> 01:35:55,005
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:07,995 --> 01:36:09,155
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,165 --> 01:36:10,905
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,945 --> 01:36:13,945
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,275 --> 01:36:16,575
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,275 --> 01:36:22,525
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,515 --> 01:36:27,795
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,545 --> 01:36:31,295
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,765 --> 01:36:37,875
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:43,805
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,695 --> 01:36:52,555
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,645 --> 01:36:58,775
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,495 --> 01:37:03,795
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:08,295
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,295 --> 01:37:09,825
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,425 --> 01:37:30,395
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,415 --> 01:37:36,105
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,115 --> 01:37:39,945
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,095 --> 01:37:54,255
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,595 --> 01:37:59,675
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,695 --> 01:38:08,805
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,225 --> 01:38:11,605
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,615 --> 01:38:14,805
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:17,945
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:19,775
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,445 --> 01:38:23,105
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,395 --> 01:38:25,405
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,415 --> 01:38:26,705
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,045 --> 01:38:31,155
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,045 --> 01:38:41,245
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,815 --> 01:38:43,975
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,315 --> 01:38:45,675
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,515 --> 01:38:49,645
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,975 --> 01:38:51,175
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,975 --> 01:38:58,475
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,815 --> 01:39:01,995
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,495 --> 01:39:16,505
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,175 --> 01:39:28,095
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,795 --> 01:39:31,755
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:37,855
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,315 --> 01:39:39,895
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,295 --> 01:40:01,405
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,595 --> 01:40:13,175
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,425 --> 01:40:24,055
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:26,495
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,495 --> 01:40:28,605
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,945 --> 01:40:34,245
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,245 --> 01:40:36,855
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,865 --> 01:40:39,525
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:45,375
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,675 --> 01:40:49,045
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,595 --> 01:40:53,295
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,675 --> 01:40:57,855
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,865 --> 01:40:59,975
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,275 --> 01:41:02,395
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,645 --> 01:41:05,225
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,225 --> 01:41:08,055
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,525 --> 01:41:09,745
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:11,805
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,065 --> 01:41:16,405
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,415 --> 01:41:18,125
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,375 --> 01:41:20,045
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,295 --> 01:41:22,325
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,325 --> 01:41:25,955
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,965 --> 01:41:28,075
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,075 --> 01:41:31,905
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,575 --> 01:42:08,845
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:16,505
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,175 --> 01:42:19,205
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,425 --> 01:42:22,595
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,045 --> 01:42:25,225
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,195 --> 01:42:28,695
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,975 --> 01:42:31,395
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,815 --> 01:42:34,225
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,245 --> 01:42:54,245
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,795 --> 01:42:58,125
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,265 --> 01:43:00,975
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,595 --> 01:43:04,225
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,175 --> 01:43:08,675
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:12,645
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,515 --> 01:43:17,105
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,075 --> 01:43:27,075
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,495 --> 01:43:32,075
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,075 --> 01:43:34,455
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,465 --> 01:43:36,755
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,715 --> 01:43:41,375
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,345 --> 01:43:47,045
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,875 --> 01:43:51,055
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,815 --> 01:43:53,725
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,275 --> 01:43:58,475
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,145 --> 01:44:02,475
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,365 --> 01:44:06,025
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,165 --> 01:44:09,295
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,465 --> 01:44:11,575
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,575
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,545 --> 01:44:20,125
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,495 --> 01:44:27,805
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,815 --> 01:44:32,595
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,975 --> 01:44:36,725
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,565 --> 01:44:39,805
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,825 --> 01:44:50,325
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,745 --> 01:44:53,405
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,495 --> 01:44:58,825
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:03,375
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:06,345
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,345 --> 01:45:10,295
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,925 --> 01:45:14,595
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,215 --> 01:45:16,645
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,975 --> 01:45:19,855
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,395 --> 01:45:24,395
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,225 --> 01:45:27,355
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,665 --> 01:45:29,975
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,645 --> 01:45:33,245
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:35,545
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,165 --> 01:45:39,155
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,965 --> 01:45:41,325
And then,

1298
01:45:41,965 --> 01:45:45,325
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,825 --> 01:45:48,155
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,295 --> 01:45:51,725
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,525 --> 01:46:18,945
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,575 --> 01:46:25,795
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,095 --> 01:46:31,595
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,215 --> 01:46:34,005
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,395 --> 01:46:45,805
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,225 --> 01:47:24,475
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,895 --> 01:47:27,555
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:32,475
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,415 --> 01:47:36,025
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,525 --> 01:47:39,825
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,445 --> 01:47:43,105
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,415 --> 01:47:44,325
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,165 --> 01:47:47,495
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,165 --> 01:47:51,175
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,595 --> 01:47:52,755
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,175 --> 01:47:57,345
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,675 --> 01:48:01,425
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:06,875
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,445 --> 01:48:13,355
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,225 --> 01:48:16,855
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:21,805
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,725 --> 01:48:24,125
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,915 --> 01:48:31,155
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,415 --> 01:48:43,925
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,675 --> 01:48:49,925
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,925 --> 01:48:55,175
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,175 --> 01:48:58,945
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,245 --> 01:49:02,445
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,745 --> 01:49:05,195
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,545 --> 01:49:08,825
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,825 --> 01:49:11,195
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,445 --> 01:49:13,075
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,665 --> 01:49:16,845
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,715 --> 01:49:19,845
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,375 --> 01:49:33,105
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,145 --> 01:50:18,805
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,175 --> 01:50:21,145
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,125 --> 01:50:45,795
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,965 --> 01:50:52,795
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,775 --> 01:51:01,895
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,275 --> 01:51:12,895
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,715 --> 01:51:21,995
I see.

1343
01:51:31,515 --> 01:51:36,355
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:37,015 --> 01:51:39,345
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,725 --> 01:51:41,555
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,975 --> 01:51:44,895
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,315 --> 01:51:48,225
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:51,025 --> 01:51:54,405
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,825 --> 01:51:57,605
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,465 --> 01:52:18,705
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,645 --> 01:52:33,105
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,115 --> 01:52:39,275
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,315 --> 01:52:45,655
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,665 --> 01:52:50,875
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,875 --> 01:52:56,815
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,815 --> 01:53:03,925
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:11,015 --> 01:53:16,745
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,745 --> 01:53:23,665
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,665 --> 01:53:29,555
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,555 --> 01:53:37,045
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,045 --> 01:53:42,625
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,625 --> 01:53:51,225
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,475 --> 01:54:07,475
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,845 --> 01:54:14,215
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,215 --> 01:54:20,465
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,465 --> 01:54:25,645
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,645 --> 01:54:31,595
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,595 --> 01:54:38,645
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,345 --> 01:54:45,745
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,745 --> 01:54:52,325
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,715 --> 01:55:10,625
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,965 --> 01:55:31,245
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,965 --> 01:55:48,675
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,675 --> 01:55:54,645
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,645 --> 01:56:02,145
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,145 --> 01:56:07,295
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,415 --> 01:56:13,995
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,725 --> 01:56:19,875
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:31,745
Until I reach that distant future
