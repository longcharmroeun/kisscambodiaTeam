1
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,270
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,060
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,970
Minoru...

4
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,190
Masao...

5
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,060
Susumu...

6
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,360
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,470
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,610
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,490
Isao...

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,660
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,410
Yukio...

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,120
Takahiro...

13
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,060
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,640
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,920
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,940
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,320
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:57,370
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,040
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,870
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,360
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,920
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,040
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,760
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,540
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,720
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,360
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,560
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,610
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,060
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,390
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,490
So fast!

34
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,490
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,310
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,510
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,420
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,310
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,760
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,570
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,110
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,860
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,490
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,770
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,870
Sure,

46
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,920
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,170
Hey!

48
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,590
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,340
Delicious!

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:30,370
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,990
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,660
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,670
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,670
Delicious!

55
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,260
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,760
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,340
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,760
Delicious!

59
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,020
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,270
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,520
Delicious!

62
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,820
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,040
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,910
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,520
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,990
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,290
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,120
Delicious!

69
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,760
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,590
Delicious!

71
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,840
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,610
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,690
Yes.

74
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,470
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,360
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,390
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,610
Yes.

78
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,710
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,370
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,790
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,040
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,810
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,470
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,140
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,970
A mission?

86
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,410
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,990
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,610
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,740
Right.

90
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,770
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,960
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,920
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,620
About my father...

94
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,670
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,370
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,710
Was he really?

97
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,190
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,890
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,190
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,610
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,610
What's up?

102
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,720
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,270
Dance!

104
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,140
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,070
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,460
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,910
Right!

108
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,320
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,560
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,170
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,560
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,640
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,470
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,160
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,110
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,690
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,320
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,770
Flame.

119
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,070
Water.

120
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,360
Wind.

121
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,670
Stone.

122
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,790
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,420
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,670
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,540
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,670
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,810
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,310
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,360
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,360
For real?

131
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,010
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,370
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,320
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,120
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,620
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,070
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,970
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,420
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,890
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,590
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,490
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,410
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,160
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,660
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,420
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,590
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,260
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,010
Nooo!

149
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,290
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,860
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,770
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,860
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,960
May I...

155
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,540
see your...

156
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,410
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,820
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,260
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,640
Here.

160
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,120
What is this?

161
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,540
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,790
Thank you...

163
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,960
very much.

164
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,560
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,690
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,190
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,040
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,510
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,970
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,920
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,160
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,160
First Form...

173
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,790
Amazing.

174
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,290
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,290
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,970
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,270
All right!

178
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,220
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,710
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,640
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,560
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,060
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,140
All right!

184
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,470
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,510
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,070
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,540
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,960
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,960
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,060
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,060
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,240
Tha...

193
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,240
Tha...

194
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,170
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,010
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,810
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,810
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,340
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,260
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,760
Bro!

201
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,820
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,690
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,060
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,990
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,460
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,120
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,410
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,320
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,810
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,010
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,310
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,490
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,490
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,160
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:37,290
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,760
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,260
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,170
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,690
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,860
Okay.

222
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,910
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,540
Calm down.

224
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,420
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,870
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,270
Hey!

227
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,270
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,440
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,360
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,040
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,140
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,610
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,160
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,520
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,820
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,340
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,710
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,010
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:45,220
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,440
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,770
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,120
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,040
while you count.

244
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,040
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,820
One...

246
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,210
Two...

247
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,890
Three...

248
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,810
Four...

249
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Five...

250
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,640
Six...

251
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,090
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,990
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,110
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,440
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,020
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,040
I'm all right.

257
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,540
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,090
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,760
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,920
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,920
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,720
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,690
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,060
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,820
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,240
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,820
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,570
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,090
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,340
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,340
They can...

273
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,440
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,110
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,690
This way!

276
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,820
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,260
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,340
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,760
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,420
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,090
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,460
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,770
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,020
River?

285
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,270
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,020
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,040
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,040
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,540
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,040
Let's go!

291
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,140
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,010
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,920
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,760
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,270
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,070
Boss!

297
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,320
Boss!

298
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,070
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,740
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,240
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,760
Here he is!

302
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,340
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,210
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,790
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,140
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,470
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,240
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,470
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,970
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,390
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,570
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,370
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,040
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,040
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,340
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,540
nor I.

317
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,970
Brother...

318
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,020
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:42,270
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,320
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,910
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,790
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,120
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,490
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,970
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,010
Why?

327
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,970
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,240
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,070
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,490
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,090
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,540
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,210
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,460
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,710
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,720
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,720
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,470
You're not like me.

339
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,940
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,970
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,820
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,460
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,660
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,960
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,670
Looking good.

347
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,140
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,560
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,890
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,240
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:51,610
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,170
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,290
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,960
Like this?

355
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
That's right.

356
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,170
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,220
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,810
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,720
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,940
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,110
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:39,040
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,960
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,710
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,220
There it is!

366
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,720
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,060
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,860
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,940
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,670
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,210
It's burning up.

372
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,510
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,060
Found it!

374
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,110
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,360
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,620
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,410
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:32,340
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,190
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,270
Wow!

381
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,670
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,090
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,870
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,340
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,290
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,310
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,860
Okay!

388
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,190
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,890
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,360
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,970
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,640
No fair!

393
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,070
There.

394
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,290
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,640
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,810
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,420
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,610
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,240
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,360
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,360
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,770
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,710
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,120
Well...

405
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,590
Um...

406
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,790
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,870
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,710
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,260
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,140
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,140
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,720
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,570
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,710
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,410
Wake up!

416
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,910
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,010
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,840
You're under attack!

419
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,090
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,590
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,090
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,260
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,110
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,610
Fight!

425
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,490
Fight!

426
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,020
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,610
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,210
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,620
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,460
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,710
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,040
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,210
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,220
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,790
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,990
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,110
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,960
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,210
Nezuko!

440
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,090
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,540
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,760
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,370
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,060
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,940
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,110
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,310
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,360
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,060
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,890
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,910
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,320
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,070
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,290
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,260
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,310
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,840
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,910
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,910
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,240
Mom?

461
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,020
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,370
Big Bro...

463
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,920
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,970
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,770
forever.

466
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,160
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,660
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,570
Right here.

469
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,820
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,960
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:30,340
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,590
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,090
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,610
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,520
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,940
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,260
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,460
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,370
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,390
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,810
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,440
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,060
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,540
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,120
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,990
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,470
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,860
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,590
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,590
So, please...

491
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,090
forgive me!

492
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,770
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,510
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,010
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,520
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,310
and...

497
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,310
also warm.

498
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,540
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:07,570
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,820
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,410
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,170
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,840
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,610
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,360
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,110
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:54,290
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,370
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,090
What was that?

510
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,310
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,060
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,470
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,320
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,320
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,990
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,320
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,220
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,340
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,590
Oh well...

520
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,090
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,110
Not here.

522
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,820
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,690
What's this, though?

524
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,110
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,860
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,110
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,160
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,620
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,870
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,790
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,760
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,260
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,640
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,860
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,520
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,820
There's something...

537
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,210
I must cut.

538
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,790
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,820
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,920
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,720
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,970
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,970
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,970
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,610
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,570
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,190
In other words...

548
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,860
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,320
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,460
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,020
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,560
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,640
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,440
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,370
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,540
Who are these people?

557
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,040
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,720
Rope...

559
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,370
What's this?

560
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,090
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,560
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,560
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,720
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,760
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,860
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,770
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,320
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,270
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:11,210
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,010
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,370
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,360
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,610
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,470
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,720
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,970
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,620
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,490
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,490
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,740
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,540
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,170
What are you doing?

583
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,170
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,970
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,060
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:19,240
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,610
This man, too?

588
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,660
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,520
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:34,590
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,790
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,420
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,260
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,920
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,920
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,940
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,020
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,110
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,610
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,810
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,190
I was willing...

602
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:55,410
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:59,410
But it was warm...

604
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,170
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,170
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,940
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,940
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,070
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,410
No way!

610
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,740
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,040
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,090
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,170
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,920
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,310
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,410
Right!

617
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:14,820
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,620
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,870
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,870
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,870
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,510
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,370
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,220
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,610
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,390
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,520
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,520
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,690
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,790
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,620
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,710
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,210
It was him!

634
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,140
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,140
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,140
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:32,920
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,570
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,360
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,610
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,870
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:02,870
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,390
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:19,640
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,140
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,160
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,370
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:37,910
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,210
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,010
And yet...

651
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,060
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,920
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,590 --> 00:53:01,360
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,990
is so enormous!

655
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:11,190
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,860
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,660
get away with this!

658
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,870
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,420
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,120
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:37,690
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,810
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:46,690
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,990
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,660
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,160
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,370
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,140
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,140
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,170
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:29,820
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,320
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,710
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:53,170
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,460
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,520
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,440
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:29,210
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,070
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,840
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,760
This brat...

682
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,670
is insane!

683
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,160
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,020
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,790
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,370
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,790
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,520
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,890
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,660
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,040
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,990
insult...

693
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,120
my family!

694
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,820
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,410
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,770
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,770
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,370
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,540
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,040
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:51,370
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,140
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,310
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,720
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:06,470
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:11,070
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:15,540
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,570
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,070
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:29,090
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,590
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,470
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:44,610
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,160
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,360
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,490
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:58,410
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,870
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,420
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:11,620
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,940
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,640
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,360
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,570
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,210
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,120
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,960
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,590
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,930 --> 00:59:59,920
All right!

730
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,140
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,340
Comin' through!

732
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,110
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,360
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,860
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,110
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,860
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:21,110
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:26,670
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,670
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,920
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,420
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:48,440
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,500
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,690
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,690
Glorify me!

746
01:00:55,030 --> 01:01:00,020
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,790
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:06,870
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,390
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:38,660
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,520
First Form...

752
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,820
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,360
No good.

754
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,690
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,020
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:03,040
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,870
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,970
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,340
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,460
First Form...

761
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,560
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,810
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:41,560
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,810
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,060
Protect...

766
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:56,490
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,320
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:00,290
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:02,160
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,120
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,410
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:14,090
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,420
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,060
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:21,310
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,720
Damn!

777
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,590
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:27,410
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:37,910
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:40,490
How could this be?

781
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:43,420
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,260
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,920
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,090
What happened?

785
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,640
What was that?

786
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,270
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,060
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:14,060
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,790
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:20,410
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,990
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:23,910
Okay!

793
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,160
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,410
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:32,660
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:34,560
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,470
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:39,760
Head?

799
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,220
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:45,010
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:47,420
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,560
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,610
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,990
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:02,490
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,740
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:09,840
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:13,710
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,960
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,090
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,220
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,220
Somehow...

813
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,970
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,810
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:38,440
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,270
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:43,710
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:45,710
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,820
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,240
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,740
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:55,570
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:59,570
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,920
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,470
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,510
That's right!

827
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:06,420
Understood!

828
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,560
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,060
Forward!

830
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,570
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:28,910
All right!

832
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,370
Inosuke!

833
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:40,620
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,010
Especially around here!

835
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:44,370
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:46,370
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,370
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:49,870
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,640
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:57,770
Gross!

841
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,110
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:04,020
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,560
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:11,320
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:12,820
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,460
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,960
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,970
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,920
It's here...

850
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,390
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,560
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,310
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:44,940
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,070
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,190
Slice!

856
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,690
It's the bone.

857
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,590
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,040
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,370
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,210
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:28,940
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,220
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:35,910
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,990
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:41,820
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:46,570
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:49,290
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,820
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:51,970
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:54,890
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,260
DREAM

872
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:07,010
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,520
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:12,190
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:16,570
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,940
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:23,770
It's all right!

878
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,170
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:32,170
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,380
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:45,890
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,720
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:50,520
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:53,310
No good!

885
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,640
Wake up!

886
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:56,390
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,390
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:58,890
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,910
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:02,990
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,160
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,820
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:17,060
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,590
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:27,090
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:30,260
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,390
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:38,440
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:42,520
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:47,940
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,340
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,870
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,260
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:05,710
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,210
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:13,060
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,520
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:33,710
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:35,870
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,740
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,620
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,590
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,090
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,590
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,290
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:35,640
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:39,220
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:41,270
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:43,390
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,060
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,510
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:16,420
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:17,760
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,390
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:23,470
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:28,020
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,440
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:34,240
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:03,440
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,440
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,390
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:12,310
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,220
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,270
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:17,620
I'm...

936
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,570
all right.

937
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,320
What about you?

938
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,740
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,320
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:32,240
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:35,670
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:40,310
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,810
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:47,260
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,890
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:53,320
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:56,020
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,490
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,910 --> 01:16:01,610
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:04,070
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,320
Please.

952
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,260
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,920
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,170
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:24,590
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:28,520
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:35,110
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,520
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,770
We have to...

960
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,790
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:44,910
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,640
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,760
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:11,840
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:13,020
Me?

966
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,640
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:18,660
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:22,160
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:27,660
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,660
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:34,210
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,170
It was him!

973
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:38,290
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:44,120
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,590
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:48,420
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,770
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:55,220
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:59,770
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,140
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,440
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:09,460
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,240
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,990
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:18,740
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:22,570
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,490
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,340
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:33,560
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,760
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:38,840
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:41,140
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,520
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:52,520
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:54,190
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:57,910
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:02,870
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:05,870
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:11,760
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,940
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:22,610
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,440
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,410
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,070
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:40,540
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:43,910
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,570
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:49,460
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,260
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:56,760
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,760
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,810
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,140
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:27,870
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,870
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:43,810
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,470
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,640
Right.

1019
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:56,790
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:59,990
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,820
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,740
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:43,020
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:45,740
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,670
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:16,440
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,220
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:22,940
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,690
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,240
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:34,570
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,160
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:41,570
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,970
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:48,920
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:53,510
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:57,760
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:00,610
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,110
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,940
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,570
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:10,360
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:13,020
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:17,210
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,670
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,010
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:26,170
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,010
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:31,290
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:35,440
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:40,860
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,440
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:48,940
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,210
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:58,660
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,210
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:05,710
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:11,810
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,970
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,090
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,140
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:26,410
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,990
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,490
I see.

1065
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,270
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:45,340
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:19,570
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:23,490
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:27,240
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:33,570
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:37,890
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,810
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:51,190
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:53,520
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:56,270
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:58,360
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,270
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,860
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,120
I see.

1080
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:23,170
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,670
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,770
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:32,110
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,640
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:48,540
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,790
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,490
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:00,140
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:06,090
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,670
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,170
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:10,590
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:13,060
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,060
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:18,360
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,940
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,320
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,190
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:30,190
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:43,960
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:51,440
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,810
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,060
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:07,190
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,540
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:16,790
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:20,490
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,260
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:33,170
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,090
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:41,140
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:42,240
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,190
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:53,690
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:56,570
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:59,340
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:03,710
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,710
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:09,620
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,090
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,140
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:25,810
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:36,870
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,160
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:42,790
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,490
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,470
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:15,190
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,910
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,410
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:21,740
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,870
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,460
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:30,170
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,260
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:40,870
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,990
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,060
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,110
No way!

1140
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:48,110
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:51,290
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,060
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,970
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:26,210
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:33,660
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,990
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:40,960
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,170
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,310
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,060
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:54,260
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,760
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:03,940
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,360
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:09,410
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,120
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:32,120
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:35,770
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:40,610
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:42,020
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,210
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:55,120
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,120
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,120
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:06,120
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:09,390
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:11,220
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,970
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:21,140
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:23,590
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,110
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,740
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:45,120
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,540
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:26,290
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:29,960
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:31,040
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:32,410
goku...

1179
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,390
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:50,390
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:51,660
You are...

1182
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:55,020
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:09,170
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,920
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,960
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:16,590
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:22,540
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,810
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,310
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:37,890
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:43,820
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:52,570
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:58,790
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:03,810
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:08,310
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:09,840
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:30,410
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:36,120
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:39,960
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:54,270
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:59,690
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:08,820
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,620
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:14,820
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:17,960
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,790
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:23,120
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:25,420
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:26,720
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:31,170
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:41,260
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:43,990
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:45,690
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:49,660
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,190
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,990 --> 01:38:58,490
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:02,010
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:16,520
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:28,110
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:31,770
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,870
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:39,910
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,310 --> 01:40:01,420
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,190
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,070
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,510
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:28,620
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,260
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:36,870
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,540
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:45,390
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:49,060
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:53,310
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:57,870
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,990
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:02,410
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:05,240
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,070
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:09,760
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,820
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,420
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:18,140
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:20,060
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:22,340
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:25,970
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:28,090
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:31,920
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:08,860
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,520
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:19,220
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:22,610
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:25,240
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:28,710
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,410
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:34,240
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,260
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:58,140
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,990
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,610 --> 01:43:04,240
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:08,690
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:12,660
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:17,120
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:27,090
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:32,090
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:34,470
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,770
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,730 --> 01:43:41,390
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,060
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:51,070
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:53,740
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:58,490
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,490
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,040
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,310
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,590
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:16,590
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:20,140
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,510 --> 01:44:27,820
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:32,610
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:36,740
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,820
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:50,340
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,420
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:58,840
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:03,390
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:06,360
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:10,310
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:14,610
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:16,660
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:19,870
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:24,410
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,370
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,990
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:33,260
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:35,560
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:39,170
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,340
And then,

1298
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:45,340
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,170
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:51,740
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:18,960
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:25,810
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:31,610
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:34,020
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:45,820
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,490
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,910 --> 01:47:27,570
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:32,490
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,430 --> 01:47:36,040
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,840
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:43,120
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:44,340
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:47,510
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:51,190
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:52,770
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,190 --> 01:47:57,360
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,690 --> 01:48:01,440
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:06,890
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:13,370
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:16,870
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:21,820
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:24,140
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:31,170
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:43,940
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:49,940
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:55,190
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:58,960
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:02,460
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,210
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:08,840
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:11,210
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:13,090
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:16,860
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:19,860
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:33,120
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:18,820
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,190 --> 01:50:21,160
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:45,810
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,810
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:01,910
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:12,910
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:22,010
I see.

1343
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:36,370
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:39,360
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:41,570
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:44,910
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,330 --> 01:51:48,240
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,420
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,620
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,720
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:33,120
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:39,290
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:45,670
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:50,890
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:56,830
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,830 --> 01:53:03,940
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:16,760
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:23,680
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:29,570
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:37,060
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:42,640
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:51,240
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:07,490
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:14,230
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:20,480
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:25,660
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:31,610
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:38,660
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:45,760
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:52,340
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:10,640
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:31,260
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:48,690
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:54,660
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,660 --> 01:56:02,160
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:07,310
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:14,010
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:19,890
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:31,760
Until I reach that distant future
