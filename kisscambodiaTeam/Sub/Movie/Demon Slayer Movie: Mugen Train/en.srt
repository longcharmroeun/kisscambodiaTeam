1
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,210
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,000
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,910
Minoru...

4
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,130
Masao...

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,000
Susumu...

6
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,300
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,410
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,550
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,430
Isao...

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,600
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,350
Yukio...

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,060
Takahiro...

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,580
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,860
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,880
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,260
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,310
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,980
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,810
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,300
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,860
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,980
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,700
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,480
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,660
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,300
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,500
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,550
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,330
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,430
So fast!

34
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,430
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,250
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,450
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,360
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,250
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,700
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,510
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,050
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,800
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,430
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,710
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,810
Sure,

46
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,860
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,110
Hey!

48
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,530
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,280
Delicious!

50
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:30,310
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,930
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,600
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,610
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,610
Delicious!

55
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,200
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,700
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,280
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,700
Delicious!

59
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,960
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,210
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,460
Delicious!

62
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,760
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,980
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,850
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,460
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,930
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,230
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,060
Delicious!

69
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,700
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,530
Delicious!

71
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,780
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,550
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,630
Yes.

74
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,410
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,300
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,330
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,550
Yes.

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,650
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,310
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,730
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,980
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,750
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,410
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,080
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,910
A mission?

86
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,350
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,930
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,550
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,680
Right.

90
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,710
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,900
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,860
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,560
About my father...

94
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,610
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,310
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,650
Was he really?

97
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,130
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,830
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,130
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,550
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,550
What's up?

102
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,660
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,210
Dance!

104
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,080
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,010
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,850
Right!

108
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,260
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,500
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,110
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,500
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,580
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,410
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,100
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,050
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,630
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,260
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,710
Flame.

119
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,010
Water.

120
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,300
Wind.

121
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,610
Stone.

122
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,730
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,360
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,610
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,480
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,610
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,750
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,250
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,300
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,300
For real?

131
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,950
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,310
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,260
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,060
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,560
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,010
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,910
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,360
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,830
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,530
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,430
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,350
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,100
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,530
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:34,200
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,950
Nooo!

149
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,230
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,800
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,710
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,800
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,900
May I...

155
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,480
see your...

156
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,350
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,760
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,200
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,580
Here.

160
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,060
What is this?

161
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,480
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,730
Thank you...

163
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,900
very much.

164
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,500
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,630
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,130
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,980
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,450
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,910
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,860
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,100
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,100
First Form...

173
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,730
Amazing.

174
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,230
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,230
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,910
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,210
All right!

178
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,160
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,650
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,580
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,500
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,000
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
All right!

184
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,410
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,450
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,010
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,480
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,900
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,900
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,000
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,180
Tha...

193
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,180
Tha...

194
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,110
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,950
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,750
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,200
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,700
Bro!

201
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,760
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,630
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,000
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,930
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,400
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,060
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,350
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,260
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,750
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,580
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,950
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,250
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,430
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,430
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,100
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:37,230
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,700
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,200
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,110
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,630
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,800
Okay.

222
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,850
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
Calm down.

224
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,360
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,810
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,210
Hey!

227
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,210
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,380
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,300
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,980
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,550
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,100
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,460
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,760
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,280
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,650
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,950
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,160
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,380
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,710
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,060
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,980
while you count.

244
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,980
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,760
One...

246
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,150
Two...

247
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,830
Three...

248
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,750
Four...

249
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,580
Five...

250
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,580
Six...

251
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,030
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,930
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,050
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,380
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,960
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,980
I'm all right.

257
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,480
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,030
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,700
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,860
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,860
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,660
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,630
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,000
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,760
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,180
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,760
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,510
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,030
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,280
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,780
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,280
They can...

273
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,380
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,050
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,630
This way!

276
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,760
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,200
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,280
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,700
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,360
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,030
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,400
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,710
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,960
River?

285
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,210
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,960
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,980
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,980
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,480
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,980
Let's go!

291
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,080
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,950
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,860
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,700
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,210
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,010
Boss!

297
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,260
Boss!

298
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,010
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,680
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,180
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,700
Here he is!

302
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,280
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,150
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,730
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,080
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,410
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,180
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,410
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,910
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,330
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,510
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,310
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,980
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,980
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,280
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,480
nor I.

317
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,910
Brother...

318
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,960
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:42,210
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,260
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,850
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,730
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,060
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,430
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,910
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,950
Why?

327
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,910
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,180
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,010
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,430
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,030
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,480
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,150
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,400
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,650
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,660
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,660
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,410
You're not like me.

339
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,880
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,910
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,760
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,400
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,600
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,900
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,610
Looking good.

347
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,500
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,830
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,180
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,550
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,110
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,230
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,900
Like this?

355
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
That's right.

356
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,110
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,160
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,750
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,660
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,880
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,050
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,980
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,900
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,650
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,160
There it is!

366
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,660
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,800
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,880
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,610
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,150
It's burning up.

372
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,450
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,000
Found it!

374
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,050
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,300
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,560
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,350
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:32,280
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,130
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,210
Wow!

381
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,610
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,030
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,810
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,280
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,230
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,250
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,800
Okay!

388
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,130
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,830
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,300
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,910
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,580
No fair!

393
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,010
There.

394
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,230
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,580
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,750
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,360
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,550
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,180
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,300
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,300
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,710
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,650
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,060
Well...

405
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,530
Um...

406
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,730
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,810
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,650
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,200
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,080
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,080
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,660
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,510
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,650
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,350
Wake up!

416
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,850
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,950
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,780
You're under attack!

419
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,030
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,530
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,030
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,200
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,050
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,550
Fight!

425
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,430
Fight!

426
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,960
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,550
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,150
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,560
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,400
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,650
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,980
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,150
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,160
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,730
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,930
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,050
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,900
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,150
Nezuko!

440
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,030
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,480
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,700
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,310
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,000
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,880
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,050
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,250
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,300
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,000
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,830
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,850
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,260
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,010
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,230
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,200
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,250
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,780
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,850
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,850
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,180
Mom?

461
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,960
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,310
Big Bro...

463
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,860
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,910
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,710
forever.

466
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,100
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,600
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,510
Right here.

469
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,760
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,900
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:30,280
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,530
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,030
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,550
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,460
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,880
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,200
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,400
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,310
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,330
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,750
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,380
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,000
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,480
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,060
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,930
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,410
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,800
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,530
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,530
So, please...

491
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,030
forgive me!

492
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,710
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,450
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,950
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,460
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,250
and...

497
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,250
also warm.

498
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,480
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,510
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,760
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,350
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,110
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,780
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,550
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,300
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,050
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,230
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,310
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,030
What was that?

510
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,250
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,000
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,410
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,260
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,260
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,930
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,260
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,160
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,280
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,530
Oh well...

520
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,030
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,050
Not here.

522
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,760
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,630
What's this, though?

524
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,050
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,800
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,050
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,100
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,560
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,810
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,730
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,700
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,200
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,580
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,800
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,460
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,760
There's something...

537
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,150
I must cut.

538
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,730
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,760
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,860
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,660
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,910
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,910
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,910
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,550
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,510
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,130
In other words...

548
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,800
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,260
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,400
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,960
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,500
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,580
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,380
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,310
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,480
Who are these people?

557
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,980
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,660
Rope...

559
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,310
What's this?

560
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,030
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,500
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,500
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,660
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,700
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,800
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,710
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,260
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,210
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:11,150
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,950
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,310
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,300
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,550
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,410
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,660
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,910
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,560
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,430
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,430
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,680
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,480
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,110
What are you doing?

583
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,110
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,910
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,000
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,180
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,550
This man, too?

588
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,600
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,460
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,530
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:38,730
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,360
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,200
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,860
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,860
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,880
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,960
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,050
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,550
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,750
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,130
I was willing...

602
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:55,350
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,350
But it was warm...

604
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,110
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,110
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,880
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,880
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,010
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,350
No way!

610
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,680
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,980
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:57,030
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,110
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,860
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,250
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,350
Right!

617
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,760
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,560
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,810
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,810
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,810
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,450
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,310
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,160
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,550
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,330
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,460
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,460
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,630
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,730
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,560
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,650
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,150
It was him!

634
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,080
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,080
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,080
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,860
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,510
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,300
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,550
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,810
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:02,810
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,330
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:19,580
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,080
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:28,100
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,310
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:37,850
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,150
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:45,950
And yet...

651
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,000
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,860
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,530 --> 00:53:01,300
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,930
is so enormous!

655
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,130
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,800
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,600
get away with this!

658
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,810
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,360
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,060
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,630
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,750
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:46,630
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,930
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,600
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,100
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,310
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:09,080
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,080
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,110
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:29,760
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,260
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,650
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,110
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,400
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,460
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:13,380
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:29,150
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,010
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,780
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,700
This brat...

682
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,610
is insane!

683
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:54,100
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,960
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,730
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,310
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,730
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,460
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,830
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,600
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,980
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,930
insult...

693
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:56,060
my family!

694
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,760
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,350
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:30,710
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,710
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,310
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,480
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,980
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,310
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,080
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,250
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,660
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:06,410
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:11,010
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,480
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,510
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,010
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:29,030
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:32,530
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,410
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:44,550
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,100
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:50,300
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,430
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,350
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,810
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,360
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:11,560
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,880
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,580
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,300
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:35,510
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,150
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,060
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,900
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,530
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:59,860
All right!

730
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,080
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,280
Comin' through!

732
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,050
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,300
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,800
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:15,050
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,800
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,050
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:26,610
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,610
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,860
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,360
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:48,380
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,440
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,630
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,630
Glorify me!

746
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:59,960
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,730
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:06,810
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,330
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:38,600
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,460
First Form...

752
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,760
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,300
No good.

754
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,630
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:50,960
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:02,980
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,810
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,910
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,280
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,400
First Form...

761
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,500
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,750
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:41,500
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:43,750
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,000
Protect...

766
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,430
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,260
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:00,230
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,100
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,060
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:05,350
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,030
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,360
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:18,000
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,250
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,660
Damn!

777
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,530
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,350
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,850
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,430
How could this be?

781
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:43,360
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,200
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:49,860
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,030
What happened?

785
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,580
What was that?

786
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,210
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,000
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:14,000
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:17,730
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:20,350
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,930
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:23,850
Okay!

793
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,100
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,350
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:32,600
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,500
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,410
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:39,700
Head?

799
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,160
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,950
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,360
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,500
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,550
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:58,930
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,430
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,680
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:09,780
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,650
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,900
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,030
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,160
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,160
Somehow...

813
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,910
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,750
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,380
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,210
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:43,650
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:45,650
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,760
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,180
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,680
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,510
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:59,510
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,860
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,410
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,450
That's right!

827
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,360
Understood!

828
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,500
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,000
Forward!

830
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,510
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,850
All right!

832
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:37,310
Inosuke!

833
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:40,560
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,950
Especially around here!

835
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,310
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,310
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,310
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,810
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,580
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:57,710
Gross!

841
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:00,050
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:03,960
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,500
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:11,260
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,760
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:22,400
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,900
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,910
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,860
It's here...

850
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,330
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,500
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,250
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:44,880
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:48,010
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,130
Slice!

856
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,630
It's the bone.

857
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,530
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,980
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,310
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,150
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,880
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,160
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:35,850
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,930
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:41,760
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:46,510
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,230
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,760
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,910
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,830
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,200
DREAM

872
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:06,950
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,460
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:12,130
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,510
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,880
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,710
It's all right!

878
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:26,110
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:32,110
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,320
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,830
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,660
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:50,460
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:53,250
No good!

885
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,580
Wake up!

886
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:56,330
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,330
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,830
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,850
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:02,930
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,100
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,760
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:17,000
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:19,530
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:27,030
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:30,200
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,330
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:38,380
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,460
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:47,880
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,280
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,810
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,200
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,650
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,150
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:13,000
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,460
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:33,650
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:35,810
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,680
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,560
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,530
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,030
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:24,530
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,230
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:35,580
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:39,160
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,210
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,330
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,000
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,450
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:16,360
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:17,700
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,330
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,410
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,960
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,380
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,180
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,380
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,380
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,330
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,250
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,160
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,210
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:17,560
I'm...

936
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,510
all right.

937
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:21,260
What about you?

938
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,680
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,260
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,180
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,610
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:40,250
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,750
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,200
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,830
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:53,260
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:55,960
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,430
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,550
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,010
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:07,260
Please.

952
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:16,200
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,860
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,110
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,530
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,460
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,050
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,460
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:40,710
We have to...

960
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,730
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,850
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,580
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,700
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:11,780
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:12,960
Me?

966
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:14,580
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,600
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:22,100
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:27,600
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:30,600
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:34,150
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,110
It was him!

973
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:38,230
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:44,060
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,530
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:48,360
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,710
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,160
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:59,710
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,080
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,380
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,400
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,180
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,930
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:18,680
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,510
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,430
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:29,280
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:33,500
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,700
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,780
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,080
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:46,460
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:52,460
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,130
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:57,850
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:02,810
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:05,810
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:11,700
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,880
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,550
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:32,380
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,350
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,010
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,480
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,850
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,510
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,400
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:53,200
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:56,700
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,700
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,750
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,080
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,810
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,810
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:43,750
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,410
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:53,580
Right.

1019
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,730
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:59,930
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:04,760
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,680
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,960
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,680
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,610
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,380
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,160
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,880
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,630
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,180
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:34,510
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,100
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:41,510
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:45,910
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,860
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:53,450
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,700
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:00,550
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,050
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,880
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,510
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,300
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,960
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:17,150
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,610
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:20,950
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:26,110
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:27,950
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,230
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:35,380
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,800
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,380
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:48,880
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:51,150
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:58,600
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,150
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:05,650
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:11,750
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:17,910
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:21,030
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:23,080
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:26,350
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:30,930
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,430
I see.

1065
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:41,210
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:45,280
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,510
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,430
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:27,180
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:33,510
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,830
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:41,750
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:51,130
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:53,460
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,210
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:58,300
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:02,210
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:04,800
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,060
I see.

1080
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,110
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,610
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,710
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,050
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,580
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,480
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,730
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:56,430
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,080
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,030
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:07,610
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,110
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:10,530
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:13,000
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,000
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:18,300
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,880
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,260
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,130
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:30,130
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:43,900
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:51,380
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:52,750
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,000
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,130
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,480
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,730
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:20,430
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:26,200
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:33,110
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,030
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:41,080
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,180
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,130
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:53,630
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:56,510
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,280
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:03,650
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,650
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:09,560
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,030
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,080
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:25,750
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:36,810
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:38,100
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:42,730
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,430
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,410
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:15,130
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,850
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,350
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,680
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,810
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:28,400
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,110
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,200
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:40,810
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,930
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:30,000
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,050
No way!

1140
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,050
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:51,230
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:11,000
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,910
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:26,150
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:33,600
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,930
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:40,900
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,110
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:46,250
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:50,000
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:54,200
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:58,700
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,880
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:06,300
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,350
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:25,060
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,060
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,710
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,550
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,960
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:52,150
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:55,060
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:57,060
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:00,060
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:06,060
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:09,330
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,160
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:13,910
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:21,080
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,530
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:25,050
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,680
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:45,060
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,480
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:26,230
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:29,900
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:30,980
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,350
goku...

1179
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,330
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:50,330
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,600
You are...

1182
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:54,960
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,110
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,860
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,900
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:16,530
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:22,480
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:27,750
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,250
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:37,830
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:43,760
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:52,510
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,730
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:03,750
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:08,250
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:09,780
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:30,350
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:36,060
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:39,900
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:54,210
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:59,630
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:08,760
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,560
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:14,760
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,900
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,730
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,060
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:25,360
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:26,660
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,110
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,200
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:43,930
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:45,630
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:49,600
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:51,130
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,430
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:01,950
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:16,460
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:28,050
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:31,710
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:37,810
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:39,850
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:01,360
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:13,130
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,010
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,450
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:28,560
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:34,200
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,810
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,480
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,330
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:49,000
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:53,250
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:57,810
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,930
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:02,350
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,180
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:08,010
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,700
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:11,760
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:16,360
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:18,080
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:20,000
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:22,280
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:25,910
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,030
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:31,860
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:08,800
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:16,460
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:19,160
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,550
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,180
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,150 --> 01:42:28,650
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:31,350
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:34,180
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,200
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:58,080
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,930
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,180
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:08,630
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:12,600
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:17,060
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:27,030
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:32,030
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,030 --> 01:43:34,410
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,710
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:41,330
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:47,000
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:51,010
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,770 --> 01:43:53,680
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:58,430
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,430
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,980
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,250
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,530
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,530
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:20,080
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:27,760
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:32,550
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:36,680
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,760
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:50,280
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:53,360
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:58,780
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:03,330
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,300
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,250
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,550
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:16,600
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:19,810
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:24,350
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:27,310
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:29,930
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,200
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,500
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:39,110
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,280
And then,

1298
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,280
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,110
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,680
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,900
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:25,750
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:31,550
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,170 --> 01:46:33,960
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:45,760
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,430
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:27,510
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:32,430
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:35,980
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:39,780
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,060
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:44,280
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,450
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:51,130
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:52,710
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:57,300
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,630 --> 01:48:01,380
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:06,830
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,310
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:16,810
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:21,760
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,080
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:31,110
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:43,880
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:49,880
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:55,130
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:58,900
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:02,400
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:05,150
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:08,780
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:11,150
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,030
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:16,800
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:19,800
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:33,060
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,760
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,130 --> 01:50:21,100
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:45,750
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,750
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:01,850
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:12,850
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:21,950
I see.

1343
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:36,310
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:39,300
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,510
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:44,850
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:48,180
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:54,360
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:57,560
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:18,660
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:33,060
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,070 --> 01:52:39,230
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:45,610
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:50,830
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:56,770
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:03,880
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:16,700
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:23,620
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:29,510
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:37,000
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,580
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:51,180
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:07,430
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:14,170
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:20,420
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:25,600
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:31,550
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:38,600
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:45,700
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:52,280
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:10,580
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:31,200
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:48,630
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:54,600
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,600 --> 01:56:02,100
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:07,250
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:13,950
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:19,830
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:31,700
Until I reach that distant future
1
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,210
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,000
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,910
Minoru...

4
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,130
Masao...

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,000
Susumu...

6
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,300
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,410
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,550
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,430
Isao...

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,600
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,350
Yukio...

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,060
Takahiro...

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,580
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,860
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,880
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,260
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,310
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,980
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,810
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,300
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,860
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,980
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,700
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,480
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,660
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,300
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,500
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,550
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,330
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,430
So fast!

34
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,430
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,250
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,450
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,360
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,250
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,700
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,510
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,050
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,800
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,430
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,710
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,810
Sure,

46
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,860
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,110
Hey!

48
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,530
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,280
Delicious!

50
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:30,310
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,930
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,600
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,610
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,610
Delicious!

55
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,200
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,700
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,280
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,700
Delicious!

59
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,960
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,210
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,460
Delicious!

62
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,760
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,980
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,850
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,460
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,930
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,230
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,060
Delicious!

69
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,700
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,530
Delicious!

71
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,780
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,550
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,630
Yes.

74
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,410
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,300
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,330
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,550
Yes.

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,650
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,310
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,730
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,980
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,750
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,410
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,080
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,910
A mission?

86
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,350
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,930
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,550
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,680
Right.

90
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,710
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,900
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,860
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,560
About my father...

94
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,610
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,310
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,650
Was he really?

97
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,130
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,830
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,130
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,550
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,550
What's up?

102
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,660
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,210
Dance!

104
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,080
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,010
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,850
Right!

108
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,260
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,500
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,110
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,500
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,580
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,410
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,100
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,050
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,630
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,260
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,710
Flame.

119
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,010
Water.

120
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,300
Wind.

121
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,610
Stone.

122
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,730
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,360
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,610
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,480
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,610
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,750
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,250
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,300
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,300
For real?

131
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,950
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,310
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,260
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,060
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,560
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,010
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,910
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,360
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,830
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,530
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,430
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,350
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,100
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,530
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:34,200
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,950
Nooo!

149
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,230
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,800
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,710
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,800
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,900
May I...

155
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,480
see your...

156
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,350
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,760
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,200
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,580
Here.

160
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,060
What is this?

161
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,480
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,730
Thank you...

163
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,900
very much.

164
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,500
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,630
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,130
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,980
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,450
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,910
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,860
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,100
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,100
First Form...

173
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,730
Amazing.

174
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,230
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,230
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,910
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,210
All right!

178
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,160
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,650
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,580
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,500
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,000
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
All right!

184
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,410
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,450
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,010
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,480
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,900
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,900
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,000
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,180
Tha...

193
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,180
Tha...

194
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,110
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,950
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,750
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,200
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,700
Bro!

201
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,760
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,630
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,000
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,930
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,400
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,060
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,350
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,260
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,750
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,580
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,950
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,250
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,430
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,430
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,100
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:37,230
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,700
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,200
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,110
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,630
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,800
Okay.

222
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,850
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
Calm down.

224
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,360
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,810
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,210
Hey!

227
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,210
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,380
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,300
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,980
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,550
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,100
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,460
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,760
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,280
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,650
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,950
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,160
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,380
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,710
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,060
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,980
while you count.

244
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,980
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,760
One...

246
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,150
Two...

247
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,830
Three...

248
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,750
Four...

249
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,580
Five...

250
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,580
Six...

251
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,030
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,930
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,050
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,380
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,960
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,980
I'm all right.

257
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,480
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,030
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,700
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,860
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,860
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,660
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,630
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,000
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,760
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,180
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,760
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,510
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,030
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,280
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,780
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,280
They can...

273
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,380
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,050
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,630
This way!

276
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,760
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,200
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,280
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,700
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,360
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,030
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,400
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,710
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,960
River?

285
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,210
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,960
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,980
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,980
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,480
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,980
Let's go!

291
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,080
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,950
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,860
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,700
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,210
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,010
Boss!

297
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,260
Boss!

298
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,010
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,680
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,180
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,700
Here he is!

302
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,280
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,150
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,730
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,080
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,410
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,180
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,410
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,910
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,330
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,510
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,310
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,980
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,980
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,280
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,480
nor I.

317
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,910
Brother...

318
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,960
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:42,210
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,260
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,850
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,730
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,060
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,430
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,910
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,950
Why?

327
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,910
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,180
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,010
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,430
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,030
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,480
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,150
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,400
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,650
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,660
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,660
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,410
You're not like me.

339
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,880
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,910
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,760
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,400
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,600
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,900
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,610
Looking good.

347
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,500
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,830
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,180
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,550
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,110
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,230
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,900
Like this?

355
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
That's right.

356
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,110
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,160
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,750
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,660
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,880
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,050
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,980
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,900
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,650
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,160
There it is!

366
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,660
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,800
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,880
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,610
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,150
It's burning up.

372
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,450
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,000
Found it!

374
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,050
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,300
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,560
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,350
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:32,280
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,130
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,210
Wow!

381
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,610
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,030
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,810
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,280
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,230
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,250
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,800
Okay!

388
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,130
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,830
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,300
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,910
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,580
No fair!

393
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,010
There.

394
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,230
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,580
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,750
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,360
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,550
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,180
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,300
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,300
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,710
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,650
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,060
Well...

405
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,530
Um...

406
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,730
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,810
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,650
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,200
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,080
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,080
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,660
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,510
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,650
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,350
Wake up!

416
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,850
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,950
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,780
You're under attack!

419
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,030
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,530
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,030
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,200
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,050
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,550
Fight!

425
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,430
Fight!

426
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,960
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,550
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,150
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,560
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,400
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,650
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,980
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,150
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,160
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,730
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,930
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,050
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,900
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,150
Nezuko!

440
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,030
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,480
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,700
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,310
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,000
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,880
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,050
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,250
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,300
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,000
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,830
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,850
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,260
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,010
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,230
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,200
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,250
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,780
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,850
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,850
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,180
Mom?

461
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,960
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,310
Big Bro...

463
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,860
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,910
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,710
forever.

466
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,100
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,600
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,510
Right here.

469
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,760
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,900
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:30,280
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,530
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,030
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,550
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,460
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,880
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,200
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,400
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,310
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,330
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,750
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,380
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,000
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,480
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,060
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,930
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,410
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,800
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,530
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,530
So, please...

491
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,030
forgive me!

492
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,710
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,450
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,950
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,460
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,250
and...

497
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,250
also warm.

498
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,480
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,510
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,760
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,350
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,110
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,780
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,550
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,300
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,050
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,230
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,310
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,030
What was that?

510
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,250
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,000
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,410
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,260
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,260
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,930
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,260
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,160
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,280
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,530
Oh well...

520
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,030
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,050
Not here.

522
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,760
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,630
What's this, though?

524
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,050
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,800
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,050
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,100
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,560
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,810
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,730
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,700
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,200
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,580
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,800
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,460
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,760
There's something...

537
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,150
I must cut.

538
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,730
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,760
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,860
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,660
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,910
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,910
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,910
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,550
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,510
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,130
In other words...

548
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,800
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,260
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,400
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,960
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,500
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,580
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,380
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,310
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,480
Who are these people?

557
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,980
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,660
Rope...

559
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,310
What's this?

560
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,030
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,500
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,500
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,660
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,700
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,800
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,710
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,260
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,210
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:11,150
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,950
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,310
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,300
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,550
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,410
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,660
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,910
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,560
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,430
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,430
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,680
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,480
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,110
What are you doing?

583
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,110
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,910
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,000
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,180
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,550
This man, too?

588
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,600
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,460
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,530
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:38,730
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,360
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,200
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,860
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,860
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,880
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,960
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,050
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,550
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,750
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,130
I was willing...

602
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:55,350
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,350
But it was warm...

604
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,110
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,110
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,880
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,880
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,010
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,350
No way!

610
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,680
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,980
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:57,030
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,110
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,860
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,250
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,350
Right!

617
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,760
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,560
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,810
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,810
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,810
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,450
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,310
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,160
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,550
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,330
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,460
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,460
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,630
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,730
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,560
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,650
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,150
It was him!

634
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,080
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,080
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,080
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,860
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,510
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,300
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,550
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,810
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:02,810
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,330
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:19,580
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,080
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:28,100
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,310
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:37,850
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,150
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:45,950
And yet...

651
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,000
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,860
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,530 --> 00:53:01,300
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,930
is so enormous!

655
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,130
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,800
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,600
get away with this!

658
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,810
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,360
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,060
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,630
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,750
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:46,630
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,930
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,600
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,100
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,310
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:09,080
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,080
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,110
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:29,760
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,260
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,650
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,110
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,400
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,460
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:13,380
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:29,150
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,010
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,780
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,700
This brat...

682
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,610
is insane!

683
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:54,100
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,960
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,730
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,310
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,730
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,460
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,830
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,600
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,980
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,930
insult...

693
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:56,060
my family!

694
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,760
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,350
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:30,710
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,710
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,310
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,480
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,980
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,310
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,080
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,250
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,660
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:06,410
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:11,010
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,480
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,510
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,010
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:29,030
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:32,530
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,410
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:44,550
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,100
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:50,300
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,430
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,350
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,810
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,360
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:11,560
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,880
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,580
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,300
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:35,510
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,150
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,060
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,900
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,530
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:59,860
All right!

730
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,080
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,280
Comin' through!

732
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,050
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,300
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,800
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:15,050
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,800
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,050
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:26,610
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,610
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,860
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,360
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:48,380
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,440
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,630
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,630
Glorify me!

746
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:59,960
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,730
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:06,810
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,330
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:38,600
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,460
First Form...

752
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,760
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,300
No good.

754
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,630
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:50,960
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:02,980
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,810
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,910
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,280
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,400
First Form...

761
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,500
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,750
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:41,500
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:43,750
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,000
Protect...

766
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,430
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,260
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:00,230
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,100
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,060
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:05,350
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,030
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,360
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:18,000
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,250
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,660
Damn!

777
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,530
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,350
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,850
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,430
How could this be?

781
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:43,360
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,200
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:49,860
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,030
What happened?

785
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,580
What was that?

786
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,210
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,000
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:14,000
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:17,730
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:20,350
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,930
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:23,850
Okay!

793
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,100
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,350
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:32,600
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,500
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,410
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:39,700
Head?

799
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,160
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,950
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,360
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,500
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,550
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:58,930
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,430
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,680
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:09,780
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,650
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,900
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,030
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,160
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,160
Somehow...

813
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,910
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,750
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:38,380
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,210
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:43,650
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:45,650
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,760
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,180
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,680
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,510
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:59,510
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,860
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,410
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,450
That's right!

827
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,360
Understood!

828
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,500
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,000
Forward!

830
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,510
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,850
All right!

832
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:37,310
Inosuke!

833
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:40,560
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,950
Especially around here!

835
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,310
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,310
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,310
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,810
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,580
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:57,710
Gross!

841
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:00,050
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:03,960
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,500
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:11,260
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,760
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:22,400
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,900
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,910
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,860
It's here...

850
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,330
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,500
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,250
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:44,880
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:48,010
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,130
Slice!

856
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,630
It's the bone.

857
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,530
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,980
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,310
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,150
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,880
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,160
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:35,850
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,930
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:41,760
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:46,510
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,230
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,760
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,910
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,830
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,200
DREAM

872
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:06,950
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,460
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:12,130
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,510
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,880
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,710
It's all right!

878
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:26,110
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:32,110
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,320
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,830
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,660
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:50,460
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:53,250
No good!

885
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,580
Wake up!

886
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:56,330
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,330
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,830
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,850
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:02,930
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,100
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,760
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:17,000
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:19,530
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:27,030
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:30,200
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,330
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:38,380
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,460
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:47,880
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,280
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,810
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,200
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,650
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,150
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:13,000
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,460
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:33,650
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:35,810
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,680
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,560
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,530
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,030
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:24,530
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,230
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:35,580
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:39,160
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,210
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,330
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,000
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,450
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:16,360
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:17,700
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,330
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,410
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,960
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,380
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,180
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,380
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,380
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,330
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,250
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,160
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,210
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:17,560
I'm...

936
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,510
all right.

937
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:21,260
What about you?

938
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,680
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,260
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,180
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,610
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:40,250
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,750
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,200
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,830
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:53,260
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:55,960
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,430
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:01,550
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,010
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:07,260
Please.

952
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:16,200
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,860
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,110
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,530
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,460
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,050
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,460
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:40,710
We have to...

960
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,730
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,850
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,580
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,700
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:11,780
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:12,960
Me?

966
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:14,580
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,600
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:22,100
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:27,600
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:30,600
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:34,150
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,110
It was him!

973
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:38,230
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:44,060
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,530
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:48,360
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,710
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,160
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:59,710
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,080
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,380
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,400
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,180
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,930
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:18,680
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,510
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,430
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:29,280
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:33,500
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,700
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,780
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,080
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:46,460
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:52,460
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,130
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:57,850
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:02,810
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:05,810
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:11,700
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,880
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,550
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:32,380
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,350
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,010
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,480
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,850
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,510
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,400
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:53,200
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:56,700
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,700
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,750
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,080
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,810
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,810
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:43,750
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,410
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:53,580
Right.

1019
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,730
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:59,930
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:04,760
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,680
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,960
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,680
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,610
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,380
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,160
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,880
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,630
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,180
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:34,510
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:37,100
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:41,510
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:45,910
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,860
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:53,450
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,700
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:00,550
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,050
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,880
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,510
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,300
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,960
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:17,150
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,610
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:20,950
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:26,110
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:27,950
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,230
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:35,380
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,800
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,380
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:48,880
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:51,150
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:58,600
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,150
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:05,650
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:11,750
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:17,910
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:21,030
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:23,080
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:26,350
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:30,930
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,430
I see.

1065
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:41,210
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:45,280
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,510
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,430
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:27,180
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:33,510
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,830
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:41,750
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:51,130
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:53,460
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,210
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:58,300
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:02,210
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:04,800
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,060
I see.

1080
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,110
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,610
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,710
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,050
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,580
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,480
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,730
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:56,430
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,080
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,030
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:07,610
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,110
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:10,530
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:13,000
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,000
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:18,300
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,880
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,260
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,130
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:30,130
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:43,900
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:51,380
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:52,750
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,000
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,130
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,480
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,730
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:20,430
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:26,200
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:33,110
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,030
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:41,080
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,180
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,130
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:53,630
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:56,510
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,280
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:03,650
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,650
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:09,560
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,030
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,080
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:25,750
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:36,810
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:38,100
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:42,730
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,430
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,410
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:15,130
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,850
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,350
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,680
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,810
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:28,400
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,110
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,200
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:40,810
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,930
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:30,000
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,050
No way!

1140
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,050
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:51,230
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:11,000
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,910
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:26,150
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:33,600
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,930
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:40,900
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,110
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:46,250
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:50,000
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:54,200
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:58,700
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,880
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:06,300
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,350
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:25,060
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,060
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,710
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,550
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,960
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:52,150
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:55,060
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:57,060
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:00,060
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:06,060
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:09,330
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,160
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:13,910
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:21,080
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,530
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:25,050
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,680
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:45,060
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,480
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:26,230
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:29,900
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:30,980
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,350
goku...

1179
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,330
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:50,330
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,600
You are...

1182
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:54,960
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,110
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,860
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,900
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:16,530
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:22,480
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:27,750
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,250
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:37,830
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:43,760
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:52,510
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,730
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:03,750
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:08,250
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:09,780
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:30,350
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:36,060
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:39,900
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:54,210
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:59,630
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:08,760
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,560
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:14,760
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,900
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,730
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,060
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:25,360
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:26,660
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,110
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,200
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:43,930
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:45,630
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:49,600
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:51,130
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,430
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:01,950
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:16,460
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:28,050
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:31,710
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:37,810
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:39,850
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:01,360
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:13,130
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,010
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,450
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:28,560
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:34,200
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,810
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,480
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,330
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:49,000
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:53,250
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:57,810
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,930
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:02,350
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,180
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:08,010
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,700
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:11,760
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:16,360
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:18,080
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:20,000
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:22,280
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:25,910
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,030
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:31,860
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:08,800
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:16,460
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:19,160
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,550
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,180
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,150 --> 01:42:28,650
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:31,350
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:34,180
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,200
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:58,080
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,930
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:04,180
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:08,630
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:12,600
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:17,060
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:27,030
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:32,030
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,030 --> 01:43:34,410
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,710
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:41,330
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:47,000
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:51,010
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,770 --> 01:43:53,680
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:58,430
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,430
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,980
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,250
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,530
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,530
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:20,080
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:27,760
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:32,550
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:36,680
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,760
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:50,280
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:53,360
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:58,780
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:03,330
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,300
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,250
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,550
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:16,600
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:19,810
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:24,350
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:27,310
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:29,930
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,200
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,500
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:39,110
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,280
And then,

1298
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,280
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,110
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,680
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,900
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:25,750
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:31,550
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,170 --> 01:46:33,960
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:45,760
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,430
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:27,510
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:32,430
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:35,980
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:39,780
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,060
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:44,280
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,450
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:51,130
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:52,710
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,130 --> 01:47:57,300
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,630 --> 01:48:01,380
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:06,830
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,310
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:16,810
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:21,760
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,080
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:31,110
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:43,880
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:49,880
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:55,130
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:58,900
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:02,400
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:05,150
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:08,780
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:11,150
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,030
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:16,800
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:19,800
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:33,060
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,760
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,130 --> 01:50:21,100
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:45,750
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,750
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:01,850
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:12,850
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:21,950
I see.

1343
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:36,310
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:39,300
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,510
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:44,850
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:48,180
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:54,360
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:57,560
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:18,660
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:33,060
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,070 --> 01:52:39,230
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:45,610
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:50,830
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:56,770
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:03,880
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:16,700
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:23,620
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:29,510
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:37,000
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,580
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:51,180
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:07,430
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:14,170
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:20,420
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:25,600
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:31,550
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:38,600
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:45,700
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:52,280
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:10,580
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:31,200
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:48,630
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:54,600
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,600 --> 01:56:02,100
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:07,250
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:13,950
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:19,830
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:31,700
Until I reach that distant future
