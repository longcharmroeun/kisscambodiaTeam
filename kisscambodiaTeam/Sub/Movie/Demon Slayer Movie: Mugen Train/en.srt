00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,320
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,110
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,020
Minoru...

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,240
Masao...

5
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,110
Susumu...

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,410
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,520
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,660
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,540
Isao...

10
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,710
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,460
Yukio...

12
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,170
Takahiro...

13
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,110
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,690
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,970
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,990
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,370
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:57,420
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,090
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,920
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,410
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,970
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,090
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,810
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,590
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,570
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,770
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,410
We should go, too!

29
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,610
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,660
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,110
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,540
So fast!

34
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,540
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,360
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,560
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,470
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,360
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,810
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,620
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,160
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,910
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,540
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,820
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,920
Sure,

46
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,970
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,220
Hey!

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,640
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,390
Delicious!

50
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:30,420
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,710
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,720
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,720
Delicious!

55
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,310
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,810
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,390
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,810
Delicious!

59
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,070
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,320
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,570
Delicious!

62
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,870
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,090
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,960
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,570
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,040
Delicious!

67
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,340
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,170
Delicious!

69
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,810
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,640
Delicious!

71
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,890
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,660
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,740
Yes.

74
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,520
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,410
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,440
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,660
Yes.

78
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,760
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,420
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,840
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,090
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,860
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,520
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,190
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,020
A mission?

86
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,460
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:27,040
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,660
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,790
Right.

90
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,820
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,010
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,970
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,670
About my father...

94
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,720
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,420
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,760
Was he really?

97
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,240
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,940
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,240
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,660
What's up?

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,770
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,320
Dance!

104
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,190
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,120
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,510
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,960
Right!

108
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,370
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,610
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,220
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,610
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,690
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,520
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,210
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,740
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,370
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,820
Flame.

119
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,120
Water.

120
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,410
Wind.

121
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,720
Stone.

122
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,840
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,470
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,720
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,590
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,720
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,860
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,360
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,410
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,410
For real?

131
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,060
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,420
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,370
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,170
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,670
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,120
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,020
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,470
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,940
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,640
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,540
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,460
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,210
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,710
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,470
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,640
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,310
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,060
Nooo!

149
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,810
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,340
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,910
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,820
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,910
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,010
May I...

155
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,590
see your...

156
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,460
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,870
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,310
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,690
Here.

160
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,170
What is this?

161
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,590
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,840
Thank you...

163
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,010
very much.

164
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,610
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,740
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,240
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,090
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,560
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,020
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,970
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,210
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,210
First Form...

173
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Amazing.

174
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,340
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,340
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,020
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,320
All right!

178
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,270
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,760
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,690
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,610
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,110
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,190
All right!

184
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,520
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,560
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,590
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,010
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,010
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,110
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,110
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,290
Tha...

193
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,290
Tha...

194
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,220
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,060
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,860
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,860
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,390
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,310
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,810
Bro!

201
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,870
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,740
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,110
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,040
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,510
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,170
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,460
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,370
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,860
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,690
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,060
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,360
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,540
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,540
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,210
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:37,340
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,810
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,310
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,220
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,740
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,910
Okay.

222
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,960
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,590
Calm down.

224
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,470
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,920
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,320
Hey!

227
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,320
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,490
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,410
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,090
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,190
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,660
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,210
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,570
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,870
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,390
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,760
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,060
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,270
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,490
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,820
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,170
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,090
while you count.

244
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,090
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,870
One...

246
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,260
Two...

247
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,940
Three...

248
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,860
Four...

249
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,690
Five...

250
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,690
Six...

251
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,140
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,040
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,160
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,490
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,070
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,090
I'm all right.

257
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,590
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,140
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,810
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,970
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,970
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,770
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,740
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,110
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,870
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,290
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,870
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,620
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,140
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,390
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,890
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,390
They can...

273
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,490
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,160
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,740
This way!

276
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,870
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,310
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,390
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,810
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,470
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,140
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,510
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,820
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,070
River?

285
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,320
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,070
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,090
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,090
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,590
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,090
Let's go!

291
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,190
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,060
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,970
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,810
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,320
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,120
Boss!

297
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,370
Boss!

298
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,120
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,790
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,290
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,810
Here he is!

302
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,390
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,260
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,840
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,190
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,520
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,290
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,520
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,020
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,440
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,620
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,420
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,090
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,090
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,390
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,590
nor I.

317
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,020
Brother...

318
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,070
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,320
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,370
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,960
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,840
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,170
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,540
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:07,020
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,060
Why?

327
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,020
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,290
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:28,120
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,540
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,590
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,260
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,510
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,760
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,770
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,770
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,520
You're not like me.

339
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,990
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,020
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,870
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,290
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,510
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,710
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,010
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,720
Looking good.

347
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,190
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,610
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,940
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,290
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:51,660
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,220
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,340
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,010
Like this?

355
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,310
That's right.

356
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,220
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,270
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,860
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,770
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,990
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,160
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:39,090
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,010
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,760
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,270
There it is!

366
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,770
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,110
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,910
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,990
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,720
It's hot,

371
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,260
It's burning up.

372
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,560
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,110
Found it!

374
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,160
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,410
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,670
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,460
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,390
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,240
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,320
Wow!

381
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,720
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,140
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,920
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,390
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,340
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,360
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,910
Okay!

388
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,240
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,940
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,410
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,020
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,690
No fair!

393
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,120
There.

394
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,340
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,690
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,860
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,470
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,660
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,290
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,410
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,410
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,820
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,760
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,170
Well...

405
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,640
Um...

406
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,840
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,920
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,760
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,310
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,190
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,190
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,770
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,620
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,760
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,460
Wake up!

416
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:07,960
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,060
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,890
You're under attack!

419
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,140
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,640
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,140
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,310
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,160
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,660
Fight!

425
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,540
Fight!

426
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,070
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,660
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,260
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,670
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,510
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,760
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,090
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,260
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,270
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,840
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,040
Big Bro!

437
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,160
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,010
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,260
Nezuko!

440
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,140
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,590
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,810
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,420
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,110
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,990
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,160
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,360
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,410
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,110
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,940
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,960
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,370
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,120
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,340
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,310
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,360
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,890
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,960
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,960
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,290
Mom?

461
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,070
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,420
Big Bro...

463
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,970
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,020
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,820
forever.

466
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,210
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,710
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,620
Right here.

469
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,870
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,010
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,390
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,640
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,140
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,660
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,570
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,990
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,310
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,510
I can never go back!

479
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,420
Big Bro!

480
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,440
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,860
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,490
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,110
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,590
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,170
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,040
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,520
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,910
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,640
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,640
So, please...

491
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,140
forgive me!

492
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,820
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,560
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,060
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,570
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,360
and...

497
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,360
also warm.

498
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,590
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,620
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,870
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,460
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,220
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,890
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,660
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,410
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,160
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,340
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,420
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,140
What was that?

510
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,360
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,110
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,520
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,370
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,370
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,040
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,370
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,270
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,390
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,640
Oh well...

520
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,140
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,160
Not here.

522
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,870
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,740
What's this, though?

524
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,160
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,910
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,160
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,210
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,670
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,920
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,840
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,810
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,310
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,690
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,910
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,570
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,870
There's something...

537
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,260
I must cut.

538
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,840
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,870
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,970
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,770
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,020
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,020
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,020
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,660
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,620
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,240
In other words...

548
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,910
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,370
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,510
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,070
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,610
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,690
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,490
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,420
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,590
Who are these people?

557
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,090
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,770
Rope...

559
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,420
What's this?

560
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,140
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,610
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,610
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,770
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,810
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,910
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,820
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:02,370
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,320
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,260
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,060
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,420
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,410
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,660
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,520
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,770
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,020
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:44,670
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,540
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,540
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,790
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:58,590
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,220
What are you doing?

583
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,220
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,020
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,110
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,290
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,660
This man, too?

588
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,710
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,570
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,640
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,840
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,470
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,310
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,970
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,970
Poor man.

596
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,990
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:56,070
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,160
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,660
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,860
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,240
I was willing...

602
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,460
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,460
But it was warm...

604
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,220
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,220
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,990
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,990
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:36,120
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,460
No way!

610
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,790
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,090
Why would you...

612
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:57,140
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,220
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,970
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,360
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,460
Right!

617
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,870
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,670
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:29,920
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,920
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,920
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,560
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,420
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,270
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,660
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,440
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:53,570
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,570
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:57,740
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,840
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,670
Good morning!

632
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,760
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,260
It was him!

634
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,190
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:24,190
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:30,190
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,970
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,620
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,410
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,660
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,920
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,920
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,440
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:19,690
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:23,190
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:28,210
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,420
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,960
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,260
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,060
And yet...

651
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,110
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:53,970
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:01,410
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:06,040
is so enormous!

655
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,240
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,910
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,710
get away with this!

658
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,920
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,470
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,170
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,740
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,860
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:46,740
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,040
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,710
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,210
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,420
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:09,190
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,190
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,220
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,870
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,370
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,760
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:53,220
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,510
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,570
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,490
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,260
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,120
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,890
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,810
This brat...

682
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,720
is insane!

683
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:54,210
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:02,070
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:08,840
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:19,420
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,840
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,570
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:36,940
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:48,710
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,090
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,040
insult...

693
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,170
my family!

694
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,870
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,460
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,820
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,820
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:39,420
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,590
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,090
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:51,420
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,190
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,360
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,770
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,520
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,120
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:15,590
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,620
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:25,120
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,140
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,640
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,520
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:44,660
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,210
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,410
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,540
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,460
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,920
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:05,470
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:11,670
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,990
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:28,690
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,410
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,620
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:40,260
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,170
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:45,010
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,640
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,980 --> 00:59:59,970
All right!

730
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,190
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:05,390
Comin' through!

732
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,160
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,410
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,910
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,160
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,910
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,160
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,720
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:30,720
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,970
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:40,470
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,490
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,550
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,740
and worship me!

745
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,740
Glorify me!

746
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:00,070
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,840
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,920
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,440
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,710
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,570
First Form...

752
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,870
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,410
No good.

754
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,740
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,070
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:03,090
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,920
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:11,020
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,390
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:32,510
First Form...

761
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:34,610
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,860
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,610
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,860
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,110
Protect...

766
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,540
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,370
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,340
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,210
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,170
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,460
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,140
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,470
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,110
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,360
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:22,770
Damn!

777
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,640
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,460
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:37,960
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,540
How could this be?

781
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,470
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,310
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,970
under a rock!

784
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:58,140
What happened?

785
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,690
What was that?

786
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,320
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,110
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,110
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,840
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,460
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:23,040
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,960
Okay!

793
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,210
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,460
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,710
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,610
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:38,520
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:39,810
Head?

799
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:41,270
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,060
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,470
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:49,610
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,660
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,040
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:02,540
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,790
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,890
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,760
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:18,010
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:24,140
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,270
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,270
Somehow...

813
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,020
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,860
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,490
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,320
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,760
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,760
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,870
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,290
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,790
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:55,620
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,620
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,970
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,520
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:05,560
That's right!

827
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,470
Understood!

828
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,610
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,110
Forward!

830
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,620
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,960
All right!

832
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,420
Inosuke!

833
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,670
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:43,060
Especially around here!

835
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,420
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,420
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:48,420
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,920
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,690
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,820
Gross!

841
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,160
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,070
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,610
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:11,370
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:12,870
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,510
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:25,010
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,020
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:29,970
It's here...

850
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,440
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:34,610
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,360
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,990
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,120
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:51,240
Slice!

856
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:58,740
It's the bone.

857
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,640
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,090
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,420
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,260
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,990
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,270
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:35,960
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:38,040
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,870
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:46,620
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,340
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:50,870
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,020
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,940
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:02,310
DREAM

872
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:07,060
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,570
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,240
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,620
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:17,990
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:23,820
It's all right!

878
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,220
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:32,220
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,430
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:45,940
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,770
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,570
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,360
No good!

885
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:54,690
Wake up!

886
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,440
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:57,440
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:58,940
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:00,960
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,040
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,210
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,870
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,110
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,640
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:27,140
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,310
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:33,440
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:38,490
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:42,570
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:47,990
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,390
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,430 --> 01:11:59,920
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:01,310
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,760
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,260
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:13,110
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,570
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,760
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,920
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,790
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,670
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,640
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:19,140
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,640
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:29,340
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,690
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,270
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,320
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,440
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,110
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,560
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:16,470
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,810
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:20,440
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,520
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:28,070
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,490
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,290
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:03,490
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:07,490
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:10,440
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,360
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:14,270
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:16,320
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,670
I'm...

936
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,620
all right.

937
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,370
What about you?

938
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:24,790
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:28,370
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:32,290
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,720
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:40,360
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:44,860
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,310
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,940
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:53,370
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,070
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,540
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,660
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,120
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,370
Please.

952
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,310
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,970
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:20,220
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:24,640
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:28,570
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:35,160
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:38,570
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:40,820
We have to...

960
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,840
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,960
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:05,690
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,810
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:11,890
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,070
Me?

966
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,690
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:18,710
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,210
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:27,710
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,710
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,260
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:36,220
It was him!

973
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,340
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:44,170
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,640
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,470
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:51,820
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:55,270
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,820
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:02,190
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:05,490
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,510
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:11,290
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:16,040
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,790
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:22,620
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:25,540
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:29,390
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:33,610
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:35,810
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,890
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:41,190
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:46,570
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:52,570
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:54,240
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,960
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,920
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,920
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:11,810
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:16,990
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:22,660
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:32,490
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,460
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:37,120
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:40,590
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,960
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:46,620
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,510
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:53,310
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,810
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:58,810
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:00,860
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:06,190
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,920
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:39,920
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:43,860
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:46,520
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,690
Right.

1019
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,840
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:00,040
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:04,870
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:10,790
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:43,070
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:45,790
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,720
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,490
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,270
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:22,990
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:24,740
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:29,290
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:34,620
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:37,210
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:41,620
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:46,020
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,970
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:53,560
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:57,810
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,660
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:02,160
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:05,990
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,620
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:10,410
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:13,070
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:17,260
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:19,720
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,060
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:26,220
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,060
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:31,340
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:35,490
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:40,910
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:42,490
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,990
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:51,260
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:58,710
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:02,260
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:05,760
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:11,860
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:18,020
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,140
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,190
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:26,460
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:31,040
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,540
I see.

1065
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:41,320
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,390
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,620
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:23,540
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,290
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,620
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:37,940
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:41,860
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:51,240
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,570
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:56,320
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:58,410
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,320
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:04,910
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:19,170
I see.

1080
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,220
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:24,720
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:26,820
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:32,160
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:37,690
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:48,590
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:49,840
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,540
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:00,190
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:06,140
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,720
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,220
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,640
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,110
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:16,110
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,410
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:19,990
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,370
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:25,240
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:30,240
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,010
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,490
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:52,860
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:59,110
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:07,240
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:13,590
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:16,840
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:20,540
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:26,310
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,220
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,140
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,190
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:42,290
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:52,240
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,740
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,620
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:59,390
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:03,760
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,760
I can't move...

1119
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:09,670
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:14,140
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:20,190
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:25,860
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:36,920
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:38,210
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,840
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:45,540
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:52,520
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,240
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:16,960
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,460
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:21,790
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,920
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,510
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:30,220
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,310
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:40,920
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,610 --> 01:31:00,040
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,110
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,160
No way!

1140
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,160
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,340
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,110
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:15,020
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:26,260
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:33,710
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,040
But what about you?

1147
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:41,010
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:43,220
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:46,360
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:50,110
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,310
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:58,810
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,990
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,410
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:09,460
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,170
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:32,170
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:35,820
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:40,660
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:42,070
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,260
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:55,170
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:57,170
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,430 --> 01:34:00,170
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:06,170
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:09,440
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:11,270
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,020
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:21,190
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,640
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:25,160
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:26,790
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,170
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:19,590
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,340
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,010
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,090
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:32,460
goku...

1179
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:48,440
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,440
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,710
You are...

1182
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,070
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,220
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:10,970
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:14,010
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,640
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:22,590
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:27,860
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:31,360
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:37,940
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:43,870
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:52,620
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:58,840
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:03,860
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:08,360
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,890
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,490 --> 01:37:30,460
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:36,170
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:40,010
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,320
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:59,740
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,870
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:11,670
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,870
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:18,010
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:19,840
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:23,170
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:25,470
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,770
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:31,220
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:41,310
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,040
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,740
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:49,710
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,240
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,540
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,060
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,570
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:28,160
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:31,820
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:37,920
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:39,960
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,470
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,240
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:24,120
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:26,560
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,670
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:34,310
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:36,920
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:39,590
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:45,440
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:49,110
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,360
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:57,920
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,930 --> 01:41:00,040
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,460
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:05,290
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:08,120
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:09,810
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,870
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:16,470
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,190
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,110
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,390
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:26,020
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:28,140
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:31,970
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:08,910
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,690 --> 01:42:16,570
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,270
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:22,660
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:25,290
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:28,760
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,460
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:34,290
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:54,310
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:58,190
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:01,040
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:04,290
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:08,740
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,710
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:17,170
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:27,140
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,140
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:34,520
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,530 --> 01:43:36,820
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:41,440
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,410 --> 01:43:47,110
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:51,120
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,790
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:58,540
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:02,540
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:06,090
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:09,360
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:11,640
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,230 --> 01:44:16,640
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:20,190
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:27,870
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,660
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,790
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:39,870
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:50,390
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:53,470
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,890
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:03,440
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:06,410
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:10,360
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:14,660
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,710
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,920
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:24,460
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:27,420
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:30,040
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:33,310
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:35,610
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:39,220
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:41,390
And then,

1298
01:45:42,030 --> 01:45:45,390
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:48,220
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,790
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:19,010
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:25,860
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,660
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,070
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,870
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:24,540
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,620
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:32,540
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,090
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:39,890
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,510 --> 01:47:43,170
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,390
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:47,560
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,230 --> 01:47:51,240
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:52,820
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:57,410
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:01,490
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:06,940
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:13,420
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:16,920
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:21,870
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:24,190
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:31,220
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,990
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:49,990
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:55,240
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:59,010
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,310 --> 01:49:02,510
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:05,260
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:08,890
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:11,260
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:13,140
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:16,910
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,910
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,170
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:18,870
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,210
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,190 --> 01:50:45,860
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:52,860
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,960
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:12,960
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:22,060
I see.

1343
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:36,420
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,410
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:41,620
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,960
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:48,290
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:54,470
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:57,670
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:18,770
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:33,170
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:39,340
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:45,720
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,730 --> 01:52:50,940
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:56,880
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:03,990
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:16,810
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,810 --> 01:53:23,730
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:29,620
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:37,110
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:42,690
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:51,290
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:07,540
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:14,280
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:20,530
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:25,710
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,710 --> 01:54:31,660
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:38,710
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:45,810
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:52,390
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:10,690
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:31,310
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:42,030 --> 01:55:48,740
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:54,710
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,710 --> 01:56:02,210
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:07,360
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:14,060
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:19,940
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:31,810
Until I reach that distant future
