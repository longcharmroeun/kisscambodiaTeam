1
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,265
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,055
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:50,965
Minoru...

4
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,185
Masao...

5
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:55,055
Susumu...

6
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:57,355
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,355 --> 00:00:59,465
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:01,605
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,485
Isao...

10
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:05,655
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:07,405
Yukio...

12
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:09,115
Takahiro...

13
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:24,055
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:26,635
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:33,915
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:43,935
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,315
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:57,365
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,035
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:09,865
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:16,355
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,915
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:25,035
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:29,755
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:31,535
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:36,515
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:37,715
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:39,355
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,555
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,605
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,055
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,385
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:09,485
So fast!

34
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,485
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,305
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:15,505
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,415
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:26,305
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:27,755
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:28,565
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:31,105
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:42,855
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:44,485
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,765
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:48,865
Sure,

46
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,915
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,165
Hey!

48
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:56,585
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:58,175 --> 00:04:59,335
Delicious!

50
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:30,365
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:32,985
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:34,655
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,665
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:40,665
Delicious!

55
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,255
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:46,755
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:49,335
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:51,755
Delicious!

59
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:54,015
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:57,265
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:00,515
Delicious!

62
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:02,815
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:04,035
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,905
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,515
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:08,985
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:11,285
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,115
Delicious!

69
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,755
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:16,585
Delicious!

71
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,835
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,605
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:31,685
Yes.

74
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,465
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:39,355
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:43,385
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:44,605
Yes.

78
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,705
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:50,365
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,785
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,035
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:09,805
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:13,465
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:16,135
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:17,965
A mission?

86
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:20,405
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:26,985
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:30,605
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:31,735
Right.

90
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:34,765
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,955
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,915
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,615
About my father...

94
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,665
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:48,365
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,705
Was he really?

97
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:53,185
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:54,885
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:56,185
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,605 --> 00:07:59,605
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,605
What's up?

102
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,715
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,265
Dance!

104
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:09,135
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:13,065
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:15,455
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:21,905
Right!

108
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:24,315
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,555
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:34,165
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,555
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:38,635
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:42,465
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:46,155
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:49,105
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:51,685
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:57,315
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:58,765
Flame.

119
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,065
Water.

120
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:01,355
Wind.

121
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,665
Stone.

122
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:05,785
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:10,415
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:13,665
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:15,535
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,665
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:21,805
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:23,305
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:25,355
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,355
For real?

131
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,005
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:36,365
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,315
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,115
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,615
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,065
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,965
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,335 --> 00:10:00,415
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:06,885
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:09,585
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:13,485
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:16,405
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:20,155
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:26,655
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:28,415
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:29,585
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:34,255
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,255 --> 00:10:36,005
Nooo!

149
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:37,755
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:43,285
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,855
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,765
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,635 --> 00:11:00,855
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:09,955
May I...

155
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:11,535
see your...

156
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,405
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:15,815
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:20,255
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:32,635
Here.

160
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,115
What is this?

161
00:11:58,755 --> 00:12:00,535
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:03,785
Thank you...

163
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,955
very much.

164
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,555
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:13,685
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:18,185
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:42,035
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:44,505
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:49,965
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:56,915
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:04,155
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,155
First Form...

173
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:28,785
Amazing.

174
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,285
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,285
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:37,965
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:41,265
All right!

178
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:45,215
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,705
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,635
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,555
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:21,055
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,135
All right!

184
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:24,465
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:26,505
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,065
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:46,535
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:49,955
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:51,955
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,055
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,055
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:31,235
Tha...

193
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:33,235
Tha...

194
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:37,165
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,005
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,805
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,805
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:47,335
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:50,255
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:51,755
Bro!

201
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,815
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,685
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:41,055
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:44,985
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:49,455
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,115
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,405
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:57,315
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,805
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:08,635
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:15,005
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:17,305
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:22,485
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:27,485
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:30,155
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:37,285
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:42,755
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:47,255
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:51,165
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:54,685
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:56,855
Okay.

222
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,905
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:03,535
Calm down.

224
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:05,415
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:07,865
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:19,265
Hey!

227
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,265
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:23,435
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,355
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,035
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,805 --> 00:20:01,135
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:13,605
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:16,155
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:20,515
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:26,815
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:33,335
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:35,705
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,005
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:45,215
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:50,435
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:54,765
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,115
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,035
while you count.

244
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:14,035
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:15,815
One...

246
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,205
Two...

247
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,885
Three...

248
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:20,805
Four...

249
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:22,635
Five...

250
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:24,635
Six...

251
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:34,085
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:35,985
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:41,105
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:44,435
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:50,015
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,035
I'm all right.

257
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,535
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,085
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,755
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,915
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,915
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:15,715
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:21,685
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:25,055
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:28,815
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:35,235
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,815
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,225 --> 00:22:43,565
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:46,085
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,335
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,835 --> 00:22:56,835
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,335
They can...

273
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:02,435
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:04,105
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:13,685
This way!

276
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:15,815
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:18,255
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:20,335
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:22,755
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:24,415
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:27,085
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:29,455
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:39,765
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:41,015
River?

285
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,265
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:48,015
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:53,035
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:56,035
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:01,535
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:04,035
Let's go!

291
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:21,135
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:23,005
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,915
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,755
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,755 --> 00:24:28,265
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:29,065
Boss!

297
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:30,315
Boss!

298
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:34,065
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:38,735
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:42,235
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,755
Here he is!

302
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:51,335
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,205
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,785
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:03,135
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:05,465
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,235
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,335 --> 00:25:40,465
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,965
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,385
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:07,565
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,365
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:15,035
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:19,035
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:21,335
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:23,535
nor I.

317
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:30,965
Brother...

318
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:36,015
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:42,265
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:47,315
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:51,905
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,655 --> 00:26:54,785
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,205 --> 00:26:59,115
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:01,485
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:06,965
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,005
Why?

327
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:17,965
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:22,235
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:28,065
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:30,485
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,085
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:40,535
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:43,205
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:47,455
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,705
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:53,715
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:55,715
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,855 --> 00:28:00,465
You're not like me.

339
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:02,935
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:05,965
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:10,815
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:13,235
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:14,455
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:16,655
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,955
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,665
Looking good.

347
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:30,135
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:34,555
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:39,885
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:45,235
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:51,605
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:02,165
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:04,285
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:06,955
Like this?

355
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:08,255
That's right.

356
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:12,165
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:15,215
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:18,805
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:20,715
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,935
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:27,135 --> 00:29:31,105
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:39,035
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:41,955
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,985 --> 00:29:47,705
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:56,215
There it is!

366
00:29:56,975 --> 00:30:00,715
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:07,055
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:13,855
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:25,935
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:27,665
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:29,205
It's burning up.

372
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:31,505
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:49,055
Found it!

374
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:51,105
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:55,355
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:01,615
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,405
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:32,335
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,235 --> 00:31:39,185
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:52,265
Wow!

381
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:55,665
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,085
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:02,865
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:05,335
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,285
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,305
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:11,855
Okay!

388
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:14,185
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:14,185 --> 00:32:16,885
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:18,355
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:20,965
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:22,635
No fair!

393
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:38,065
There.

394
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:41,285
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:51,635
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:55,805
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,735 --> 00:32:59,415
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:01,605
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:05,235
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:10,355
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:13,355
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:15,765
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:19,705
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:22,115
Well...

405
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:23,585
Um...

406
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:24,785
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,865
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,705
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:35,255
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,135
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:47,135
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,935 --> 00:33:51,715
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:53,565
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,655 --> 00:33:59,705
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,405
Wake up!

416
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:07,905
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:13,005
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:14,835
You're under attack!

419
00:34:15,175 --> 00:34:16,085
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:17,585
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:22,085
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:25,255
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,105
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,605
Fight!

425
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:32,485
Fight!

426
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:39,015
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:41,605
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:45,205
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:46,615
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,455
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:54,705
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,255 --> 00:34:57,035
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:59,205
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:02,215
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,785
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:00,985
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:03,105
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:12,955
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,205
Nezuko!

440
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:20,085
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:21,535
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:23,755
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,365
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:27,055
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:28,935
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,935 --> 00:36:31,105
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,305
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:34,355
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:36,055
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:42,885
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:45,905
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,315
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:49,065
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:58,285
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:01,255
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,305
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:09,835
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:25,105 --> 00:37:26,905
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:29,905
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:34,235
Mom?

461
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:37,015
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:39,365
Big Bro...

463
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:49,915
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:02,965
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,305 --> 00:38:04,765
forever.

466
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,155
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:15,655
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:17,565
Right here.

469
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:20,815
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,655 --> 00:38:23,955
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:30,335
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:36,585
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:41,085
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:44,605
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:49,515
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:52,935
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:09,255
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:11,455
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:16,365
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,385
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:26,805
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:29,435
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:34,055
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:39,535
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:43,115
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,985
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:52,465
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:54,855
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,255 --> 00:39:58,585
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:00,585
So, please...

491
00:40:01,635 --> 00:40:03,085
forgive me!

492
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:14,765
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,455 --> 00:40:36,505
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,005
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:43,515
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,305
and...

497
00:40:46,555 --> 00:40:48,305
also warm.

498
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:01,535
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:07,565
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:12,815
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:15,405
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:24,165
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:26,835
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:39,605
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:41,185 --> 00:41:45,355
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,355 --> 00:41:49,105
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:54,285
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,365
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:00,085
What was that?

510
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:14,305
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:18,055
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:25,465
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:27,315
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:30,315
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:36,985
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:43,315
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:45,215
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:49,335
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,725 --> 00:42:51,585
Oh well...

520
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:56,085
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:01,105
Not here.

522
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:03,815
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:05,685
What's this, though?

524
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:08,105
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:11,855
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:14,105
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:16,155
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:18,615
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:22,865
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,455 --> 00:43:24,785
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:29,755
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:33,255
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:36,635
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:42,855
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:47,515
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,985 --> 00:43:59,815
There's something...

537
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:02,205
I must cut.

538
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:05,785
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:07,815
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:10,915
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:12,055 --> 00:44:14,715
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,475 --> 00:44:18,965
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,505 --> 00:44:20,965
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:25,965
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:27,605
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,855 --> 00:44:30,565
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,905 --> 00:44:32,185
In other words...

548
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:34,855
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:40,315
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,755 --> 00:45:00,455
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,355 --> 00:45:07,015
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:11,555
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,225 --> 00:45:14,635
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,435
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:18,365
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,405 --> 00:45:24,535
Who are these people?

557
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:28,035
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,715
Rope...

559
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:34,365
What's this?

560
00:45:34,675 --> 00:45:36,085
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,425 --> 00:45:38,555
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:41,555
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:45,715
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:50,755
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:53,855
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:56,765
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,275 --> 00:46:02,315
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:06,265
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:11,205
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:15,005
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,585 --> 00:46:17,365
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:25,175 --> 00:46:27,355
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,605 --> 00:46:30,605
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:33,105 --> 00:46:35,465
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:37,715
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,605 --> 00:46:42,965
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:44,615
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,485
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:52,485
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:54,735
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,735 --> 00:46:58,535
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:03,165
What are you doing?

583
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:09,165
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:10,965
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:15,055
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,235
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,605
This man, too?

588
00:47:26,105 --> 00:47:27,655
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:30,515
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:34,585
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,785
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:44,415
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,955 --> 00:47:46,255
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:47,915
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:49,915
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:52,935
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:56,015
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:58,185 --> 00:47:59,105
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:02,605
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:27,805
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,525 --> 00:48:48,185
I was willing...

602
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:55,405
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,985 --> 00:48:59,405
But it was warm...

604
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:03,165
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,705 --> 00:49:08,165
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,475 --> 00:49:25,935
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,475 --> 00:49:27,935
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:36,065
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:43,405
No way!

610
00:49:44,035 --> 00:49:46,735
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:49,035
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:57,085
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:01,165
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:04,915
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,925 --> 00:50:08,305
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:13,405
Right!

617
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:14,815
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,615
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,955 --> 00:50:29,865
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,865
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:36,865
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,505
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:42,365
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:44,215
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,605
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:47,105 --> 00:50:48,385
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,355 --> 00:50:53,515
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,975 --> 00:50:55,515
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:57,685
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,705 --> 00:51:07,785
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:09,615
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,955 --> 00:51:13,705
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,735 --> 00:51:16,205
It was him!

634
00:51:17,455 --> 00:51:19,135
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:24,135
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:30,135
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:32,915
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:35,565
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:40,355
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:44,605
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,535 --> 00:51:55,865
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,425 --> 00:52:02,865
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:10,385
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:19,635
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,435 --> 00:52:23,135
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:28,155
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:31,365
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,705 --> 00:52:37,905
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,205
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,585 --> 00:52:46,005
And yet...

651
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:50,055
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,555 --> 00:52:53,915
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,585 --> 00:53:01,355
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:05,985
is so enormous!

655
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:11,185
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,855
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:15,655
get away with this!

658
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,865
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:30,415
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,925 --> 00:53:33,115
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:37,685
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,305 --> 00:53:41,805
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,805 --> 00:53:46,685
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,305 --> 00:53:50,985
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:53,655
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,205 --> 00:53:56,155
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,365
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,235 --> 00:54:09,135
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,635 --> 00:54:13,135
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,165
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,905 --> 00:54:29,815
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:38,315
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:43,705
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:53,165
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,455
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:03,515
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:13,435
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:29,205
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:32,065
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,835
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:36,755
This brat...

682
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:40,665
is insane!

683
00:55:49,635 --> 00:55:54,155
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:02,015
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:08,785
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:19,365
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:21,785
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,725 --> 00:56:32,515
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:36,885
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:48,655
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,235 --> 00:56:51,035
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:52,985
insult...

693
00:56:52,985 --> 00:56:56,115
my family!

694
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:22,815
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,235 --> 00:57:26,405
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:30,765
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,855 --> 00:57:33,765
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:39,365
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:43,535
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:47,035
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:51,365
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,135
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,685 --> 00:57:56,305
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,635 --> 00:57:59,715
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,385 --> 00:58:06,465
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:11,065
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:15,535
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:21,565
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:25,065
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,425 --> 00:58:29,085
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:32,585
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,255 --> 00:58:36,465
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:44,605
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,155
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:50,355
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:54,485
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:58,405
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,855 --> 00:59:00,865
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:05,415
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:11,615
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,775 --> 00:59:24,935
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:28,635
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,635 --> 00:59:31,355
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:35,565
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:40,205
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,735 --> 00:59:42,115
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:44,955
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,585
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,925 --> 00:59:59,915
All right!

730
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:02,135
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,255 --> 01:00:05,335
Comin' through!

732
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:09,105
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,355
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,685 --> 01:00:12,855
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:13,105 --> 01:00:15,105
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,405 --> 01:00:17,855
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,855 --> 01:00:21,105
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:23,025 --> 01:00:26,665
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:30,665
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:37,915
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:40,415
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:48,435
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,435 --> 01:00:50,495
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,685
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:54,685
Glorify me!

746
01:00:55,025 --> 01:01:00,015
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:02,785
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:06,865
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,975 --> 01:01:34,385
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,405 --> 01:01:38,655
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:39,185 --> 01:01:40,515
First Form...

752
01:01:40,775 --> 01:01:41,815
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,355 --> 01:01:46,355
No good.

754
01:01:46,655 --> 01:01:48,685
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:51,015
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,585 --> 01:02:03,035
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,455 --> 01:02:06,865
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:10,965
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,755 --> 01:03:30,335
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,255 --> 01:03:32,455
First Form...

761
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:34,555
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,685 --> 01:03:39,805
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,385 --> 01:03:41,555
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,805
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,685 --> 01:03:48,055
Protect...

766
01:03:54,905 --> 01:03:56,485
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:58,315
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,325 --> 01:04:00,285
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,285 --> 01:04:02,155
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:04,115
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:05,405
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:11,085 --> 01:04:14,085
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,805 --> 01:04:16,415
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:18,055
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:21,305
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,755 --> 01:04:22,715
Damn!

777
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:24,585
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,385 --> 01:04:27,405
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,775 --> 01:04:37,905
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,525 --> 01:04:40,485
How could this be?

781
01:04:41,025 --> 01:04:43,415
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,255
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:49,915
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,955 --> 01:04:58,085
What happened?

785
01:05:03,975 --> 01:05:05,635
What was that?

786
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,265
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,555 --> 01:05:11,055
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:14,055
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:17,785
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:20,405
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:22,985
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:23,905
Okay!

793
01:05:24,285 --> 01:05:26,155
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,485 --> 01:05:28,405
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,785 --> 01:05:32,655
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,985 --> 01:05:34,555
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:38,465
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,805 --> 01:05:39,755
Head?

799
01:05:40,175 --> 01:05:41,215
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,225 --> 01:05:45,005
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,425 --> 01:05:47,415
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:49,555
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:55,605
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:58,985
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:02,485
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,775 --> 01:06:04,735
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,985 --> 01:06:09,835
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:10,085 --> 01:06:13,705
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:17,955
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,335 --> 01:06:24,085
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:27,215
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:29,215
Somehow...

813
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:31,965
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:34,805
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:35,105 --> 01:06:38,435
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,685 --> 01:06:40,265
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,525 --> 01:06:43,705
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:45,705
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:47,815
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:48,155 --> 01:06:51,235
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,235 --> 01:06:52,735
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,735 --> 01:06:55,565
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:59,565
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,575 --> 01:07:01,915
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,255 --> 01:07:04,465
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,475 --> 01:07:05,505
That's right!

827
01:07:05,505 --> 01:07:06,415
Understood!

828
01:07:06,975 --> 01:07:08,555
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,805 --> 01:07:10,055
Forward!

830
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:23,565
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,935 --> 01:07:28,905
All right!

832
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,365
Inosuke!

833
01:07:38,005 --> 01:07:40,615
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,955 --> 01:07:43,005
Especially around here!

835
01:07:43,005 --> 01:07:44,365
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,365
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,365
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,705 --> 01:07:49,865
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,255 --> 01:07:51,635
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,885 --> 01:07:57,765
Gross!

841
01:07:58,185 --> 01:08:00,105
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,385 --> 01:08:04,015
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:05,555
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:11,315
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:12,815
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:22,455
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,455 --> 01:08:24,955
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,955 --> 01:08:25,965
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:29,915
It's here...

850
01:08:31,085 --> 01:08:32,385
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,915 --> 01:08:34,555
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,555 --> 01:08:36,305
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:44,935
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:48,065
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:51,185
Slice!

856
01:08:57,735 --> 01:08:58,685
It's the bone.

857
01:08:59,105 --> 01:09:00,585
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:04,035
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:05,365
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,205
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,305 --> 01:09:28,935
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,475 --> 01:09:31,215
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,525 --> 01:09:35,905
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,235 --> 01:09:37,985
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:41,815
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,205 --> 01:09:46,565
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,575 --> 01:09:49,285
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,555 --> 01:09:50,815
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:51,965
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,585 --> 01:09:54,885
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,335 --> 01:10:02,255
DREAM

872
01:10:02,805 --> 01:10:07,005
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,305 --> 01:10:08,515
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:12,185
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:16,565
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,935
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,735 --> 01:10:23,765
It's all right!

878
01:10:24,105 --> 01:10:26,165
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:27,085 --> 01:10:32,165
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:35,375
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:45,885
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:46,185 --> 01:10:48,715
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,725 --> 01:10:50,515
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,525 --> 01:10:53,305
No good!

885
01:10:53,635 --> 01:10:54,635
Wake up!

886
01:10:55,025 --> 01:10:56,385
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,635 --> 01:10:57,385
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,805 --> 01:10:58,885
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,275 --> 01:11:00,905
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:02,985
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,955 --> 01:11:06,155
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,815
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:17,055
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,385 --> 01:11:19,585
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:27,085
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,425 --> 01:11:30,255
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:33,385
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,725 --> 01:11:38,435
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,735 --> 01:11:42,515
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,985 --> 01:11:47,935
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,275 --> 01:11:51,335
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,375 --> 01:11:59,865
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,255
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,505 --> 01:12:05,705
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:06,035 --> 01:12:08,205
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:13,055
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,385 --> 01:12:15,515
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,825 --> 01:12:33,705
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,325 --> 01:12:35,865
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:37,735
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:38,075 --> 01:12:39,615
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:15,185 --> 01:13:17,585
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,085
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,925 --> 01:13:24,585
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,675 --> 01:13:29,285
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:33,185 --> 01:13:35,635
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:36,185 --> 01:13:39,215
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:40,135 --> 01:13:41,265
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:43,385
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,275 --> 01:13:47,055
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:12,085 --> 01:14:13,505
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:16,415
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:17,755
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,755 --> 01:14:20,385
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,305 --> 01:14:23,465
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,255 --> 01:14:28,015
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:29,435
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,325 --> 01:14:34,235
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:01,135 --> 01:15:03,435
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,555 --> 01:15:07,435
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,435 --> 01:15:10,385
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,725 --> 01:15:12,305
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,635 --> 01:15:14,215
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,475 --> 01:15:16,265
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:17,615
I'm...

936
01:15:17,955 --> 01:15:19,565
all right.

937
01:15:19,985 --> 01:15:21,315
What about you?

938
01:15:21,575 --> 01:15:24,735
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:28,315
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,575 --> 01:15:32,235
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,585 --> 01:15:35,665
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,805 --> 01:15:40,305
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,635 --> 01:15:44,805
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,385 --> 01:15:47,255
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:49,885
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,885 --> 01:15:53,315
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,605 --> 01:15:56,015
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:56,025 --> 01:15:57,485
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,905 --> 01:16:01,605
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:02,105 --> 01:16:04,065
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:06,105 --> 01:16:07,315
Please.

952
01:16:14,785 --> 01:16:16,255
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,915
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,255 --> 01:16:20,165
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:24,585
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:28,515
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,975 --> 01:16:35,105
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,515
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:40,765
We have to...

960
01:16:41,385 --> 01:16:42,785
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,405 --> 01:16:44,905
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,675 --> 01:17:05,635
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,975 --> 01:17:07,755
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:11,835
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:12,175 --> 01:17:13,015
Me?

966
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:14,635
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,975 --> 01:17:18,655
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:19,105 --> 01:17:22,155
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:22,155 --> 01:17:27,655
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,905 --> 01:17:30,655
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,905 --> 01:17:34,205
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:36,165
It was him!

973
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:38,285
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,675 --> 01:17:44,115
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:45,585
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:46,005 --> 01:17:48,415
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,835 --> 01:17:51,765
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:55,215
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,225 --> 01:17:59,765
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,135
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:05,435
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,805 --> 01:18:09,455
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,235
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,535 --> 01:18:15,985
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:18,735
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:22,565
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:23,075 --> 01:18:25,485
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:29,335
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,335 --> 01:18:33,555
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,555 --> 01:18:35,755
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,305 --> 01:18:38,835
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:39,175 --> 01:18:41,135
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,755 --> 01:18:46,515
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,905 --> 01:18:52,515
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,935 --> 01:18:54,185
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:54,185 --> 01:18:57,905
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:02,865
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,865
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:11,755
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,755 --> 01:19:16,935
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,935 --> 01:19:22,605
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,885 --> 01:19:32,435
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,775 --> 01:19:34,405
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,535 --> 01:19:37,065
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,655 --> 01:19:40,535
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,785 --> 01:19:43,905
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,565
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,455
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:53,255
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:56,755
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,475 --> 01:19:58,755
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:59,175 --> 01:20:00,805
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,755 --> 01:20:06,135
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:27,865
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,455 --> 01:20:39,865
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:43,805
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,475 --> 01:20:46,465
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,275 --> 01:20:53,635
Right.

1019
01:20:55,525 --> 01:20:56,785
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,985
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:01,035 --> 01:21:04,815
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,235 --> 01:21:10,735
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,355 --> 01:21:43,015
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,735 --> 01:21:45,735
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,665
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,775 --> 01:22:16,435
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:20,215
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:22,935
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,685
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,535 --> 01:22:29,235
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:34,565
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:37,155
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:41,565
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:45,965
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,305 --> 01:22:48,915
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:53,505
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,975 --> 01:22:57,755
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,085 --> 01:23:00,605
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,105
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,775 --> 01:23:05,935
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,935 --> 01:23:07,565
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,855 --> 01:23:10,355
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,015
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:17,205
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,755 --> 01:23:19,665
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:20,005 --> 01:23:21,005
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:26,165
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,505 --> 01:23:28,005
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,535 --> 01:23:31,285
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:33,005 --> 01:23:35,435
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,275 --> 01:23:40,855
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,855 --> 01:23:42,435
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:44,025 --> 01:23:48,935
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:51,205
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:58,655
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,955 --> 01:24:02,205
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:05,705
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,985 --> 01:24:11,805
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:17,965
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,425 --> 01:24:21,085
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,385 --> 01:24:23,135
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,135 --> 01:24:26,405
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,075 --> 01:24:30,985
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,825 --> 01:24:37,485
I see.

1065
01:24:39,435 --> 01:24:41,265
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,085 --> 01:24:45,335
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,905 --> 01:25:19,565
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,575 --> 01:25:23,485
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,205 --> 01:25:27,235
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,725 --> 01:25:33,565
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:37,885
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,475 --> 01:25:41,805
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:51,185
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,185 --> 01:25:53,515
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,325 --> 01:25:56,265
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,525 --> 01:25:58,355
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:01,025 --> 01:26:02,265
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:04,855
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,175 --> 01:26:19,115
I see.

1080
01:26:21,455 --> 01:26:23,165
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:24,665
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,675 --> 01:26:26,765
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:32,105
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,355 --> 01:26:37,635
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,655 --> 01:26:48,535
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,535 --> 01:26:49,785
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,205 --> 01:26:56,485
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,575 --> 01:27:00,135
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,975 --> 01:27:06,085
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,385 --> 01:27:07,665
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,675 --> 01:27:09,165
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:10,585
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,885 --> 01:27:13,055
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,635 --> 01:27:16,055
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,325 --> 01:27:18,355
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:19,935
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,155 --> 01:27:23,315
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,735 --> 01:27:25,185
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,525 --> 01:27:30,185
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,505 --> 01:27:43,955
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:51,435
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,435 --> 01:27:52,805
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:59,055
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:07,185
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,075 --> 01:28:13,535
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,455 --> 01:28:16,785
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,485
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,075 --> 01:28:26,255
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,585 --> 01:28:33,165
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,175 --> 01:28:38,085
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,925 --> 01:28:41,135
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,135 --> 01:28:42,235
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,735 --> 01:28:52,185
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,525 --> 01:28:53,685
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:54,025 --> 01:28:56,565
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,575 --> 01:28:59,335
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:03,705
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:04,035 --> 01:29:05,705
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,955 --> 01:29:09,615
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,455 --> 01:29:14,085
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,435 --> 01:29:20,135
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,475 --> 01:29:25,805
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,285 --> 01:29:36,865
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,155
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,785
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,155 --> 01:29:45,485
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,475 --> 01:29:52,465
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,985 --> 01:30:15,185
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,435 --> 01:30:16,905
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:19,405
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,655 --> 01:30:21,735
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,935 --> 01:30:25,865
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:28,455
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:30,165
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,675 --> 01:30:35,255
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:40,865
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,555 --> 01:30:59,985
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,725 --> 01:31:30,055
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,605 --> 01:31:38,105
No way!

1140
01:31:45,655 --> 01:31:48,105
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,905 --> 01:31:51,285
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,605 --> 01:32:11,055
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,435 --> 01:32:14,965
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,855 --> 01:32:26,205
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,325 --> 01:32:33,655
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,905 --> 01:32:35,985
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,985 --> 01:32:40,955
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,165
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,305
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,635 --> 01:32:50,055
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,305 --> 01:32:54,255
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,675 --> 01:32:58,755
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,485 --> 01:33:03,935
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,275 --> 01:33:06,355
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,355 --> 01:33:09,405
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,925 --> 01:33:25,115
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,535 --> 01:33:32,115
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:35,765
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,255 --> 01:33:40,605
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,855 --> 01:33:42,015
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,805 --> 01:33:52,205
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,205 --> 01:33:55,115
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,115
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,375 --> 01:34:00,115
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,485 --> 01:34:06,115
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:09,385
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,725 --> 01:34:11,215
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,225 --> 01:34:13,965
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,925 --> 01:34:21,135
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,885 --> 01:34:23,585
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,835 --> 01:34:25,105
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,405 --> 01:34:26,735
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,785 --> 01:34:45,115
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:19,535
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:26,285
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,735 --> 01:35:29,955
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,205 --> 01:35:31,035
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:32,405
goku...

1179
01:35:46,835 --> 01:35:48,385
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,385 --> 01:35:50,385
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,385 --> 01:35:51,655
You are...

1182
01:35:52,025 --> 01:35:55,015
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:08,005 --> 01:36:09,165
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,175 --> 01:36:10,915
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,955 --> 01:36:13,955
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,285 --> 01:36:16,585
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:22,535
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,525 --> 01:36:27,805
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,555 --> 01:36:31,305
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,775 --> 01:36:37,885
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,885 --> 01:36:43,815
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,705 --> 01:36:52,565
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,655 --> 01:36:58,785
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,505 --> 01:37:03,805
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:08,305
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,305 --> 01:37:09,835
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,435 --> 01:37:30,405
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,425 --> 01:37:36,115
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:39,955
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,105 --> 01:37:54,265
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,605 --> 01:37:59,685
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,705 --> 01:38:08,815
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,235 --> 01:38:11,615
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:14,815
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,485 --> 01:38:17,955
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,235 --> 01:38:19,785
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,455 --> 01:38:23,115
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,405 --> 01:38:25,415
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,425 --> 01:38:26,715
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,055 --> 01:38:31,165
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,055 --> 01:38:41,255
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,825 --> 01:38:43,985
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,325 --> 01:38:45,685
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,525 --> 01:38:49,655
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,985 --> 01:38:51,185
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,985 --> 01:38:58,485
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,825 --> 01:39:02,005
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,505 --> 01:39:16,515
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,185 --> 01:39:28,105
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,805 --> 01:39:31,765
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:37,865
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,325 --> 01:39:39,905
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,305 --> 01:40:01,415
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,605 --> 01:40:13,185
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,435 --> 01:40:24,065
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,675 --> 01:40:26,505
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,505 --> 01:40:28,615
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,955 --> 01:40:34,255
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,255 --> 01:40:36,865
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:39,535
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,135 --> 01:40:45,385
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,685 --> 01:40:49,055
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,605 --> 01:40:53,305
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,685 --> 01:40:57,865
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,875 --> 01:40:59,985
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,285 --> 01:41:02,405
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,655 --> 01:41:05,235
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,235 --> 01:41:08,065
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,535 --> 01:41:09,755
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,075 --> 01:41:11,815
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,075 --> 01:41:16,415
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,425 --> 01:41:18,135
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,385 --> 01:41:20,055
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:22,335
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,335 --> 01:41:25,965
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,975 --> 01:41:28,085
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,085 --> 01:41:31,915
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,585 --> 01:42:08,855
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,635 --> 01:42:16,515
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,185 --> 01:42:19,215
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,435 --> 01:42:22,605
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,055 --> 01:42:25,235
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,205 --> 01:42:28,705
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,985 --> 01:42:31,405
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,825 --> 01:42:34,235
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,255 --> 01:42:54,255
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,805 --> 01:42:58,135
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,275 --> 01:43:00,985
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,605 --> 01:43:04,235
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:08,685
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,485 --> 01:43:12,655
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,525 --> 01:43:17,115
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,085 --> 01:43:27,085
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,505 --> 01:43:32,085
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,085 --> 01:43:34,465
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,475 --> 01:43:36,765
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,725 --> 01:43:41,385
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,355 --> 01:43:47,055
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,885 --> 01:43:51,065
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:53,735
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,285 --> 01:43:58,485
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,155 --> 01:44:02,485
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:06,035
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,175 --> 01:44:09,305
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,475 --> 01:44:11,585
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,175 --> 01:44:16,585
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,555 --> 01:44:20,135
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,505 --> 01:44:27,815
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,825 --> 01:44:32,605
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,985 --> 01:44:36,735
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,575 --> 01:44:39,815
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,835 --> 01:44:50,335
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,755 --> 01:44:53,415
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,505 --> 01:44:58,835
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,305 --> 01:45:03,385
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,385 --> 01:45:06,355
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,355 --> 01:45:10,305
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,935 --> 01:45:14,605
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:16,655
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,985 --> 01:45:19,865
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,405 --> 01:45:24,405
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,235 --> 01:45:27,365
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,675 --> 01:45:29,985
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,655 --> 01:45:33,255
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,255 --> 01:45:35,555
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,175 --> 01:45:39,165
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,975 --> 01:45:41,335
And then,

1298
01:45:41,975 --> 01:45:45,335
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,835 --> 01:45:48,165
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,305 --> 01:45:51,735
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,535 --> 01:46:18,955
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,585 --> 01:46:25,805
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,105 --> 01:46:31,605
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,225 --> 01:46:34,015
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,405 --> 01:46:45,815
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,235 --> 01:47:24,485
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:27,565
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,185 --> 01:47:32,485
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,425 --> 01:47:36,035
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:39,835
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,455 --> 01:47:43,115
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,425 --> 01:47:44,335
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,175 --> 01:47:47,505
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,175 --> 01:47:51,185
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,605 --> 01:47:52,765
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,185 --> 01:47:57,355
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,685 --> 01:48:01,435
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,385 --> 01:48:06,885
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,455 --> 01:48:13,365
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,235 --> 01:48:16,865
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,235 --> 01:48:21,815
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,735 --> 01:48:24,135
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,925 --> 01:48:31,165
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,425 --> 01:48:43,935
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:49,935
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,935 --> 01:48:55,185
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,185 --> 01:48:58,955
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,255 --> 01:49:02,455
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,755 --> 01:49:05,205
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,555 --> 01:49:08,835
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,835 --> 01:49:11,205
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,455 --> 01:49:13,085
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,675 --> 01:49:16,855
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,725 --> 01:49:19,855
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,385 --> 01:49:33,115
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,155 --> 01:50:18,815
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,185 --> 01:50:21,155
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:45,805
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,975 --> 01:50:52,805
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,785 --> 01:51:01,905
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,285 --> 01:51:12,905
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,725 --> 01:51:22,005
I see.

1343
01:51:31,525 --> 01:51:36,365
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:37,025 --> 01:51:39,355
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:41,565
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,985 --> 01:51:44,905
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,325 --> 01:51:48,235
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:51,035 --> 01:51:54,415
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,835 --> 01:51:57,615
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,475 --> 01:52:18,715
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,655 --> 01:52:33,115
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:39,285
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,325 --> 01:52:45,665
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,675 --> 01:52:50,885
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,885 --> 01:52:56,825
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,825 --> 01:53:03,935
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:11,025 --> 01:53:16,755
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,755 --> 01:53:23,675
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,675 --> 01:53:29,565
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,565 --> 01:53:37,055
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,055 --> 01:53:42,635
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,635 --> 01:53:51,235
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,485 --> 01:54:07,485
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,855 --> 01:54:14,225
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,225 --> 01:54:20,475
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,475 --> 01:54:25,655
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,655 --> 01:54:31,605
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,605 --> 01:54:38,655
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,355 --> 01:54:45,755
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,755 --> 01:54:52,335
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,725 --> 01:55:10,635
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,975 --> 01:55:31,255
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,975 --> 01:55:48,685
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,685 --> 01:55:54,655
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,655 --> 01:56:02,155
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,155 --> 01:56:07,305
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,425 --> 01:56:14,005
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,735 --> 01:56:19,885
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,885 --> 01:56:31,755
Until I reach that distant future
now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,865 --> 01:22:45,955
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,905
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,495
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,965 --> 01:22:57,745
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,075 --> 01:23:00,595
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,925 --> 01:23:02,095
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,765 --> 01:23:05,925
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,925 --> 01:23:07,555
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,845 --> 01:23:10,345
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:13,005
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,395 --> 01:23:17,195
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,745 --> 01:23:19,655
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:20,995
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,445 --> 01:23:26,155
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,495 --> 01:23:27,995
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:31,275
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:32,995 --> 01:23:35,425
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,265 --> 01:23:40,845
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,845 --> 01:23:42,425
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:44,015 --> 01:23:48,925
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,265 --> 01:23:51,195
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,225 --> 01:23:58,645
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,945 --> 01:24:02,195
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,195 --> 01:24:05,695
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:11,795
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:17,955
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,415 --> 01:24:21,075
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,125
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:26,395
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,065 --> 01:24:30,975
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,815 --> 01:24:37,475
I see.

1065
01:24:39,425 --> 01:24:41,255
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,075 --> 01:24:45,325
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,895 --> 01:25:19,555
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,565 --> 01:25:23,475
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,195 --> 01:25:27,225
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:33,555
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,565 --> 01:25:37,875
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,465 --> 01:25:41,795
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,915 --> 01:25:51,175
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,175 --> 01:25:53,505
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,255
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,515 --> 01:25:58,345
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:01,015 --> 01:26:02,255
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,515 --> 01:26:04,845
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,165 --> 01:26:19,105
I see.

1080
01:26:21,445 --> 01:26:23,155
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,365 --> 01:26:24,655
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,665 --> 01:26:26,755
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,965 --> 01:26:32,095
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,345 --> 01:26:37,625
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:48,525
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,525 --> 01:26:49,775
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,195 --> 01:26:56,475
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,565 --> 01:27:00,125
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,965 --> 01:27:06,075
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:07,655
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,665 --> 01:27:09,155
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,415 --> 01:27:10,575
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:13,045
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:16,045
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,345
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,765 --> 01:27:19,925
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:23,305
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,725 --> 01:27:25,175
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,515 --> 01:27:30,175
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:43,945
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,115 --> 01:27:51,425
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,425 --> 01:27:52,795
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,345 --> 01:27:59,045
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,845 --> 01:28:07,175
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,065 --> 01:28:13,525
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,445 --> 01:28:16,775
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,115 --> 01:28:20,475
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:26,245
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,575 --> 01:28:33,155
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,165 --> 01:28:38,075
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:41,125
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:42,225
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,175
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,515 --> 01:28:53,675
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:54,015 --> 01:28:56,555
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,565 --> 01:28:59,325
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,575 --> 01:29:03,695
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:04,025 --> 01:29:05,695
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,945 --> 01:29:09,605
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,445 --> 01:29:14,075
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:20,125
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,465 --> 01:29:25,795
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,275 --> 01:29:36,855
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,115 --> 01:29:38,145
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,615 --> 01:29:42,775
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:45,475
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,465 --> 01:29:52,455
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,175
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,425 --> 01:30:16,895
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,315 --> 01:30:19,395
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,645 --> 01:30:21,725
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,925 --> 01:30:25,855
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,115 --> 01:30:28,445
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,165 --> 01:30:30,155
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,665 --> 01:30:35,245
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,115 --> 01:30:40,855
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,545 --> 01:30:59,975
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,715 --> 01:31:30,045
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,595 --> 01:31:38,095
No way!

1140
01:31:45,645 --> 01:31:48,095
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,895 --> 01:31:51,275
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,595 --> 01:32:11,045
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,425 --> 01:32:14,955
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,845 --> 01:32:26,195
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,315 --> 01:32:33,645
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,895 --> 01:32:35,975
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,975 --> 01:32:40,945
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,945 --> 01:32:43,155
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,465 --> 01:32:46,295
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:50,045
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,295 --> 01:32:54,245
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,665 --> 01:32:58,745
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,925
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,265 --> 01:33:06,345
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,345 --> 01:33:09,395
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,915 --> 01:33:25,105
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,525 --> 01:33:32,105
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,365 --> 01:33:35,755
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:40,595
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,845 --> 01:33:42,005
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,795 --> 01:33:52,195
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,195 --> 01:33:55,105
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,115 --> 01:33:57,105
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,365 --> 01:34:00,105
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,475 --> 01:34:06,105
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,365 --> 01:34:09,375
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,715 --> 01:34:11,205
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,215 --> 01:34:13,955
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,915 --> 01:34:21,125
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:23,575
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:25,095
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,395 --> 01:34:26,725
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,775 --> 01:34:45,105
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,365 --> 01:35:19,525
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,775 --> 01:35:26,275
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,725 --> 01:35:29,945
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,195 --> 01:35:31,025
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,365 --> 01:35:32,395
goku...

1179
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:48,375
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,375
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:51,645
You are...

1182
01:35:52,015 --> 01:35:55,005
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:07,995 --> 01:36:09,155
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,165 --> 01:36:10,905
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,945 --> 01:36:13,945
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,275 --> 01:36:16,575
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,275 --> 01:36:22,525
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,515 --> 01:36:27,795
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,545 --> 01:36:31,295
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,765 --> 01:36:37,875
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:43,805
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,695 --> 01:36:52,555
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,645 --> 01:36:58,775
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,495 --> 01:37:03,795
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:08,295
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,295 --> 01:37:09,825
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,425 --> 01:37:30,395
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,415 --> 01:37:36,105
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,115 --> 01:37:39,945
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,095 --> 01:37:54,255
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,595 --> 01:37:59,675
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,695 --> 01:38:08,805
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,225 --> 01:38:11,605
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,615 --> 01:38:14,805
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:17,945
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:19,775
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,445 --> 01:38:23,105
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,395 --> 01:38:25,405
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,415 --> 01:38:26,705
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,045 --> 01:38:31,155
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,045 --> 01:38:41,245
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,815 --> 01:38:43,975
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,315 --> 01:38:45,675
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,515 --> 01:38:49,645
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,975 --> 01:38:51,175
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,975 --> 01:38:58,475
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,815 --> 01:39:01,995
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,495 --> 01:39:16,505
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,175 --> 01:39:28,095
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,795 --> 01:39:31,755
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:37,855
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,315 --> 01:39:39,895
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,295 --> 01:40:01,405
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,595 --> 01:40:13,175
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,425 --> 01:40:24,055
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:26,495
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,495 --> 01:40:28,605
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,945 --> 01:40:34,245
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,245 --> 01:40:36,855
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,865 --> 01:40:39,525
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:45,375
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,675 --> 01:40:49,045
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,595 --> 01:40:53,295
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,675 --> 01:40:57,855
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,865 --> 01:40:59,975
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,275 --> 01:41:02,395
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,645 --> 01:41:05,225
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,225 --> 01:41:08,055
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,525 --> 01:41:09,745
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:11,805
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,065 --> 01:41:16,405
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,415 --> 01:41:18,125
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,375 --> 01:41:20,045
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,295 --> 01:41:22,325
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,325 --> 01:41:25,955
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,965 --> 01:41:28,075
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,075 --> 01:41:31,905
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,575 --> 01:42:08,845
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:16,505
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,175 --> 01:42:19,205
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,425 --> 01:42:22,595
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,045 --> 01:42:25,225
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,195 --> 01:42:28,695
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,975 --> 01:42:31,395
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,815 --> 01:42:34,225
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,245 --> 01:42:54,245
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,795 --> 01:42:58,125
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,265 --> 01:43:00,975
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,595 --> 01:43:04,225
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,175 --> 01:43:08,675
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:12,645
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,515 --> 01:43:17,105
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,075 --> 01:43:27,075
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,495 --> 01:43:32,075
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,075 --> 01:43:34,455
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,465 --> 01:43:36,755
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,715 --> 01:43:41,375
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,345 --> 01:43:47,045
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,875 --> 01:43:51,055
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,815 --> 01:43:53,725
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,275 --> 01:43:58,475
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,145 --> 01:44:02,475
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,365 --> 01:44:06,025
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,165 --> 01:44:09,295
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,465 --> 01:44:11,575
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,575
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,545 --> 01:44:20,125
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,495 --> 01:44:27,805
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,815 --> 01:44:32,595
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,975 --> 01:44:36,725
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,565 --> 01:44:39,805
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,825 --> 01:44:50,325
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,745 --> 01:44:53,405
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,495 --> 01:44:58,825
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,295 --> 01:45:03,375
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:06,345
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,345 --> 01:45:10,295
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,925 --> 01:45:14,595
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,215 --> 01:45:16,645
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,975 --> 01:45:19,855
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,395 --> 01:45:24,395
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,225 --> 01:45:27,355
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,665 --> 01:45:29,975
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,645 --> 01:45:33,245
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,245 --> 01:45:35,545
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,165 --> 01:45:39,155
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,965 --> 01:45:41,325
And then,

1298
01:45:41,965 --> 01:45:45,325
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,825 --> 01:45:48,155
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,295 --> 01:45:51,725
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,525 --> 01:46:18,945
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,575 --> 01:46:25,795
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,095 --> 01:46:31,595
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,215 --> 01:46:34,005
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,395 --> 01:46:45,805
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,225 --> 01:47:24,475
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,895 --> 01:47:27,555
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:32,475
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,415 --> 01:47:36,025
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,525 --> 01:47:39,825
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,445 --> 01:47:43,105
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,415 --> 01:47:44,325
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,165 --> 01:47:47,495
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,165 --> 01:47:51,175
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,595 --> 01:47:52,755
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,175 --> 01:47:57,345
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,675 --> 01:48:01,425
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:06,875
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,445 --> 01:48:13,355
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,225 --> 01:48:16,855
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:21,805
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,725 --> 01:48:24,125
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,915 --> 01:48:31,155
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,415 --> 01:48:43,925
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,675 --> 01:48:49,925
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,925 --> 01:48:55,175
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,175 --> 01:48:58,945
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,245 --> 01:49:02,445
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,745 --> 01:49:05,195
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,545 --> 01:49:08,825
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,825 --> 01:49:11,195
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,445 --> 01:49:13,075
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,665 --> 01:49:16,845
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,715 --> 01:49:19,845
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,375 --> 01:49:33,105
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,145 --> 01:50:18,805
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,175 --> 01:50:21,145
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,125 --> 01:50:45,795
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,965 --> 01:50:52,795
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,775 --> 01:51:01,895
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,275 --> 01:51:12,895
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,715 --> 01:51:21,995
I see.

1343
01:51:31,515 --> 01:51:36,355
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:37,015 --> 01:51:39,345
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,725 --> 01:51:41,555
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,975 --> 01:51:44,895
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,315 --> 01:51:48,225
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:51,025 --> 01:51:54,405
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,825 --> 01:51:57,605
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,465 --> 01:52:18,705
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,645 --> 01:52:33,105
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,115 --> 01:52:39,275
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,315 --> 01:52:45,655
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,665 --> 01:52:50,875
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,875 --> 01:52:56,815
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,815 --> 01:53:03,925
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:11,015 --> 01:53:16,745
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,745 --> 01:53:23,665
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,665 --> 01:53:29,555
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,555 --> 01:53:37,045
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,045 --> 01:53:42,625
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,625 --> 01:53:51,225
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,475 --> 01:54:07,475
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,845 --> 01:54:14,215
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,215 --> 01:54:20,465
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,465 --> 01:54:25,645
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,645 --> 01:54:31,595
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,595 --> 01:54:38,645
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,345 --> 01:54:45,745
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,745 --> 01:54:52,325
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,715 --> 01:55:10,625
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,965 --> 01:55:31,245
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,965 --> 01:55:48,675
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,675 --> 01:55:54,645
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,645 --> 01:56:02,145
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,145 --> 01:56:07,295
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,415 --> 01:56:13,995
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,725 --> 01:56:19,875
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:31,745
Until I reach that distant future
