00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,070
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,860
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,770
Minoru...

4
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,990
Masao...

5
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,860
Susumu...

6
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,160
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,270
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,410
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,290
Isao...

10
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,460
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,210
Yukio...

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,920
Takahiro...

13
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,860
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,440
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,720
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,740
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,120
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,170
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,840
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,670
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,160
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,720
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,840
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,560
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,340
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,320
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,520
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,160
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,360
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,410
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,860
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,190
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,290
So fast!

34
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,290
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,110
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,310
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,220
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,110
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,560
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,370
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,910
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,660
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,290
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,570
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,670
Sure,

46
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,720
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,970
Hey!

48
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,390
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,140
Delicious!

50
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:30,170
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,790
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,460
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,470
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,470
Delicious!

55
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,060
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,560
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,140
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,560
Delicious!

59
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,820
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,070
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,320
Delicious!

62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,620
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,840
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,710
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,320
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,790
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,090
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,920
Delicious!

69
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,560
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,390
Delicious!

71
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,640
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,410
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,490
Yes.

74
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,270
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,160
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,190
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,410
Yes.

78
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,510
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,170
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,590
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,840
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,610
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,270
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,940
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,770
A mission?

86
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,210
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,790
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,410
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,540
Right.

90
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,570
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,760
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,720
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,420
About my father...

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,470
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,170
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,510
Was he really?

97
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,990
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,690
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,990
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,410
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,410
What's up?

102
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,520
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,070
Dance!

104
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,940
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,870
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,710
Right!

108
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,120
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,360
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,970
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,360
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,440
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,270
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,960
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,910
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,490
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,120
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,570
Flame.

119
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,870
Water.

120
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,160
Wind.

121
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,470
Stone.

122
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,590
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,220
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,470
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,340
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,470
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,610
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,110
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,160
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,160
For real?

131
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,810
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,170
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,120
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,920
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,420
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,870
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,770
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,220
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,690
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,390
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,290
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,210
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,960
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,460
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,220
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,390
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,060
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,810
Nooo!

149
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,090
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,660
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,570
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,660
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,760
May I...

155
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,340
see your...

156
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,210
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,620
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,060
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,440
Here.

160
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,920
What is this?

161
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,340
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,590
Thank you...

163
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,760
very much.

164
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,360
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,490
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,990
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,840
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,310
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,770
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,720
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,960
First Form...

173
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,590
Amazing.

174
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,090
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,090
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,770
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,070
All right!

178
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,020
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,510
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,440
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,360
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,860
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,940
All right!

184
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,270
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,310
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,870
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,340
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,760
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,760
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,860
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,860
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,040
Tha...

193
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,040
Tha...

194
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,970
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,810
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,610
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,610
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,140
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,060
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,560
Bro!

201
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,620
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,490
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,860
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,790
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,260
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,920
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,210
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,120
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,610
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,810
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,110
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,290
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,290
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,960
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:37,090
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,560
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,060
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,970
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,490
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,660
Okay.

222
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,710
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,340
Calm down.

224
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,220
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,670
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,070
Hey!

227
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,070
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,240
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,160
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,840
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,940
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,410
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,960
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,320
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,620
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,140
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,510
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,810
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:45,020
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,240
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,570
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,920
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,840
while you count.

244
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,840
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,620
One...

246
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,010
Two...

247
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,690
Three...

248
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,610
Four...

249
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Five...

250
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,440
Six...

251
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,890
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,790
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,910
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,240
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,820
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm all right.

257
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,340
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,890
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,560
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,720
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,720
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,520
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,490
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,860
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,620
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,040
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,620
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,370
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,890
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,140
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,140
They can...

273
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,240
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,910
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,490
This way!

276
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,620
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,060
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,140
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,560
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,220
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,890
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,260
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,570
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,820
River?

285
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,070
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,820
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,840
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,840
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,340
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,840
Let's go!

291
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,940
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,810
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,720
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,560
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,070
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,870
Boss!

297
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,120
Boss!

298
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,870
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,540
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,040
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,560
Here he is!

302
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,140
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,010
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,590
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,940
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,270
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,040
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,270
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,770
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,190
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,370
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,170
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,840
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,840
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,140
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,340
nor I.

317
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,770
Brother...

318
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,820
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:42,070
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,120
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,710
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,590
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,920
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,290
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,770
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,810
Why?

327
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,770
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,040
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,870
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,290
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,890
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,340
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,010
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,260
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,510
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,520
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,520
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,270
You're not like me.

339
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,740
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,770
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,620
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,260
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,460
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,760
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,470
Looking good.

347
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,940
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,360
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,690
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,040
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,410
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,970
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,090
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,760
Like this?

355
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,060
That's right.

356
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,970
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,020
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,610
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,520
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,740
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,910
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,840
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,760
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,510
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,020
There it is!

366
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,520
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,860
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,660
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,740
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,470
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,010
It's burning up.

372
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,310
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,860
Found it!

374
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,910
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,160
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,420
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,210
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:32,140
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,990
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,070
Wow!

381
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,470
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,890
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,670
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,140
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,090
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,110
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,660
Okay!

388
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,990
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,690
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,160
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,770
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,440
No fair!

393
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,870
There.

394
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,090
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,440
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,610
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,220
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,410
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,040
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,160
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,160
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,570
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,510
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,920
Well...

405
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,390
Um...

406
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,590
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,670
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,510
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,060
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,940
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,940
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,520
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,370
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,510
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,210
Wake up!

416
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,710
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,810
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,640
You're under attack!

419
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,890
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,390
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,890
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,060
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,910
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,410
Fight!

425
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,290
Fight!

426
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,820
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,410
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,010
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,420
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,260
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,510
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,840
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,010
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,020
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,590
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,790
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,910
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,760
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,010
Nezuko!

440
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,890
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,340
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,560
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,170
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,860
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,740
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,910
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,110
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,160
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,860
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,690
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,710
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,120
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,870
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,090
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,060
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,110
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,640
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,710
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,710
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,040
Mom?

461
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,820
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,170
Big Bro...

463
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,720
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,770
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,570
forever.

466
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,960
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,460
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,370
Right here.

469
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,620
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,760
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,140
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,390
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,890
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,410
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,320
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,740
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,060
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,260
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,170
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,190
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,610
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,240
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,860
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,340
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,920
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,790
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,270
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,660
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,390
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,390
So, please...

491
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,890
forgive me!

492
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,570
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,310
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,810
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,320
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,110
and...

497
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,110
also warm.

498
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,340
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,370
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,620
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,210
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,970
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,640
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,410
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,160
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,910
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,090
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,170
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,890
What was that?

510
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,110
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,860
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,270
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,120
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,120
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,790
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,120
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,020
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,140
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,390
Oh well...

520
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,890
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,910
Not here.

522
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,620
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,490
What's this, though?

524
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,910
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,660
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,910
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,960
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,420
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,670
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,590
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,560
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,060
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,440
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,660
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,320
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,620
There's something...

537
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,010
I must cut.

538
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,590
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,620
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,720
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,520
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,770
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,770
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,770
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,410
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,370
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,990
In other words...

548
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,660
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,120
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,260
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,820
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,360
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,440
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,240
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,170
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,340
Who are these people?

557
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,840
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,520
Rope...

559
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,170
What's this?

560
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,890
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,360
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,360
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,520
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,560
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,660
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,570
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:02,120
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,070
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,010
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,810
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,170
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,160
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,410
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,270
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,520
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,770
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,420
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,290
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,290
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,540
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,340
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:02,970
What are you doing?

583
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,970
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,770
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,860
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,040
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,410
This man, too?

588
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,460
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,320
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:34,390
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,590
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,220
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,060
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,720
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,720
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,740
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,820
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,910
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,410
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,610
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,990
I was willing...

602
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:55,210
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,210
But it was warm...

604
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,970
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,970
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,740
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,740
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,870
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,210
No way!

610
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,540
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,840
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,890
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,970
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,720
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,110
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,210
Right!

617
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,620
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,420
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,670
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,670
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,670
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,310
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,170
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,020
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,410
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,190
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,320
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,320
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,490
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,590
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,420
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,510
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,010
It was him!

634
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,940
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,940
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,940
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,720
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,370
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,160
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,410
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,670
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:02,670
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,190
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:19,440
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,940
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,960
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:31,170
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:37,710
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,010
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,810
And yet...

651
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,860
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,720
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,390 --> 00:53:01,160
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,790
is so enormous!

655
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,990
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,660
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,460
get away with this!

658
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,670
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:30,220
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,920
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:37,490
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,610
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:46,490
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,790
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,460
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,960
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,170
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,940
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,940
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:22,970
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,620
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,120
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,510
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:52,970
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,260
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,320
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,240
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:29,010
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,870
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,640
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,560
This brat...

682
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,470
is insane!

683
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,960
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,820
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,590
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,170
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,590
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,320
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,690
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,460
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,840
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,790
insult...

693
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,920
my family!

694
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,620
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,210
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:30,570
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,570
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,170
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,340
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,840
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,170
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,940
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:56,110
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,520
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:06,270
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:10,870
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:15,340
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:21,370
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,870
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,890
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,390
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,270
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:44,410
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,960
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,160
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,290
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:58,210
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,670
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,220
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:11,420
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,740
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,440
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,160
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:35,370
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,010
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,920
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,760
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,390
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,720
All right!

730
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,940
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,140
Comin' through!

732
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,910
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,160
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,660
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,910
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,660
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,910
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:26,470
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,470
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,720
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,220
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:48,240
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,300
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,490
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,490
Glorify me!

746
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:59,820
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,590
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,670
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,190
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,460
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,320
First Form...

752
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,620
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
No good.

754
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,490
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,820
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:02,840
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,670
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,770
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,140
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,260
First Form...

761
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,360
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,610
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:41,360
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,610
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,860
Protect...

766
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,290
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,120
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,090
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,960
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,920
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,210
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,890
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:16,220
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,860
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,110
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,520
Damn!

777
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,390
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,210
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,710
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:40,290
How could this be?

781
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:43,220
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,060
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,720
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,890
What happened?

785
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,440
What was that?

786
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,070
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,860
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,860
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,590
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,210
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,790
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:23,710
Okay!

793
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,960
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,210
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:32,460
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:34,360
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,270
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:39,560
Head?

799
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,020
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:44,810
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:47,220
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,360
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,410
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,790
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,290
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,540
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:09,640
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:13,510
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,760
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,890
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,020
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,020
Somehow...

813
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:31,770
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:34,610
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:38,240
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,070
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,510
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,510
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,620
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,040
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,540
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,370
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:59,370
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,720
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,270
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,310
That's right!

827
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,220
Understood!

828
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,360
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,860
Forward!

830
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,370
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,710
All right!

832
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,170
Inosuke!

833
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:40,420
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,810
Especially around here!

835
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,170
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:46,170
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,170
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:49,670
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,440
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:57,570
Gross!

841
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,910
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:03,820
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:05,360
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:11,120
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,620
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,260
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,760
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,770
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,720
It's here...

850
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:32,190
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,360
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,110
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:44,740
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,870
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,990
Slice!

856
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,490
It's the bone.

857
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:00,390
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,840
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,170
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,010
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,740
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,020
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:35,710
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,790
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:41,620
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:46,370
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,090
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,620
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,770
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,690
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,060
DREAM

872
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:06,810
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,320
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,990
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:16,370
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,740
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,570
It's all right!

878
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,970
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:31,970
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,180
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:45,690
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,520
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,320
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,110
No good!

885
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,440
Wake up!

886
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,190
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,190
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:58,690
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,710
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,790
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,960
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,620
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,860
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,390
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,890
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:30,060
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,190
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:38,240
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:42,320
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:47,740
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,140
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,670
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,060
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:05,510
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,010
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:12,860
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:15,320
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:33,510
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,670
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,540
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,420
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,390
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,890
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,390
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,090
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:35,440
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:39,020
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,070
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:43,190
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,860
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,310
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:16,220
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:17,560
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,190
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,270
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,820
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,240
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,040
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,240
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,240
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,190
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,110
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,020
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,070
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:17,420
I'm...

936
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,370
all right.

937
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:21,120
What about you?

938
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:24,540
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:28,120
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,040
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,470
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:40,110
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,610
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,060
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,690
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:53,120
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,820
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:57,290
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:01,410
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:03,870
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,120
Please.

952
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,060
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,720
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,970
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:24,390
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:28,320
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,910
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,320
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,570
We have to...

960
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:42,590
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,710
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,440
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,560
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:11,640
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:12,820
Me?

966
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,440
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:18,460
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:21,960
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:27,460
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,460
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:34,010
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,970
It was him!

973
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:38,090
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:43,920
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,390
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:48,220
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,570
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:55,020
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:59,570
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,940
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:05,240
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:09,260
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,040
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:15,790
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,540
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:22,370
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,290
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,140
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:33,360
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,560
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:38,640
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,940
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:46,320
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:52,320
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:53,990
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:57,710
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:02,670
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,670
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:11,560
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,740
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:22,410
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:32,240
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,210
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,870
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:40,340
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:43,710
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,370
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:49,260
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,060
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:56,560
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,560
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:00,610
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,940
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,670
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,670
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:43,610
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,270
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,440
Right.

1019
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:56,590
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,790
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,620
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,540
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,820
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,540
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:00,470
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,240
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,020
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:22,740
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,490
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,040
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:34,370
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,960
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:41,370
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:45,770
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:48,720
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,310
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,560
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,410
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:01,910
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:05,740
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:07,370
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:10,160
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,820
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:17,010
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,470
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:20,810
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:25,970
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,810
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:31,090
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:35,240
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:40,660
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,240
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:48,740
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,010
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:58,460
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,010
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:05,510
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:11,610
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:17,770
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:20,890
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,940
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:26,210
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,790
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:37,290
I see.

1065
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,070
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:45,140
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:19,370
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:23,290
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:27,040
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:33,370
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:37,690
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:41,610
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:50,990
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:53,320
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:56,070
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:58,160
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:02,070
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:04,660
Air Type!

1079
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:18,920
I see.

1080
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,970
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:24,470
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,570
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,910
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,440
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:48,340
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:49,590
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,290
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,940
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:05,890
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:07,470
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,970
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,390
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,860
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,860
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,160
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:19,740
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,120
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:24,990
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:29,990
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:43,760
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,240
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,610
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,860
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:06,990
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,340
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,590
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:20,290
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,060
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:32,970
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,890
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:40,940
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,040
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,990
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:53,490
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:56,370
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:59,140
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:03,510
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,510
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,420
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,890
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,940
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:25,610
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:36,670
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:37,960
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:42,590
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,290
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,270
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:14,990
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,710
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:19,210
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,540
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,670
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:28,260
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:29,970
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,060
Disorder!

1136
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:40,670
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,790
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:29,860
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:37,910
No way!

1140
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:47,910
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:51,090
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:10,860
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,770
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:26,010
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:33,460
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:35,790
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:40,760
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,970
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,110
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,860
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:54,060
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,560
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:03,740
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,160
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,210
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,920
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,920
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,570
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:40,410
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:41,820
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:52,010
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:54,920
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,920
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,920
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:05,920
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:09,190
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:11,020
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:13,770
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:20,940
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:23,390
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,910
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:26,540
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:44,920
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:19,340
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:26,090
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,760
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:30,840
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:32,210
goku...

1179
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,190
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:50,190
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:51,460
You are...

1182
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,820
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:08,970
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,720
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,760
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:16,390
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:22,340
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:27,610
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,110
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:37,690
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:43,620
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:52,370
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:58,590
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:03,610
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:08,110
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:09,640
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:30,210
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:35,920
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:39,760
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,070
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:59,490
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:08,620
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,420
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:14,620
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,760
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,590
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,920
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:25,220
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:26,520
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,970
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:41,060
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:43,790
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:45,490
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:49,460
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:50,990
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:58,290
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:01,810
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:16,320
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:27,910
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:31,570
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,670
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,710
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:01,220
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:12,990
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,870
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,310
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:28,420
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,060
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,670
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,340
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:45,190
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:48,860
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:53,110
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:57,670
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,790
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:02,210
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,040
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,870
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,560
You bastard!

1240
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,620
You coward!

1241
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:16,220
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:17,940
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:19,860
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:22,140
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:25,770
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,890
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:31,720
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:08,660
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,320
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:19,020
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,410
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:25,040
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,510
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:31,210
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:34,040
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:54,060
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,940
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,790
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:04,040
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:08,490
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:12,460
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:16,920
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:26,890
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:31,890
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:34,270
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,570
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:41,190
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:46,860
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:50,870
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:53,540
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:58,290
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,290
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:05,840
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,110
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,390
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,390
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,940
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:27,620
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:32,410
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:36,540
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:39,620
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:50,140
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,220
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:58,640
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:03,190
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:06,160
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:10,110
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:14,410
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:16,460
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:19,670
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:24,210
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,170
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,790
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,060
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,360
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:38,970
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:41,140
And then,

1298
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:45,140
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,970
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:51,540
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:18,760
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:25,610
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:31,410
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:33,820
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:45,620
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,290
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:27,370
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:32,290
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:35,840
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:39,640
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:42,920
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:44,140
Yeah.

1313
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:47,310
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:50,990
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:52,570
Yeah.

1316
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:57,160
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,490 --> 01:48:01,240
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:06,690
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:13,170
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,670
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:21,620
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,940
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:30,970
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:43,740
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:49,740
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:54,990
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:58,760
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:02,260
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,010
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:08,640
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,010
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:12,890
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:16,660
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:19,660
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:32,920
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,620
Is that so...

1337
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:20,960
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:45,610
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:52,610
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:01,710
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:12,710
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:21,810
I see.

1343
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:36,170
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:39,160
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,370
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:44,710
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:48,040
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:54,220
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,420
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,520
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:32,920
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:39,090
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:45,470
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:50,690
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:56,630
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,630 --> 01:53:03,740
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:16,560
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:23,480
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:29,370
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:36,860
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:42,440
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:51,040
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:07,290
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:14,030
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:20,280
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:25,460
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:31,410
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:38,460
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:45,560
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:52,140
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:10,440
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:31,060
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:48,490
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:54,460
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,460 --> 01:56:01,960
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:07,110
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:13,810
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:19,690
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:31,560
Until I reach that distant future
1
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,070
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,860
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,770
Minoru...

4
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,990
Masao...

5
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,860
Susumu...

6
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,160
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,270
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,410
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,290
Isao...

10
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,460
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,210
Yukio...

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,920
Takahiro...

13
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,860
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,440
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,720
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,740
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,120
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,170
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,840
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,670
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,160
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,720
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,840
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,560
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,340
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,320
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,520
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,160
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,360
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,410
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,860
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,190
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,290
So fast!

34
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,290
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,110
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,310
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,220
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,110
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,560
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,370
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,910
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,660
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,290
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,570
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,670
Sure,

46
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,720
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,970
Hey!

48
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,390
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,140
Delicious!

50
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:30,170
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,790
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,460
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,470
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,470
Delicious!

55
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,060
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,560
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,140
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,560
Delicious!

59
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,820
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,070
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,320
Delicious!

62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,620
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,840
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,710
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,320
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,790
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,090
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,920
Delicious!

69
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,560
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,390
Delicious!

71
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,640
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,410
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,490
Yes.

74
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,270
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,160
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,190
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,410
Yes.

78
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,510
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,170
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,590
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,840
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,610
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,270
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,940
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,770
A mission?

86
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,210
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,790
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,410
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,540
Right.

90
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,570
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,760
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,720
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,420
About my father...

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,470
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,170
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,510
Was he really?

97
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,990
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,690
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,990
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,410
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,410
What's up?

102
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,520
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,070
Dance!

104
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,940
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,870
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,710
Right!

108
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,120
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,360
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,970
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,360
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,440
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,270
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,960
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,910
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,490
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,120
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,570
Flame.

119
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,870
Water.

120
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,160
Wind.

121
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,470
Stone.

122
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,590
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,220
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,470
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,340
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,470
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,610
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,110
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,160
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,160
For real?

131
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,810
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,170
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,120
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,920
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,420
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,870
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,770
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,220
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,690
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,390
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,290
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,210
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,960
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,460
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,220
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,390
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,060
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,810
Nooo!

149
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,090
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,660
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,570
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,660
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,760
May I...

155
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,340
see your...

156
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,210
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,620
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,060
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,440
Here.

160
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,920
What is this?

161
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,340
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,590
Thank you...

163
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,760
very much.

164
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,360
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,490
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,990
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,840
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,310
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,770
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,720
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,960
First Form...

173
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,590
Amazing.

174
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,090
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,090
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,770
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,070
All right!

178
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,020
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,510
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,440
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,360
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,860
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,940
All right!

184
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,270
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,310
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,870
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,340
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,760
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,760
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,860
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,860
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,040
Tha...

193
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,040
Tha...

194
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,970
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,810
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,610
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,610
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,140
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,060
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,560
Bro!

201
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,620
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,490
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,860
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,790
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,260
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,920
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,210
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,120
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,610
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,810
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,110
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,290
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,290
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,960
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:37,090
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,560
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,060
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,970
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,490
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,660
Okay.

222
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,710
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,340
Calm down.

224
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,220
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,670
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,070
Hey!

227
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,070
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,240
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,160
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,840
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,940
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,410
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,960
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,320
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,620
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,140
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,510
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,810
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:45,020
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,240
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,570
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,920
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,840
while you count.

244
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,840
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,620
One...

246
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,010
Two...

247
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,690
Three...

248
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,610
Four...

249
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Five...

250
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,440
Six...

251
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,890
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,790
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,910
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,240
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,820
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm all right.

257
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,340
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,890
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,560
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,720
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,720
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,520
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,490
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,860
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,620
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,040
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,620
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,370
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,890
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,140
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,140
They can...

273
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,240
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,910
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,490
This way!

276
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,620
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,060
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,140
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,560
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,220
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,890
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,260
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,570
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,820
River?

285
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,070
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,820
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,840
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,840
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,340
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,840
Let's go!

291
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,940
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,810
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,720
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,560
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,070
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,870
Boss!

297
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,120
Boss!

298
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,870
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,540
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,040
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,560
Here he is!

302
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,140
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,010
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,590
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,940
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,270
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,040
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,270
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,770
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,190
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,370
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,170
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,840
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,840
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,140
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,340
nor I.

317
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,770
Brother...

318
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,820
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:42,070
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,120
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,710
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,590
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,920
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,290
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,770
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,810
Why?

327
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,770
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,040
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,870
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,290
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,890
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,340
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,010
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,260
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,510
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,520
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,520
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,270
You're not like me.

339
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,740
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,770
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,620
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,260
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,460
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,760
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,470
Looking good.

347
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,940
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,360
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,690
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,040
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,410
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,970
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,090
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,760
Like this?

355
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,060
That's right.

356
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,970
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,020
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,610
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,520
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,740
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,910
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,840
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,760
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,510
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,020
There it is!

366
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,520
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,860
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,660
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,740
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,470
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,010
It's burning up.

372
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,310
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,860
Found it!

374
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,910
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,160
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,420
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,210
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:32,140
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,990
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,070
Wow!

381
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,470
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,890
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,670
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,140
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,090
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,110
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,660
Okay!

388
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,990
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,690
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,160
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,770
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,440
No fair!

393
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,870
There.

394
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,090
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,440
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,610
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,220
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,410
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,040
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,160
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,160
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,570
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,510
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,920
Well...

405
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,390
Um...

406
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,590
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,670
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,510
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,060
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,940
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,940
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,520
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,370
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,510
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,210
Wake up!

416
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,710
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,810
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,640
You're under attack!

419
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,890
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,390
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,890
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,060
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,910
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,410
Fight!

425
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,290
Fight!

426
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,820
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,410
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,010
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,420
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,260
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,510
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,840
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,010
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,020
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,590
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,790
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,910
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,760
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,010
Nezuko!

440
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,890
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,340
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,560
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,170
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,860
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,740
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,910
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,110
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,160
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,860
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,690
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,710
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,120
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,870
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,090
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,060
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,110
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,640
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,710
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,710
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,040
Mom?

461
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,820
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,170
Big Bro...

463
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,720
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,770
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,570
forever.

466
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,960
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,460
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,370
Right here.

469
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,620
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,760
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,140
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,390
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,890
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,410
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,320
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,740
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,060
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,260
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,170
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,190
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,610
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,240
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,860
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,340
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,920
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,790
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,270
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,660
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,390
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,390
So, please...

491
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,890
forgive me!

492
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,570
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,310
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,810
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,320
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,110
and...

497
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,110
also warm.

498
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,340
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,370
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,620
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,210
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,970
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,640
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,410
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,160
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,910
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,090
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,170
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,890
What was that?

510
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,110
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,860
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,270
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,120
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,120
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,790
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,120
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,020
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,140
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,390
Oh well...

520
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,890
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,910
Not here.

522
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,620
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,490
What's this, though?

524
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,910
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,660
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,910
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,960
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,420
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,670
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,590
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,560
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,060
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,440
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,660
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,320
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,620
There's something...

537
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,010
I must cut.

538
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,590
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,620
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,720
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,520
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,770
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,770
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,770
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,410
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,370
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,990
In other words...

548
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,660
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,120
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,260
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,820
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,360
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,440
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,240
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,170
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,340
Who are these people?

557
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,840
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,520
Rope...

559
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,170
What's this?

560
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,890
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,360
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,360
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,520
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,560
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,660
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,570
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:02,120
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,070
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,010
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,810
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,170
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,160
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,410
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,270
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:37,520
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,770
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,420
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,290
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,290
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,540
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,340
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:02,970
What are you doing?

583
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,970
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,770
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,860
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,040
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,410
This man, too?

588
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,460
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,320
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:34,390
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,590
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,220
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,060
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,720
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,720
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,740
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,820
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,910
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,410
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,610
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,990
I was willing...

602
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:55,210
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,210
But it was warm...

604
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,970
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,970
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,740
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,740
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,870
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,210
No way!

610
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,540
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,840
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,890
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,970
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,720
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,110
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,210
Right!

617
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,620
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,420
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,670
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,670
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,670
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,310
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,170
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,020
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,410
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,190
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,320
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,320
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,490
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,590
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,420
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,510
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,010
It was him!

634
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,940
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,940
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,940
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,720
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,370
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,160
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,410
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,670
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:02,670
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,190
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:19,440
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,940
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,960
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:31,170
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:37,710
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,010
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,810
And yet...

651
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,860
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,720
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,390 --> 00:53:01,160
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,790
is so enormous!

655
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,990
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,660
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,460
get away with this!

658
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,670
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:30,220
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,920
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:37,490
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,610
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:46,490
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,790
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,460
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,960
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,170
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,940
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,940
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:22,970
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,620
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,120
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,510
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:52,970
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,260
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,320
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,240
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:29,010
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,870
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,640
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,560
This brat...

682
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,470
is insane!

683
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,960
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,820
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,590
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,170
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,590
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,320
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,690
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,460
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,840
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,790
insult...

693
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,920
my family!

694
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,620
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,210
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:30,570
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,570
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,170
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,340
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,840
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,170
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,940
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:56,110
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,520
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:06,270
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:10,870
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:15,340
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:21,370
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,870
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,890
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,390
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,270
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:44,410
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,960
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,160
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,290
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:58,210
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,670
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,220
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:11,420
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,740
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,440
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,160
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:35,370
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,010
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,920
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,760
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,390
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,720
All right!

730
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,940
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,140
Comin' through!

732
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,910
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,160
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,660
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,910
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,660
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,910
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:26,470
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,470
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,720
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,220
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:48,240
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,300
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,490
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,490
Glorify me!

746
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:59,820
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,590
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,670
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,190
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,460
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,320
First Form...

752
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,620
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
No good.

754
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,490
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,820
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:02,840
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,670
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,770
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,140
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,260
First Form...

761
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,360
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,610
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:41,360
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,610
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,860
Protect...

766
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,290
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,120
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,090
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,960
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,920
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,210
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,890
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:16,220
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,860
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,110
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,520
Damn!

777
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,390
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,210
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,710
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:40,290
How could this be?

781
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:43,220
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,060
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,720
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,890
What happened?

785
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,440
What was that?

786
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,070
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,860
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,860
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,590
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,210
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,790
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:23,710
Okay!

793
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,960
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,210
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:32,460
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:34,360
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,270
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:39,560
Head?

799
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,020
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:44,810
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:47,220
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,360
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,410
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,790
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,290
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,540
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:09,640
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:13,510
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,760
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,890
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,020
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,020
Somehow...

813
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:31,770
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:34,610
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:38,240
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,070
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,510
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,510
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,620
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,040
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,540
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,370
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:59,370
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,720
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,270
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,310
That's right!

827
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,220
Understood!

828
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,360
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,860
Forward!

830
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,370
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,710
All right!

832
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,170
Inosuke!

833
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:40,420
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,810
Especially around here!

835
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,170
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:46,170
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,170
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:49,670
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,440
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:57,570
Gross!

841
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,910
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:03,820
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:05,360
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:11,120
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,620
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,260
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,760
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,770
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,720
It's here...

850
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:32,190
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,360
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,110
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:44,740
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,870
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,990
Slice!

856
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,490
It's the bone.

857
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:00,390
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,840
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,170
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,010
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,740
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,020
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:35,710
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,790
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:41,620
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:46,370
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,090
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,620
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,770
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,690
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,060
DREAM

872
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:06,810
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,320
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,990
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:16,370
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,740
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,570
It's all right!

878
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,970
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:31,970
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,180
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:45,690
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,520
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,320
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,110
No good!

885
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,440
Wake up!

886
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,190
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,190
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:58,690
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,710
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,790
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,960
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,620
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,860
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,390
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,890
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:30,060
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,190
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:38,240
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:42,320
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:47,740
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,140
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,670
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,060
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:05,510
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,010
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:12,860
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:15,320
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:33,510
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,670
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,540
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,420
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,390
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,890
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,390
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,090
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:35,440
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:39,020
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,070
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:43,190
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,860
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,310
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:16,220
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:17,560
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,190
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,270
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,820
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,240
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,040
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,240
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,240
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,190
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,110
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,020
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,070
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:17,420
I'm...

936
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,370
all right.

937
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:21,120
What about you?

938
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:24,540
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:28,120
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,040
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,470
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:40,110
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,610
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,060
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,690
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:53,120
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,820
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:57,290
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:01,410
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:03,870
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,120
Please.

952
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,060
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,720
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,970
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:24,390
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:28,320
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,910
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,320
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,570
We have to...

960
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:42,590
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,710
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,440
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,560
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:11,640
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:12,820
Me?

966
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,440
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:18,460
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:21,960
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:27,460
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,460
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:34,010
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,970
It was him!

973
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:38,090
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:43,920
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,390
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:48,220
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,570
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:55,020
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:59,570
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,940
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:05,240
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:09,260
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,040
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:15,790
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,540
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:22,370
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,290
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,140
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:33,360
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,560
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:38,640
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,940
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:46,320
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:52,320
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:53,990
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:57,710
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:02,670
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,670
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:11,560
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,740
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:22,410
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:32,240
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,210
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,870
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:40,340
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:43,710
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,370
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:49,260
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,060
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:56,560
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,560
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:00,610
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,940
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,670
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,670
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:43,610
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,270
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,440
Right.

1019
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:56,590
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,790
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,620
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,540
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,820
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,540
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:00,470
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,240
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,020
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:22,740
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,490
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,040
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:34,370
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,960
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:41,370
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:45,770
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:48,720
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,310
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,560
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,410
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:01,910
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:05,740
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:07,370
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:10,160
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,820
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:17,010
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,470
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:20,810
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:25,970
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,810
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:31,090
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:35,240
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:40,660
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,240
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:48,740
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,010
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:58,460
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,010
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:05,510
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:11,610
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:17,770
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:20,890
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,940
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:26,210
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,790
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:37,290
I see.

1065
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,070
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:45,140
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:19,370
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:23,290
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:27,040
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:33,370
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:37,690
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:41,610
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:50,990
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:53,320
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:56,070
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:58,160
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:02,070
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:04,660
Air Type!

1079
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:18,920
I see.

1080
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,970
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:24,470
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,570
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,910
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,440
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:48,340
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:49,590
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,290
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,940
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:05,890
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:07,470
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,970
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,390
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,860
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,860
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,160
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:19,740
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,120
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:24,990
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:29,990
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:43,760
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,240
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,610
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,860
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:06,990
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,340
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,590
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:20,290
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,060
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:32,970
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,890
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:40,940
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,040
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,990
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:53,490
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:56,370
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:59,140
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:03,510
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,510
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,420
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,890
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,940
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:25,610
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:36,670
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:37,960
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:42,590
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,290
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,270
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:14,990
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,710
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:19,210
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,540
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,670
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:28,260
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:29,970
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,060
Disorder!

1136
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:40,670
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,790
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:29,860
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:37,910
No way!

1140
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:47,910
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:51,090
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:10,860
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,770
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:26,010
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:33,460
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:35,790
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:40,760
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,970
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,110
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,860
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:54,060
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,560
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:03,740
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,160
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,210
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,920
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,920
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,570
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:40,410
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:41,820
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:52,010
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:54,920
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,920
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,920
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:05,920
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:09,190
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:11,020
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:13,770
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:20,940
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:23,390
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,910
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:26,540
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:44,920
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:19,340
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:26,090
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,760
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:30,840
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:32,210
goku...

1179
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,190
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:50,190
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:51,460
You are...

1182
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,820
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:08,970
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,720
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,760
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:16,390
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:22,340
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:27,610
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,110
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:37,690
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:43,620
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:52,370
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:58,590
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:03,610
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:08,110
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:09,640
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:30,210
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:35,920
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:39,760
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,070
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:59,490
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:08,620
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,420
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:14,620
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,760
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,590
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,920
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:25,220
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:26,520
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,970
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:41,060
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:43,790
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:45,490
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:49,460
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:50,990
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:58,290
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:01,810
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:16,320
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:27,910
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:31,570
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,670
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,710
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:01,220
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:12,990
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,870
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,310
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:28,420
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,060
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,670
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,340
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:45,190
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:48,860
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:53,110
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:57,670
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,790
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:02,210
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,040
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,870
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,560
You bastard!

1240
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,620
You coward!

1241
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:16,220
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:17,940
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:19,860
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:22,140
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:25,770
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,890
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:31,720
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:08,660
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,320
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:19,020
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,410
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:25,040
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,510
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:31,210
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:34,040
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:54,060
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,940
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,790
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:04,040
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:08,490
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:12,460
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:16,920
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:26,890
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:31,890
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:34,270
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,570
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:41,190
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:46,860
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:50,870
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:53,540
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:58,290
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,290
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:05,840
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,110
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,390
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,390
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,940
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:27,620
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:32,410
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:36,540
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:39,620
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:50,140
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,220
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:58,640
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:03,190
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:06,160
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:10,110
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:14,410
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:16,460
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:19,670
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:24,210
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,170
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,790
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,060
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,360
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:38,970
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:41,140
And then,

1298
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:45,140
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,970
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:51,540
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:18,760
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:25,610
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:31,410
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:33,820
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:45,620
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,290
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:27,370
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:32,290
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:35,840
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:39,640
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:42,920
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:44,140
Yeah.

1313
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:47,310
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:50,990
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:52,570
Yeah.

1316
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:57,160
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,490 --> 01:48:01,240
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:06,690
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:13,170
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,670
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:21,620
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,940
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:30,970
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:43,740
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:49,740
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:54,990
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:58,760
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:02,260
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,010
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:08,640
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,010
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:12,890
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:16,660
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:19,660
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:32,920
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,620
Is that so...

1337
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:20,960
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:45,610
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:52,610
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:01,710
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:12,710
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:21,810
I see.

1343
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:36,170
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:39,160
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,370
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:44,710
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:48,040
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:54,220
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,420
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,520
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:32,920
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:39,090
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:45,470
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:50,690
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:56,630
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,630 --> 01:53:03,740
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:16,560
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:23,480
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:29,370
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:36,860
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:42,440
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:51,040
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:07,290
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:14,030
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:20,280
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:25,460
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:31,410
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:38,460
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:45,560
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:52,140
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:10,440
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:31,060
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:48,490
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:54,460
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,460 --> 01:56:01,960
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:07,110
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:13,810
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:19,690
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:31,560
Until I reach that distant future
