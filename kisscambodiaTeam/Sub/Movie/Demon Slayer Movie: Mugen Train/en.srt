1
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,310
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,100
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,010
Minoru...

4
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,230
Masao...

5
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,100
Susumu...

6
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,400
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,510
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,650
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,530
Isao...

10
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,700
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,450
Yukio...

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,160
Takahiro...

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,100
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,680
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,960
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,980
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,360
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:57,410
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,080
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,910
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,400
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,960
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,080
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,800
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,580
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,760
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,400
We should go, too!

29
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,600
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,650
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,100
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,430
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,530
So fast!

34
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,530
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,350
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,550
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,460
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,350
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,800
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,610
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,150
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,900
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,530
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,810
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:48,910
Sure,

46
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,960
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,210
Hey!

48
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,630
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,380
Delicious!

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:30,410
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,030
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,700
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,710
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,710
Delicious!

55
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,300
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,800
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,380
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,800
Delicious!

59
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,060
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,310
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,560
Delicious!

62
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,860
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,080
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,950
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,560
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,030
Delicious!

67
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,330
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,160
Delicious!

69
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,800
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,630
Delicious!

71
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,880
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,650
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,730
Yes.

74
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,510
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,400
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,430
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,650
Yes.

78
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,750
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,410
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,830
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,080
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,850
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,510
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,180
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,010
A mission?

86
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,450
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:27,030
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,650
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,780
Right.

90
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,810
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,000
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,960
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,660
About my father...

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,710
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,410
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,750
Was he really?

97
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,230
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,930
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,230
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,650
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,650
What's up?

102
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,760
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,310
Dance!

104
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,180
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,110
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,950
Right!

108
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,360
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,600
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,210
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,600
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,680
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,510
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,200
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,150
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,730
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,360
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,810
Flame.

119
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,110
Water.

120
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,400
Wind.

121
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,710
Stone.

122
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,830
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,460
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,710
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,580
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,710
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,850
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,350
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,400
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,400
For real?

131
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,050
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,410
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,360
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,160
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,660
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,110
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,010
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,460
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,930
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,630
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,450
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,200
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,700
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,460
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,630
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,300
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,050
Nooo!

149
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,330
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,900
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,810
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,900
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,000
May I...

155
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,580
see your...

156
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,450
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,860
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,300
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,680
Here.

160
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,160
What is this?

161
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,580
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,830
Thank you...

163
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,000
very much.

164
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,600
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,730
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,230
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,080
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,550
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,010
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,960
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,200
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,200
First Form...

173
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,830
Amazing.

174
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,330
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,330
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,010
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,310
All right!

178
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,260
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,750
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,680
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,600
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,100
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,180
All right!

184
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,510
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,550
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,110
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,580
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,000
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,100
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,100
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,280
Tha...

193
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,280
Tha...

194
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,210
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,050
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,850
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,850
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,380
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,300
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,800
Bro!

201
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,860
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,730
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,100
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,030
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,500
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,160
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,450
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,360
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,850
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,050
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,350
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,530
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,530
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,200
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:37,330
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,800
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,300
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,210
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,730
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,900
Okay.

222
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,950
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,580
Calm down.

224
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,460
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,910
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,310
Hey!

227
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,310
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,480
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,400
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,080
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,180
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,650
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,200
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,560
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,860
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,380
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,750
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,050
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:45,260
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,480
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,810
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,160
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,080
while you count.

244
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,080
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,860
One...

246
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,250
Two...

247
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,930
Three...

248
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,850
Four...

249
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Five...

250
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,680
Six...

251
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,130
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,030
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,150
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,480
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,060
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,080
I'm all right.

257
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,580
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,130
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,800
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,960
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,960
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,760
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,730
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,100
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,860
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,280
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,860
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,610
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,130
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,380
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,380
They can...

273
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,480
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,150
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,730
This way!

276
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,860
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,300
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,380
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,800
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,460
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,130
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,500
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,810
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,060
River?

285
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,310
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,060
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,080
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,080
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,580
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,080
Let's go!

291
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,180
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,050
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,960
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,800
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,310
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,110
Boss!

297
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,360
Boss!

298
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,110
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,780
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,280
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,800
Here he is!

302
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,380
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,250
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,830
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,180
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,510
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,280
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,510
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,010
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,430
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,610
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,410
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,080
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,080
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,380
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,580
nor I.

317
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,010
Brother...

318
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,060
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:42,310
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,360
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,950
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,830
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,160
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,530
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,010
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,050
Why?

327
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,010
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,280
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,110
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,530
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,130
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,580
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,250
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,500
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,750
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,760
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,760
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,510
You're not like me.

339
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,980
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,010
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,860
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,500
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,700
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,000
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,710
Looking good.

347
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,600
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,930
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,280
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:51,650
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,210
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,330
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,000
Like this?

355
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
That's right.

356
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,210
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,260
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,850
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,760
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,980
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,150
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:39,080
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,000
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,750
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,260
There it is!

366
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,760
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,100
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,900
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,980
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,710
It's hot,

371
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,250
It's burning up.

372
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,550
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,100
Found it!

374
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,150
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,400
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,660
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,450
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:32,380
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,230
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,310
Wow!

381
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,710
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,130
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,910
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,380
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,330
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,350
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,900
Okay!

388
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,230
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,930
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,400
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,010
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,680
No fair!

393
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,110
There.

394
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,330
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,680
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,850
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,460
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,650
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,280
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,400
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,400
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,810
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,750
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,160
Well...

405
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,630
Um...

406
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,830
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,910
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,750
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,300
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,180
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,180
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,760
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,610
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,750
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,450
Wake up!

416
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,950
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,050
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,880
You're under attack!

419
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,130
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,630
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,130
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,300
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,150
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,650
Fight!

425
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,530
Fight!

426
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,060
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,650
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,250
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,660
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,500
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,750
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,080
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,250
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,260
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,830
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,030
Big Bro!

437
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,150
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,000
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,250
Nezuko!

440
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,130
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,580
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,800
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,410
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,100
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,980
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,150
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,350
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,400
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,100
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,930
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,950
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,360
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,110
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,330
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,300
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,350
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,880
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,950
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,950
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,280
Mom?

461
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,060
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,410
Big Bro...

463
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,960
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,010
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,810
forever.

466
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,200
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,700
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,610
Right here.

469
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,860
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,000
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:30,380
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,630
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,130
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,650
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,560
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,980
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,300
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,500
I can never go back!

479
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,410
Big Bro!

480
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,430
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,850
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,480
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,100
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,580
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,160
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,030
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,510
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,900
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,630
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,630
So, please...

491
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,130
forgive me!

492
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,810
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,550
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,050
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,560
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,350
and...

497
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,350
also warm.

498
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,580
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,610
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,860
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,450
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,210
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,880
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,650
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,400
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,150
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,330
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,410
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,130
What was that?

510
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,350
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,100
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,510
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,360
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,360
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,030
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,360
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,260
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,380
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,630
Oh well...

520
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,130
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,150
Not here.

522
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,860
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,730
What's this, though?

524
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,150
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,900
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,150
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,200
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,660
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,910
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,830
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,800
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,300
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,680
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,900
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,560
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,860
There's something...

537
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,250
I must cut.

538
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,830
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,860
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,960
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,760
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,010
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,010
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,010
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,650
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,610
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,230
In other words...

548
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,900
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,360
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,500
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,060
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,600
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,680
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,480
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,410
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,580
Who are these people?

557
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:28,080
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,760
Rope...

559
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,410
What's this?

560
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,130
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,600
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,600
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,760
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,800
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,900
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,810
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,360
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,310
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:11,250
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,050
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,410
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,400
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,650
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,510
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:37,760
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,010
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,660
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,530
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,530
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,780
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,580
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,210
What are you doing?

583
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:09,210
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:11,010
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:15,100
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,280
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,650
This man, too?

588
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,700
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,560
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,630
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,830
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,460
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,300
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,960
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,960
Poor man.

596
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,980
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,060
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,150
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,650
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,850
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,230
I was willing...

602
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:55,450
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,450
But it was warm...

604
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,210
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,210
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,980
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,980
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,110
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,450
No way!

610
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,780
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,080
Why would you...

612
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,130
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,210
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:04,960
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,350
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,450
Right!

617
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,860
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,660
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,910
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,910
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,910
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,550
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,410
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,260
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,650
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,430
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,560
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,560
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,730
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,830
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,660
Good morning!

632
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,750
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,250
It was him!

634
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,180
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:24,180
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:30,180
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,960
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,610
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,400
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,650
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,910
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:02,910
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,430
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:19,680
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,180
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,200
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:31,410
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:37,950
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,250
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,050
And yet...

651
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,100
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,960
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,630 --> 00:53:01,400
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,030
is so enormous!

655
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,230
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,900
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,700
get away with this!

658
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,910
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,460
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,160
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:37,730
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:41,850
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:46,730
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,030
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,700
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,200
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,410
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,180
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,180
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,210
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:29,860
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,360
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,750
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:53,210
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,500
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,560
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:13,480
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:29,250
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,110
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:34,880
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,800
This brat...

682
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,710
is insane!

683
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,200
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,060
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,830
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,410
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,830
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,560
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,930
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,700
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,080
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,030
insult...

693
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,160
my family!

694
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,860
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,450
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,810
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,810
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:39,410
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,580
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:47,080
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,410
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,180
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,350
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,760
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:06,510
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:11,110
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:15,580
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,610
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,110
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:29,130
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:32,630
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,510
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:44,650
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,200
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,400
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,530
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:58,450
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,910
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,460
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:11,660
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,980
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,680
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,400
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:35,610
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,250
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,160
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,000
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,630
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,970 --> 00:59:59,960
All right!

730
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,180
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,380
Comin' through!

732
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,150
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,400
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,900
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,150
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,900
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,150
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:26,710
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,710
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,960
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,460
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,480
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,540
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,730
and worship me!

745
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,730
Glorify me!

746
01:00:55,070 --> 01:01:00,060
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,830
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:06,910
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,430
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:38,700
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,560
First Form...

752
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,860
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,400
No good.

754
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,730
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,060
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:03,080
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,910
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,010
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,380
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,500
First Form...

761
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,600
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,850
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:41,600
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,850
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,100
Protect...

766
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,530
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,360
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,330
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,200
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,160
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,450
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,130
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,460
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,100
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:21,350
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,760
Damn!

777
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,630
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,450
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:37,950
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,530
How could this be?

781
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:43,460
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,300
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,960
under a rock!

784
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,130
What happened?

785
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,680
What was that?

786
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,310
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,100
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,100
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:17,830
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,450
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,030
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:23,950
Okay!

793
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,200
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,450
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:32,700
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,600
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,510
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:39,800
Head?

799
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,260
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:45,050
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,460
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,600
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,650
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:59,030
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,530
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,780
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:09,880
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:13,750
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,000
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,130
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,260
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,260
Somehow...

813
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,010
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:34,850
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,480
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:40,310
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,750
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,750
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,860
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,280
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,780
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,610
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:59,610
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,960
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,510
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,550
That's right!

827
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,460
Understood!

828
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,600
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:10,100
Forward!

830
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,610
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:28,950
All right!

832
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:37,410
Inosuke!

833
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,660
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,050
Especially around here!

835
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,410
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:46,410
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,410
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:49,910
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,680
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:57,810
Gross!

841
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:00,150
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,060
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,600
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:11,360
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:12,860
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:22,500
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,000
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,010
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:29,960
It's here...

850
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,430
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,600
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,350
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:44,980
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,110
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,230
Slice!

856
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,730
It's the bone.

857
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,630
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,080
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,410
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,250
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,980
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,260
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:35,950
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,030
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:41,860
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:46,610
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:49,330
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,860
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,010
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,930
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,300
DREAM

872
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:07,050
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,560
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:12,230
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:16,610
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:17,980
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,810
It's all right!

878
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,210
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:32,210
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,420
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:45,930
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:48,760
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:50,560
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:53,350
No good!

885
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,680
Wake up!

886
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:56,430
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,430
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:58,930
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,950
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:03,030
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,200
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,860
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,100
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,630
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:27,130
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:30,300
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,430
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:38,480
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:42,560
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,980
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,380
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,910
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,300
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:05,750
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,250
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:13,100
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,560
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:33,750
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:35,910
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,780
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,660
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:17,630
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,130
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,630
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,330
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,680
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:39,260
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,310
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:43,430
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,100
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,550
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:16,460
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:17,800
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,430
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:23,510
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,060
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:29,480
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:34,280
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:03,480
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,480
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,430
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:12,350
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,260
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,310
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:17,660
I'm...

936
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,610
all right.

937
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:21,360
What about you?

938
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,780
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,360
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,280
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:35,710
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:40,350
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,850
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:47,300
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,930
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:53,360
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:56,060
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:57,530
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:01,650
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:04,110
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:07,360
Please.

952
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:16,300
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,960
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,210
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:24,630
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,560
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:35,150
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,560
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,810
We have to...

960
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,830
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:44,950
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,680
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,800
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:11,880
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,060
Me?

966
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,680
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:18,700
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:22,200
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:27,700
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,700
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:34,250
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,210
It was him!

973
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:38,330
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:44,160
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,630
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:48,460
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,810
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:55,260
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:59,810
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,180
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,480
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:09,500
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,280
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:16,030
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:18,780
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:22,610
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,530
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,380
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:33,600
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,800
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,880
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,180
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:46,560
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:52,560
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,230
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,950
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:02,910
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,910
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:11,800
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,980
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:22,650
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,480
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,450
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,110
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,580
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:43,950
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,610
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:49,500
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,300
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,800
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,800
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,850
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,180
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,910
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,910
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,850
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,510
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,680
Right.

1019
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:56,830
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:00,030
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,860
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,780
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,060
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:45,780
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,710
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,480
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,260
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:22,980
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,730
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:29,280
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:34,610
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,200
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:41,610
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,010
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,960
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,550
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,800
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:00,650
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,150
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:05,980
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,610
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,400
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:13,060
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:17,250
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,710
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,050
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,210
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:28,050
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:31,330
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,480
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,900
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,480
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:48,980
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,250
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:58,700
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,250
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:05,750
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:11,850
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:18,010
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,130
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:23,180
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:26,450
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:31,030
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,530
I see.

1065
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,310
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:45,380
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:19,610
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:23,530
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:27,280
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:33,610
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:37,930
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:41,850
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:51,230
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:53,560
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:56,310
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:58,400
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:02,310
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:04,900
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,160
I see.

1080
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,210
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,710
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,810
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:32,150
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,680
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:48,580
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,830
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,530
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:00,180
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:06,130
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,710
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,210
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:10,630
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:13,100
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,100
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,400
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:19,980
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,360
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,230
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:30,230
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:44,000
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:51,480
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,850
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,100
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:07,230
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,580
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,830
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:20,530
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,300
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:33,210
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:38,130
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:41,180
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:42,280
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,230
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:53,730
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:56,610
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:59,380
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:03,750
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,750
I can't move...

1119
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,660
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,130
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,180
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:25,850
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:36,910
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:38,200
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:42,830
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,530
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,510
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:15,230
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,950
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:19,450
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,780
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,910
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,500
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,210
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,300
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:40,910
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,030
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:30,100
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:38,150
No way!

1140
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,150
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:51,330
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,100
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,010
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:26,250
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:33,700
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:36,030
But what about you?

1147
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:41,000
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,210
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,350
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,100
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:54,300
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,800
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,980
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,400
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,450
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:25,160
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:32,160
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:35,810
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:40,650
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,060
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:52,250
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:55,160
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:57,160
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:00,160
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:06,160
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:09,430
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,260
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:14,010
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:21,180
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,930 --> 01:34:23,630
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,150
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:26,780
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:45,160
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:19,580
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:26,330
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:30,000
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:31,080
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:32,450
goku...

1179
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,430
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:50,430
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:51,700
You are...

1182
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:55,060
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:09,210
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,960
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:16,630
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:22,580
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:27,850
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,350
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:37,930
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:43,860
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:52,610
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:58,830
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:03,850
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:08,350
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:09,880
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:30,450
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:36,160
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:40,000
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,310
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:59,730
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,860
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,660
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:14,860
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:18,000
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,830
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:23,160
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,450 --> 01:38:25,460
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,760
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,210
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:41,300
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:44,030
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:45,730
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:49,700
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:51,230
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:58,530
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,870 --> 01:39:02,050
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:16,560
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:28,150
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,850 --> 01:39:31,810
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,910
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:39,950
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:01,460
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:13,230
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,110
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,550
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:28,660
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,300
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:36,910
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:39,580
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:45,430
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:49,100
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:53,350
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:57,910
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,030
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:02,450
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:05,280
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:08,110
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:09,800
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:11,860
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:16,460
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:18,180
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:20,100
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:22,380
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:26,010
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:28,130
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:31,960
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:08,900
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,560
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:19,260
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,650
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,280
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,750
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:31,450
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:34,280
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:54,300
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:58,180
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:01,030
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:04,280
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:08,730
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:12,700
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:17,160
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:27,130
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:32,130
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,130 --> 01:43:34,510
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,810
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:41,430
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:47,100
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:51,110
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:53,780
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:58,530
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,530
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:06,080
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:09,350
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:11,630
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:16,630
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,180
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:27,860
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:32,650
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:36,780
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:39,860
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:50,380
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,460
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:58,880
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:03,430
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:06,400
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:10,350
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:14,650
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:16,700
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:19,910
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:24,450
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,410
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,030
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,300
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:35,600
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:39,210
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,380
And then,

1298
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:45,380
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,210
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:51,780
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,000
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:25,850
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:31,650
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:34,060
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,450 --> 01:46:45,860
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:24,530
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:27,610
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:32,530
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:36,080
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:39,880
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,160
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:44,380
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:47,550
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:51,230
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,650 --> 01:47:52,810
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:57,400
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,730 --> 01:48:01,480
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:06,930
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:13,410
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,910
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:21,860
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:24,180
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:31,210
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:43,980
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,730 --> 01:48:49,980
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:55,230
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:59,000
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:02,500
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,250
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,880
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:11,250
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,130
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,900
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:19,900
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:33,160
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,860
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:21,200
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:45,850
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,850
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:01,950
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:12,950
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:22,050
I see.

1343
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:36,410
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:39,400
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:41,610
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:44,950
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:48,280
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:54,460
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,660
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,760
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:33,160
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,170 --> 01:52:39,330
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:45,710
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:50,930
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:56,870
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,870 --> 01:53:03,980
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:16,800
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:23,720
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:29,610
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:37,100
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:42,680
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:51,280
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:07,530
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:14,270
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:20,520
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:25,700
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:31,650
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:38,700
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:45,800
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:52,380
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:10,680
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:31,300
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:48,730
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:54,700
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,700 --> 01:56:02,200
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:07,350
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:14,050
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:19,930
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,930 --> 01:56:31,800
Until I reach that distant future
