00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,970
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,760
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,670
Minoru...

4
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,890
Masao...

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,760
Susumu...

6
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,060
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,170
Yaichi..

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,310
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,190
Isao...

10
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,360
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,110
Yukio...

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,820
Takahiro...

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,760
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,340
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,620
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,640
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,020
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,070
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,740
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,570
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,060
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,620
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,740
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,460
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,240
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,220
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,420
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,060
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,260
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,310
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,760
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,090
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,190
So fast!

34
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,190
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,010
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,210
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,120
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,010
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,460
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,270
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,810
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,560
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,190
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,470
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,570
Sure,

46
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,620
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,870
Hey!

48
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,290
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,040
Delicious!

50
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:30,070
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,690
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,360
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,370
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,370
Delicious!

55
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,460
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,040
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,460
Delicious!

59
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,720
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,970
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,220
Delicious!

62
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,520
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,740
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,610
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,220
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,690
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,990
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,820
Delicious!

69
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,460
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,290
Delicious!

71
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,540
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,310
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,390
Yes.

74
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,170
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:39,060
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,090
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,310
Yes.

78
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,410
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,070
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,490
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,740
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,510
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,170
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,840
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,670
A mission?

86
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,110
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,690
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,310
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,440
Right.

90
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,470
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,660
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,620
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,320
About my father...

94
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,370
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,070
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,410
Was he really?

97
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,890
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,590
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,890
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,310
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,310
What's up?

102
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,420
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,970
Dance!

104
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,840
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,770
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,610
Right!

108
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,020
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,260
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,870
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,260
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,340
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,170
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,860
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,810
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,390
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,020
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,470
Flame.

119
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,770
Water.

120
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,060
Wind.

121
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,370
Stone.

122
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,490
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,120
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,370
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,240
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,370
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,510
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,010
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,060
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,060
For real?

131
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,710
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,070
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,020
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,820
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,320
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,770
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,670
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,120
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,590
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,290
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,190
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,110
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,860
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,120
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,290
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,960
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,710
Nooo!

149
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,460
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,990
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,560
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,470
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,560
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,660
May I...

155
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,240
see your...

156
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,110
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,520
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,960
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,340
Here.

160
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,820
What is this?

161
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,240
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,490
Thank you...

163
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,660
very much.

164
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,260
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,390
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,890
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,740
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,210
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,670
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,620
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,860
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,860
First Form...

173
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,490
Amazing.

174
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,990
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,990
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,670
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,970
All right!

178
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,920
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,410
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,340
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,260
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,760
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,840
All right!

184
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,170
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,210
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,770
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,240
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,660
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,660
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,760
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,760
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,940
Tha...

193
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,940
Tha...

194
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,870
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,710
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,510
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,510
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,960
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,460
Bro!

201
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,520
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,390
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,760
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,690
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:49,160
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,820
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,110
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,020
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,510
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,340
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,710
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,010
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,190
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,190
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,860
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,990
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,460
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,960
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,870
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,390
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,560
Okay.

222
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,610
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,240
Calm down.

224
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,120
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,570
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,970
Hey!

227
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,970
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,140
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,060
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,740
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,840
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,310
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,860
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,220
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,520
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,040
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,410
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,710
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,920
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,140
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,470
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,820
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,740
while you count.

244
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,740
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,520
One...

246
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,910
Two...

247
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,590
Three...

248
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,510
Four...

249
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,340
Five...

250
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,340
Six...

251
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,790
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,690
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,810
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,140
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,720
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,740
I'm all right.

257
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,240
Are you sure?

258
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,790
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,460
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,620
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,620
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,420
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,390
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,760
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,520
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,940
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,520
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,270
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,790
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,040
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,540
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,040
They can...

273
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,140
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,810
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,390
This way!

276
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,520
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,960
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,040
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,460
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,120
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,790
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,160
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,470
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,720
River?

285
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,970
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,720
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,740
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,740
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,240
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,740
Let's go!

291
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,840
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,710
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,620
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,460
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,970
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,770
Boss!

297
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,020
Boss!

298
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,770
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,440
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,940
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,460
Here he is!

302
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,040
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,910
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,490
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,840
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,170
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,940
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,170
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,670
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,090
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,270
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,070
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,740
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,740
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,040
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,240
nor I.

317
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,670
Brother...

318
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,720
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:41,970
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,020
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,610
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,490
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,820
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,190
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,670
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,710
Why?

327
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,670
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,940
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,770
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,190
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,790
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,240
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,910
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,160
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,410
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,420
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,420
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,170
You're not like me.

339
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,640
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,670
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,520
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,940
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,160
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,360
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,660
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,370
Looking good.

347
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,260
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,590
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,940
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,310
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,870
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,990
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,660
Like this?

355
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
That's right.

356
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,870
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,920
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,510
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,420
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,640
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,810
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,740
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,660
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,410
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,920
There it is!

366
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,420
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,760
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,560
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,640
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,370
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,910
It's burning up.

372
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,210
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,760
Found it!

374
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,810
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,060
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,320
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,110
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:32,040
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,890
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,970
Wow!

381
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,370
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,790
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,570
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,040
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,990
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,010
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,560
Okay!

388
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,890
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,590
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,060
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,670
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,340
No fair!

393
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,770
There.

394
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,990
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,340
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,510
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,310
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,940
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,060
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,060
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,470
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,410
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,820
Well...

405
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,290
Um...

406
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,490
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,570
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,410
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,960
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,840
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,840
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,420
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,270
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,410
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,110
Wake up!

416
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,610
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,710
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,540
You're under attack!

419
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,790
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,290
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,790
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,960
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,810
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,310
Fight!

425
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,190
Fight!

426
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,720
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,310
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,910
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,320
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,160
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,410
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,740
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,910
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,920
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,490
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,690
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,810
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,660
Nezuko...

439
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,910
Nezuko!

440
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,790
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,240
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,460
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,070
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,760
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,640
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,810
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,010
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,060
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,760
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,590
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,610
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,020
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,770
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,990
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,960
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,010
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,540
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,610
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,610
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,940
Mom?

461
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,720
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,070
Big Bro...

463
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,620
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,670
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,470
forever.

466
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,860
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,360
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,270
Right here.

469
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,520
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,660
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:30,040
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,290
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,790
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,310
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,220
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,640
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,960
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,160
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,070
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,090
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,510
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,140
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,760
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,240
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,820
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,690
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,170
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,560
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,290
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,290
So, please...

491
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,790
forgive me!

492
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,470
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,210
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,710
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,220
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,010
and...

497
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,010
also warm.

498
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,240
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,270
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,520
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,110
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,870
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,540
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,310
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:45,060
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,810
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,990
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,070
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,790
What was that?

510
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,010
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,760
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,170
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,020
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,020
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,690
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,020
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,920
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,040
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,290
Oh well...

520
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,790
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,810
Not here.

522
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,520
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,390
What's this, though?

524
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,810
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,560
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,810
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,860
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,320
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,570
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,490
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,460
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,960
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,340
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,560
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,220
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,520
There's something...

537
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,910
I must cut.

538
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,490
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,520
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,620
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,420
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,670
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,670
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,670
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,310
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,270
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,890
In other words...

548
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,560
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,020
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,720
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,260
Nezuko...

553
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,340
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,140
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,070
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,240
Who are these people?

557
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:27,740
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,420
Rope...

559
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,070
What's this?

560
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,790
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:38,260
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,260
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,420
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,460
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,560
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,470
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:02,020
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,970
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,910
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,710
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,070
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,060
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,310
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:35,170
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,420
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,670
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,320
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,190
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,190
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,440
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,240
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:02,870
What are you doing?

583
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,870
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,670
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,760
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,940
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,310
This man, too?

588
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,360
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,220
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:34,290
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:38,490
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,120
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,960
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,620
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,620
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,640
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,720
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:58,810
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,310
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,510
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,890
I was willing...

602
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:55,110
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:59,110
But it was warm...

604
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,870
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,870
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,640
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,640
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,770
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,110
No way!

610
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,440
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,740
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:56,790
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,870
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:04,620
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,010
Be careful.

616
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,110
Right!

617
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,520
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,320
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,570
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,570
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,570
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,210
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,070
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,920
I was useless!

625
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,310
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,090
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,220
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,220
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,390
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,490
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:09,320
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,410
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,910
It was him!

634
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,840
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,840
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:29,840
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,620
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,270
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,060
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,310
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,570
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:02,570
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,090
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:19,340
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,840
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,860
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,070
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:37,610
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,910
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,710
And yet...

651
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:49,760
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,620
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,290 --> 00:53:01,060
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,690
is so enormous!

655
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,890
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,560
I won't let you...

657
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,360
get away with this!

658
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,570
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:30,120
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,820
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:37,390
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,510
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:46,390
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,690
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,360
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,860
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,070
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,840
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,840
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:22,870
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,520
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,020
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,410
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,870
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,160
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,220
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,140
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,910
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,770
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,540
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,460
This brat...

682
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,370
is insane!

683
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:53,860
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:01,720
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,490
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,070
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,490
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:32,220
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,590
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:48,360
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,740
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,690
insult...

693
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,820
my family!

694
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,520
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,110
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:30,470
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,470
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:39,070
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,240
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,740
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:51,070
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,840
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,010
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,420
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:06,170
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,770
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,240
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,270
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,770
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,790
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,290
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,170
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:44,310
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,860
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,060
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,190
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,110
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,570
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,120
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:11,320
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,640
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:28,340
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,060
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:35,270
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,910
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,820
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,660
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,290
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,620
All right!

730
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,840
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,040
Comin' through!

732
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,810
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,060
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:12,560
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,810
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,560
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,810
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,370
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,370
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,620
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,120
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:48,140
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,200
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,390
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,390
Glorify me!

746
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:59,720
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,490
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:06,570
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,090
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,360
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:40,220
First Form...

752
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,520
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,060
No good.

754
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,390
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,720
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:02,740
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,570
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:10,670
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,040
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,160
First Form...

761
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,260
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,510
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,260
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,510
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,760
Protect...

766
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,190
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,020
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,990
What's going on?

769
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:01,860
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,820
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,110
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:13,790
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,120
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:17,760
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:21,010
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,420
Damn!

777
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,290
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:27,110
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,610
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,190
How could this be?

781
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:43,120
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,960
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,620
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,790
What happened?

785
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,340
What was that?

786
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,970
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,760
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,760
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:17,490
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:20,110
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,690
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,610
Okay!

793
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,860
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,110
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:32,360
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,260
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,170
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:39,460
Head?

799
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,920
But this demon is

800
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:44,710
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,120
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,260
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,310
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:58,690
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,190
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,440
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:09,540
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:13,410
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,660
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,790
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:26,920
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,920
Somehow...

813
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,670
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,510
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:38,140
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:39,970
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:43,410
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:45,410
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,520
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:50,940
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,440
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,270
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:59,270
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,620
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,170
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,210
That's right!

827
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,120
Understood!

828
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,260
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:09,760
Forward!

830
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,270
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,610
All right!

832
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,070
Inosuke!

833
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:40,320
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,710
Especially around here!

835
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,070
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:46,070
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,070
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,570
The demon's...

839
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,340
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:57,470
Gross!

841
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,810
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:03,720
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:05,260
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:11,020
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,520
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,160
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,660
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,670
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:29,620
It's here...

850
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,090
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,260
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,010
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:44,640
Just watch.

854
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,770
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,890
Slice!

856
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,390
It's the bone.

857
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,290
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,740
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,070
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,910
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,640
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,920
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:35,610
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,690
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:41,520
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:46,270
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,990
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,520
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:51,670
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,590
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,960
DREAM

872
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:06,710
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:08,220
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:11,890
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:16,270
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,640
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,470
It's all right!

878
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,870
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:31,870
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,080
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:45,590
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,420
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:50,220
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:53,010
No good!

885
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,340
Wake up!

886
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:56,090
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,090
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:58,590
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,610
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:02,690
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,860
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,520
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,760
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:19,290
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:26,790
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:29,960
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,090
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:38,140
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,220
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:47,640
Inosuke!

901
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:51,040
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,570
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,960
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,410
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,910
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:12,760
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:15,220
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:33,410
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:35,570
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,440
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,320
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,290
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:18,790
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,290
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,990
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:35,340
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:38,920
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,970
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:43,090
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,760
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,210
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:16,120
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:17,460
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:20,090
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:23,170
I can't die.

926
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,720
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,140
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:33,940
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,140
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:07,140
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,090
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:12,010
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,920
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,970
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:17,320
I'm...

936
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,270
all right.

937
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,020
What about you?

938
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,440
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,020
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,940
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:35,370
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:40,010
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,510
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:46,960
It's not okay.

945
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,590
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:53,020
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:55,720
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:57,190
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:01,310
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,770
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,020
Please.

952
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:15,960
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,620
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,870
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,290
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,220
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,810
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:38,220
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,470
We have to...

960
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:42,490
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,610
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:05,340
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,460
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:11,540
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,720
Me?

966
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,340
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,360
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:21,860
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:27,360
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:30,360
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:33,910
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,870
It was him!

973
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:37,990
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:43,820
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:45,290
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,120
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:51,470
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,920
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:59,470
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,840
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,140
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:09,160
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,940
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,690
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:18,440
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:22,270
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,190
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:29,040
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,260
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,460
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,540
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,840
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:46,220
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:52,220
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,890
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:57,610
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:02,570
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:05,570
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:11,460
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:16,640
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:22,310
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:32,140
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,110
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,770
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,240
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:43,610
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,270
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:49,160
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:52,960
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:56,460
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:58,460
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,510
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,840
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,570
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,570
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:43,510
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,170
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,340
Right.

1019
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,490
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:59,690
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:04,520
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,440
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,720
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,440
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,370
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,140
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,920
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,640
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,390
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,940
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:34,270
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,860
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:41,270
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:45,670
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,620
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:53,210
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,460
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:00,310
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,810
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,640
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,270
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,060
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:12,720
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:16,910
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,370
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:20,710
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:25,870
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,710
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,990
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:35,140
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:40,560
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,140
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:48,640
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,910
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:58,360
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:01,910
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:05,410
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:11,510
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,670
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:20,790
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,840
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,110
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:30,690
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,190
I see.

1065
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,970
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:45,040
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:19,270
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,190
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:26,940
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,270
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:37,590
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:41,510
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:50,890
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:53,220
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:55,970
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:58,060
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:01,970
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,560
Air Type!

1079
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:18,820
I see.

1080
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,870
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,370
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,470
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,810
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,340
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:48,240
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,490
In that case...

1087
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,190
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,840
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,790
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,370
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,870
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,290
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:12,760
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:15,760
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,060
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,640
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,020
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,890
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,230 --> 01:27:29,890
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:43,660
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:51,140
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,510
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,760
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,890
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,240
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,490
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:20,190
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,960
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:32,870
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,790
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:40,840
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:41,940
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:51,890
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,390
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:56,270
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,040
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:03,410
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,410
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:09,320
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,790
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:19,840
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:25,510
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:36,570
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:37,860
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:42,490
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:45,190
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,170
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:14,890
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,610
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,110
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,440
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,570
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,160
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,870
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:34,960
Disorder!

1136
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:40,570
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:59,690
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:29,760
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:37,810
No way!

1140
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,810
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:50,990
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:10,760
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,670
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:25,910
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:33,360
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,690
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:40,660
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:42,870
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:46,010
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:49,760
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:53,960
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,460
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:03,640
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:06,060
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,110
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,820
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,820
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:35,470
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,310
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,720
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:51,910
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:54,820
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:56,820
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,820
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:05,820
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,090
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,920
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,670
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:20,840
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,290
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:24,810
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,440
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:44,820
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,240
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:25,990
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,660
I see hi

1177
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:30,740
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:32,110
goku...

1179
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:48,090
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:50,090
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:51,360
You are...

1182
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:54,720
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:08,870
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,620
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:13,660
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:16,290
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:22,240
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:27,510
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:31,010
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:37,590
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:43,520
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,410 --> 01:36:52,270
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:58,490
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:03,510
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:08,010
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:09,540
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:30,110
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:35,820
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:39,660
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:53,970
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:59,390
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:08,520
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:11,320
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:14,520
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,660
Damn!

1206
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,490
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,820
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:25,120
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:26,420
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,870
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,960
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,690
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:45,390
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:49,360
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:50,890
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:58,190
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:01,710
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:16,220
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:27,810
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:31,470
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:37,570
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:39,610
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,010 --> 01:40:01,120
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:12,890
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:23,770
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:26,210
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:28,320
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:33,960
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,570
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:39,240
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,090
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:48,760
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:53,010
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:57,570
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:59,690
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:02,110
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,940
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,770
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,460
You bastard!

1240
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,520
You coward!

1241
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:16,120
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:17,840
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,760
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,010 --> 01:41:22,040
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:25,670
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,790
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:31,620
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:08,560
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:16,220
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:18,920
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:22,310
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,940
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:28,410
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:31,110
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:33,940
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,960
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:57,840
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:00,690
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:03,940
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:04,890 --> 01:43:08,390
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:12,360
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:16,820
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:26,790
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:31,790
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:34,170
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,470
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:41,090
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:46,760
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:50,770
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:53,440
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:58,190
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,190
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:05,740
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,010
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:11,290
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,290
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:19,840
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:27,520
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:32,310
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:36,440
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,520
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:50,040
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,120
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:58,540
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:03,090
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:06,060
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:10,010
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,310
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:16,360
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:19,570
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:24,110
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:27,070
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:29,690
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:32,960
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,260
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,870
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,040
And then,

1298
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:45,040
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:47,870
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,440
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,660
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:25,510
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:31,310
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:33,720
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,110 --> 01:46:45,520
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:24,190
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:27,270
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:32,190
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,130 --> 01:47:35,740
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:39,540
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,820
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:44,040
Yeah.

1313
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,210
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,890
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:52,470
Yeah.

1316
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:57,060
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,390 --> 01:48:01,140
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:06,590
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:13,070
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:16,570
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:21,520
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:23,840
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:30,870
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:43,640
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:49,640
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:54,890
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:58,660
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:02,160
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,910
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:08,540
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,910
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:12,790
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:16,560
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:19,560
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:32,820
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,520
Is that so...

1337
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:20,860
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:45,510
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:52,510
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,490 --> 01:51:01,610
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:12,610
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,430 --> 01:51:21,710
I see.

1343
01:51:31,230 --> 01:51:36,070
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:39,060
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,270
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:44,610
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:47,940
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:54,120
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:57,320
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:18,420
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:32,820
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:38,990
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:45,370
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:50,590
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:56,530
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,530 --> 01:53:03,640
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:16,460
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:23,380
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:29,270
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:36,760
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:42,340
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:50,940
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:07,190
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:13,930
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:20,180
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:25,360
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:31,310
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:38,360
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:45,460
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:52,040
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:10,340
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:30,960
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:48,390
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:54,360
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,360 --> 01:56:01,860
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:07,010
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:13,710
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:19,590
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,590 --> 01:56:31,460
Until I reach that distant future
