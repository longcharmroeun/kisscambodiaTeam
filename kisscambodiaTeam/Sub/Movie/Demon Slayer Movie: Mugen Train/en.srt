1
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,230
Kenichi...

2
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,020
Hideki...

3
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,930
Minoru...

4
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,150
Masao...

5
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,020
Susumu...

6
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,320
Yuta...

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,430
Yaichi..

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,570
Toyoaki...

9
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,450
Isao...

10
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,620
Ryosuke...

11
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,370
Yukio...

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,080
Takahiro...

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,020
Master, we should go.

14
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,600
It's not good for your health.

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,880
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,900
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

17
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,280
who died while I'm in charge.

18
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:57,330
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

19
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,000
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

20
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,830
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

21
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,320
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

22
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,880
MUGEN

23
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,000
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,720
Are the police still around?

25
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,500
We'll have to go even if they are.

26
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,480
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

27
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,680
Hey, idiot!

28
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,320
We should go, too!

29
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,520
Hey, don't leave me behind!

30
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,570
W-Wait up!

31
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,020
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

32
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,350
Zenitsu!

33
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,450
So fast!

34
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,450
Sorry! We're very sorry!

35
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,270
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

36
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,470
So freakin' fast!

37
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,380
Ma'am, is that all right?

38
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,270
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,720
Sorry to trouble you.

40
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,530
Oh no.

41
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,070
It's the least I can do.

42
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,820
He's a Hashira, right?

43
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,450
This Rengoku person...

44
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,730
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

45
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,830
Sure,

46
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,880
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

47
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,130
Hey!

48
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,550
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

49
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,300
Delicious!

50
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:30,330
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

51
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,950
Delicious!

52
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,620
Delicious!

53
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,630
Delicious!

54
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,630
Delicious!

55
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,220
Delicious!

56
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,720
Delicious!

57
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,300
Delicious!

58
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,720
Delicious!

59
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,980
Delicious!

60
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,230
Delicious!

61
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,480
Delicious!

62
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,780
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

63
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,000
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,870
Not just some random glutton?

65
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,480
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

66
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,950
Delicious!

67
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,250
Um, excuse me...

68
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,080
Delicious!

69
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,720
R-Rengoku?

70
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,550
Delicious!

71
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,800
Uh, we really get that part already.

72
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,570
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

73
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,650
Yes.

74
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,430
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

75
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,320
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

76
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,350
I see. And inside that box there...

77
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,570
Yes.

78
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,670
It's my sister Nezuko.

79
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,330
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

80
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,750
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

81
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,000
Have a seat here.

82
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,770
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

83
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,430
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

84
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,100
What are you three doing here?

85
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,930
A mission?

86
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,370
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

87
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,950
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

88
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,570
Yes! I see now! Understood!

89
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,700
Right.

90
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,730
Also, there's one more thing.

91
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,920
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

92
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,880
What is it? Let's hear it.

93
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,580
About my father...

94
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,630
What about your father?

95
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,330
Well, he was really frail.

96
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,670
Was he really?

97
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,150
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

98
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,850
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

99
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,150
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

100
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,570
The thing is...

101
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,570
What's up?

102
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,680
Hinokami Kagura...

103
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,230
Dance!

104
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,100
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

105
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,030
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

106
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,420
I was hoping you'd tell me.

107
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,870
Right!

108
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,280
But I know nothing!

109
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,520
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

110
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:34,130
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

111
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,520
All right, end of discussion!

112
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,600
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

113
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,430
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

114
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,120
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

115
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,070
He's totally weird, all right.

116
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,650
Flame Breathing has a long history.

117
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,280
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

118
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,730
Flame.

119
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,030
Water.

120
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,320
Wind.

121
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,630
Stone.

122
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,750
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

123
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,380
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,630
Mist is a fork of Wind.

125
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,500
Young Mizoguchi!

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,630
What color is your sword?

127
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,770
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

128
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,270
A black sword, huh?

129
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,320
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

130
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,320
For real?

131
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,970
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

132
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,330
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

133
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,280
Come to me, and I'll train you!

134
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,080
You can rest easy now!

135
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,580
No, thank you!

136
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,030
And just what are you looking at?

137
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,930
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

138
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,380
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

139
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,850
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

140
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,550
That's dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,450
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

142
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,370
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

143
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,120
You never know when a demon might appear.

144
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,620
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

145
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,380
Sure do!

146
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,550
What? They do?

147
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,220
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

148
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,970
Nooo!

149
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm getting off!

150
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,250
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

151
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,820
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

152
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,730
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

153
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,820
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

154
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,920
May I...

155
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,500
see your...

156
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,370
tickets, please?

157
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,780
What's he doing?

158
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,220
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

159
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,600
Here.

160
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,080
What is this?

161
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,500
There's a horrible scent,

162
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,750
Thank you...

163
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,920
very much.

164
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,520
Mr. Conductor...

165
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,650
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

166
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,150
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

167
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,000
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

168
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,470
I had a hard time detecting you.

169
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,930
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

170
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,880
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

171
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,120
Flame Breathing...

172
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,120
First Form...

173
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,750
Amazing.

174
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,250
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

175
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,250
There's still one more.

176
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,930
Come with me!

177
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,230
All right!

178
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,180
D-Don't leave me behind!

179
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,670
You will not lay a finger on that man!

180
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,600
Didn't you hear me?

181
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,520
I said I'm your opponent.

182
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,020
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

183
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,100
All right!

184
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,430
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

185
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,470
We gotta save the passenger first!

186
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,030
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

187
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,500
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

188
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,920
We're good to go now.

189
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,920
Let's finish him off in short order.

190
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,020
Flame Breathing...

191
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,020
Second Form...
192
00:15:06,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

192
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,200
Tha...

193
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,200
Tha...

194
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,130
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

195
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,970
Please make me your apprentice!

196
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,770
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

197
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,770
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

198
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,300
I'll train all of you!

199
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,220
Big Bro Rengoku!

200
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,720
Bro!

201
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,780
- Bro!
- Bro!

202
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,650
Big Bro Rengoku!

203
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,020
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

204
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,950
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

205
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,420
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

206
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm begging you.

207
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,370
I'm begging you.

208
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,280
Sure thing.

209
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,770
You did a good job.

210
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Go to sleep.

211
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,970
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

212
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,270
Excuse me.

213
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,450
What do you want us to do?

214
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,450
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

215
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,120
Wait here until then.

216
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:37,250
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

217
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,720
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

218
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,220
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

219
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,130
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

220
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,650
so that you can have blissful dreams.

221
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,820
Okay.

222
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,870
What's going on? What happened?

223
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,500
Calm down.

224
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,380
Calm down.

225
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,830
You have to calm down.

226
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,230
Hey!

227
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,230
It's Big Bro!

228
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Welcome home, Big Bro!

229
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,320
Did you sell the charcoal?

230
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,000
Big Bro?

231
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

232
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,570
To be able to die while dreaming...

233
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,120
Just how lucky are you?

234
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,480
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

235
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,780
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

236
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,300
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

237
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,670
You can kill them just like that!

238
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,970
All human hearts are the same.

239
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,180
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

240
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,400
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

241
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,730
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

242
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,080
Take a deep, slow breath...

243
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,000
while you count.

244
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,000
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

245
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,780
One...

246
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,170
Two...

247
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,850
Three...

248
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,770
Four...

249
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Five...

250
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,600
Six...

251
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,050
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

252
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,950
What a weirdo!

253
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,070
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

254
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,400
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

255
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,980
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?
257
00:21:48,710 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

256
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm all right.

257
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,500
Are you sure?

258
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,050
Hey! You come back here!

259
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,720
Gotcha!

260
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,880
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,880
Hey! You stop that right now!

262
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,680
I was having a bad dream or something.

263
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,650
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

264
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,020
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

265
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,780
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

266
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,200
Looks like fun.

267
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,780
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

268
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,530
You are falling...

269
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,050
You are falling...,

270
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,300
into a dream.

271
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
It's a deep slumber.

272
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,300
They can...

273
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,400
no longer awaken.

274
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,070
LOWER ONE

275
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,650
This way!

276
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,780
The peaches over here taste great!

277
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,220
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

278
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,300
I'll make you a chaplet!

279
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,720
I can make these really great-looking ones...

280
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,380
Nezuko!

281
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,050
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

282
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,420
Zenitsu?

283
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,730
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

284
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,980
River?

285
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,230
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

286
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,980
I can't swim.

287
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,000
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

288
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,000
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

289
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,500
Just leave it to me!

290
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,000
Let's go!

291
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,100
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

292
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,970
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

293
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,880
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

294
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,720
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

295
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,230
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

296
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,030
Boss!

297
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
Boss!

298
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,030
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

299
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,700
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

300
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,200
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

301
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,720
Here he is!

302
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,300
All right, let's go! Showdown!

303
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,170
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

304
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,750
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!
307
00:24:55,730 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

305
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,100
Let's go!

306
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,430
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,200
Why did I come here?

308
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,430
Oh, right.

309
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,930
To report to my father...

310
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,350
that I've become a Hashira.

311
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,530
So what if you've become a Hashira?

312
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,330
Worthless.

313
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,000
It means nothing.

314
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,000
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

315
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,300
'Neither you...

316
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,500
nor I.

317
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,930
Brother...

318
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,980
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

319
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:42,230
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

320
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,280
He wasn't always like that.

321
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,870
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

322
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,750
He was a passionate man.

323
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,080
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

324
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,450
Suddenly.

325
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,930
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

326
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,970
Why?

327
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,930
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

328
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,200
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

329
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,030
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

330
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,450
and just look at the state our father is in.

331
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,050
I'm going to be honest.

332
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,500
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

333
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,170
He told me that it meant nothing.

334
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,420
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

335
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,670
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

336
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,680
I'll never give in!

337
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,680
And Senjuro...

338
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,430
You're not like me.

339
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,900
ou have a big brother...

340
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,930
who believes in his little brother.

341
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,780
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

342
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

343
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,420
Let's do our best!

344
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,620
Let's do our best-and live on!

345
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,920
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

346
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,630
Looking good.

347
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
Those ropes that I created are used...

348
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,520
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

349
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,850
I always fight with the utmost caution.

350
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,200
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

351
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,570
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

352
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,130
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

353
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,250
Relax your shoulders.

354
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,920
Like this?

355
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
That's right.

356
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,130
Close call. He's right there.

357
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,180
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

358
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,770
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

359
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,680
Hurry!

360
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,900
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

361
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,070
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

362
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:39,000
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

363
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,920
That's what you must destroy.

364
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,670
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

365
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,180
There it is!

366
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,680
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

367
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,020
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

368
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,820
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

369
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,900
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

370
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,630
It's hot,

371
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,170
It's burning up.

372
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,470
I have to hurry.

373
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,020
Found it!

374
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,070
The spiritual core!

375
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,320
I've never seen a red one before.

376
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,580
All I have to do is destroy this and...

377
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,370
It'll be my turn to...

378
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:32,300
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

379
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,150
What a strong survival instinct he has!
383
00:31:44,740 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

380
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,230
Wow!

381
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,630
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

382
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,050
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

383
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,830
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

384
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,300
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

385
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,250
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

386
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,270
Can you get the grill ready for me?

387
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,820
Okay!

388
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,150
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

389
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,850
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

390
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,320
Me, too!

391
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,930
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

392
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,600
No fair!

393
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,030
There.

394
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,250
Nezuko, let's go.

395
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,600
What did I just say?

396
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,770
I'm back!

397
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,380
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

398
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,570
Yeah, I'm home!

399
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,200
Welcome home, Big Bro!

400
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,320
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

401
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,320
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

402
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,730
In broad daylight?

403
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,670
She's not supposed to?

404
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,080
Well...

405
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,550
Um...

406
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,750
Tanjiro...

407
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,830
Could you get the bath ready?

408
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,670
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

409
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,220
I keep saying all these strange things.

410
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,100
Am I tired maybe?

411
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,100
tis.gone.

412
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,680
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

413
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,530
A toolbox perhaps?

414
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,670
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

415
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,370
Wake up!

416
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,870
Wake up!

417
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,970
Wake up!

418
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,800
You're under attack!

419
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,050
It's a dream!

420
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,550
This is a dream!

421
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,050
I see... That's right, I'm...

422
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,220
on board the train!

423
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,070
Wake up and fight!

424
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,570
Fight!

425
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,450
Fight!

426
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,980
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

427
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,570
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

428
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,170
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

429
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,580
What's your problem?

430
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,420
You just had seconds!

431
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,670
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

432
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,000
How can I get out of it?

433
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,170
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

434
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,180
What am I supposed to do?

435
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,750
I have to wake up...

436
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,950
Big Bro!

437
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,070
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

438
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,920
Nezuko...

439
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,170
Nezuko!

440
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,050
My uniform...

441
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,500
My Nichirin Sword...

442
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,720
I'm waking up!

443
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,330
Little by little.

444
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,020
Little by little!

445
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,900
Big Bro?

446
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,070
Big Bro, are you all right?

447
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,270
Big Bro?

448
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,320
Sorry.

449
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,020
I have to go.

450
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,850
I have to hurry back!

451
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,870
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,280
Big Bro!

453
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,030
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

454
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,250
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

455
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,220
I have to find him and slash him right away!

456
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,270
Where is he? I have to...

457
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,800
Where are you going, Big Bro?
462
00:37:15,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I picked lots of vegetables today!

458
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,870
Mom! This way!

459
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,870
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

460
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,200
Mom?

461
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,980
Tanjiro, are you all right?

462
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,330
Big Bro...

463
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,880
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

464
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,930
I wish I could stay here...

465
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,730
forever.

466
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,120
I wish I could turn around and go back,

467
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,620
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

468
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,530
Right here.

469
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,780
If none of this had happened...

470
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,920
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

471
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:30,300
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

472
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,550
If none of this had happened...

473
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,050
I should be here
making charcoal every day

474
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,570
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

475
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,480
If none of this had happened...

476
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,900
f none of this had happenedos

477
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,220
But I've lost them now.

478
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,420
I can never go back!

479
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,330
Big Bro!

480
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,350
Don't leave us behind!

481
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,770
Sorry!

482
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

483
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,020
We can't be together anymore.

484
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,500
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

485
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,080
I'll be thinking of you all!

486
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,950
There are lots of things to thank you for.

487
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,430
Lots of things to be sorry for!

488
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,820
But I will never forget you!

489
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,550
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

490
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,550
So, please...

491
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,050
forgive me!

492
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,730
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

493
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,470
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

494
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,970
How can it be so beautiful?

495
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,480
It's so endlessly vast...

496
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,270
and...

497
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,270
also warm.

498
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,500
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

499
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,530
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

500
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,780
And that creepy naked boar...

501
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,370
Seriously, this is insane.

502
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,130
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

503
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,800
You stupid naked boar!

504
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,570
It's pitch-dark.

505
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,320
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

506
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,070
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

507
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,250
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

508
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,330
You must be kidding me.

509
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,050
What was that?

510
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,270
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

511
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,020
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

512
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,430
Where's Nezuko?

513
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,280
Wh-Who the heck knows?

514
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,280
All right, then... Die!

515
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,950
Nooo!

516
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,280
They're having trouble, aren't they?

517
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,180
I wonder why.

518
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,300
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

519
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,550
Oh well...

520
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,050
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

521
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,070
Not here.

522
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,780
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

523
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,650
What's this, though?

524
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,070
It's like there's a film over everything!

525
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,820
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

526
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,070
I can't tell the exact location!

527
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,120
I have to hurry!

528
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,580
Nezuko's bleeding!

529
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,830
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

530
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,750
What should I do?

531
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,720
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

532
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,220
Am I just asleep right now?

533
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,600
Tanjiro...

534
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,820
Take up your sword.

535
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,480
There's something you must cut.

536
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,780
There's something...

537
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,170
I must cut.

538
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,750
There's something I must cut...

539
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,780
in order to wake up.

540
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,880
I think I know what it is.

541
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,680
But what if I'm wrong?

542
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,930
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

543
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,930
there'll be no going back.

544
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,930
Don't hesitate! Do it!

545
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,570
You have to do it!

546
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,530
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

547
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,150
In other words...

548
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,820
what I have to cut is...

549
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,280
my own neck!

550
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,420
I'm all right. I'm alive.

551
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,980
Nezuko! Are you okay?

552
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,520
Nezuko...

553
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,600
Zenitsu...

554
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,400
Inosuke...

555
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,330
Rengoku...

556
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,500
Who are these people?

557
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:28,000
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

558
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,680
Rope...

559
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,330
What's this?

560
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,050
It's burned off.

561
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,520
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

562
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,520
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

563
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,680
This smell... The ticket!

564
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,720
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

565
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,820
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

566
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,730
This must be a demon's work!

567
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,280
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

568
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,230
I don't know why...

569
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,170
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

570
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,970
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

571
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,330
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

572
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,320
Zenitsu! Wake up!

573
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,570
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

574
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,430
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

575
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,680
Inosuke...

576
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,930
There, there... Sorry, okay?

577
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,580
Thanks.

578
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,450
You did a great job, Nezuko.

579
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,450
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

580
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,700
What can I do?

581
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,500
Rengoku

582
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,130
What are you doing?

583
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,130
Is a demon controlling her?

584
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,930
Get out of our way!

585
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:15,020
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

586
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,200
Is she acting of her own free will?

587
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,570
This man, too?

588
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,620
What do you think you're doing?

589
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,480
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

590
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:34,550
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

591
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,750
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

592
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,380
Is he the one who was connected to me?

593
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,220
Tuberculosis...

594
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,880
He's sick.

595
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,880
Poor man.

596
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,900
What this demon did is unforgivable.

597
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,980
He took advantage of their weak souls!

598
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,070
Sorry.

599
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,570
I have to go fight.

600
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,770
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

601
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,150
I was willing...

602
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:55,370
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

603
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,370
But it was warm...

604
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,130
inside your dream and inside your soul.

605
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,130
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

606
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,900
Is that his spiritual core?

607
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,900
Why are you showing it to me?

608
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:36,030
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

609
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,370
No way!

610
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,700
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

611
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,000
Why would you...

612
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:57,050
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

613
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,130
Are you all right?

614
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,880
Thank you.

615
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,270
Be careful.

616
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,370
Right!

617
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,780
Nezuko!

618
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,580
The smell is overpowering!

619
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,830
So heavy!

620
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,830
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

621
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,830
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

622
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,470
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

623
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,330
I can't believe I was!

624
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,180
I was useless!

625
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,570
The demon's upwind...

626
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,350
Is he in the first car?

627
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,480
Nezuko, don't come!

628
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,480
Stay away from me and wait!

629
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,650
Go wake everyone up!

630
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,750
What? You're awake?

631
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,580
Good morning!

632
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,670
You could've stayed asleep.

633
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,170
It was him!

634
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,100
Why did you wake up?

635
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,100
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

636
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:30,100
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

637
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,880
Would you have liked that one better?

638
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,530
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

639
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,320
All right, next...

640
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,570
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

641
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,830
What I really love..,

642
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:02,830
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

643
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,350
I get such a kick out of that!

644
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:19,600
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

645
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,100
But I don't usually let my guard down.

646
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,120
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

647
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,330
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

648
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:37,870
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

649
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,170
the spell activates,

650
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,970
And yet...

651
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:50,020
how did this one manage to wake up?

652
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,880
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

653
00:52:54,550 --> 00:53:01,320
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

654
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,950
is so enormous!

655
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:11,150
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

656
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,820
I won't let you...

657
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,620
get away with this!

658
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,830
How lucky is that?

659
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,380
So, he came right to me!

660
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,080
This is like a dream!

661
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:37,650
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

662
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:41,770
And once I become more powerful,

663
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:46,650
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

664
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,950
Water Breathing...

665
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,620
Tenth Form...

666
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,120
Constant Flux!

667
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,330
Blood Demon Art!

668
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,100
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

669
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,100
Go to sleep!

670
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,130
He's not falling asleep.

671
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:29,780
Go to sleep.

672
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,280
Go to sleep.

673
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,670
Go to sleep!

674
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:53,130
Go... to... sleep!

675
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,420
It's not working. But why not?

676
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:03,480
He's falling under this spell over and over!

677
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,400
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

678
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,170
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

679
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:32,030
to take his own life with his own hands...

680
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,800
that takes incredible willpower!

681
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,720
This brat...

682
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,630
is insane!

683
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,120
Why didn't you save us?

684
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,980
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

685
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,750
How could you be the only one to survive?

686
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,330
Why do you think you were here?

687
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,750
You're so useless!

688
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:32,480
It should've been you that died.

689
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,850
How dare you go on living
without a care.

690
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,620
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

691
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,000
Don't you dare...

692
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,950
insult...

693
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,080
my family!

694
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,780
It was way too easy.

695
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,370
Could this be a dream, too?

696
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:30,730
Or was this demon weaker than him?

697
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,730
I can totally see why...

698
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:39,330
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

699
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,500
along with the Hashira!

700
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,000
Your very existence is, like...

701
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,330
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

702
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,100
He's not dying?

703
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:56,270
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

704
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,680
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

705
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:06,430
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

706
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:11,030
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

707
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,500
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

708
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:21,530
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

709
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,030
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

710
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,050
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

711
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:32,550
While you were snoozing away...

712
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,430
I fused with this train!

713
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:44,570
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

714
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,120
Look at your face.

715
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:50,320
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

716
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,450
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

717
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:58,370
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

718
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,830
as well as my hostages.

719
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,380
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

720
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:11,580
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

721
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,900
What should I do? What should I do?

722
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,600
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

723
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,320
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

724
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,530
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

725
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,170
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

726
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,080
Nezuko!

727
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,920
Protect the sleeping passengers!

728
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,550
Follow me, damn minions!

729
00:59:58,890 --> 00:59:59,880
All right!

730
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,100
Explosive Awakening!

731
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,300
Comin' through!

732
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:09,070
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

733
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,320
Inosuke!

734
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,820
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

735
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,070
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

736
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,820
This whole train's turned into a demon!

737
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:21,070
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

738
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:26,630
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

739
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,630
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

740
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,880
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

741
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,380
Crazy Cutting!

742
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:48,400
I'll save every last one of you guys!

743
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,460
Fall onto your knees...

744
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,650
and worship me!

745
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,650
Glorify me!

746
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:59,980
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

747
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,750
I have to go save the passengers!

748
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:06,830
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

749
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,350
It's gone this far already?

750
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:38,620
Water Breathing...

751
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,480
First Form...

752
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,780
Water Surface Slash!

753
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,320
No good.

754
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,650
This is never going to end!

755
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:50,980
How am I supposed to fend it off?

756
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:03,000
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

757
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,830
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

758
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,930
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

759
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,300
Thunder Breathing...

760
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,420
First Form...

761
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,520
Thunderclap and Flash!

762
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:39,770
Sixfold.

763
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,520
I'll protect you...

764
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,770
Nezuko!

765
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,020
Protect...

766
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,450
That sounded like thunder,

767
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,280
From one of the cars in the back?

768
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:00,250
What's going on?

769
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,120
Is Zenitsu awake now?

770
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,080
What about Rengoku?

771
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,370
And Nezuko?

772
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,050
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

773
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:16,380
This is bad! What should I do?

774
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:18,020
We can't fight in coordination!

775
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:21,270
Are the passengers in the back all right?

776
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,680
Damn!

777
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,550
It's so cramped!

778
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,370
And so hard to swing my sword!

779
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,870
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

780
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,450
How could this be?

781
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:43,380
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

782
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,220
If only I could crawl...

783
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:49,880
under a rock!

784
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,050
What happened?

785
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,600
What was that?

786
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,230
A demon attack?

787
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,020
Young Kamado!

788
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,020
Rengoku!

789
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:17,750
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

790
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,370
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

791
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,950
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

792
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:23,870
Okay!

793
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,120
This train has eight cars in all.

794
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,370
I'll protect the five in the rear.

795
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:32,620
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

796
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,520
You and the boar head boy...

797
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,430
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

798
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:39,720
Head?

799
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,180
But this demon is

800
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,970
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

801
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:47,380
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

802
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,520
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

803
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,570
Amazing! I can't even see him!

804
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,950
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

805
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,450
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

806
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,700
Five cars, all by himself?

807
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:09,800
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

808
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,670
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

809
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,920
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

810
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,050
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

811
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,180
But somehow...

812
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:29,180
Somehow...

813
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:31,930
Somehow, he was awesome!

814
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,770
I'm so pissed!

815
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:38,400
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

816
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,230
You don't have to tell me!

817
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:43,670
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

818
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,670
With my all-out Seventh Form...

819
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,780
I found this master's weak spot!

820
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,200
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

821
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,700
That's right, up front!

822
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,530
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

823
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:59,530
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

824
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,880
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

825
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,430
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

826
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,470
That's right!

827
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:06,380
Understood!

828
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,520
Okay, let's go!

829
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:10,020
Forward!

830
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,530
This is it, huh?

831
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:28,870
All right!

832
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,330
Inosuke!

833
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,580
Fishy, very fishy!

834
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,970
Especially around here!

835
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:44,330
Who the hell are you?

836
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:46,330
G-Get out of here!

837
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,330
The demon's head...

838
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,830
The demon's...

839
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,600
weak spot!

840
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:57,730
Gross!

841
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:00,070
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

842
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:03,980
That's way too many hands!

843
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,520
Uh-oh!

844
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:11,280
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

845
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,780
Whirlpool!

846
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:22,420
Inosuke, are you all right?

847
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,920
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

848
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,930
Yeah, I know!

849
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:29,880
It's here...

850
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:32,350
It's right beneath!

851
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,520
Directly below this place.

852
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,270
The demon's scent is powerful!

853
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:44,900
Just watch.

854
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,030
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

855
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,150
Slice!

856
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,650
It's the bone.

857
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:00,550
His neck bone!

858
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:04,000
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

859
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,330
Waterfall Basin!

860
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,170
It blocked it!

861
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,900
The gash is closing up!

862
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,180
It's regenerating so fast!

863
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:35,870
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

864
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,950
I have to sever it!

865
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:41,780
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

866
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:46,530
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

867
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:49,250
Sounds good! Great idea!

868
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,780
I can praise you for that!

869
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:51,930
Thanks!

870
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,850
Let's go!

871
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,220
DREAM

872
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:06,970
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

873
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,480
A Blood Demon Art!

874
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:12,150
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

875
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,530
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

876
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:17,900
Then, you'll wake up!

877
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,730
It's all right!

878
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,130
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

879
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:32,130
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

880
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:35,340
Okay, I'm awake!

881
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:45,850
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

882
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:48,680
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

883
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:50,480
With my eyes shut!

884
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,270
No good!

885
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,600
Wake up!

886
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,350
Wake up!

887
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,350
Hurry!

888
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:58,850
Cut the neck!

889
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,870
Cut it! Cut it!

890
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,950
I have to wake up!

891
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,120
Hurry!

892
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,780
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

893
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,020
Don't fall for his trap!

894
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:19,550
Don't die such lame deaths!

895
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:27,050
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

896
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,220
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

897
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,350
You loser eyeballs!

898
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:38,400
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

899
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:42,480
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

900
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:47,900
Inosuke!

901
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,300
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

902
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,830
Did you get stabbed?

903
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,220
I'm okay.

904
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:05,670
Just forget about that bastard!

905
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,170
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

906
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:13,020
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

907
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:15,480
I know! Let's get moving!

908
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:33,670
Inosuke!

909
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:35,830
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

910
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,700
And let's chop off the demon's head!

911
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,580
Let's attack together!

912
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:17,550
No good! If I fall asleep now...

913
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,050
Damn you!
919
01:13:17,730 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Follow me!

914
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,550
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

915
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,250
Slice 'n' Dice!

916
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,600
Father, please protect me!

917
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:39,180
I'm going to sever that bone...

918
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,230
with this blow!

919
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:43,350
Hinokami Kagura...

920
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,020
Clear Blue Sky!

921
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:13,470
Are you okay, Inosuke?

922
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,380
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

923
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:17,720
Y-Yeah!

924
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,350
Inosuke, protect the passen

925
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,430
I can't die.

926
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:27,980
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

927
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:29,400
I can't die!

928
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:34,200
I don't want to let anyone die!

929
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,400
Are you okay, Santaro?

930
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,400
Hang in there!

931
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,350
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

932
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:12,270
Cool, huh?

933
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,180
Is your belly okay?

934
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,230
Your belly that got stabbed!

935
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:17,580
I'm...

936
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,530
all right.

937
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:21,280
What about you?

938
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,700
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

939
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:28,280
I won't be able to move for a while.

940
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,200
Help the others, will you?

941
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,630
Was anyone injured?

942
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:40,270
What about the engineer near the head?

943
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,770
It's okay if that bastard dies!

944
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:47,220
It's not okay.

945
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:49,850
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

946
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:53,280
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

947
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:55,980
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

948
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,450
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

949
01:15:57,870 --> 01:16:01,570
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

950
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:04,030
Help him, will you?

951
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,280
Please.

952
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,220
I'll go for you, then!

953
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,880
Because I'm the boss!

954
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,130
Because my minion asked me to!

955
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:24,550
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

956
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,480
That's really not necessary.

957
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:35,070
It's almost dawn.

958
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,480
Get your breathing under control.

959
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,730
We have to...

960
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:42,750
save the injured...

961
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:44,870
before it's too late.

962
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,600
My body's disintegrating.

963
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:07,720
I can't regenerate,

964
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,800
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

965
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:12,980
Me?

966
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,600
Ridiculous.

967
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:18,620
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

968
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:22,120
I couldn't devour a single human!

969
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:27,620
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

970
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:30,620
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

971
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:34,170
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

972
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,130
It was him!

973
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,250
It's all his fault!

974
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:44,080
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

975
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,550
I was held at bay!

976
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,380
Is this the power of a Hashira?

977
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,730
And him... He was fast, too.

978
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,180
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

979
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:59,730
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

980
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:02,100
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

981
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,400
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

982
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:09,420
Dammit! Dammit!

983
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,200
In the first place...

984
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:15,950
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

985
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,700
That brat is to blame!

986
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,530
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

987
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,450
That's right, and that boar, too!

988
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,300
I could've at least killed that brat!

989
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:33,520
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

990
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,720
He could sense my gaze!

991
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:38,800
Am I going to lose?

992
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,100
Am I going to die?

993
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:46,480
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

994
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:52,480
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

995
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,150
In the Upper Ranks...

996
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:57,870
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

997
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:02,830
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

998
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,830
Do they have otherworldly powers?

999
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:11,720
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

1000
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,900
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

1001
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:22,570
What a miserable nightmare this is...

1002
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:32,400
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

1003
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,370
Impressive!

1004
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,030
Rengoku...

1005
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,500
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

1006
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:43,870
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

1007
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,530
I'll do my best.

1008
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:49,420
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

1009
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,220
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

1010
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:56,720
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

1011
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,720
There's a blood vessel.

1012
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:00,770
A torn blood vessel.

1013
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,100
Concentrate harder!

1014
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,830
Focus!

1015
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,830
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

1016
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:43,770
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

1017
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,430
Not that you'll be able to do everything,
1024
01:20:45,190 --> 00:00:00,000
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

1018
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,600
Right.

1019
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:56,750
Everyone's safe!

1020
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,950
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

1021
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,780
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

1022
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,700
Thank you very much.

1023
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,980
Upper... Three?

1024
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,700
What's he doing here and now?

1025
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:00,630
Flame Breathing, Second Form...
1033
01:22:01,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1026
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,400
That's a fine sword.

1027
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,180
He sure can regenerate fast.

1028
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:22,900
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

1029
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,650
So, this is an Upper Rank,

1030
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:29,200
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

1031
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:34,530
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

1032
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,120
What would you and I have to talk about?

1033
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:41,530
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

1034
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,930
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

1035
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:48,880
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

1036
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,470
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

1037
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:57,720
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

1038
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:00,570
Why don't you become a demon, too?

1039
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,070
I will not.

1040
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:05,900
I can tell your strength at a glance,

1041
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,530
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

1042
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:10,320
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

1043
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,980
It's close to the realm of the highest.

1044
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:17,170
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

1045
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,630
I'm Akaza.

1046
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:20,970
Kyojuro...

1047
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:26,130
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

1048
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:27,970
Because you're a human.

1049
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,250
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

1050
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:35,400
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1051
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,820
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

1052
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,400
You can become stronger.

1053
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:48,900
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

1054
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,170
I have to help him fight!

1055
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:58,620
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

1056
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:02,170
The fact that we grow old and die

1057
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,670
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

1058
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:11,770
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

1059
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,930
This boy isn't weak!

1060
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,050
Don't insult him.

1061
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:23,100
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

1062
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,370
You and I have different senses of value.

1063
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,950
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

1064
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:37,450
I see.

1065
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,230
Technique Development...

1066
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,300
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1067
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:19,530
I can't follow their movements!

1068
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:23,450
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

1069
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:27,200
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

1070
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:33,530
Why do you think that is?

1071
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:37,850
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

1072
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,770
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

1073
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:51,150
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

1074
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:53,480
It pains me! I can't bear it!

1075
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:56,230
Die, Kyojuro...

1076
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:58,320
while you're still young and strong.

1077
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,230
Destructive Death..

1078
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:04,820
Air Type!

1079
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,080
I see.

1080
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,130
Flame Breathing...

1081
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:24,630
Fourth Form...

1082
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,730
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1083
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:32,070
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

1084
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,600
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

1085
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:48,500
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

1086
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,750
In that case...

1087
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:56,450
I'll just have to get up close!

1088
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:00,100
This superb reaction speed of yours...

1089
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,050
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

1090
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,630
Kyojuro!

1091
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,130
Doesn't that make you sad?

1092
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,550
It happens to everyone!

1093
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,020
It's a fact of life for any human!

1094
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,020
Stay where you are!

1095
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:18,320
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

1096
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,900
Stand back! That's an order!

1097
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,280
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

1098
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,150
Come on, give me your best shot!

1099
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,150
Concentrate on me.

1100
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:43,920
Nice moves!

1101
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,400
Rengoku!

1102
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,770
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

1103
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,020
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

1104
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:07,150
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

1105
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,500
You have what it takes to do that!

1106
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,750
I'll pass!

1107
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:20,450
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

1108
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,220
I will not become a demon!

1109
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:33,130
Blazing Universe!

1110
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:38,050
Magnificent! That's sensational!

1111
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,100
Destructive Death..

1112
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,200
Air Type!

1113
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,150
There's no opening.

1114
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:53,650
I can't jump in.

1115
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:56,530
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

1116
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,300
Those two are in a different dimension!

1117
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:03,670
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

1118
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,670
I can't move...

1119
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,580
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

1120
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,050
Rengoku...

1121
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,100
You still don't get it?

1122
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:25,770
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

1123
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:36,830
Flame Breathing, First Form...

1124
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:38,120
Unknowing Fire!

1125
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,750
It would be a shame to kill you now!

1126
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,450
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

1127
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,430
Second Form...
1136
01:29:52,110 --> 00:00:00,000
Rising Scorching Sun!

1128
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,150
Third Form...

1129
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,870
Blazing Universe!

1130
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:19,370
Fourth Form...

1131
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:21,700
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1132
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,830
Destructive Death..

1133
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:28,420
Fifth Form...

1134
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,130
Flame Tiger!

1135
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,220
Disorder!

1136
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:40,830
Kyojuro!

1137
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,950
Did he do it? Did he win?

1138
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:30,020
Don't tell me...

1139
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:38,070
No way!

1140
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,070
Let's fight more.

1141
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:51,250
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

1142
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:11,020
Rengoku!

1143
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,930
Rengoku!

1144
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:26,170
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

1145
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:33,620
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

1146
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:35,950
But what about you?

1147
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:40,920
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

1148
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,130
All irreparable.

1149
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,270
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

1150
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:50,020
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

1151
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:54,220
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

1152
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,720
I want to go help him!

1153
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,900
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

1154
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,320
It's partly because of my injury,

1155
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,370
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

1156
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:25,080
Kyojuro, why...

1157
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,080
I will fulfill my duty!

1158
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:35,730
I will not allow anyone here to die!

1159
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:40,570
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

1160
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,980
Flame Breathing...

1161
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:52,170
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

1162
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:55,080
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

1163
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:57,080
That mental strength!

1164
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:00,080
That airtight stance!

1165
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:06,080
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

1166
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:09,350
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

1167
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:11,180
Set your heart ablaze.

1168
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:13,930
Go beyond your limits!

1169
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:21,100
Ninth Form...

1170
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:23,550
Rengoku!

1171
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,070
Destructive Death..

1172
01:34:25,370 --> 01:34:26,700
Annihilation Type!

1173
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,080
Rengoku!

1174
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:19,500
Rengoku!

1175
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:26,250
Rengoku!

1176
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:29,920
I see hi

1177
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:31,000
Ren...

1178
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,370
goku...

1179
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,350
Become a demon!

1180
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:50,350
Say that you'll become a demon!

1181
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:51,620
You are...

1182
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,980
strong and one of the chosen ones!

1183
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:09,130
Kyojuro...

1184
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,880
Yes, Mother?

1185
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,920
I want you to think hard...

1186
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,550
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

1187
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:22,500
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

1188
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:27,770
I don't know!

1189
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:31,270
So that you can save weaker people.

1190
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:37,850
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

1191
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:43,780
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

1192
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:52,530
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

1193
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:58,750
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

1194
01:36:59,470 --> 01:37:03,770
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

1195
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:08,270
Make sure you never forget that.

1196
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:09,800
I won't!

1197
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,370
I don't have much more time to live.

1198
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:36,080
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

1199
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:39,920
I will entrust everything to you.

1200
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:54,230
Mother...

1201
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:59,650
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

1202
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:08,780
He stopped it?

1203
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,580
What unbelievable strength!

1204
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:14,780
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

1205
01:38:16,450 --> 01:38:17,920
Damn!

1206
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:19,750
It'll be daybreak soon!

1207
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:23,080
I have to kill him and get out of here!

1208
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:25,380
I can't...

1209
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:26,680
pull my arm out!

1210
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:31,130
I won't let you escape!

1211
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:41,220
No matter what Rengoku says...

1212
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:43,950
I have to...

1213
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:45,650
do it right now!

1214
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:49,620
I have to slice off the demon's head!

1215
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:51,150
Quickly!
1225
01:38:52,290 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's coming up!

1216
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:58,450
There'll be sunlight here!

1217
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:01,970
I have to get away!

1218
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:16,480
Not until I chop off your head!

1219
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:28,070
Move, Inosuke!

1220
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:31,730
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

1221
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,830
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

1222
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:39,870
Pierce!

1223
01:39:58,270 --> 01:40:01,380
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

1224
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:13,150
That took too long!
1235
01:40:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to get away from the sun!

1225
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,030
Don't run away!

1226
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:26,470
Don't run away, you coward!

1227
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:28,580
Don't run away!

1228
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:34,220
What the hell is that brat talking about?

1229
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:36,830
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

1230
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,500
I'm not running away from you!
1242
01:40:38,180 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm running away from the sun!

1231
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:45,350
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

1232
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:49,020
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

1233
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:53,270
The Demon Slayer Corps...

1234
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:57,830
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

1235
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,950
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

1236
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:02,370
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

1237
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:05,200
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

1238
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,030
Don't run away, you bastard!

1239
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:09,720
You bastard!

1240
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,780
You coward!

1241
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:16,380
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

1242
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:18,100
He's stronger!

1243
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:20,020
Rengoku didn't lose!

1244
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:22,300
He didn't let anybody die!

1245
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:25,930
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

1246
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:28,050
You're the one who lost!

1247
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:31,880
It's Rengoku who won!

1248
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:08,820
Stop yelling already.

1249
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,480
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

1250
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:19,180
You're badly injured, too, remember?

1251
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,570
If you die, young Kamado,

1252
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:25,200
it'll mean I'm the loser.

1253
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:28,670
Rengoku...

1254
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:31,370
Come over here.

1255
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:34,200
Let's talk a bit one last time.

1256
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:54,220
There's something that I remembered...

1257
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:58,100
while I was dreaming.

1258
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:00,950
You should go to my parents' home,

1259
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:04,200
the Rengoku residence.

1260
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:08,650
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

1261
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,620
My father read them often,

1262
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:17,080
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

1263
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:27,050
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

1264
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:32,050
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

1265
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:34,430
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

1266
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,730
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

1267
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:41,350
I'll be dead soon.

1268
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:47,020
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

1269
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:51,030
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

1270
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:53,700
to follow his heart...

1271
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:58,450
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

1272
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:02,450
Tell my father...

1273
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:06,000
that I want him to take care of himself.

1274
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:09,270
One more thing.

1275
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:11,550
Young Kamado...

1276
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:16,550
I believe in your little sister.

1277
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,100
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

1278
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:27,780
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

1279
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:32,570
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

1280
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:36,700
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

1281
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,780
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

1282
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:50,300
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

1283
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,380
set your heart ablaze.

1284
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:58,800
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

1285
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:03,350
Even if you stop and crouch down,

1286
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:06,320
the time won't wait for you...

1287
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:10,270
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

1288
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:14,570
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

1289
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:16,620
As a Hashira,

1290
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:19,830
of course I would shield my juniors.

1291
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:24,370
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

1292
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,330
We never let the young buds get nipped.

1293
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,950
Young Kamado...

1294
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:33,220
Young Boar Head...

1295
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:35,520
Yellow Boy...

1296
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:39,130
Keep learning and grow.

1297
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,300
And then,

1298
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:45,300
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

1299
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,130
I believe in you.

1300
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:51,700
I believe in you all.

1301
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,920
Mother...

1302
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:25,770
Do you think I did it right?

1303
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:31,570
Did
carry out what I had to do...

1304
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:33,980
and my duties?

1305
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:45,780
You made me proud.

1306
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,450
When the train went off the rails,

1307
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:27,530
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

1308
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:32,450
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

1309
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:36,000
I guess he did.

1310
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,800
I can't believe he's gone.

1311
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:43,080
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

1312
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:44,300
Yeah.

1313
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:47,470
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

1314
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:51,150
Was it that strong? I mean...

1315
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:52,730
Yeah.

1316
01:47:55,150 --> 01:47:57,320
I'm so frustrated!

1317
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:01,400
As soon as I master one thing,

1318
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:06,850
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

1319
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:13,330
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

1320
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,830
I just can't make it there yet!

1321
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,780
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

1322
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,100
Can I...

1323
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:31,130
ever become like Rengoku?

1324
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:43,900
Stop whining already!

1325
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:49,900
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

1326
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:55,150
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

1327
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:58,920
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

1328
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:02,420
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

1329
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:05,170
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

1330
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,800
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

1331
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,170
you still have to go on living!

1332
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:13,050
But you're crying, too.

1333
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,820
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

1334
01:49:17,690 --> 01:49:19,820
I'm not crying!

1335
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:33,080
Get over here! We're gonna train!

1336
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:18,780
Is that so...

1337
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:21,120
Rengoku...

1338
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:45,770
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

1339
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:52,770
I don't believe it.

1340
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:01,870
Namu Amida Butsu.

1341
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:12,870
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

1342
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:21,970
I see.

1343
01:51:31,490 --> 01:51:36,330
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

1344
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:39,320
did a great job, then.

1345
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:41,530
What a remarkable child.

1346
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:44,870
I'm not sad.

1347
01:51:45,290 --> 01:51:48,200
I don't have much longer to live, either.

1348
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,380
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

1349
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,580
in the land of the dead.

1350
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,680
Rengoku!

1351
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:33,080
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

1352
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:39,250
What's more important than grief

1353
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:45,630
Hoping that they reach you as we part

1354
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:50,850
In time for the warmth and pain

1355
01:52:50,850 --> 01:52:56,790
I thought it would always be like this

1356
01:52:56,790 --> 01:53:03,900
I envisioned our days-to come

1357
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:16,720
Still burn deep in our hearts?

1358
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:23,640
We met amidst a blazing journey

1359
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:29,530
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

1360
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:37,020
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

1361
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:42,600
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

1362
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:51,200
With my resolve as the parting gift

1363
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:07,450
Held captive by nostalgic memories

1364
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:14,190
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

1365
01:54:14,190 --> 01:54:20,440
There will be even more as I grow older

1366
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:25,620
I never want to lose anything again

1367
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:31,570
By succumbing to the grief

1368
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:38,620
I might not feel pain anymore

1369
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:45,720
But your words, your wishes

1370
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:52,300
I swore to protect them to the end

1371
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:10,600
With a roar, it's crumbling down

1372
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:31,220
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

1373
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:48,650
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

1374
01:55:48,650 --> 01:55:54,620
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

1375
01:55:54,620 --> 01:56:02,120
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

1376
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:07,270
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

1377
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:13,970
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

1378
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:19,850
Lighting the flames in my heart

1379
01:56:19,850 --> 01:56:31,720
Until I reach that distant future
