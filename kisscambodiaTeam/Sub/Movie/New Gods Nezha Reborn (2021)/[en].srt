[exhales]
I came back.

354
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,166
Oh, Kasha,
you haven't visited here in ages.

355
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,583
Aren't I here now?

Jinxiang, what brings you here?

361
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,458
So Anti-Smuggling Bureau
made another bust.

362
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,041
Dropped off the report to my boss.

363
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,500
So I was in the area.

364

[Old Li] We're not rich,
but we're not poor either.

383
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:24,041
At least, every cent I have,
I made honorably.

[Jinxiang] Lucky for us,
the Anti-Smuggling Bureau still has water.

391
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,833
Otherwise, there would be
no dinner tonight.

Really, we're in the best shape.

The areas under the other clans,
it's just chaos.

It's tough right now,
but it could always be worse.

Sure, the De Clan is strict,
but they're fair.

Hmm… You didn't hear this from me.

How did I get here?

546

I was on duty.

Allow me to apologize for my son.

Please forgive him
for his foolish actions.

Mr. De, I'm very sorry.

My younger brother, he has such a temper.

600
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,833
[Yaksa] Boss, is it really him?

601
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:21,666
[Ao Guang] Unless he's a mortal
who found power by some miracle,

602
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,833
I'm afraid that it really is him.

603
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:26,875
It happens the same way
in every reincarnation.

604
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:28,125
[Yaksa] But why?

605
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,416

The Will of Heaven.

There can be no other way.

It must play out like this in every cycle.

608
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:40,666
Before he masters his power, kill him.

609

[Ao Guang] Just as we've always done.

610

614
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,166

you accept it.

-After what they did to Kasha's leg?

Kasha will get the best treatment.

-This is the way life is. Just accept it.
-I'll never accept it!

622
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:16,208
Do whatever you want,
but think about Kasha, okay?

623
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,208

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,208
I live here…

[Ao Guang] It doesn't surprise me
their total defeat.

708
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,833
Father, please let me be the one
to defeat him for you.

709
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:38,083
[Ao Bing] I started this.
Let me finish it.

710
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,875
[Ao Guang chuckles]

711
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,083

Father, he hurt you too?

724
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,583
Yes, once long ago.

725
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:26,500
Me, Dragon King of the East Sea.

[ice cracking]

[Ao Guang] He is a terrible foe.

731

His power is incredible
and he shows no mercy.

732
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,041
He's killed gods and demons.

733
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,500
Men, women, children, he doesn't care.

734
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:59,916
He would kill his own father
without thinking.

735
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,916
His name is Nezha.

Oh, look who the cat dragged in.

747
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,250
Why did you call me Nezha?

748
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,583
Oh, because that's who you are.

749
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,416
Oh, listen. When you were a kid,
did anyone tell you

750
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,416
about the story of Nezha
and the Dragon King?

751
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,791
Yeah, I heard that story.

752
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,291
Well, you are that Nezha.

753
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:59,375
Chaos-creating, sea-churning,
insufferably arrogant Nezha!

754
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:00,875
So, what's up, Nezha?

Hey, hey, hey, seriously.
You guys are wild camping a grill here.

759
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,833
Wait, what was I just saying?

760
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,666
-That I'm Nezha.
-[Masked Man] Hoo-hoo! Right.

761
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,208
With each reincarnation,
you get a new name and identity,

762
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,291
new parents, sibling, friends,

763
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:24,625
and, basically, play a few rounds
at the character casino.

764
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,458
You got a girlfriend? Huh?

765
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, do you? Do you?

766
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,875
[crazy laughter]

767
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,750
Mr. De is the Dragon King of the East Sea.

768
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,041
His son, that little bastard,

769
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,250
is the Dragon King's Third Prince,
Ao Bing.

770
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,750
[Ao Bing grunts]

771
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,791
So in a past life, he killed me?

772
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:45,333
Your father used all his powers
to forge you a steel dragon spine

773
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,791
and bring you back to life.

774
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:48,916
[crackles]

775
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,458
[Yaksa] But the injury wiped away
all memories of your past life.

776
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,916
[corals clinking]

777
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,916
[Ao Guang] Three thousand years ago,

778
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,333
the four Dragon Kings agreed
to stop fighting one another.

779
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:07,250
We united, and forced Nezha
to kill himself for his crimes.

780
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:12,458
But even after his death,
a part of his soul escaped our trap

781
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,958
to be reincarnated again and again.

782
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:18,708
Everyone believes the Jing Clan
holds Nezha in their prison.

783
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,166
[Yaksa] But they hold nothing
but a wooden statue.

784
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,166
The real Nezha is still out there.

785
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,666
So for 3,000 years,
we've been guarding Donghai by ourselves.

786
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,416
If we suspect anyone
to be his reincarnation,

787
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,083
we make sure the man dies.

788
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:37,458
It's the only way to keep us safe.

794
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:57,458
Well, that's your primordial spirit.
You are the reincarnation of Nezha, man!

795
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:00,791
[exclaims]
What you doing up there? Let's drink.

796
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:03,250
Wha--
[sighs]

797
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,583
Ah, Nezha always had
that terrible unrelenting fire.

798
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:09,541
Once it gets released, oh, boy, watch out!
[snickers]

799
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,458
Not even you can control it.

Oh! Full disclosure. Even I'm scared.

804
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,291
So if I'm Nezha, then who are you?

805
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,541
Me?

806
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:26,083
Oh, sorry, buddy,
I am not going to tell you that.

807
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,125

809
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500
This reincarnation is especially powerful.

810
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,708
We cannot provoke him.

811
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,000
Without my revenge,
what kind of Dragon Prince am I?

Now leave me.

I don't have the Dragon Pearl.

827

I can't yet face him myself.

828
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:21,166

we hire someone who can.

you've done excellent work before.

00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,375
Don't act so surprised.

[grill squeaking]

846
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,125
I recognize this fish.

847
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,458
Oh, yeah? It's really tasty.
Go on. Have some.

848
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,958
You saw it all.

849
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:22,458
Ooh, yeah, I was passing by.
I couldn't help but notice.

850
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,666
He's just a kid.

851
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,041
[Masked Man] Why is he
so important to you, huh?

852
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:29,625
If you really want him dead,
there are plenty of assassins in Donghai

853
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,708
a lot cheaper than me.

854
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,833

00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,375

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,875
Sounds like you've got a problem, hmm?

[squealing]

860
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:49,833
You expect me to believe
you didn't know already.

861
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:54,375
Ooh, lots of other people have fire powers
like, uh… the Fire Imp, remember?

862
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:58,250
[gasps]
Wait, if the kid really is Nezha,

863
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,333
I don't stand a chance against him either.

-[gasps]

867
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,625
[Yaksa] We trust you have plenty
of tricks up your sleeve.

00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:13,125
Oh, impressive, Yaksa,
you know a lot of things.

869
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:18,041
But if you know so much, how come
Nezha defeat you in every lifetime?

870
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,875
We all have our roles to play.

871
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:23,083
Mine sometimes means to lose.

872
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,875
Yours is to disappear.

00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:28,916
However, an enemy will knock
on your door one day,

874
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,291
so that even if you turn
yourself into a rat,

875
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,083
you won't be able to hide.

876
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,708
A rat?

877
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,958
Good idea! Hoo-hoo! A rat!

[mimicking rat squeaks]

879
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,625
[Ao Guang] I'm sure you know

880
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,916
that the Order of the Gods
has been falling apart.

881
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,375
Finally, a new order will arise
from the old one.

882
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:52,958
Very soon, the Chan and Jie clans

883
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:56,250
will be forced to resume
their battle to the death.

884
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:59,500
There won't be any clean hands this time.

885
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,458
-Then what hole will you crawl into?

887
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,083
[Ao Guang] Help me now,

888
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:09,125
and perhaps the Dragon Clan of East Sea
can help you later.

890
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,833

00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,166
[Yaksa] Do you think he'll do it?

893
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:25,666
He always comes around,
so long as the price is right.

894
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:31,125
Every monster has his price,
and our little friend is no different.

895
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:33,916
[Ao Guang] Be patient.

[Masked Man] No, I can't.

925
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,291
I thought you wanted
a motorcycle like mine.

926
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,458
I'll build you one.

[clinks]

928
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,583
All I want is a way to control the fire.

Okay, fine. However, I can't guarantee
the lesson will stick.

934
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,875
So let's get it straight.

935
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:46,958
Even if you fail,
I still get the motorcycle. Huh?

936
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:47,958
I'll learn.

937
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:49,291

But your body is just flesh and blood.

[Masked Man]
The fire inside you is too fierce.

943
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:05,416
So you will need iron and steel
to channel it out.

And most importantly, to put it out.

What happens if I can't put it out?

947
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:14,041
Oh, if that happens,
the fire will burn your heart

948
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,250
and roast the skin off your body.

949
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:19,083

Why can't I do it again?

Well, you still haven't united
with Nezha's primordial spirit.

You can't just summon him when you want.

Ha! Listen.

1033
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:07,000
In this life, Nezha was reborn
as you, Li Yunxiang.

But he's been reborn many times before
and many times after.

He was Zhang Yunxiang, Zhao Yunxiang,
Wang Yunxiang, Sun Yunxiang.

But up until now,
none of Nezha's reincarnation

1037
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,750
has been worthy of his name.

1038

Some of them never even realize
that they were Nezha,

1039

Also, if you really want
to use Nezha's powers,

1043
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,166
you have to get your Astras back.

[ominous music]

1051
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,125
Your father has made
the proper arrangements.

1052
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,208
I'd listen to him if I were you.

1053
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,916
We shouldn't make a move
until the time is right.

1054
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,375
Why take any risks?

1055
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:08,666
We must be patient.
You'll get your revenge.

1056
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:13,000
That's not good enough.
I want my revenge now.

1057

[Yaksa sighs]

1058
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:18,916
My boy, if that is what you want,
let me try something.

1059
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,791
This is not the first reincarnation
of Nezha to die by my hand.

1060
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:28,500
Yunxiang, that's so cool.

1061
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:30,625
-[Six] Let me see.
-What a show-off.

1062
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:31,625
[Dr. Su] Li Yunxiang.

1063
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,375
Doctor, why are you here?

1064
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:37,166
I just came to let you know
your brother's doing well.

1065
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,291
-I don't know.
-You should come visit.

1066
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:41,625
-That's great! Thank you.
-That was all.

1067
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,958
Actually, if you have the time,
I'd love a bike mod.

1068
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:48,625
[chuckles]
If I do that, I'll never win another race.

1069
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,125
[chuckles]
Is that really such a problem?

[bells tolling in distance]

1125
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:16,416
You understand, Mr. De,
why I had to come to you?

1126
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:19,500
[exhales]
I was just being naive.

1127
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:23,375
I thought that by smuggling,
I'd be able to make something of myself.

1128
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:24,750
[sighs]

1129
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,666
[Liang] But what I really need
is a new master.

1130
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,000
-[Ao Bing] Is that right?
-[Liang] I mean,

1131
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,833
who does Li Yunxiang think he is?

1132
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,416
He's a nobody trying to be a big shot.

1133
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:37,625
He's got those powers. What do I get?

1134
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,958
[grunts]
I don't have a job anymore.

1135
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,166
Ooh!
[chuckles]

1136
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,458

You know what you have to do, right?

[Liang chuckles]

1142
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:55,958
Come on, I'm a smart guy, hard worker.

1143
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,833
I just need a little capital, you know.

1144
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:01,416
Maybe if I had a rich dad,
we'd be the same.

1145
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,583
[scoffs]
I have the money.

1146
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:05,041
Will you live to see it?

[gasps]

1148
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,666
Being a traitor doesn't bother you?

[chuckles]

1150
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,500
What else is a successful man,
but a traitor who got away with it.

1151
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:15,666

Plus, you can never be sure.

1155
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,208
Maybe I have secret powers too.

[somber music continues]

1159
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:51,625
Your dad is with your brother.

1160
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,083
You should talk to him.
I can watch her.

[dramatic music]

[inhales, sighs]

1163
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:06,583
[Old Li] There were
so many wars back then.

1164
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:08,291
We didn't get far.

1165
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:14,250
It wasn't long before your mom
got sick and died.

1166
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:17,000
I carried a pole on my shoulder.

1167
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:21,708
You were in the front basket,
and your younger brother was in the back.

1168
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:26,000
The night was dark,
and the hill was steep,

1169
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:28,333
and the baskets were heavy.

1170
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,625
I tripped and rolled down the hill.

1171
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,208
I was so scared.

1172
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:36,625
I scrambled back to the baskets,

1173
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:41,500
and I saw your brother was laughing.

1174
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:45,500
He was… He was laughing with such joy.
[laughs]

1175
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:47,291
He thought it was fun.

1176
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:50,541
[sorrowful laughter]

1177
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:58,208
[Old Li] The years have passed so quickly.

1178
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:04,500
Your brother has been getting
into trouble since he was little.

1179
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:05,625
[gasps]

1180
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:08,041
I thought that when he grew up,

1181
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,291
he'd learn his lesson
and get some sense for once.

1182
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:14,541
But the troubles only grew bigger.

1183
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:16,666
Now, even you…

1184
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,291
Now, even you…

[Yunxiang breathing heavily]

1188
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,333
[Dr. Su] They're both out of danger now.

1189
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,208
Don't worry.

1190
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:41,625
Mm-hm.

1191
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:46,208
[rustles]

1192
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,458
I've wanted to be a doctor
since I was little.

1193
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:54,041
I guess I thought
I could help a lot of people that way.

1194
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,666
And I do help them.

1195
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,000
I only understood later

1196
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:06,708
that some people
can't be helped by a doctor.

1197
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:08,958
But you can help them.

1198
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:11,916
Me?
[scoffs]

1199
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,875
I only cause trouble.

1200
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:20,625
[Dr. Su] Don't blame yourself.

1201
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,291
It wasn't you that hurt them.

1203
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,125
It's all the same.

[exhales]
You know what?

1205
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:35,750
[Dr. Su] The first time I saw you,
I knew you weren't like the others.

[sighs]

1207
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,375
So cheer up.

1208
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,083
The guy I saw earlier, that guy
looked like a hero in the making,

1209
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,916
who is just discovering his power.

-You should be in bed.
-I'm fine.

1213
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,083

The waters of the East Sea are fed
by thousands upon thousands of rivers.

[Ao Guang] It draws
from even the smallest springs.

01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:06,041
if there has been progress
in the favor I asked of you.

You don't say.

I'm hoping you can help me
understand something.

1387
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:19,250
That brat's power has grown so quickly,
he even defeated Yaksa.

1388
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:22,541
Someone must have trained him,
don't you think?

1389
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:27,083
Oh, maybe he is so naturally talented
that he got there on his own.

1390
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,333
That's true.

1391
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:32,333
But perhaps it was you.

1392
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:35,583
Who me?
Why would I do that? It's crazy.

Anything is possible.

In fact, you might be afraid

1395
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:41,791
I'll reveal what you're hiding
behind that mask.

1396
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:44,666
Perhaps that's why
you want me dead so badly.

1397
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,458
So you can shut me up!

[chuckles]

1403
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:00,750
So you're a demon after all.

1404
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:03,125
I thought the Monkey King
had killed you long ago.

1405
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:05,500
-[magical hum]
-Yes, he did.

1406
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:10,000
Now I'm just a nameless demon in a mask.

1407
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:12,541
Dragon King, a few years ago,

1408
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:15,416
Donghai's lakes and rivers
dried up overnight.

1409
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,458
And river dragons
who ruled them disappeared.

1410
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,750
That was you?

1411
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,125
A nosy demon.

1412
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,250
You have six ears after all.

1413
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:25,250
You deserve your reputation.
No one could trick you.

1414
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:28,208
The Order of the Gods is finished!

1415
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:33,166
We, Dragons, won't have
our tails stepped on again.

1416
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:36,541
[Ao Guang] Once I have gathered
all the lakes and rivers

1417
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:38,666
and added them to my power,

1418
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,625
I shall create a new universal order.

1419
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,541
[chuckles]
Universal order?

1420
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,000
So this master plan of yours

1421
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:49,750
is the reason you have brought
such suffering to the people of Donghai?

1422
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:53,583
Ao Guang, don't you fear
the Court of Heaven?

1423
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:56,333
[scoffs]
It's total chaos up there.

1424
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:57,916
How could they handle me?

1425
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:01,541
Besides, who dare testify against me?

1426
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:05,250
Just like plants,
people need to be weeded.

1427
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:08,708
If the grass won't bend
when a strong wind blows over it,

1428
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:12,125
then I'll have to mow it down. There, see?

1429
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,125
[scoffs]
So brutal. Ruthless.

1430
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:17,625
How else will my new order be imposed?

1431
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:19,083

I wouldn't expect her to work for you.

1438
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:36,250
Nezha has many enemies.

1439
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:39,000
