1
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,627
My cash just ran out.

2
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,088
It's real rice, not the molecular stuff--

3
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,851
Wait! Hold on.

4
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,647
I just want a quick look,
how can you charge me every time?

5
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,318
What do you know? Let go!

6
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,279
Just let me look!

7
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,956
Found these yesterday and fixed them up.

8
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,710
I was the only one on my ship
without boots--

9
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,835
Speed's at 7 km/sec, still slow.

10
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,719
It's going from District D 79.348 to 30.

11
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,724
You who hooked the satellite, stay away.

12
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,852
That'll cost you at least 800 dollars.

13
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,364
-Who?
-Who do you think?

14
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,783
I heard he went down to Earth yesterday.

15
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,536
They can't be back yet.

16
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,877
-You said they wouldn't be here!
-We're fucked!

17
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,136
VICTORY

18
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,562
Out of the way, you incompetent fools.

19
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,690
That one's mine.

20
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,360
Step on it.

21
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,956
God, this is exhausting.

22
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,633
Stop them!

23
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,563
Grab it!

24
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,692
I'll kill those sons of bitches!

25
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,446
-Kill them!
-God, what a racket!

26
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,701
All that swearing,
not a cultured mind in the whole crowd.

27
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,047
Too slow, Mr. Park!

28
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,133
It's too slow! Hey, it's too slow!

29
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,734
How long will I have to do this
all by hand?

30
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,661
Let's wrap things up.

31
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,678
They're getting away! Step on it!

32
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,267
Just catch them!

33
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,361
Can't you share?

34
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,116
Think about the other ships!

35
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,535
Damn you!

36
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,787
Why make me think of other ships?

37
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,797
Everyone on your toes!

38
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,783
You're dead if we catch you!

39
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,451
-Human trash!
-We'll get you next time!

40
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,290
Ethics, my ass.

41
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,917
Not a chance.

42
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,423
These guys really give it their all.

43
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,343
Fighting like kids
over a few measly dollars.

44
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,972
What? What's that?

45
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,812
Hey, what the hell?

46
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,480
Slow down!

47
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,905
Watch the antenna!
There's a fine if you break it!

48
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,241
I can't believe this.

49
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,117
-But what about the car?
-The garage is full.

50
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,369
However,
if you want us to take it from you,

51
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,872
you need to pay extra 70K for reassembly.

52
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,457
If you don’t want to pay,
you dismantle it and bring it back in.

53
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,628
And I see you broke
an antenna off a jelly.

54
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,839
You need to pay 1,300 dollars for that.

55
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,092
We will deduct from your money
and withdraw the rest from your account.

56
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,887
These are your taxes. Pay up.

57
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,268
Why show me the cash?

58
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,688
If you're not giving it to me,
why count it out? You pig!

59
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,651
This is my company's money.

60
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,364
Karum, watch your back.
I'll get you one day.

61
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,868
-Any organic matter?
-Just one.

62
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,413
In the Thunderbolt, 12 kg of iced pork.

63
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,582
Accident. Refrigerated spaceship.

64
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,172
It’s been three years now.

65
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,926
About Su-ni. What will you do?

66
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,261
What do you think? Earn cash.

67
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,264
I'll do anything for cash.

68
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,226
Anything, really.

69
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,158
How's Captain Jang? Beautiful as ever?

70
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,786
She has a message for you.

71
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,412
For me? What did she say?

72
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,289
Call her once more, and she'll kill you.

73
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,626
All right.

74
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,253
Let's watch TV.

75
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,345
She looks so real.

76
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,643
Those Black Foxes give me the creeps.

77
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,729
See you.

78
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,946
Ciao.

79
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,161
You guys made Victory
with reinforced duralumin structure.

80
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:41,542
Quantum radar. Top speed 48,000.
3.2 million pounds of thrust.

81
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,670
If you've got that kind of beast ship,
why don't you make money?

82
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,839
It's all debt.

83
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,427
It's still just a trash collector.
Captain Jang keeps overdoing it.

84
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:56,223
Between repairs and fines,
we just pay debt with more debt.

85
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,683
But you are a good team.

86
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,685
Team, my ass.

87
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,937
We're a mess.

88
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,537
For me, check!

89
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,757
He's got a ten-pair.

90
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,052
This is one dollar per round.
Why so serious?

91
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,428
I'll raise the minimum.

92
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,306
Even if you beat everyone, it's ten bucks.

93
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,059
I see you, and raise two.

94
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,145
I fold.

95
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,943
Shut your mouth!

96
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,405
I don't have a mouth. Why so sensitive?

97
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,824
Let's quit after this hand.

98
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,118
It's no fun anyway.
And you're all getting touchy.

99
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,454
There's something I need to address.

100
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,248
What could he be addressing now?

101
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,210
Can't bail on this round. Call!

102
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,544
The rice is gone.

103
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,090
I was saving it for a special day.

104
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,717
Last time, the toolbox.
Before that, the battery.

105
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,973
Someone's pilfering supplies
and selling them for cash.

106
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,477
Captain,

107
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,815
how'd you buy that booze?
It's 80 dollars a bottle.

108
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,859
Shut up. I see you, and raise ten.

109
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,571
No excuses. Don't insult my intelligence.

110
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,117
There's a time I'd have strung up
your corpse as a warning.

111
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,536
Someone's losing his mind.

112
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,372
Do you want to get strung up?

113
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,917
Our loan deferrals end this month,
then we have to pay 2,000 per month.

114
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,462
-Don't forget.
-Didn't it get extended? How much is left?

115
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:55,551
Well, 16,000 or 17,000 dollars,

116
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,761
plus the 9,000 you borrowed
from the guild, and then…

117
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,848
I'll uncover that thief today for sure.

118
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,766
I know nothing about this nonsense,

119
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,726
but let's talk after the game.

120
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,563
And the court ordered
a provisional seizure,

121
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,730
so you're basically screwed.

122
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,773
Bubs.

123
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,401
You can stop now. I fold.

124
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,863
Okay,
there's one more thing, but forget it.

125
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,031
What thing?

126
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,533
Porky ran off.

127
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,995
-What?
-He split. Porky.

128
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,746
The one managing our fund.

129
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,499
Quite the uproar. Doubt they'll catch him.

130
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,168
-Are you serious?
-Okay, show your cards!

131
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,589
I won again! This is so boring.

132
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,632
-Captain, you knew?
-A deuce?

133
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,760
You said it would be safe!

134
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,221
We had so much money in there!

135
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,766
-One more round tomorrow.
-Hey! That was 100K, our whole savings!

136
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,019
-Why should we call you Captain?
-Where's my money?

137
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,520
Where's my rice?

138
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,190
Captain Jang!

139
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,025
Oh, sorry.

140
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,695
Too slow.

141
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,464
Scary crowd.

142
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,508
TOUCH THIS AND I'LL BREAK YOUR WRIST

143
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,854
How many zeros?

144
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,232
Damn, that's expensive.

145
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,193
When I caught one, I'd cut off both hands.

146
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,947
Keep one myself, send one to his boss.

147
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,741
There you go again.
It's a sign of dementia, Mr. Park.

148
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,660
Not Mr. Park, I'm Tiger Park.

149
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,371
Then what'd you do with all those hands?

150
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,832
-Don't believe me?
-I do.

151
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,543
I just wish I could have one.

152
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,296
Graphene titanium.
The equalizer. Dead in one swing.

153
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,881
You or me.

154
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,384
Stop talking nonsense and get to work!

155
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,845
God, I hate working.

156
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,306
For a ship from Lagrangian Point,
it's in good shape,

157
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,518
usually the nanobots
would've eaten it all.

158
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,271
You don't think
nanobots infected our ship?

159
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,773
Infected? They're everywhere.

160
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:19,903
They're no ordinary nanobots.
Lagrangians are indestructible.

161
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,447
Imagine if our ship got a hole.
We'd all be dead!

162
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,951
Don't worry,
we'll all have starved to death by then.

163
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,249
Is being poor a sin,
or am I poor because I sinned?

164
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:38,046
If you all starve to death,
the ship becomes mine.

165
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,347
A missing child.

166
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,351
Our work is stopped,
now the police will get us.

167
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,312
We'll get fined for the dumbest reasons.

168
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,944
-So annoying.
-What a headache.

169
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,321
Maybe her parents will pay us a reward?

170
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,408
Are you a UTS citizen?

171
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,992
She has no translation device.

172
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,955
-U-T-what?
-She's Korean?

173
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,040
I mean, are you from a rich home?

174
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,542
I have no home.

175
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,462
But I'm hungry.

176
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,922
I want to eat.

177
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,008
Hey, shut up. Kid's got no manners.

178
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,301
How shameless.

179
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,515
She was in that car?

180
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,269
In the rear seat's airbag.
Don't know how she survived.

181
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,857
Feel like I've seen
that bowl cut somewhere.

182
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,903
Su-ni! Where is our Su-ni hiding?

183
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,947
There you are!

184
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,453
Take her to the security center
when we dock.

185
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,306
-We've met, right?
-No.

186
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,621
Get down!

187
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,685
Get out!

188
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,317
No!

189
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,581
She's a robot?

190
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,375
An explosive?

191
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,544
No wonder the scanner didn't detect life.

192
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,046
Her skin grafts are amazing.

193
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,215
Shit, it's moving.

194
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,635
-Will it get offended and blow up?
-Just shut up and report it.

195
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,012
Nine, zero, zero.

196
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:01,935
Non-citizen.

197
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,563
Can't we tie it up outside the ship? Bubs?

198
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,107
Why do I always do the dangerous work?

199
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,693
Number 14 for miscellaneous crimes.
Is this a miscellaneous crime?

200
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,070
First, tie it up. Paper, rock, scissors.

201
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,446
Paper, rock, scissors!

202
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,255
Stay away! Don't come closer!

203
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,549
-I tried wiping up the water--
-Don't talk!

204
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,218
-God, he's useless.
-What an idiot.

205
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,469
Jeez.

206
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,055
Don't look at me. Take easy breaths.

207
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,725
Don't get any ideas.

208
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,435
I'm not a good person.

209
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,279
A pet robot?

210
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,158
Give me a break.

211
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,204
WRITING KOREAN

212
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,708
"Kang Hyeo-nu"? Who's that?

213
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,845
"Kang Hyeo-nu."

214
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,309
"Kang Hyeo-nu."

215
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,021
Missed calls up to a moment ago.

216
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,031
Guys, let's talk.

217
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,914
She's going to blow!

218
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,219
-You called?
-I registered a miscellaneous crime.

219
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,679
-Think they'll come?
-Never.

220
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,763
Right.

221
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,348
Listen up.

222
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,518
Two Black Foxes took the robot
and got shot down.

223
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,520
One was captured, one escaped.

224
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,814
The robot entered
Lagrangian Point alone. So…

225
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,860
Both the Black Foxes
and the Space Guards are looking for it.

226
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:00,113
I have no idea what you're trying to say.

227
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,824
I'm saying we can make

228
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,161
some money off this.

229
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,747
-"Money"?
-Can non-citizens collect rewards?

230
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,165
-No.
-Let me get this straight.

231
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,626
You want to sell that bomb
to the Black Foxes.

232
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,421
Make some money off those terrorists?

233
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,047
I bet they'll pay a million.

234
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,050
-"A million"?
-No way. That's unjust.

235
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,720
What bullshit is that?

236
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,889
Forget it, then!

237
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,224
I'll take the bomb--

238
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,019
You think it's your bomb?

239
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,105
A direct call to Space Guards,
and they'll come in five minutes.

240
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:38,443
All right, four for the Captain,
three each for Mr. Park and me.

241
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,492
-Yeah, that's great!
-All right.

242
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,746
Three and a half,
three and a half, two, one. Good?

243
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,915
-"One"?
-You're three and a half, I'm two?

244
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,625
Why'd I fall to three and a half?

245
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,460
How should I interpret this?

246
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,086
Give me back my one half.

247
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,297
This is total crap.

248
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,884
Four, three, two, one for me, okay?

249
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,348
-You all are going to hell.
-Right!

250
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,309
But can you really pull this off?
Want me to do it?

251
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,729
Mr. Park,
did you forget where I came from?

252
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,649
I know those sorts of bastards.

253
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,026
Don't be scared of them--

254
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,319
Aren't you going to order?

255
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,364
This time, order or get out.

256
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,366
One cola.

257
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,577
Where'd she go?

258
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,412
Where is she?

259
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,333
What's she drawing? A giraffe?

260
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,752
Damned kid, drawing in my room?

261
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,630
But the transmission mic is broken.

262
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,507
Connect ours and raise the pitch.

263
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,175
-What's this?
-A smartphone.

264
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,262
Uses private satellites,
so are hard to trace. Criminals love them.

265
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:51,349
Didn't you say one was caught?
If so, Space Guards might be listening in.

266
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,269
I don't know technical stuff.

267
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,020
But you know the Black Foxes?

268
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,022
They weren't around when I worked.

269
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,567
Do you know anything?

270
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,778
Ready. Okay?

271
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,988
Yes.

272
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:05,947
I'm doing it.

273
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,961
Hello?

274
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,468
Do you own this object, Dr. Kang?

275
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,555
How much do you want?

276
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,310
How much?

277
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,523
Two million.

278
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,567
No!

279
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,570
One and a half million.

280
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:52,702
If you really insist,
we'll give you a discount.

281
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,954
Two million. In cash.

282
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,749
Let's meet immediately.

283
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,335
I'll pay you once I see it.

284
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,715
By Exit two
of the Zenith Telescope Station.

285
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,593
Zone G, at 13:00!

286
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,096
Not there. No!

287
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:18,436
At 32nd Commercial District, Club Ghost,

288
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,315
in front of Gate two at 14:00.

289
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,070
Just a minute!

290
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,366
I'm worried about an explosion.

291
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,702
Should I take precautions?

292
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,873
It won't explode without an order.

293
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,043
If this is a prank call, you will die.

294
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,129
Don't be late. We won't wait.

295
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,392
Drink up!

296
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,977
You deserve it!

297
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,229
I knew you could do it!

298
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,825
At 32nd Commercial District, Club Ghost,

299
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:17,662
in front of Gate two at 14:00.

300
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,509
Don't make a move. I said to stay still.

301
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,344
That's what I'm doing.

302
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,852
That's a giraffe? You're a lousy artist.

303
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,478
It's a dinosaur.

304
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,989
Let's search for dinosaurs.

305
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,828
Take a good look.
This is a dinosaur, okay?

306
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,665
That's a dinosaur, too.

307
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,418
Look, it's the same.

308
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,008
-Anyway--
-I drew you, too!

309
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,640
This one I recognize.

310
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,436
But the eyes are too small, look.

311
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,897
Make the eyes bigger?

312
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,315
That's right.

313
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,109
Look here. The nose, too.

314
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,779
-The nose, too?
-More handsome.

315
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,703
You like doing that, don't you?

316
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,373
If you ever feel sick,
say something right away.

317
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,417
So people can run, okay?

318
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,211
Okay, climb in here.

319
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,129
Uncle Tiger! Where am I going?

320
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,219
Okay, everybody ready? Five minutes!

321
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,179
The engine's looking bad.
It might not make it.

322
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,430
If we're late, we're dead!

323
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,057
Come here. Bubs, come here.

324
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,101
It's two million dollars. Okay?

325
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,437
Let's all shout, "Let's go!"
One, two, three! Let's go!

326
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,817
Who the hell is it? We're busy!

327
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,318
Didn't you lock the door?

328
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,117
Back to your places.

329
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,662
Now!

330
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,419
I'm forcing the door!

331
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,596
Why didn't you open up?

332
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,599
No respect for the UTS Police?

333
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,520
The door. Why won't the door open?

334
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,192
You really went wild
on the illegal modifications to your ship.

335
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,778
Our captain is good with tools.

336
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,823
Such an ugly ship
is an insult to UTS citizens.

337
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,158
We'll make her stop.

338
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,160
What the hell?

339
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,495
Isn't this military equipment?

340
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,707
Where did you get it?

341
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,794
Captain got it from the recycling center.
It's very friendly.

342
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,929
Why grow plants on a spaceship?

343
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,850
We're actually in a rush.
What brings you here?

344
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,435
That's what I want to know.

345
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,354
You're the one who called the police.

346
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,064
Number 14. Miscellaneous crimes.

347
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,744
Sir, that wasn't a report,
we just wanted to ask something!

348
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,145
We've got two minutes! God dammit!

349
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,023
Who were you looking at?

350
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,655
What are you doing? Why take my money?

351
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,202
Fine, we're all on our own now.

352
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,748
-Bubs, let me use it!
-You scumbag!

353
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,335
Sir, we have a really important meeting.

354
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,711
Just wait a second!

355
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,466
Did you record that?

356
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,095
What's the occasion?

357
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,139
Non-citizens usually have to call
five to six times for a response.

358
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,309
Bubs, did you record him taking the money?

359
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,564
Sure, I got it in detail!

360
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,442
Your patrol lights are off,
so you're off duty.

361
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,779
What happens if we report you
for taking bribes after work?

362
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,073
Crazy bitch! I didn't ask for bribes.

363
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,535
Didn't announce your name or regiment.
And a private gun?

364
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,120
He's got some nerve.

365
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,665
Don't illegal weapons
get you banished to Earth?

366
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,168
That's right.
We've got a real cowboy here!

367
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,170
A gun like that
should be kept disassembled.

368
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,632
Abusing authority won't get you anywhere.

369
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,968
Patrol officers
are non-citizens just like us.

370
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,220
So who are you to smack me in the head?

371
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,222
Who are you to smack Bubs in the head?

372
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,016
Anyway…

373
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:35,438
If you want to erase the evidence,
you can kill us all and slip out quietly.

374
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,945
Otherwise fuck off, dickwad.

375
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,282
-You're going to pay for this!
-Okay! See you later.

376
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,367
Captain!

377
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:52,038
He's gone! Mr. Park, hurry up!

378
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,748
Get the bag, we're late!

379
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,090
Mr. Park, hurry up!

380
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,888
A place like this is the safest.

381
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,807
Brilliant idea, Tae-ho!
You're so thoughtful. Well done.

382
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:16,187
But I'm curious.
What will happen to our girl?

383
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,271
"Our girl"?

384
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,359
It's not ours, and it's not a girl.

385
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,528
Who cares if they blow it up
or melt it down to make teeth?

386
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,907
-Still…
-We're here to make money.

387
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,576
Stay focused.

388
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,505
Just hold out a bit longer.

389
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,491
Hey asshole. I told you, Gate two!

390
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,244
Do you want your pet or not?

391
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,080
Are you new at this?

392
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,832
No bullets?

393
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,043
And you came alone.

394
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,714
Do you trust me, or underestimate me?

395
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,341
Follow me, asshole!

396
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,561
Mr. Park, get ready!

397
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,151
Just speak in Korean, Kang Hyeo-nu.

398
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,736
Don't try any tricks.

399
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,992
-Dorothy first.
-Money first.

400
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,203
Money first!

401
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,468
Is this the correct amount?

402
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,387
Yes! We did it!

403
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,648
What's going on? She's not here.

404
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,444
What's with you guys?

405
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,447
Where'd it go?

406
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:52,176
Find it quick!
If anyone recognizes it, we're dead!

407
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,653
Kot-nim!

408
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,461
Kot-nim!

409
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,422
Oh, my God.

410
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,061
Calm down! It won't explode. No!

411
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,692
-What's that?
-Look!

412
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,947
Move! Kang Hyeo-nu!

413
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,200
Kot-nim!

414
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,245
Kot-nim!

415
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,247
Kang, where are you? Kang Hyeo-nu!

416
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,166
Hey, Kang! Get back in here!

417
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,845
What just happened?

418
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,662
Why didn't you watch the kid?

419
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,583
Mr. Park, why do you screw up everything?

420
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,419
And why give the money back?
What were you thinking?

421
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,922
And what about you,
freaking out about money in that chaos?

422
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:54,923
Shit!

423
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,260
I had a bad feeling from the beginning.

424
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,304
You always say that
when things don't work out!

425
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,889
If I'd gone, it might've worked.

426
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,015
Then why didn't you?

427
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,350
I'm just talking to myself.

428
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,519
Hey, forget that,
where's the smartphone? Dial the--

429
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,357
This is why we were caught.

430
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,359
Space Guards were listening in.

431
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,154
I've got the number,
so we'll transmit by radio wave.

432
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,948
The signal won't travel far,
but we'll keep trying until it works.

433
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,575
For now, fly to the Factory.

434
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,369
Ship's down, we can't go.

435
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,164
My two million dollars.

436
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,209
My two million dollars. I'm screwed!

437
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,337
Did you lose your money, Uncle Tae-ho?

438
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,014
It's not done yet.

439
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,018
What's your name?

440
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,689
Kot-nim.

441
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,190
-"Kot-nim"?
-Aren't you Dorothy?

442
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,192
Kot-nim's my Korean name.

443
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,695
"Kot-nim." Pretty name.

444
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,905
"Kot-nim." A bit rustic.

445
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,240
Not as rustic as your name.

446
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,282
Don't call it by name.

447
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:10,916
-What's wrong, Kot-nim?
-Uncle Tae-ho gets scared when he sees me.

448
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,256
Who's scared? Come here.

449
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,427
Who's scared of our Kot-nim?

450
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,220
Put down that explosive.

451
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,055
Uncle Tiger is more scary.

452
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,432
Big spider!

453
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,768
-Let's get Uncle Tae-ho!
-Gosh.

454
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,229
-Scaredy-cat!
-Jeez, seriously!

455
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,940
Stop it! Stay away!

456
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,483
Don't come near me!

457
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,069
Stay away!

458
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,821
The Black Foxes have a hydrogen bomb.

459
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,073
Many UTS citizens are worried about that.

460
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,384
Pierre, the emergency channel is on.

461
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,595
We love your singing,
but the other ships can all hear you.

462
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,807
-There goes that idiot again!
-Sorry!

463
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,166
Why won't it turn off?

464
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,837
Turn the damn thing off!

465
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,012
He said Captain Jang kissed him.

466
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,889
You think it was just a kiss?

467
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,391
Whatever. Bubs, bring your cash box.

468
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,851
What now?

469
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:25,110
He stole my money to buy a battery.
My precious money!

470
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,529
We need a welding rod, too.

471
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,198
-We have no credit anymore.
-Whatever.

472
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,950
I just don't get it.

473
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,328
Three adults, and not a penny between you.

474
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,332
We're totally broke.

475
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,463
Uncle Tae-ho, I have a favor to ask.

476
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,340
Can you do it?

477
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,257
No.

478
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,551
I didn't say what it was.

479
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,012
You ask if I can do it
before saying what it is?

480
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,182
-Can I borrow scissors?
-No.

481
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:03,315
-I have a favor to ask too.
-What is it? I can do it!

482
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,828
Don't do anything. That's my request.

483
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,873
Don't laugh or talk
or draw pictures of us.

484
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,218
Why scissors?

485
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,601
-Careful.
-Of my fingers?

486
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,436
No, the tomatoes.

487
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,859
Hey, I said to stay in the ship!

488
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,781
As soon as I saw these,
I thought of you, Pierre.

489
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,449
I'm always grateful to you.

490
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,161
-Damn, is that a real tomato?
-I've never tasted one myself.

491
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,251
Damn, that's good!

492
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,591
-It's one dollar each.
-"One dollar"!

493
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,759
Please enjoy!

494
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,344
Thank you!

495
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,222
Thank you!

496
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,976
-Two, that's two dollars.
-Two?

497
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,896
We're selling a lot!

498
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,982
Back there!

499
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,067
Don't cut in line.

500
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,820
Have a nice day!

501
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,323
It's gross.

502
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,658
Twenty two, twenty three…

503
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,671
Why are you such a sloppy eater?

504
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,299
Look the other way.

505
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:54,801
What's with that chuckle?

506
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,098
-Okay.
-I bought a welding rod!

507
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,605
You know Mr. Park?

508
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:09,649
He used to be the boss of a drug gang.

509
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,486
They say he sold drugs
and helped out poor kids.

510
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,864
He had more money
than he could count, so he'd weigh it.

511
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,241
He even raised a tiger at home!

512
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,328
Captain Jang is smart,
but she's got a filthy temper.

513
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,581
So don't make her angry, got it?

514
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,417
And in her mouth,
she's got a self-destruct…

515
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,545
This is important!

516
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,506
Why's the ship called Victory?

517
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,884
Captain said to pick a good name,
so I wrote it.

518
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,345
I used to think
winning was always a good thing.

519
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,597
What did you do in the past, Sis?

520
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,390
"Sis"?

521
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,023
Oh my! "Sis"? Listen to you.

522
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,654
Actually,
I'm thinking of getting skin grafts.

523
00:51:55,737 --> 00:52:00,283
A black market
full body reconstruction costs 20,000.

524
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,870
But I'm scared people will laugh at me.

525
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,624
Well, that's an excuse.
I don't have the money.

526
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,378
What did I do?

527
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,882
Air-to-air attack,
entering polluted zones,

528
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,135
assassination and so on.

529
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,057
Kid, you're not a…

530
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,225
What?

531
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,269
I'm so envious.

532
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:32,023
You should’ve said so, you little punk!

533
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,235
But was Uncle Tae-ho always so scary?

534
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,697
Nothing scary about him.
He's just a broke, nasty guy.

535
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,240
Kim Tae-ho…

536
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,785
He's really had no luck.

537
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,019
Tae-ho was a child soldier.

538
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,146
He was a soldier since he was little.

539
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,274
Back then,
he saw a baby for the first time.

540
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,985
He said that she was like an angel.

541
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,786
According to the rules,
he should have sent her to Earth,

542
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,998
but he had some power back then.

543
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,668
Sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry.

544
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,921
She naps at 2 p.m.,

545
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,215
and if she doesn't want milk,
heat up some water.

546
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:42,636
He spent more and more time
with her, and became a dad.

547
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,678
At age 20.

548
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,264
Don't fall on the stone path.

549
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,393
Su-ni! Su-ni?

550
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,062
Su-ni!

551
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:03,990
It's my fault.

552
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,535
Daddy will take care of you.

553
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,207
I'll be the best dad in the world.

554
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,378
I'll be a truly good person.

555
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:27,639
From then on, Tae-ho couldn't hurt anyone.

556
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,860
Su-ni, I wrote this song for you.

557
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,320
Want to hear it?

558
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,989
Can I sing? All right.

559
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,951
Su-ni

560
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,786
I love you

561
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:54,624
More than anything in the world

562
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:59,879
I think of you when I'm eating
When I'm putting on my shoes

563
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:04,467
And even when I'm doing laundry

564
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,101
I didn't violate any rules.
Tell me why I was let go.

565
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,688
Let go! This is so unfair.

566
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,399
The Space Guards let him go
for disobeying orders.

567
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:24,821
In an instant,
he fell from the very top to the gutter.

568
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,660
What's that?

569
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,997
It's just space debris.

570
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,379
Those are shooting stars.
If you make a wish, it will come true.

571
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,805
After living homeless for a year,

572
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,516
he completely fell apart.

573
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,371
Su-ni, we'll eat like kings tonight!
Let's go.

574
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,249
Su-ni, come here.

575
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,293
Su-ni!

576
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,505
Su-ni!

577
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,013
"Vacate the orbit"?

578
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,577
If you start the search--

579
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,120
I'll pay later.

580
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,580
Wait!

581
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:31,549
Tae-ho is still searching for Su-ni.

582
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,178
She's waiting in dark space

583
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,681
for her daddy.

584
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:43,353
Mr. Park, are you using the torque wrench?

585
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,315
Why don't you answer? Mr. Park!

586
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,484
Who said you could use my power?

587
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,737
Something's missing.

588
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,113
Hello.

589
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,573
-Who is this?
-My friend.

590
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:59,077
-I'm busy, screw off.
-I want to stop.

591
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,703
All right, let's wrap up.

592
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,873
What is it now?

593
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,835
Do I look like a kid?

594
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,427
We've got a call! A call!

595
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,853
Tae-ho! Hurry up!

596
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,188
Should I answer? Hola?

597
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,606
Hurry!

598
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,618
Hello?

599
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,121
District F, by the rail gun base.

600
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,372
Who is it?

601
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:45,665
In 30 minutes.

602
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,959
No.

603
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:53,631
Block 27, MR-13, in…

604
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,634
two hours, okay?

605
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,178
I'll wait until you show up.

606
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,432
-Is it done?
-It's done!

607
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,684
It's done!

608
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,363
Go and check the engine.
We'll leave in 30 minutes.

609
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,159
Where the hell is Captain Jang?

610
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,579
-Off getting drunk, I'm sure.
-Let's keep Kot-nim.

611
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:31,002
Who knows
what the Black Foxes might do to her?

612
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,046
You know why I live?

613
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,673
To find Su-ni.

614
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,884
But soon she'll vacate the orbit.

615
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,720
Then, not even money will help.

616
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,349
I need money now, Mr. Park.

617
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:49,270
We all need money.

618
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,747
It's not easy for me, either.

619
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,875
All those debts.

620
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,795
Never able to pay them. And Bubs...

621
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,930
-Kot-nim! Is she there?
-No.

622
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,557
Kot-nim!

623
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,933
-Kot-nim!
-Kot-nim!

624
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,226
-Kot-nim!
-Kot-nim!

625
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,437
-Kot-nim!
-Kot-nim!

626
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,063
-Where did she go?
-Kot-nim!

627
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,189
Kot-nim!

628
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,150
Kot-nim!

629
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:32,957
Kot-nim!

630
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,751
Uncle!

631
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,295
-Uncle Tiger!
-Kot-nim!

632
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,921
Mr. Park, where are you?

633
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,506
Corridor 17!

634
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,516
Kot-nim!

635
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,861
Why do I always seem
to be the only one working?

636
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,288
Who the hell are you?

637
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,300
Kot-nim, stay behind me.

638
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,094
Close your eyes.

639
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,058
Look at these scums.

640
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:15,977
Open your eyes.

641
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,400
Karum?

642
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:20,810
I need to poop.

643
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:32,780
Sorry I hit you.
But what were you plotting?

644
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,740
I should be asking that question.

645
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,034
-What were you plotting to do with--
-Whatever.

646
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,787
Go away!
Before Dorothy walks out that door…

647
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,331
-Let's just forget this happened.
-Don't you give us orders!

648
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,291
It's not an order, it's a suggestion.

649
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,336
Bubs, if he says one more word,
rip his tongue out.

650
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,298
That's what you call an order.

651
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,135
We've both got suspicions here,

652
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,387
so let's talk it out.

653
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:01,976
Should I go first?

654
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,271
No robot poops.

655
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,482
Kot-nim is human.

656
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:12,903
I knew that.

657
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,410
I thought she was just too cute.

658
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:22,079
Kang Kot-nim,
the daughter of nanorobotics scientist

659
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,541
Kang Hyeo-nu
at the Mars Terraforming Lab. Right?

660
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,377
Does Dr. Kang still have the money?

661
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,425
They're dumber than I thought.

662
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,054
Kill the light. Lock the door.

663
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,022
Hey, Black Foxes. We're not done here yet.

664
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:52,318
We don't want to hurt you guys.
So tell us.

665
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,362
What's this all about?

666
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,476
The Black Foxes aren't terrorists.

667
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,770
We were an environmental organization

668
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,065
until the Space Guards
tried to kill all of us.

669
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,984
Now we're the only survivors.

670
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:58,402
Stick to the point.

671
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:06,327
We've been following
the Mars program from the start.

672
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,162
Don’t you think it's strange?

673
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:12,583
If Mars with its harsh environment
can become green land,

674
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,960
why not Earth?

675
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,177
Dorothy was born
with a rare congenital sickness.

676
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:26,096
A sickness that ravaged her nerves.

677
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:29,642
No cure was available. And no hope.

678
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:33,520
As a last resort, Dr. Kang injected
ultra-sophisticated nanobots

679
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:36,357
that he had programmed into her body.

680
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:51,205
The nanobots were programmed
to signal each other.

681
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:56,210
Then the nanobots in Dorothy's body
started to talk with other nanobots.

682
01:10:56,293 --> 01:11:00,673
Nobody knows how it's possible,
not even Dr. Kang can explain it.

683
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:04,218
She even makes flowers blossom
from a dead tree.

684
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:09,265
She is the only hope
to bring life back to Earth.

685
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,896
But Sullivan grabbed Dorothy
and brought her to Mars,

686
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:19,149
and the slow progress there
suddenly sped up?

687
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,735
Yes, that small girl turned Mars
into a fine island.

688
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,780
A plant was genetically modified
to grow on Mars soil.

689
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,032
Earth didn't get a chance.
It’s all bullshit.

690
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,493
The media all broadcast Sullivan’s lies.

691
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:32,955
Never mind that.
Kot-nim. What happens to her?

692
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,924
And Kot-nim ran off
before they killed her.

693
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,175
But they can’t kill her.

694
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,844
Dorothy is protected by the nanobots,

695
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:50,180
and nanobots can only be killed
at 200 million degrees Celsius.

696
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,390
The hydrogen bomb…

697
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:16,123
Sullivan isn’t the savior of humanity.

698
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:19,126
He wants to destroy everything on Earth!

699
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,087
What is that? What's happening?

700
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,440
Hurry, let's go!

701
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,984
Everyone go out by the back door.

702
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,029
Block 27, MR-13.

703
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,239
We'll meet Dr. Kang there. See you then.

704
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,574
Let's use the back door!

705
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:52,910
Bubs!

706
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,120
-Mr. Park, let's go.
-And Kot-nim?

707
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,247
I'll take her.

708
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,755
Keep your head up and pass quietly.

709
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,728
I feel much better.

710
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:21,814
What?

711
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,241
On my back.

712
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:34,701
On my back, hurry!

713
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,586
You sure you want to go inside?
I just took a dump in there.

714
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:46,964
Maybe you want to give it a minute?

715
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:32,968
Kot-nim, you okay?

716
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:36,805
I'm okay. Uncle Tae-ho, are you okay?

717
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:45,481
Not okay.

718
01:14:58,118 --> 01:15:01,205
Don’t worry about Kot-nim,
you take the ship and go.

719
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,248
Answer me, Captain Jang!

720
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,637
What the hell? Just a minute.

721
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,683
You bastards!

722
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,287
Grab on, Kot-nim!

723
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,387
Crazy fool, how could you jump?

724
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:11,733
Hurry up, Kim Tae-ho.

725
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,906
Wait, I'll get the harpoon!

726
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,661
Kot-nim!

727
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,557
Get up! Let me!

728
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,809
We're in, let's go!

729
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:05,454
Let's go.

730
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:11,877
Come on.

731
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,222
No.

732
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,308
Oh, my God.

733
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,915
It's nothing.

734
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:53,126
Close your eyes and count to 100.

735
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,716
Not enough oxygen in the A Bus!
The ventilation is torn!

736
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,967
The pipes are bursting!

737
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,442
Thirty-two, thirty-three…

738
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:38,588
Everyone come in.

739
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:51,226
Seventy-eight, seventy-nine…

740
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:04,406
Ninety-five, ninety-six…

741
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,495
Ninety-nine, one hundred.

742
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:01,129
Kot-nim!

743
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,131
Kot-nim!

744
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,884
What do we do? Her heart's stopped.

745
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,761
-You didn't bring the defibrillator?
-What now?

746
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:10,722
-Where did it go?
-Come on, we need to stay calm!

747
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,433
-Calm down, please!
-Can you organize this better?

748
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,685
-Gently, don't break her ribs!
-One, two.

749
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:17,729
Three, four,

750
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:20,982
five… Kot-nim!

751
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:22,901
Six… Kot-nim!

752
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:25,529
Kot-nim!

753
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:33,286
Who was that?

754
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:35,705
You.

755
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,750
You fart machine.

756
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,130
She's a fart machine.

757
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:46,550
A fart machine!

758
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:52,848
Be honest.
You pooped a little, didn't you?

759
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:02,941
-I need the bathroom.
-Go quick!

760
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:22,414
Our appointment with Kang
was two hours ago.

761
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:26,042
He'll wait. What else can he do?

762
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,711
Kot-nim is with us.

763
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:31,339
Anyway, if we enter
Earth's airspace, it's game over.

764
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,091
Then Sullivan can't touch us.

765
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:37,679
Kang, the Black Foxes, Kot-nim,
Bubs, you, Mr. Park…

766
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,974
-We'll all meet and descend to Earth.
-No.

767
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:45,854
We don't have time to meet up.

768
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,441
Let's go down now,
before the Space Guards come.

769
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:53,445
-Saving Kot-nim comes first.
-How can we go now?

770
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:54,904
We need the money first.

771
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,450
Stop talking nonsense, will you?

772
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:11,671
I need to work.
Go up to the Captain's room.

773
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,798
Uncle Tae-ho, you know what?

774
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:17,260
In space, there's no up or down.

775
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:21,890
From the universe's viewpoint,
nothing is worthless or precious.

776
01:24:22,932 --> 01:24:26,227
Everything is precious in its own place.

777
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:28,605
Who said that?

778
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:30,065
My dad.

779
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:37,238
Hey, Kot-nim.
Why didn't you draw a picture of me?

780
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,158
I drew you first,

781
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,243
but I was too scared to give it to you.

782
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:50,043
I'll put it on the refrigerator.

783
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:55,840
Anyway, if you want to draw, do it there.

784
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,926
Don't cross over. You'll disturb me.

785
01:24:58,009 --> 01:25:00,303
-Uncle Tae-ho.
-What now?

786
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:01,304
Your shoe.

787
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:08,186
I know who Su-ni is.

788
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:13,149
Later, let's go see her together.

789
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,197
Even if we don't know where she is,
we can meet her.

790
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:24,702
Anybody seen Kot-nim? Anyone?

791
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,788
I bet she's hiding on me again.

792
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,081
Mr. Park is looking for you.

793
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:42,095
-That's cold!
-Sorry.

794
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,268
How's that?

795
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:49,227
Good.

796
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:50,895
Good?

797
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,982
Shall we wash your hair?

798
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:57,819
Your daddy will be mad at us
if your hair's dirty.

799
01:25:57,902 --> 01:25:59,320
I'll wash it up nice.

800
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:02,282
Put a basin underneath!

801
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,332
That's not the way you do it.

802
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,878
If you know what's good for you, beat it!

803
01:26:15,628 --> 01:26:17,505
But you're… Move over.

804
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,216
That's what you do for babies.

805
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,551
I'm doing fine!

806
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:23,136
-Give it.
-Why push me around?

807
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:24,888
-I'll show you.
-Show me what?

808
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:27,098
-It will go in her nose.
-No, it won't!

809
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,391
I know these things!

810
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:31,978
-I'm doing fine here!
-Hey, Kot-nim, get up.

811
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:33,897
Jeez, seriously.

812
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,481
Wait, hold on!

813
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:39,736
Hey! Stop moving!

814
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:42,322
Hey! What's going on here?

815
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:43,865
Get out.

816
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,784
-Why'd you have to show up?
-I said I'd do it!

817
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,204
Stop fighting and get out!

818
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,247
-Have you raised a kid?
-I'm going to someday.

819
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,249
-You don't know anything.
-Don't even talk to me.

820
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,418
Close your eyes while I shampoo.

821
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:58,129
Damn, all this expensive water.

822
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:02,634
Uncle Tae-ho's not angry, right?
He wants to get close to me?

823
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:03,718
Who knows.

824
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:05,720
I see it!

825
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:25,990
Hello?

826
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:27,825
-Hello?
-Karum?

827
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,620
Can you hear me? You hear me?

828
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:32,038
Yes, I hear you!

829
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,832
-What about Dr. Kang?
-I just picked him up.

830
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,793
I am with him now.

831
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:39,045
He was here when I came.

832
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,634
We're going in.

833
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:47,512
Karum, is your GPS off?

834
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:48,763
It's turned off.

835
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:52,100
-Check again to be sure.
-You can't see me in the radar.

836
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:54,811
I also used my eyes to drive inside.

837
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:58,273
Careful. Let's not screw it up this time.

838
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,983
Where are we going?

839
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,401
To see your daddy.

840
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:02,652
Daddy?

841
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,071
My daddy? Really?

842
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,585
I see you now. I see you.

843
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,858
-Daddy!
-Kot-nim!

844
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,526
-Daddy!
-Kot-nim!

845
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,997
I'm sorry, Kot-nim. I'm sorry.

846
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,376
Have you been eating okay?

847
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:04,547
I'm full, Captain gave me
yummy food with hot sauce.

848
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:08,551
Bubs put makeup on me,
but it all rubbed off.

849
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:13,973
Uncle Tiger sewed up my socks
and washed my hair.

850
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:18,936
Uncle Tae-ho and I earned 23 dollars.

851
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,106
Thank you.

852
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:44,504
Come here a second.

853
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:49,967
-Where's the money?
-It's in the ship.

854
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:54,305
-It's two million dollars, right?
-Of course. You like money too much.

855
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,432
What do you mean?
We need to check these things.

856
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:59,352
Stop, already. Now's not the time.

857
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,897
It didn't feel right
with the small kid here.

858
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:06,484
-Just put it in a bag! This is your job.
-Since when am I in charge of money?

859
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,529
You're frustrating me.
Just go bring the money.

860
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:11,906
-What's so hard about it?
-Take your conversation outside.

861
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:23,626
EMP mines!

862
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,101
Start the engine.

863
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:43,521
Bubs!

864
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:07,795
Daddy!

865
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,006
-Kot-nim!
-Daddy!

866
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:15,761
Daddy!

867
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:17,763
Kot-nim!

868
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:22,977
Kot-nim!

869
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:24,979
Daddy!

870
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:58,846
No!

871
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:52,984
Mr. Park, Bubs, Tae-ho…

872
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:55,820
I'm sorry about this.

873
01:37:24,296 --> 01:37:26,048
I’m one, so I’ll take 400,000.

874
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:33,305
Why don't you take it?

875
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:35,724
That money is dirty.

876
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:36,934
Forget it, then.

877
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,854
Captain and Bubs can take your share.

878
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,856
I don't need money from selling Kot-nim.

879
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:43,732
What about this month's interest?

880
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:46,819
Fuel costs. Oxygen. Water.

881
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:48,779
Insurance and the non-citizen tax?

882
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:51,282
The bank owns this ship.

883
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:54,285
But you don't need money?

884
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:57,955
Let's be honest,
we'll never earn anything.

885
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:00,416
The more we work, the more debts we have.

886
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:04,128
Can't leave quite yet.
Kot-nim's in the Factory.

887
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:05,462
-Park.
-It's too far.

888
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:07,172
-So we need to warm up the engine.
-Park.

889
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:09,466
I'll sit at the control panel,
and Captain can drive.

890
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:11,385
If you go there, you'll die, idiot!

891
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,347
I don't care if I die.

892
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:19,310
Tae-ho, you have something to do.

893
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,937
We do, too.

894
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:22,855
Go.

895
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:25,566
Go find Su-ni.

896
01:39:10,235 --> 01:39:11,528
It's 400,000 dollars.

897
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:55,197
WRITING KOREAN
KIM SU-NI

898
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:59,535
SU-NI,
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

899
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:01,954
I THINK OF YOU WHEN I'M EATING

900
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:09,044
HELLO
NICE TO MEET YOU

901
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:23,017
DADDY, SU-NI LOVES YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

902
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,811
I LOVE YOU WHEN I'M EATING
WHEN I'M PUTTING ON MY SHOES

903
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:28,981
AND EVEN WHEN I'M DOING LAUNDRY
I WILL BECOME A GOOD PERSON LIKE YOU

904
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:34,862
Don't move!

905
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:37,322
Why's your hand under the table?
Who are you?

906
01:40:52,337 --> 01:40:53,297
Daddy.

907
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,757
Go play outside.

908
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:57,801
I wrote this.

909
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,136
Go buy something to eat.

910
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:20,324
I WILL BECOME A GOOD PERSON LIKE YOU

911
01:41:31,376 --> 01:41:34,421
They were all so hot on money.
Now they're throwing it away?

912
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:36,423
Isn't it crazy?

913
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:38,967
-Huh? What are you doing?
-It is crazy.

914
01:41:39,843 --> 01:41:42,346
Mr. Park! Fill the rest of the fuel rods.

915
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:44,098
Tae-ho?

916
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:49,645
Just remembered a promise I made.

917
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:52,523
-What promise?
-What are you doing in my seat?

918
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:54,108
Move over!

919
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:15,838
Let's go, damn it!

920
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:42,573
Let's go.

921
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:12,561
Too many of them.

922
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:26,992
Close the valve!

923
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:38,086
Bubs, knock out a few.

924
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:29,221
Almost there, Bubs. Just a bit longer.

925
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:41,858
My harpoon!

926
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:43,610
Damn!

927
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:01,420
Nice work, Bubs.
We're in the clear now.

928
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:15,017
It never ends.

929
01:45:21,898 --> 01:45:24,318
Mr. Park, this is my last request.

930
01:45:25,944 --> 01:45:28,947
-Finish the job before we go back up.
-"Go back up"?

931
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:33,618
What's he doing?

932
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:37,706
Kim Tae-ho, you're insane!

933
01:46:01,271 --> 01:46:02,356
Mr. Park, please.

934
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:04,483
It's done!

935
01:46:07,944 --> 01:46:09,404
It's done! All done.

936
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:21,083
It's done!

937
01:46:33,011 --> 01:46:34,137
Mr. Park, now!

938
01:47:20,767 --> 01:47:23,145
Tae-ho, know where you're going?

939
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:24,813
Doesn't look like it.

940
01:47:24,896 --> 01:47:26,898
Don't think. Just step on it!

941
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:52,883
Is that a bomb?

942
01:47:56,219 --> 01:47:58,722
If that goes off, we're finished.

943
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:08,899
Captain?

944
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:12,235
-How've you been?
-Kot-nim!

945
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:14,654
Kot-nim!

946
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:17,616
Uncle Tiger, what about my dad?

947
01:48:18,867 --> 01:48:20,118
He had to go to work.

948
01:48:29,211 --> 01:48:30,837
-"Krypton."
-Is Kot-nim crying?

949
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:48,980
Captain, keep working,
but Kot-nim should go.

950
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:50,315
It won't do any good.

951
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:55,028
If the bomb explodes, a 5,000 km wave
of krypton will be released.

952
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:58,156
-It will destroy all nanobots.
-What?

953
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,075
Kot-nim, come on!

954
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:03,537
Even if she survives,

955
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:05,497
she'll get sick again.

956
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:08,083
And forget about restoring Earth.

957
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:10,293
What do you mean?
You said you'd stop the explosion.

958
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:13,463
-Can't you do anything, Captain?
-I can't do anything.

959
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,967
The detonator's on the inside.
If I hack in, it will explode.

960
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:20,345
Nothing can stop it.

961
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,640
And the Factory will fall to Earth.

962
01:49:26,017 --> 01:49:27,352
There's nothing we can do.

963
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,230
Captain, how can you give up now?

964
01:49:30,313 --> 01:49:32,983
Try something. Anything!

965
01:49:33,483 --> 01:49:34,526
If we go far away…

966
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,153
If Kot-nim

967
01:49:38,029 --> 01:49:39,948
is very far away from the explosion,

968
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,076
can she live?

969
01:49:43,159 --> 01:49:44,619
If she escapes the krypton wave.

970
01:49:44,703 --> 01:49:47,706
-How far?
-5132.463 km.

971
01:49:58,133 --> 01:49:59,217
There's no other way.

972
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:02,137
I'm okay with it.

973
01:50:06,182 --> 01:50:07,100
Take Kot-nim.

974
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:11,104
-Kot-nim.
-We don't have much time.

975
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:12,897
I'll go as fast as I can.

976
01:50:15,483 --> 01:50:16,818
Uncle Tae-ho!

977
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:38,340
Listen to me. Our ship is that way.

978
01:50:38,423 --> 01:50:39,507
Go wait there.

979
01:50:39,591 --> 01:50:41,217
And you?

980
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:44,471
I'll take everyone and come soon, okay?

981
01:50:46,973 --> 01:50:48,266
Touch her, and you're dead.

982
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:10,080
Kot-nim!

983
01:51:11,164 --> 01:51:12,749
Step aside, ordinary folk.

984
01:51:15,418 --> 01:51:17,545
This one's more than you can handle.

985
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:21,049
Mr. Park!

986
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:39,984
Mr. Park!

987
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:37,000
I knew you'd grab on.

988
01:52:37,083 --> 01:52:39,294
Now it's my turn!

989
01:52:52,557 --> 01:52:54,434
A present. It will be hot.

990
01:52:54,517 --> 01:52:57,270
It really is hot. It really is a hand!

991
01:52:57,979 --> 01:53:01,232
Thanks Mr. Park, I mean Tiger Park!

992
01:53:02,859 --> 01:53:04,694
Take it off slowly.

993
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:06,279
There's no time, dammit!

994
01:53:06,362 --> 01:53:08,490
You want it slowly, or quickly?

995
01:53:22,712 --> 01:53:24,881
Captain, call Pierre!

996
01:53:24,964 --> 01:53:27,008
He came last time!

997
01:53:27,884 --> 01:53:29,010
The emergency channel.

998
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:32,138
Mr. Park, the channel is on, right?

999
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:33,556
Emergency channel!

1000
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,892
KOR SH 7901, Victory.

1001
01:53:35,975 --> 01:53:37,477
It's already on.

1002
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:41,147
Current location, inside the Factory.
You all heard what Sullivan said?

1003
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:42,607
We heard everything!

1004
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:45,151
We need to go help Captain Jang!

1005
01:53:45,693 --> 01:53:48,780
Help me? I don't think you get it.

1006
01:53:48,863 --> 01:53:50,198
Listen up, everyone.

1007
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:54,619
Soon, the Factory will fall to Earth.

1008
01:53:55,370 --> 01:54:00,083
Right on the heads
of your family members on Earth.

1009
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:03,461
This isn't an accident,
or a terrorist attack.

1010
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,588
All you sweepers,

1011
01:54:06,297 --> 01:54:08,258
if you want to live then run away,

1012
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:09,175
otherwise…

1013
01:54:10,134 --> 01:54:11,219
Come and fight.

1014
01:54:12,262 --> 01:54:13,888
I'll help you all.

1015
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:24,315
Five thousand kilometers.
Tae-ho, there's no time!

1016
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:26,734
Victory, please hold together.

1017
01:54:26,818 --> 01:54:29,112
I don't know
if the ship can last that long.

1018
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:41,040
-Pierre.
-Captain Jang! It's me!

1019
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:43,001
I'll do anything.

1020
01:54:44,752 --> 01:54:48,131
Listen to that lover boy.
Doesn't he get the situation?

1021
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:57,140
Mr. Park, is it done?

1022
01:54:57,223 --> 01:54:58,766
It's done, all done.

1023
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:01,019
Stop acting pitiful
and get down here! Tiger Park!

1024
01:55:05,773 --> 01:55:07,191
Move over, Pierre!

1025
01:55:44,145 --> 01:55:46,189
Space sweepers, let's see what you got.

1026
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,737
Damn! I almost lost it there.

1027
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:36,364
Shit!

1028
01:56:49,585 --> 01:56:51,129
One's on our tail.

1029
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:03,224
Got you, bastard!

1030
01:57:33,463 --> 01:57:34,338
Please…

1031
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:37,550
Kot-nim? Is she okay?

1032
01:57:37,633 --> 01:57:39,218
Yes, don't worry.

1033
01:57:39,927 --> 01:57:43,014
She's safe inside the container.

1034
01:58:34,732 --> 01:58:35,650
Captain Jang!

1035
01:58:38,194 --> 01:58:40,154
-Captain Jang!
-Captain Jang!

1036
01:59:02,927 --> 01:59:03,761
It's too slow.

1037
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:06,639
Mr. Park. Burn the last of our fuel
and hit the booster!

1038
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:09,392
The emergency booster
will only give you 20 seconds!

1039
01:59:09,475 --> 01:59:10,685
That's enough.

1040
01:59:12,562 --> 01:59:13,688
Won't anything go right?

1041
01:59:13,771 --> 01:59:16,357
Bubs! Release the gear
for the emergency booster!

1042
01:59:21,696 --> 01:59:22,530
Bubs!

1043
02:00:48,407 --> 02:00:49,450
Tae-ho.

1044
02:00:58,042 --> 02:01:01,128
Captain Jang, Mr. Park, Bubs.

1045
02:01:03,381 --> 02:01:04,966
Thank you for everything.

1046
02:01:05,549 --> 02:01:07,468
I was happy

1047
02:01:08,511 --> 02:01:09,595
with you guys.

1048
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,265
You know that I love you all?

1049
02:01:42,169 --> 02:01:43,170
Kot-nim

1050
02:01:45,256 --> 02:01:46,757
isn't here, you fucking loser.

1051
02:01:47,758 --> 02:01:51,637
We can't stop it from exploding.
So let's take the bomb and run.

1052
02:01:51,721 --> 02:01:53,597
And leave Kot-nim in the Factory?

1053
02:01:53,681 --> 02:01:55,224
Captain Jang! It's me!

1054
02:01:55,308 --> 02:01:59,020
Before we fly out,
we'll give Kot-nim to Pierre.

1055
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:01,647
Where are you going without me?

1056
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:03,983
We have to go to work too.

1057
02:02:05,609 --> 02:02:08,571
Hide Kot-nim, and take the bomb with us?

1058
02:02:08,654 --> 02:02:10,156
Then we'll all die together?

1059
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:11,490
There's no other way.

1060
02:02:12,074 --> 02:02:14,076
Goodbye, Kot-nim.

1061
02:02:20,458 --> 02:02:22,710
It needs to explode 5,000 km away.

1062
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:24,670
Then Kot-nim will be safe.

1063
02:02:25,921 --> 02:02:28,549
And then she can save the Earth.

1064
02:02:35,097 --> 02:02:36,182
Let's go together.

1065
02:04:29,587 --> 02:04:32,381
-What about Bubs?
-Fine. The head at least.

1066
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:35,593
The repair fee will be insane.

1067
02:04:36,218 --> 02:04:38,762
And what was that?
"Thanks for everything"?

1068
02:04:39,889 --> 02:04:42,099
"I was happy with you guys"?

1069
02:04:42,683 --> 02:04:44,810
"You know that I love you all"?

1070
02:04:44,894 --> 02:04:47,646
You all are so corny.

1071
02:05:03,412 --> 02:05:08,709
VICTORY

1072
02:05:40,574 --> 02:05:42,201
Long time no see, Porky.

1073
02:05:45,037 --> 02:05:47,373
-Who are…
-I'm hurt.

1074
02:05:47,456 --> 02:05:49,041
You don't recognize Bubs?

1075
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:52,878
Porky, that idiot.

1076
02:05:58,592 --> 02:06:00,386
-Pay up.
-Yes, pay up!

1077
02:06:01,512 --> 02:06:04,181
For what we did today. Pay us.

1078
02:06:05,891 --> 02:06:06,725
Right.

1079
02:07:28,515 --> 02:07:30,893
Daddy, I finished writing.

1080
02:07:30,976 --> 02:07:32,102
You did?

1081
02:07:34,229 --> 02:07:35,481
Then show me.

1082
02:07:36,106 --> 02:07:38,108
WRITING KOREAN

1083
02:07:47,534 --> 02:07:48,702
You wrote so well.

1084
02:07:57,127 --> 02:07:58,003
Su-ni,

1085
02:07:59,421 --> 02:08:00,798
give me a hug?

1086
02:08:06,261 --> 02:08:09,598
Sorry I'm so late.

1087
02:08:12,226 --> 02:08:15,396
Thanks so much for coming to me.

1088
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:23,112
Bye, Daddy.

1089
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:42,840
You're slacking off, kid.
Need to get you another tutor.

1090
02:08:42,923 --> 02:08:44,758
-Right.
-Stop freaking out, you two.

1091
02:08:44,842 --> 02:08:48,137
We're not freaking out.
She's a first grader now.

1092
02:08:48,804 --> 02:08:52,766
Look at all the other moms.
They hire five tutors for their kids.

1093
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:55,060
-That's right.
-Want her to fall behind and resent you?

1094
02:08:55,144 --> 02:08:57,187
I'm not saying she should do nothing.

1095
02:08:57,730 --> 02:09:00,524
Hey, Kot-nim! Want another tutor?

1096
02:09:01,275 --> 02:09:02,735
Of course she doesn't!

1097
02:09:02,818 --> 02:09:04,778
People keep complimenting my voice.

1098
02:09:04,862 --> 02:09:06,572
And this one is nice.

1099
02:09:06,655 --> 02:09:09,825
I enjoy singing ballads.

1100
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:10,826
What do you think?

1101
02:09:11,326 --> 02:09:13,954
I don't like them. I like your voice now.

1102
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:20,127
Still, pick one. I can't keep this voice.

1103
02:09:22,337 --> 02:09:24,631
We've become a new family.

1104
02:09:25,132 --> 02:09:28,135
Sometimes I go to Earth to make trees.

1105
02:09:28,635 --> 02:09:31,180
Captain has stopped drinking.

1106
02:09:31,263 --> 02:09:36,977
Bubs is a real girl now,
and she wants to get cultured.

1107
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:42,274
Uncle Tiger erased his tattoos
so he won't scare my friends.

1108
02:09:42,858 --> 02:09:46,445
And Uncle Tae-ho
bought ten pairs of shoes.

1109
02:09:47,362 --> 02:09:50,240
I think Daddy must be happy in heaven.

1110
02:09:50,324 --> 02:09:56,330
LIFE AND SONGS

1111
02:09:58,207 --> 02:10:01,710
Damn it! How am I supposed to read?

1112
02:10:01,794 --> 02:10:04,004
What are they doing in our territory?

1113
02:10:04,087 --> 02:10:05,380
Start the engine.

1114
02:10:05,923 --> 02:10:07,633
We'll get 400 dollars for those.

1115
02:10:18,352 --> 02:10:21,230
Let's go make some money!

1116
02:16:19,379 --> 02:16:24,384
