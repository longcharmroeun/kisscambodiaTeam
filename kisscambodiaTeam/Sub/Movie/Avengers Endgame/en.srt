1
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,927
-You see where you're going?
-Mm-hmm.

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,095
Okay.

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,183
Now, let's worry about how you get there.

4
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,428
Gotta move your foot here.

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,348
Point your toe this way.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,268
Your hips here.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,810
Okay?

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,937
-Can you see?
-Yeah.

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,108
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,608
How about now?
Can you see now?

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,066
-No.
-How about now?

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,320
All right.

13
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,991
Ready?
Three fingers.

14
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,871
Nice!

15
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,962
Nice throw, kiddo.

16
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,213
Here you go.

17
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,633
Hey, you guys want mayo?
Or mustard?

18
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,254
Or both?

19
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,506
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

20
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:48,633
Probably your brothers.

21
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,969
Two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

22
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:51,974
Got it!

23
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,047
Nate, mayo or mustard?

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,890
How about ketchup?

25
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,266
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,639
Mind your elbow.

27
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,686
Good job, hawk-eye.

28
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,476
Go get your arrow.

29
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,694
Hey, guys!

30
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:12,072
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,279
All right.

32
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,818
We're coming. We're hungry.

33
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,371
Lila, let's go.

34
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,664
Lila?

35
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,595
Honey?

36
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,634
Hey, babe?

37
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,522
Babe?

38
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,768
Babe?

39
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,648
Boys!

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,398
Boys!

41
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,906
Laura!

42
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,948
You don't need to do that.

43
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,163
Because you're just holding the position.

44
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,375
Oh, yeah.

45
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,675
That was close.

46
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,293
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

47
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,841
I would like to try again.

48
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,548
We're tied up. Feel the tension?

49
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,257
It's fun.

50
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,427
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

51
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,681
And you've won.

52
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,926
Congratulations.

53
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,231
Fair game.

54
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,945
Good sport.

55
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,319
You have fun?

56
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,070
It was fun.

57
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,215
This thing on?

58
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,387
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

59
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,429
If you find this recording...

60
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,272
don't post it on social media.

61
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,148
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

62
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,225
I don't know if you're ever gonna see these.

63
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,441
I don't even know if you're still...

64
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,857
Oh, God, I hope so.

65
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,948
Today's day 21.

66
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,367
No, 22.

67
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,577
You know, if it wasn't for the
existential terror...

68
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:12,208
of staring into the literal void of space,
I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.

69
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,417
Infection's run its course,
thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,586
You'd love her.

71
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,178
Very practical.

72
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,725
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

73
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,805
So, the fuel cells
were cracked during battle...

74
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,147
and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...

75
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,023
and bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.

76
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,149
But it's now dead in the water.

77
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,821
Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.

78
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,696
Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning...

79
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,875
and that'll be it.

80
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,248
Pep, I know I said no more surprises...

81
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,011
but I gotta say
I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

82
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,135
But it looks like...

83
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,102
Well, you know what it looks like.

84
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,354
Don't feel bad about this.

85
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,306
I mean, actually,
if you grovel for a couple weeks...

86
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,191
and then move on with enormous guilt...

87
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,369
I should probably lie down for a minute.
Go rest my eyes.

88
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,908
Please know...

89
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,711
when I drift off,
it'll be like every night lately.

90
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,876
I'm fine. Totally fine.

91
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,845
I dream about you.

92
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,013
Because it's always you.

93
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,752
Couldn't stop him.

94
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Neither could I.

95
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,258
Hang on.

96
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,265
I lost the kid.

97
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,394
Tony, we lost.

98
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:18,683
Is...?

99
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,315
-Oh, good.
-Oh, my God!

100
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,362
Oh, my God!

101
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,487
It's okay.

102
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,199
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

103
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,917
World governments are in pieces.

104
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,003
The parts that are still working...

105
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,961
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

106
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,298
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do.

107
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,639
Thanos wiped out...

108
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,136
...50% of all living creatures.

109
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,400
Where is he now?
Where?

110
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,276
We don't know.

111
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,533
He just opened a portal and walked through.

112
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,197
What's wrong with him?

113
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,244
He's pissed.

114
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,751
He thinks he failed.

115
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,206
Which, of course, he did...

116
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,503
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

117
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,207
Honestly, until this exact second
I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

118
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,798
Maybe I am.

119
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,343
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

120
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,507
Deep space scans...

121
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,719
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

122
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:38,513
Tony, you fought him.

123
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,600
Who told you that?

124
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,305
I didn't fight him.

125
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,065
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

126
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,647
while the Bleecker Street magician
gave away the store.

127
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,152
That's what happened.
There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable.

128
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,035
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

129
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,529
I saw this coming a few years back.

130
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,317
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

131
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,284
Thought I was dreaming.

132
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,451
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

133
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,369
And I needed you.

134
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,578
As in, past tense.

135
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,997
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

136
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,287
Sorry.

137
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,963
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

138
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,131
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

139
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,180
Tony, Tony!

140
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:21,643
...alive and otherwise, that what we needed
was a suit of armor around the world.

141
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,437
Remember that? Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

142
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,812
That's what we needed.

143
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,059
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

144
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,650
I said we'd lose.

145
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,985
You said,
"We'll do that together, too."

146
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,606
And guess what, Cap?

147
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,067
We lost.

148
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,529
And you weren't there.

149
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,285
But that's what we do, right?

150
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,199
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

151
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,329
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

152
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,496
-Okay.
-Right?

153
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,874
You made your point. Just sit down, okay?

154
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

155
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,537
-She's great by the way.
-Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

156
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,340
We need you. You're new blood.

157
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,343
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

158
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,796
I got no coordinates...

159
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,716
no clues, no strategies, no options.

160
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,596
Zero. Zip. Nada.

161
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,512
No trust, liar.

162
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,310
Here, take this.

163
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,608
You find him, you put that on...

164
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,614
you hide.

165
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,611
-Tony!
-I'm fine.

166
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,487
Let me...

167
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,294
Bruce gave him a sedative.

168
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,164
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

169
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,708
You guys take care of him...

170
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,425
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir
when I come back.

171
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,002
Where are you going?

172
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,840
To kill Thanos.

173
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,013
Hey.

174
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,296
You know, we usually work as a team here...

175
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,140
and, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

176
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,895
We realize up there is more your territory,
but this is our fight, too.

177
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,229
You even know where he is?

178
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,563
I know people who might.

179
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,058
Don't bother.

180
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,772
I can tell you where Thanos is.

181
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,278
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

182
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,955
And when he worked,
he talked about his Great Plan.

183
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,197
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

184
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,791
I'd ask...

185
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,001
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

186
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,501
And his answer was always the same.

187
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,715
"To the Garden."

188
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,094
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

189
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,802
So, where is he?

190
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,217
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

191
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:31,271
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

192
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,646
No one's ever seen anything like it.

193
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,154
Until two days ago...

194
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,574
on this planet.

195
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,778
Thanos is there.

196
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,199
He used the stones again.

197
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,869
Hey, hey, hey.

198
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,245
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

199
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,792
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

200
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,505
So, let's get 'em.

201
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,045
Use them to bring everyone back.

202
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,288
Just like that?

203
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,039
Yeah. Just like that.

204
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,381
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

205
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,258
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

206
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:06,386
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end
any differently than it did before?

207
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,185
Because before you didn't have me.

208
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,227
Hey, new girl?

209
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,102
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

210
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,896
And if you don't mind my asking,
where the hell have you been all this time?

211
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,484
There are a lot of other planets
in the universe.

212
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,530
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.

213
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,263
I like this one.

214
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,274
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

215
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,037
Okay.

216
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,825
Who here hasn't been to space?

217
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,339
Why?

218
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,172
You better not throw up on my ship.

219
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,627
Approaching jump in three...

220
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,877
two, one.

221
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,147
I'll head down for recon.

222
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,876
This is gonna work, Steve.

223
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,841
I know it will.

224
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,973
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do
if it doesn't.

225
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,051
No satellites. No ships. No armies.

226
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,721
No ground defenses of any kind.

227
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,478
It's just him.

228
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,852
And that's enough.

229
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,320
Oh, no.

230
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,544
Where are they?

231
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,373
Answer the question.

232
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,213
The universe required correction.

233
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:11,169
After that, the stones served no purpose...

234
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,971
beyond temptation.

235
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,105
You murdered trillions!

236
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,644
You should be grateful.

237
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,772
Where are the stones?

238
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,307
Gone.

239
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,560
Reduced to atoms.

240
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,732
You used them two days ago!

241
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:32,111
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

242
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,493
It nearly killed me.

243
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,658
But the work is done.

244
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,746
It always will be.

245
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,711
I am inevitable.

246
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,383
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying!

247
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:51,757
My father is many things.

248
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,723
A liar is not one of them.

249
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,062
Thank you, daughter.

250
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,855
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

251
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
What?

252
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,778
What did you do?

253
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,123
I went for the head.

254
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,191
So...

255
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,984
...I went on a date the other day.

256
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,822
It's the first time in five years.

257
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,317
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

258
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,532
I didn't even know what to talk about.

259
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,079
What did you talk about?

260
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,919
Same old crap.
You know, how things have changed.

261
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,171
My job, his job.

262
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,049
How much we miss the Mets.

263
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,015
And then things got quiet...

264
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,719
then he cried
as they were serving the salads.

265
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,389
What about you?

266
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,735
I cried just before dessert.

267
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,612
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

268
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,526
That's great.

269
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,284
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

270
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,566
You didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

271
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:26,489
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps we gotta take...

272
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:30,372
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

273
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:36,209
I went in the ice in '45.
right after I met the love of my life.

274
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,839
Woke up 70 years later.

275
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:44,009
You gotta move on.

276
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,353
Gotta move on.

277
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,608
The world is in our hands.

278
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,864
It's left to us, guys.

279
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,236
And we gotta do something with it.

280
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,356
Otherwise...

281
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,987
Thanos should've killed all of us.

282
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,260
What the hell?

283
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:22,897
Hope?

284
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,103
Kid!

285
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,311
Hey, kid!

286
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,861
What the hell happened here?

287
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,308
Oh, my God!

288
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,608
Oh, please!

289
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,324
Please, please!

290
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,494
No, no, no. No.

291
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,316
No.

292
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,658
Excuse me. Sorry.

293
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,116
Cassie, no.

294
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,746
No, no, no.

295
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,832
No, no.

296
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,670
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

297
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,055
What?

298
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,464
Cassie?

299
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:44,997
Dad?

300
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,779
You're so big!

301
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:31,263
Yeah. We boarded that highly-suspect warship
Danvers pinged.

302
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,135
It was an infectious garbage scow.

303
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,762
So, thanks for the hot tip.

304
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,258
Well, you were closer.

305
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,720
Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

306
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,220
You get a reading on those tremors?

307
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,981
'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.

308
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,194
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

309
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,524
Nat.

310
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,941
It's an earthquake under the ocean.

311
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,938
We handle it by not handling it.

312
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,815
Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

313
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,991
-Not likely.
-What? You gonna get another haircut?

314
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,489
Listen, fur face.

315
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,450
I'm covering a lot of territory.

316
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,751
The things that are happening on Earth
are happening everywhere.

317
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,922
On thousands of planets.

318
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,754
All right, all right. That's a good point.
That's a good point.

319
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,011
So, you might not see me for a long time.

320
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,510
All right. Well...

321
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,514
This channel's always active.

322
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,758
So, if anything goes sideways...

323
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:21,351
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

324
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:22,677
comes through me.

325
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,307
Okay.

326
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:25,938
All right.

327
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,768
Good luck.

328
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:37,375
Where are you?

329
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,533
Mexico.

330
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,330
The Federales found a room full of bodies.

331
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:43,125
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys...

332
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,248
never even had a chance
to get their guns off.

333
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,125
It's probably a rival gang.

334
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,502
Except it isn't.

335
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,842
It's definitely Barton.

336
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,011
What he's done here...

337
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,343
what he's been doing
for the last few years...

338
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,967
I mean, the scene that he left...

339
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:03,522
I gotta tell you, there's a part of me
that doesn't even wanna find him.

340
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,356
Will you find out where he's going next?

341
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,399
Nat?

342
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,908
Please?

343
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,830
Okay.

344
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,458
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner...

345
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,377
but you seem pretty miserable already.

346
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,889
You here to do your laundry?

347
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,644
And to see a friend.

348
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:46,394
Clearly, your friend is fine.

349
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:51,646
You know, I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming over the bridge.

350
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,645
-In the Hudson?
-There's fewer ships...

351
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,067
cleaner water.

352
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:59,155
You know, if you're about to tell me
to look on the bright side...

353
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:05,123
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

354
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,250
Sorry.

355
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,575
Force of habit.

356
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,977
You know, I keep telling everybody
they should move on...

357
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,809
and grow.

358
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,310
Some do.

359
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:36,285
But not us.

360
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,067
If I move on, who does this?

361
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,566
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

362
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,036
I used to have nothing.

363
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,119
And then I got this.

364
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,133
This job.

365
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:59,256
This family.

366
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,925
And I was better because of it.

367
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:16,728
And even though they're gone...

368
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,106
I'm still trying to be better.

369
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,579
I think we both need to get a life.

370
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,418
You first.

371
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:40,423
Hi, hi!
Is anyone home?

372
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:42,301
This is Scott Lang.

373
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:45,297
We met a few years ago at the airport...

374
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,140
in Germany?

375
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,596
I was the guy that got really big.
I had a mask on.

376
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,266
-You wouldn't recognize me.
-Is this an old message?

377
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,405
Ant-Man?
I know you know that.

378
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:57,153
-It's the front gate.
-I really need to talk to you guys.

379
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,492
Scott.

380
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:06,449
Are you okay?

381
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:07,617
Yeah.

382
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,791
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

383
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,706
Only to make conversation.

384
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,421
All right, so...

385
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,503
five years ago, right before...

386
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,208
Thanos...

387
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,680
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

388
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,342
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

389
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,642
To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.

390
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,345
Hope. She's my...

391
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,144
She was my...

392
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,064
She was supposed to pull me out.

393
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,821
And then Thanos happened...

394
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,652
and I got stuck in there.

395
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,069
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

396
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:44,567
Yeah, but that's just it.

397
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:45,908
It wasn't.

398
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,283
For me, it was five hours.

399
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,869
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

400
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,575
Everything is unpredictable.

401
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,945
Is that anybody's sandwich?

402
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,371
I'm starving.

403
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,826
Scott.

404
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,289
What are you talking about?

405
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,543
So...

406
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,094
what I'm saying is...

407
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:05,385
time works differently in the quantum realm.

408
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:08,851
The only problem is right now
we don't have a way to navigate it.

409
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,012
But what if we did?

410
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,984
I can't stop thinking about it.
What if we could somehow control the chaos...

411
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,272
and we could navigate it?

412
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:16,935
What if there was a way...

413
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,904
that we could enter the quantum realm
at a certain point in time...

414
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,775
but then exit the quantum realm
at another point in time?

415
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,283
Like...

416
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,108
-Like before Thanos.
-Wait.

417
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,871
Are you talking about a time machine?

418
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,792
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

419
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:32,992
This is more like a...

420
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,955
Yeah. Like a time machine.

421
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,924
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

422
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,458
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...

423
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,513
some way...

424
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,473
-It's crazy.
-Scott.

425
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,933
I get emails from a raccoon...

426
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,103
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

427
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,926
So, who do we talk to about this?

428
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,123
Chow time!

429
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:15,618
Maguna.

430
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,422
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

431
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,796
-Define "lunch" or be disintegrated.
-Okay.

432
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,633
You should not be wearing that, okay?

433
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,339
That is part of a special anniversary gift
I'm making for Mom.

434
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,677
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

435
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,770
I can give you a handful of crickets
on a bed of lettuce.

436
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,646
-No.
-That's what you want.

437
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,942
How did you find this?

438
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,936
-Garage.
-Really?

439
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,108
-Were you looking for it?
-No.

440
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,856
I found it, though.

441
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,780
You like going in the garage, huh?

442
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,199
So does Daddy.

443
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,791
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

444
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:00,748
So, I'm gonna...

445
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:20,807
No. We know what it sounds like.

446
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,648
Tony, after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible?

447
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,323
Quantum fluctuation
messes with the Planck Scale...

448
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,282
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition.
Can we agree on that?

449
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,533
Thank you.

450
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,825
In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.

451
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,405
-I did.
-No.

452
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:34,994
You accidentally survived.

453
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:37,704
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

454
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,960
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

455
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,330
A time heist?

456
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:47,841
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.
Why didn't we think of this before?

457
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,475
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

458
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:54,222
The stones are in the past.
We could go back, we could get them.

459
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,676
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

460
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,767
Or screw it up
worse than he already has, right?

461
00:34:58,932 --> 00:34:59,932
I don't believe we would.

462
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:03,057
Gotta say it.
I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

463
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,647
However, high hopes won't help...

464
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:11,324
if there's no logical, tangible way
for me to safely execute said time heist.

465
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:14,316
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.

466
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,369
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

467
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:20,124
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

468
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,827
no betting on sporting events.

469
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:23,747
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

470
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,916
Are you seriously telling me
that your plan to save the universe...

471
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,746
is based on Back to the Future?

472
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,631
-Is it?
-No.

473
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:34,969
Good. You had me worried there.
'Cause that would be horseshit.

474
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,425
That's not how quantum physics works.

475
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:38,756
Tony.

476
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,184
We have to take a stand.

477
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,731
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

478
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:48,364
I know you got a lot on the line.

479
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:51,397
You got a wife, a daughter.

480
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:54,068
But I lost someone very important to me.

481
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,818
A lotta people did.

482
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,989
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

483
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,829
to bring everyone back,
and you're telling me that you won't even...

484
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,785
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

485
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,829
I can't.

486
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,252
Mommy told me to come and save you.

487
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,841
Good job. I'm saved.

488
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,761
I wish you were coming here to ask me
something else. Anything else.

489
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,718
I'm honestly happy to see you guys,
I just...

490
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,508
-Oh, look, the table's set for six.
-Tony.

491
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:22,772
I get it.

492
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:25,233
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

493
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,519
But this is a second chance.

494
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,650
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

495
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,356
Can't roll the dice on it.

496
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,364
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

497
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:40,826
Well, he's scared.

498
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:42,543
He's not wrong.

499
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,703
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

500
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,162
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

501
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,082
No, I wanna do it right.

502
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,956
We're gonna need a really big brain.

503
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,468
Bigger than his?

504
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,545
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one
eating here. Try some of that.

505
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Have some eggs.

506
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,471
I'm so confused.

507
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,309
These are confusing times.

508
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,394
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

509
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,060
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

510
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,436
I know, it's crazy.

511
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:12,817
I'm wearing shirts now.

512
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,823
Yeah. What? How? Why?

513
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,608
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

514
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,869
Except it was worse for me...

515
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:22,243
'cause I lost twice.

516
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,199
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

517
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,328
and then, we all lost.

518
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:27,746
No one blamed you, Bruce.

519
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,295
I did.

520
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:33,423
For years, I've been treating the Hulk
like he's some kind of disease...

521
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:35,047
something to get rid of.

522
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,467
But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

523
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,181
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

524
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,935
I put the brains and the brawn together...

525
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:45,347
and now, look at me.

526
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,731
Best of both worlds.

527
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,807
-Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
-Yes.

528
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,308
Can we get a photo?

529
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,730
100%, little person.

530
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:55,939
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

531
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:58,322
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Thanks.

532
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:00,067
Say "green."

533
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,489
-Green.
-Green.

534
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:03,578
Did you get that?

535
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:04,992
That's a good one.

536
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,036
Did you want to grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

537
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,628
They're Hulk fans. They don't know Ant-Man.

538
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:14,884
Nobody does.

539
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,585
-No, he wants you to take a picture with him.
-I don't want a picture.

540
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:17,755
Stranger danger.

541
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:19,473
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't.

542
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,683
-I get it. I don't want it, either.
-But come on. The kid...

543
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,264
I don't want a picture with them.

544
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,428
-He's gonna feel bad.
-Sorry.

545
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,756
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

546
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,391
-I don't want to do it.
-We can do it.

547
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,558
-No, you feel bad.
-Take the goddamn phone.

548
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:30,886
Okay.

549
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,731
-Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
-No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.

550
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:35,569
Hulk out!

551
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:36,612
Bruce.

552
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:38,192
Dab.

553
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:40,147
-Bruce.
-Listen to your mom.

554
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:41,529
She knows better.

555
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,367
About what we were saying.

556
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:44,742
Right.

557
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:49,372
The whole time travel do-over?

558
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:54,424
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

559
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,127
Well, you pulled this off.

560
00:38:57,171 --> 00:39:00,971
I remember a time when that seemed
pretty impossible, too.

561
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,089
I've got a mild inspiration.
I'd like to see if it checks out.

562
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:41,012
So, I'd like to run one last sim
before we pack it in for the night.

563
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:45,553
This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip,
inverted, please.

564
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,799
Processing.

565
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,765
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

566
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,945
factoring in spectral decomp.

567
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:57,063
-That'll take a second.
-Just a moment.

568
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,976
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

569
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:04,028
Model rendered.

570
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:16,672
Shit!

571
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,037
Shit!

572
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,174
What are you doing up, little miss?

573
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,051
-Shit.
-Nope. We don't say that.

574
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:27,428
Only Mommy says that word.

575
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,014
She coined it. It belongs to her.

576
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,139
Why are you up?

577
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:31,675
'Cause I've got some important shit
going on here!

578
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,019
Why do you think?

579
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:36,143
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.

580
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,851
Was it juice pops?

581
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:40,608
Sure was.

582
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,775
That's extortion. That's a word.

583
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:45,114
What kind you want?

584
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,279
Great minds think alike.

585
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,276
Juice pops exactly...

586
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,580
was on my mind.

587
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:54,125
You done? Yeah?

588
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:55,873
Now you are.

589
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,616
Here. Wipe.

590
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:02,995
Good. That face goes there.

591
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:04,422
Tell me a story.

592
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,170
A story.

593
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,471
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.
The end.

594
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,224
That is a horrible story.

595
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:12,137
Come on, that's your favorite story.

596
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,018
Love you tons.

597
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,848
I love you 3.000.

598
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,114
Wow.

599
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:30,316
3.000. That's crazy.

600
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,333
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

601
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:35,866
Night night.

602
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,248
Not that it's a competition...

603
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,668
but she loves me 3.000.

604
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,923
Does she, now?

605
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:44,134
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

606
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:51,677
Whatcha reading?

607
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:53,764
Just a book on composting.

608
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:56,021
What's new with composting?

609
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,516
-Interesting science...
-I figured it out.

610
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:01,604
By the way.

611
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:05,861
And, you know,
just so we're talking about the same thing...

612
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,486
Time travel.

613
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:08,993
What?

614
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Wow.

615
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:19,828
That's amazing...

616
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:21,921
and terrifying.

617
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:23,544
That's right.

618
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:32,553
We got really lucky.

619
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,719
Yeah.

620
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,007
I know.

621
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,310
A lot of people didn't.

622
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,103
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

623
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,192
Sorta seems like you can.

624
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:42,983
Not if I stop.

625
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,027
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

626
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:48,818
Tony...

627
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,068
trying to get you to stop...

628
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,868
has been one of the few failures
of my entire life.

629
00:42:58,161 --> 00:42:59,831
Something tells me...

630
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:03,793
I should put it in a lockbox
and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

631
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:06,212
and go to bed.

632
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,643
But would you be able to rest?

633
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:22,689
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

634
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:25,023
Scott, fire up...

635
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:27,109
the van thing.

636
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:30,441
Breakers are set.

637
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:32,451
Emergency generators are on standby.

638
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:37,533
Good, because if we blow the grid,
I don't want to lose Tiny here in the 1950s.

639
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:38,541
Excuse me?

640
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,662
He's kidding.

641
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,789
You can't say things like that.

642
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,456
It was a bad joke.

643
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,420
You were kidding, right?

644
00:43:47,586 --> 00:43:50,706
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

645
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:53,131
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

646
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,970
We're good!

647
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,465
Get your helmet on.

648
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,885
Scott, I'm gonna send you back a week...

649
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:02,266
let you walk around for an hour,
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

650
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:03,444
Make sense?

651
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:05,352
Perfectly not confusing.

652
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,481
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

653
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:12,074
You're right. I do, Captain America.

654
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:15,568
On a count of three...

655
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:19,619
Three, two, one.

656
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:24,535
Guys?

657
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:26,882
This doesn't feel right.

658
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:27,882
What is this?

659
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:28,883
-What's going on?
-Who is that?

660
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:29,884
-Hold on.
-Is that Scott?

661
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:30,915
Yes, it's Scott.

662
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:36,339
-What's going on, Bruce?
-Oh, my back!

663
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,470
-What is this?
-Hold on a second.

664
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:38,886
-Could I get a little space here?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:40,934
-Can you bring him back?
-I'm working on it.

666
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,980
It's a baby.

667
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,687
-It's Scott.
-As a baby.

668
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,228
-He'll grow.
-Bring Scott back.

669
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:53,781
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

670
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:55,204
Oh, my God.

671
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,284
And... kill it!

672
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:03,502
Somebody peed my pants.

673
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:04,622
Oh, thank God.

674
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:07,998
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me.

675
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:13,296
Or just me me.

676
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:14,924
Time travel!

677
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:19,677
What?

678
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,596
I see this as an absolute win.

679
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,559
Why the long face?

680
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,479
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

681
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,732
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

682
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:17,321
It's the EPR Paradox.

683
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,161
Instead of pushing Lang through time,
you might've wound up...

684
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:21,742
pushing time through Lang.

685
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:24,577
It's tricky, dangerous.
Somebody could have cautioned you against it.

686
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:25,703
You did.

687
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:27,079
Oh, did I?

688
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:28,906
Well, thank God I'm here.

689
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,326
Regardless, I fixed it.

690
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,707
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

691
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:38,047
I just want peace.

692
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:42,395
Turns out resentment is corrosive,
and I hate it.

693
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:44,642
Me, too.

694
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:49,349
We got a shot at getting these stones,
but I gotta tell you my priorities.

695
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:51,848
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

696
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,860
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

697
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:58,688
And maybe not die trying.

698
00:46:58,861 --> 00:46:59,901
Would be nice.

699
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,454
Sounds like a deal.

700
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:28,055
Tony, I don't know.

701
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:29,853
Why?

702
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:31,807
He made it for you.

703
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:35,557
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of
the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

704
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,241
Thank you, Tony.

705
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,778
Will you keep that a little quiet?

706
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,870
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

707
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:51,909
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

708
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,830
We're working on that right now.

709
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:12,984
Hey, Humie.

710
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,309
Where's Big Green?

711
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:17,686
The kitchen, I think.

712
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:20,151
That's awesome.

713
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,450
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

714
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:25,322
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

715
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:27,620
Oh, God.

716
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,240
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

717
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:25,376
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

718
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:26,877
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

719
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,010
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

720
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:30,718
They're probably just happy to have a home.

721
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,598
You shouldn't have come.

722
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:35,683
Valkyrie!

723
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:38,561
Great to see you, angry girl!

724
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:40,939
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

725
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:43,981
-This is Rocket.
-How ya doing?

726
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:47,403
He won't see you.

727
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:48,778
It's that bad, huh?

728
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:53,577
We only see him once a month
when he comes in for "supplies."

729
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,791
It's that bad.

730
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:56,964
Yeah.

731
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:10,508
What the...?

732
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:15,642
Something died in here!

733
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:18,975
Hello? Thor!

734
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,190
Are you here about the cable?

735
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:24,019
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago...

736
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:27,358
and the sports are all kinda fuzzy
and whatnot.

737
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:29,111
Thor?

738
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,617
Boys! Oh, my God!

739
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:42,999
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!

740
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:45,751
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

741
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:47,511
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

742
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:49,629
That's not necessary.

743
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:52,762
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

744
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:54,048
-Hey, boys!
-Hey, guys.

745
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:55,471
Long time no see.

746
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:57,889
Beer's in the bucket.
Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

747
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,768
No password, obviously.

748
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:02,353
Thor, he's back.

749
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:05,191
That kid on the TV
just called me a dickhead again.

750
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:06,782
Noobmaster.

751
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:09,402
Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.

752
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,740
I am sick of this.

753
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:14,575
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder.

754
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,911
Listen, bud, if you don't
log off this game immediately...

755
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:20,207
I am gonna fly over to your house, come down
to that basement you're hiding in...

756
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:23,002
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

757
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,415
Oh, that's right, yes!
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

758
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:28,129
Thank you, Thor.

759
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,627
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

760
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,008
Thank you very much. I will.

761
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,300
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

762
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,888
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

763
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,175
Buddy.

764
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,310
You all right?

765
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:42,806
Yes, I'm fine. Why?

766
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:44,018
Why, don't I look all right?

767
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:45,858
You look like melted ice cream.

768
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:49,938
So, what's up?
You just here for a hang, or what?

769
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,400
We need your help.

770
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:54,611
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

771
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,121
What, like the cable?

772
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,493
'Cause that's been driving me
bananas for weeks.

773
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,660
Like Thanos.

774
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:21,677
Don't say that name.

775
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:25,521
Yeah, we don't actually say that name
in here.

776
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,239
Please take your hand off me.

777
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:38,696
Now, I know that guy...

778
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:40,738
might scare you.

779
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,291
Why would I be...?

780
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:45,624
Why would I be scared of that guy?

781
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,631
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

782
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:50,841
Anyone else here kill that guy?

783
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,338
Nope.

784
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:56,894
Didn't think so.

785
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:02,220
Korg, why don't you tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

786
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:03,806
Stormbreaker?

787
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:05,596
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

788
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,900
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

789
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,067
I've been there myself.

790
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:15,535
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

791
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:18,026
Was it Natasha?

792
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,370
It was you.

793
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,494
You helped me.

794
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:25,164
So, why don't you ask...

795
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,578
the Asgardians down there...

796
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,460
how much my help is worth?

797
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:37,593
The ones that are left, anyway.

798
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,725
I think we could bring them back.

799
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:41,637
Stop.

800
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:43,854
Stop, okay?

801
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,520
I know you think I'm down here
wallowing in my own self-pity...

802
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:50,226
waiting to be rescued and saved...

803
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:52,477
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

804
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:54,109
We're good here, mate.

805
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:56,236
So, whatever it is that you're offering,
we're not into it.

806
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,903
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

807
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,161
Goodbye.

808
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,244
We need you, pal.

809
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,670
There's beer on the ship.

810
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:21,338
What kind?

811
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,440
It's him! He's after Akihiko!

812
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:05,348
Why are you doing this?

813
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,644
We never did anything to you!

814
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:10,269
You survived...

815
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:12,401
Half the planet didn't.

816
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,306
They got Thanos.

817
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:15,898
You get me...

818
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:23,204
You're done hurting people.

819
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:26,373
WE hurt people?

820
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:30,835
You're crazy!

821
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,111
Wait! Help me!

822
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,070
I'll give you anything!

823
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:07,455
What do you want?

824
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:10,698
What I want you can't give me.

825
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:35,773
You shouldn't be here.

826
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:40,232
Neither should you.

827
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,700
I've got a job to do.

828
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:50,914
Is that what you're calling this?

829
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:54,405
Killing all these people
isn't gonna bring your family back.

830
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,344
We found something.

831
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,176
A chance, maybe.

832
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:09,722
Don't.

833
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,099
Don't what?

834
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:16,603
Don't give me hope.

835
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,400
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

836
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,264
You're drifting left.

837
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:47,551
One side there, Lebowski.

838
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,062
Ratchet, how's it going?

839
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:53,222
It's Rocket.

840
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,930
Take it easy.
You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

841
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:02,436
Time travel suit, not bad.

842
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:05,321
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

843
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:06,485
I'm being very careful.

844
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,073
No, you're being very Hulky.

845
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:09,158
I'm being careful.

846
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:10,703
These are Pym Particles, all right?

847
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:13,366
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.

848
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,285
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

849
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,374
-Scott, calm down.
-Sorry.

850
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:20,666
We've got enough for one round-trip each.
That's it.

851
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:21,884
No do-overs.

852
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,250
Plus two test runs.

853
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:29,255
One test run.

854
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,184
All right. I'm not ready for this.

855
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,636
I'm game.

856
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,599
I'll do it.

857
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:41,227
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little
discombobulated from the chronoshift.

858
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:43,266
-Don't worry about that.
-Wait a second. Let me ask you something.

859
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,070
If we can do this, you know...

860
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:47,574
go back in time,
why don't we just find baby Thanos?

861
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:48,896
You know, and...

862
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:54,778
-First of all, that's horrible.
-It's Thanos.

863
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:57,252
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

864
00:58:57,412 --> 00:58:59,582
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

865
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,458
Look, we go back, we get the stones
before Thanos gets them...

866
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:05,376
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

867
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,376
-Bingo.
-That's not how it works.

868
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:09,668
-Well, that's what I heard.
-Wait, but who? Who told you that?

869
00:59:09,842 --> 00:59:11,632
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

870
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:13,392
-Time After Time.
-Quantum Leap.

871
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,604
-Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.
-Hot Tub Time Machine.

872
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:18,144
Hot Tub Time Machine.
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

873
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:20,388
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

874
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:22,401
Die Hard.
No, that's not one.

875
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:23,613
This is known.

876
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:26,022
I don't know why everyone believes that,
but that isn't true.

877
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:28,191
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

878
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,700
that past becomes your future...

879
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:33,823
and your former present
becomes the past...

880
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:36,621
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

881
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:37,985
Exactly.

882
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,459
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?

883
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,797
All right, Clint.

884
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:50,512
We're going in three, two...

885
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:51,684
one.

886
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,369
Cooper?

887
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,081
Where are my headphones?

888
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:08,171
Lila?

889
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:10,415
-I never had them.
-Lila?

890
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:13,175
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

891
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,047
Lila! Lila!

892
01:01:20,556 --> 01:01:21,556
Yeah, Dad?

893
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:26,475
Dad?

894
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:30,271
Lila!

895
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:38,526
Hey. Hey, look at me.

896
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:39,819
You okay?

897
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:42,584
Yeah. Yeah.

898
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:45,656
It worked.

899
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:48,786
It worked.

900
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,760
Okay, so the how works.

901
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:57,473
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

902
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:00,102
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

903
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:01,932
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

904
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:03,597
Or substitute the word "encounter"...

905
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,345
for "damn near been killed"
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

906
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:07,688
Well, I haven't...

907
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:10,193
but I don't even know
what the hell you're all talking about.

908
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:15,105
Regardless, we only have enough
Pym Particles for one round-trip each.

909
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:18,487
And these stones have been in a lot
of different places throughout history.

910
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:19,945
Our history.

911
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:23,115
So, not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in, yeah?

912
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:25,085
Which means we have to pick our targets.

913
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:26,787
Correct.

914
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:29,755
So, let's start with the Aether.

915
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,127
Thor, what do you know?

916
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:37,915
Is he asleep?

917
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:40,641
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

918
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:45,266
Where to start?

919
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,599
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

920
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:51,902
Someone called it a stone before.

921
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:57,279
It's more of an angry sludge
sort of a thing...

922
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:00,324
so someone's gonna need to amend that
and stop saying that.

923
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,321
Here's an interesting story, though,
about the Aether.

924
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:05,372
My grandfather, many years ago...

925
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:09,036
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

926
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:11,918
Scary beings.

927
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,794
So, Jane, actually...

928
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:15,918
Oh, there she is.

929
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,760
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

930
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:23,966
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

931
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,967
and then the Aether stuck itself
inside her...

932
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:29,181
and she became very, very sick.

933
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:32,481
And so I had to take her to Asgard,
which is where I'm from...

934
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:34,606
and we had to try and fix her.

935
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:36,403
We were dating at the time, you see...

936
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,937
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

937
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:43,318
who's dead and...

938
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:48,291
Oh, you know, Jane and I
aren't even dating anymore, so...

939
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,539
Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

940
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:52,036
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

941
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:53,957
-Why don't you come sit down?
-I'm not done yet.

942
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:57,166
The only thing that is permanent
in life is impermanence.

943
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:00,221
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

944
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,432
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

945
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:04,723
Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

946
01:04:05,637 --> 01:04:08,517
-Is that a person?
-No, Morag's a planet.

947
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:10,604
Quill was a person.

948
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,691
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

949
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:18,074
Oh, look. It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

950
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:21,403
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

951
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,700
I'll take you to space.

952
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:25,992
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

953
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:28,118
What is Vormir?

954
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:29,455
A dominion of death...

955
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,042
at the very center of celestial existence.

956
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:37,957
It's where Thanos murdered my sister.

957
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:45,434
Not it.

958
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:48,809
-That Time Stone guy.
-Doctor Strange.

959
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:50,772
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

960
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:52,893
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.

961
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,350
Nice place in the Village, though.

962
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,100
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

963
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,271
Bleecker Street.

964
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:58,519
Wait, he lived in New York?

965
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:01,231
-No, he lived in Toronto.
-Yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.

966
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:03,191
-Have you been listening to anything?
-Guys.

967
01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:06,912
If you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.

968
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:11,078
Shut the front door.

969
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,960
All right. We have a plan.

970
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:20,714
Six stones, three teams, one shot.

971
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:32,310
Five years ago, we lost.

972
01:05:33,642 --> 01:05:34,932
All of us.

973
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:38,234
We lost friends.

974
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:40,609
We lost family.

975
01:05:42,568 --> 01:05:44,398
We lost a part of ourselves.

976
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:48,203
Today, we have a chance to take it all back.

977
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:52,446
You know your teams. You know your missions.

978
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:55,207
Get the stones. Get them back.

979
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:57,209
One round-trip each.

980
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,464
No mistakes...

981
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:00,669
no do-overs.

982
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:02,706
Most of us are going somewhere we know.

983
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,710
That doesn't mean we should know
what to expect.

984
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:06,883
Be careful.

985
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:08,801
Look out for each other.

986
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:12,062
This is the fight of our lives...

987
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:14,521
and we're gonna win.

988
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:17,685
Whatever it takes.

989
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:22,399
Good luck.

990
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:23,646
He's pretty good at that.

991
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:24,977
-Right?
-All right.

992
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:27,492
You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

993
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:29,987
Trackers engaged.

994
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:32,622
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

995
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:34,124
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

996
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:36,156
Okay, I'll do my best.

997
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,120
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

998
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,340
See ya in a minute.

999
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:38,055
All right, we all have our assignments.

1000
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:40,445
Two stones uptown, one stone down.

1001
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:42,562
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.

1002
01:07:57,995 --> 01:07:59,795
Maybe smash a few things along the way.

1003
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:02,924
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1004
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,822
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.

1005
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:40,791
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

1006
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:45,252
You're about five years too early.

1007
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:49,753
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery about 20 blocks that way.

1008
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:52,548
What do you want from him?

1009
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:54,467
That, actually.

1010
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:58,676
I'm afraid not.

1011
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:00,467
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1012
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:02,391
You don't want to do this.

1013
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:04,139
You're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1014
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:05,811
and I don't have time to debate it.

1015
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:16,411
Let's start over, shall we?

1016
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,460
For you, Lady Jane.

1017
01:09:29,628 --> 01:09:32,008
Do you have anything with pants?

1018
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:33,212
Pants?

1019
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:35,472
Never mind. These will be fine.
Thank you.

1020
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:37,264
-Yes, milady.
-There's Jane.

1021
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:39,887
All right.

1022
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,723
Here's the deal, tubby.

1023
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:45,271
You're gonna charm her,
and I'm gonna poke her with this thing...

1024
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:47,895
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1025
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:52,608
I'll be right back, okay?
The wine cellar is just down here.

1026
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:55,646
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1027
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:57,071
I'll see if the scullery has a couple
of to-go cups.

1028
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:59,119
Hey. Hey!
Aren't you drunk enough already?

1029
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:08,418
-If you could send Loki some soup.
-Yes, milady.

1030
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:12,594
And ask our librarians to pull
some volumes from the astronomy shelf.

1031
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,300
Who's the fancy broad?

1032
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:23,138
That's my mother.

1033
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,350
She dies today.

1034
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,808
Oh, that is today?

1035
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,899
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1036
01:10:37,487 --> 01:10:39,027
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1037
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:40,318
It's a bad idea!

1038
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:41,656
-Come here.
-No, no, no.

1039
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:44,235
I think I'm having a panic attack.

1040
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:46,411
-Come here. Right here.
-I shouldn't be here. This is bad.

1041
01:10:47,206 --> 01:10:48,826
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1042
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:50,829
What do you think we're doing here?

1043
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:53,171
I lost the only family I ever had.

1044
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:55,757
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1045
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,343
all gone.

1046
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,380
I get you miss your mom...

1047
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:00,886
but she's gone.

1048
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:02,053
Really gone.

1049
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:05,468
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1050
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:06,771
and you can help them.

1051
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:11,103
So, is it too much to ask that
you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

1052
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:13,571
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

1053
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:16,904
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1054
01:11:17,069 --> 01:11:18,649
and help me get my family back?

1055
01:11:20,322 --> 01:11:21,322
Okay.

1056
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:22,625
Are you crying?

1057
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:24,534
No.

1058
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:27,540
Yes.

1059
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:28,914
I feel like I'm losing it.

1060
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,081
Get it together!

1061
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:31,249
You can do this.

1062
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:33,754
You can do this.

1063
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:37,922
All right?

1064
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,090
Yes, I can.

1065
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:40,258
Good.

1066
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:44,799
I can do this. I can do this.

1067
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:47,099
I can't do this.

1068
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:50,686
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone.
This is our shot.

1069
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:53,443
Thor? Thor!

1070
01:12:03,824 --> 01:12:05,084
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1071
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:07,662
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1072
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:13,998
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1073
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:16,248
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1074
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,170
All that is really helpful.

1075
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:21,882
-Take care, okay?
-Yeah.

1076
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,510
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1077
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:26,723
-Hey.
-We got this.

1078
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,099
-Let's get it done.
-Yes, sir.

1079
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:29,565
I'll see you back.

1080
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:31,597
You guys watch each other's six.

1081
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:33,519
Yeah.

1082
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:43,736
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

1083
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:47,275
All they have to do is not fall out.

1084
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:55,577
We're a long way from Budapest.

1085
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:01,974
Okay, so...

1086
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:06,427
we just wait around
for this Quill guy to show up...

1087
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:08,435
and then he leads us
to the Power Stone, is that it?

1088
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:10,851
Let's take cover.

1089
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:14,936
We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.

1090
01:13:15,103 --> 01:13:16,353
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

1091
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:17,862
Who else is looking for these stones?

1092
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:22,905
My father...

1093
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,860
my sister...

1094
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,160
and me.

1095
01:13:26,323 --> 01:13:27,493
And you?

1096
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:30,948
Where are you right now?

1097
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:00,818
You're welcome.

1098
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:03,283
I didn't ask for your help.

1099
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:05,574
And yet, you always need it.

1100
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,616
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1101
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:12,785
Why?

1102
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:14,953
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1103
01:14:19,418 --> 01:14:20,878
Where?

1104
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:22,804
On a planet called Morag.

1105
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,343
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1106
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:28,508
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1107
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:29,887
It's a start.

1108
01:14:30,053 --> 01:14:31,853
If he gets all of them...

1109
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:48,410
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1110
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:49,782
He won't like that.

1111
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:52,078
His alternative is death.

1112
01:14:53,577 --> 01:14:55,327
Ronan's obsession...

1113
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:58,541
clouds his judgment.

1114
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:04,751
We will not fail you, Father.

1115
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:07,417
No, you won't.

1116
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:11,135
I swear...

1117
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:14,933
I will make you proud.

1118
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:26,995
...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1119
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:29,152
and then he leads us
to the Power Stone, is that it?

1120
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:30,911
Let's take cover.

1121
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:34,777
We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.

1122
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:38,664
Who was that?

1123
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:39,830
I don't know.

1124
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:42,168
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1125
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:46,587
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1126
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:58,889
Bring her to my ship.

1127
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:07,365
Better hustle, Cap.

1128
01:16:07,526 --> 01:16:09,606
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1129
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:11,398
Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.

1130
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,450
If it's all the same to you...

1131
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:23,288
I'll have that drink now.

1132
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:25,294
All right, get him on his feet.

1133
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,460
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1134
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:29,960
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1135
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:33,133
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that
that suit...

1136
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:35,222
did nothing for your ass.

1137
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:36,507
No one asked you to look, Tony.

1138
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,310
-It's ridiculous.
-I think you look great, Cap.

1139
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:41,265
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

1140
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:43,396
Who gets the magic wand?

1141
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:44,602
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it.

1142
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,532
We can take that off your hands.

1143
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:58,701
By all means.

1144
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:02,664
Careful with that thing.

1145
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:04,291
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

1146
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,458
And not in a fun way.

1147
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:06,626
We promise to be careful.

1148
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:07,793
Who are these guys?

1149
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,251
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1150
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,511
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1151
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:14,844
Seriously? You didn't?

1152
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,510
I mean, they look like bad guys.

1153
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:18,098
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1154
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:20,103
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1155
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,225
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1156
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:24,852
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down?

1157
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,440
Shut up.

1158
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:28,312
All right, you're up, little buddy.

1159
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:30,612
There's our stone.

1160
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:31,776
All right.

1161
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:33,114
Flick me.

1162
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:48,209
-Move.
-Hey.

1163
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:50,127
Hey, hey. Buddy!

1164
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:52,085
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1165
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:53,256
Take the stairs.

1166
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:55,303
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1167
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:00,853
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

1168
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,940
All right, Cap, I got our scepter
in the elevator...

1169
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:08,904
just passing the 80th floor.

1170
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:10,690
On it.

1171
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,405
-Head to the lobby.
-All right, I'll see you there.

1172
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:15,357
Evidence secure.

1173
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:16,949
We're en route to Doctor List.

1174
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:20,526
No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

1175
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:26,706
Captain.

1176
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:28,924
I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue.

1177
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:30,634
Change of plans.

1178
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:35,884
Hey, Cap.

1179
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:38,216
Rumlow.

1180
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:46,346
I just got a call from the secretary.

1181
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:48,398
I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.

1182
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:53,148
Sir?
I don't understand.

1183
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:57,451
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1184
01:18:57,613 --> 01:18:59,203
Sorry, Cap.

1185
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:00,784
We can't give you the scepter.

1186
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,236
I'm gonna have to call the director.

1187
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,540
That's okay. Trust me.

1188
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:10,044
Hail Hydra.

1189
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:26,645
So many stairs!

1190
01:19:38,362 --> 01:19:40,992
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1191
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:42,236
It is go time.

1192
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:43,407
Bombs away.

1193
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:53,036
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1194
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:55,420
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1195
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:56,667
Can we focus, please?

1196
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:58,089
I'm going inside you...

1197
01:19:58,799 --> 01:19:59,799
now.

1198
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,141
May I ask you where you're going?

1199
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,557
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1200
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:10,726
Alexander Pierce.

1201
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:13,364
He's the man above the folks
behind Nick Fury.

1202
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:14,652
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1203
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:17,195
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn
that prisoner over to me.

1204
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:19,149
Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

1205
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:21,699
No, he's going to answer to us.
Odin can have what's left.

1206
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:23,324
And I'm gonna need that case.

1207
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,280
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D. property
for over 70 years.

1208
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:26,660
Hand over the case, Stark.

1209
01:20:26,827 --> 01:20:29,197
All right, move it, Stuart Little.
Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go.

1210
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:31,081
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1211
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,830
You promise me you won't die?

1212
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,710
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1213
01:20:35,878 --> 01:20:37,458
That doesn't sound mild.

1214
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:38,629
I need the case.

1215
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:40,167
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying, jurisdiction...

1216
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,510
Okay, then give me the case.

1217
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,715
-Well, jurisdiction...
-Hand it over.

1218
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:44,796
Do it, Lang!

1219
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,760
-Get your hands off me.
-Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1220
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:49,181
Here goes!

1221
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,559
-Stark?
-Stark?

1222
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:55,977
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1223
01:20:56,148 --> 01:20:57,858
-Medic!
-Medic!

1224
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,780
Give these guys some help.

1225
01:21:00,152 --> 01:21:01,152
Speak to me.

1226
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,412
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1227
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:07,488
Breathe, breathe.

1228
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:15,078
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1229
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:22,507
No stairs!

1230
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:32,144
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1231
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:34,269
I'm going to try something. Okay?
I have no idea if it's going to work.

1232
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:37,151
Yes!

1233
01:21:37,314 --> 01:21:38,694
Oh, that worked a treat.

1234
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:39,857
Dude, that was so crazy.

1235
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,395
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1236
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:43,448
-The case.
-The case is...

1237
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:45,612
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1238
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:47,625
Loki!

1239
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:48,953
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

1240
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:50,237
We blew it.

1241
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:51,910
Loki?

1242
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:55,246
Tony, what's going on?

1243
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,920
Tell me you found that Cube.

1244
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:02,206
You gotta be shitting me.

1245
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:08,511
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1246
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,059
I'm not Loki...

1247
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:15,272
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1248
01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:25,204
I can do this all day.

1249
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:26,652
Yeah, I know.

1250
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:27,822
I know.

1251
01:23:00,564 --> 01:23:01,564
Where did you get this?

1252
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:15,908
Bucky is alive.

1253
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:20,498
What?

1254
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:36,982
That is America's ass.

1255
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:42,365
Please, please.

1256
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:44,403
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce.

1257
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:48,572
If I give up the Time Stone
to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1258
01:23:48,737 --> 01:23:50,487
With all due respect, all right...

1259
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,736
I'm not sure
the science really supports that.

1260
01:23:59,373 --> 01:24:03,673
The Infinity Stones create
what you experience as the flow of time.

1261
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:05,376
Remove one of the stones...

1262
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:07,626
and that flow splits.

1263
01:24:07,798 --> 01:24:10,258
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1264
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:12,545
but my new one, not so much.

1265
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,638
In this new branch reality...

1266
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:17,895
without our chief weapon against
the forces of darkness...

1267
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:20,228
our world would be overrun.

1268
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:22,104
Millions will suffer.

1269
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:23,521
So, tell me, Doctor.

1270
01:24:24,106 --> 01:24:26,266
Can your science prevent all that?

1271
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:27,441
No...

1272
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:29,573
but we can erase it.

1273
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:31,446
Because once we're done with the stones...

1274
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:33,783
we can return each one to its own timeline...

1275
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:35,449
at the moment it was taken.

1276
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:38,077
So, chronologically...

1277
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:40,161
in that reality...

1278
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:44,419
it never left.

1279
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:49,875
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1280
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:55,928
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1281
01:24:56,096 --> 01:24:58,676
We will. I will. I promise.

1282
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:01,556
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1283
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:07,858
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme
to protect the Time Stone.

1284
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:10,113
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

1285
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,150
What did you say?

1286
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:15,662
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1287
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:17,873
-Willingly?
-Yes.

1288
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:23,368
-Why?
-I have no idea.

1289
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,290
Maybe he made a mistake.

1290
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:36,717
Or I did.

1291
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:59,410
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1292
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:02,076
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1293
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:04,501
I fear you might be right.

1294
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,670
Thank you.

1295
01:26:16,927 --> 01:26:18,597
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1296
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:21,849
We all are.

1297
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:43,867
Run diagnostics.

1298
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:46,581
Show me her memory file.

1299
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:50,627
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1300
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:53,755
It was a memory, but not hers.

1301
01:26:55,007 --> 01:26:56,417
There's another consciousness...

1302
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:57,882
sharing her network.

1303
01:26:58,427 --> 01:26:59,757
Another Nebula.

1304
01:27:01,889 --> 01:27:03,349
Impossible.

1305
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:06,135
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

1306
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,230
from nine years in the future.

1307
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:16,317
Where is this other Nebula?

1308
01:27:16,987 --> 01:27:18,987
In our solar system on Morag.

1309
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:21,832
Can you access her?

1310
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:24,042
Yes, the two are linked.

1311
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:26,293
Search the duplicate's memories...

1312
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:28,675
for Infinity Stones.

1313
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:35,171
And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

1314
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:36,339
Our history.

1315
01:27:36,507 --> 01:27:38,627
So, not a lot of convenient spots...

1316
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,930
to just drop in.

1317
01:27:40,093 --> 01:27:41,763
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1318
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:43,219
-Correct.
-Freeze image.

1319
01:27:45,182 --> 01:27:46,392
Terrans.

1320
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:49,136
Avengers.

1321
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:51,939
Unruly wretches.

1322
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:53,605
What's that reflection?

1323
01:27:55,234 --> 01:27:56,404
Amplify this, Maw.

1324
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:01,115
I don't understand.

1325
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:07,407
Two Nebulas.

1326
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:09,999
No.
The same Nebula...

1327
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,541
from two different times.

1328
01:28:13,836 --> 01:28:15,456
Set course for Morag.

1329
01:28:15,629 --> 01:28:18,009
And scan the duplicate's memories.

1330
01:28:18,757 --> 01:28:21,127
I wanna see everything.

1331
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:34,396
My ladies, I'll see you after.
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1332
01:28:48,787 --> 01:28:49,787
What are you doing?

1333
01:28:51,415 --> 01:28:52,625
Oh, God!

1334
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:55,251
You're better off
leaving the sneaking to your brother.

1335
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:57,299
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1336
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,802
What are you wearing?

1337
01:28:58,964 --> 01:29:01,344
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1338
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:06,809
What's wrong with your eye?

1339
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:07,972
Oh, my eye.

1340
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:10,100
Remember the Battle of Harokin...

1341
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:13,347
when I got hit in the face
with the broadsword?

1342
01:29:16,899 --> 01:29:18,939
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

1343
01:29:19,693 --> 01:29:21,443
Yes, I am.

1344
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:24,445
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

1345
01:29:24,907 --> 01:29:26,827
I didn't say I was from the future.

1346
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:29,834
I was raised by witches, boy.

1347
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:33,251
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1348
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:37,594
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1349
01:29:37,753 --> 01:29:39,383
Yes, you are, honey.

1350
01:29:39,546 --> 01:29:41,046
I really need to talk to you.

1351
01:29:41,215 --> 01:29:42,225
We can talk.

1352
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:08,325
His head was over there...

1353
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:11,451
and his body over there...

1354
01:30:12,746 --> 01:30:15,246
I mean, what was the point?
I was too late.

1355
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,536
I was just standing there.

1356
01:30:18,502 --> 01:30:20,252
Some idiot with an axe.

1357
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,130
Now, you're no idiot.

1358
01:30:23,257 --> 01:30:24,837
You're here, aren't you?

1359
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:27,510
Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.

1360
01:30:27,845 --> 01:30:28,895
I am. Yes.

1361
01:30:29,054 --> 01:30:30,394
Idiot, no.

1362
01:30:30,556 --> 01:30:32,056
A failure?

1363
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:33,354
Absolutely.

1364
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:35,307
That's a little bit harsh.

1365
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:36,977
Do you know what that makes you?

1366
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:40,188
Just like everyone else.

1367
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:43,227
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1368
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:46,905
Everyone fails
at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

1369
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:50,664
The measure of a person, of a hero...

1370
01:30:50,826 --> 01:30:54,196
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1371
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:00,919
I've really missed you, Mom.

1372
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,550
Thor! I got it!

1373
01:31:09,428 --> 01:31:10,968
Get that rabbit!

1374
01:31:13,974 --> 01:31:15,564
Mom, I have to tell you something.

1375
01:31:15,726 --> 01:31:17,516
No, son, you don't.

1376
01:31:17,686 --> 01:31:20,186
You're here to repair your future, not mine.

1377
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:22,015
This is about your future.

1378
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:23,531
It's none of my business.

1379
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:28,779
Hi.

1380
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:30,947
You must be Mom.

1381
01:31:31,116 --> 01:31:32,576
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1382
01:31:32,743 --> 01:31:34,203
I wish we had more time.

1383
01:31:34,369 --> 01:31:36,199
No, this was a gift.

1384
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:39,791
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1385
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,330
I love you, Mom.

1386
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:42,422
I love you.

1387
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:48,802
And eat a salad.

1388
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:50,931
Come on, we gotta go.

1389
01:31:51,094 --> 01:31:52,684
-Goodbye.
-Three...

1390
01:31:52,846 --> 01:31:53,926
-Two...
-No, wait!

1391
01:31:57,184 --> 01:31:58,394
What am I looking at?

1392
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,020
Sometimes it takes a second.

1393
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:11,535
I'm still worthy.

1394
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:14,580
Oh, boy.

1395
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,664
-Goodbye, Mom.
-Goodbye.

1396
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,540
So, he's an idiot?

1397
01:32:59,872 --> 01:33:01,292
Yeah.

1398
01:33:09,798 --> 01:33:11,008
What's that?

1399
01:33:11,175 --> 01:33:13,055
The tool of a thief.

1400
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:24,441
This is the part where spikes come out...

1401
01:33:24,605 --> 01:33:26,025
with skeletons on the end of them
and everything.

1402
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:27,400
What are you talking about?

1403
01:33:27,566 --> 01:33:29,896
When you break into a place called
"The Temple of the Power Stone"...

1404
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:31,358
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

1405
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:33,778
-Oh, my God.
-Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1406
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:08,574
I wasn't always like this.

1407
01:34:09,483 --> 01:34:10,483
Me either.

1408
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:13,737
But we work with what we got, right?

1409
01:34:17,491 --> 01:34:19,161
Let's sync up.

1410
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:23,496
Three, two, one.

1411
01:34:36,343 --> 01:34:37,973
You murdered trillions!

1412
01:34:38,136 --> 01:34:39,546
You should be grateful.

1413
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:42,771
Where are the stones?

1414
01:34:42,933 --> 01:34:43,933
Gone.

1415
01:34:44,685 --> 01:34:45,695
Reduced to atoms.

1416
01:34:46,395 --> 01:34:48,065
You used them two days ago!

1417
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:51,355
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

1418
01:34:51,525 --> 01:34:53,365
It nearly killed me.

1419
01:34:53,527 --> 01:34:55,447
But the work is done.

1420
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:57,452
It always will be.

1421
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:02,200
I am inevitable.

1422
01:35:03,453 --> 01:35:05,503
What did you do to them?

1423
01:35:05,664 --> 01:35:06,924
Nothing.

1424
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:09,081
Yet.

1425
01:35:10,878 --> 01:35:14,588
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.

1426
01:35:14,923 --> 01:35:18,553
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.

1427
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,389
The stones.

1428
01:35:21,305 --> 01:35:23,225
I found them all.

1429
01:35:25,017 --> 01:35:26,387
I won.

1430
01:35:27,144 --> 01:35:30,114
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

1431
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:35,859
This is your future.

1432
01:35:36,195 --> 01:35:38,245
It's my destiny.

1433
01:35:39,448 --> 01:35:41,488
My father is many things.

1434
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:43,488
A liar is not one of them.

1435
01:35:47,206 --> 01:35:49,116
Thank you, daughter.

1436
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:51,461
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

1437
01:35:55,964 --> 01:35:58,844
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1438
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:00,639
Sire...

1439
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:01,932
your daughter...

1440
01:36:04,389 --> 01:36:05,389
No!

1441
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:06,889
...is a traitor.

1442
01:36:07,059 --> 01:36:09,519
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1443
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:10,846
I would never betray you.

1444
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:12,861
Never. Never.

1445
01:36:18,612 --> 01:36:19,782
I know.

1446
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:23,989
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

1447
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,370
No!

1448
01:36:32,084 --> 01:36:33,294
He knows!

1449
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:39,921
Barton! Barton, come in.

1450
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:41,841
Romanoff!

1451
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:43,889
Come in, we have a problem.

1452
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:45,184
Come on!

1453
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:46,767
Come in, we have a...

1454
01:36:46,932 --> 01:36:48,272
Thanos knows.

1455
01:36:48,934 --> 01:36:50,194
Thanos...

1456
01:37:03,907 --> 01:37:04,987
Cap.

1457
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:08,868
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

1458
01:37:09,705 --> 01:37:11,045
Yeah, we do.

1459
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:12,623
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1460
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:13,791
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.

1461
01:37:13,959 --> 01:37:15,379
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

1462
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:16,964
You said that we had one shot.

1463
01:37:17,129 --> 01:37:18,459
This was our shot.

1464
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:20,630
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1465
01:37:20,799 --> 01:37:22,179
-It was six stones or nothing.
-You're repeating yourself, you know that?

1466
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:23,342
You're repeating yourself.

1467
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:25,220
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1468
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:27,177
-Dude. Come on!
-No. You never wanted a time heist.

1469
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:28,347
You weren't on board with the time heist.

1470
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:29,635
-I dropped the ball.
-You ruined the time heist.

1471
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:31,098
-Is that what I did?
-Yeah.

1472
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:33,058
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1473
01:37:33,228 --> 01:37:34,438
No, no, no,
there's no other options.

1474
01:37:34,605 --> 01:37:35,865
There's no do-overs.

1475
01:37:36,023 --> 01:37:38,113
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1476
01:37:38,275 --> 01:37:39,115
Each.

1477
01:37:39,276 --> 01:37:41,566
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1478
01:37:41,737 --> 01:37:42,897
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1479
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:45,031
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1480
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:46,369
then no one else is going home, either.

1481
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:47,453
I got it.

1482
01:37:48,744 --> 01:37:52,794
There's another way to retake the Tesseract
and acquire new particles.

1483
01:37:53,624 --> 01:37:54,674
Little stroll down memory lane.

1484
01:37:55,459 --> 01:37:57,289
Military installation, Garden State.

1485
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:02,671
When were they both there?

1486
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:05,221
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1487
01:38:05,886 --> 01:38:06,886
-How vague?
-What are you talking about?

1488
01:38:07,054 --> 01:38:07,934
Where are we going?

1489
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:09,006
I know for a fact they were there.

1490
01:38:09,181 --> 01:38:10,891
-Who's they? What are we doing?
-And I know how I know.

1491
01:38:13,268 --> 01:38:14,808
Guys, what is it?

1492
01:38:15,395 --> 01:38:17,015
Looks like we're improvising.

1493
01:38:17,189 --> 01:38:18,309
-Great.
-What are we improvising?

1494
01:38:18,482 --> 01:38:20,232
Scott, get this back to the compound.

1495
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,320
Suit up.

1496
01:38:21,652 --> 01:38:23,112
-What's in New Jersey?
-0-4.

1497
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:24,108
0-4.

1498
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:25,279
-0-7.
-0-7.

1499
01:38:25,447 --> 01:38:27,317
-Excuse me.
-1-9-7-0.

1500
01:38:27,783 --> 01:38:28,703
Are you sure?

1501
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:30,157
Cap?
Captain?

1502
01:38:30,327 --> 01:38:32,157
Steve? Sorry.

1503
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:33,959
America. Rogers.

1504
01:38:34,122 --> 01:38:35,332
Look, if you do this...

1505
01:38:35,624 --> 01:38:38,174
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1506
01:38:39,253 --> 01:38:41,053
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.

1507
01:38:42,089 --> 01:38:43,299
You trust me?

1508
01:38:44,174 --> 01:38:45,344
I do.

1509
01:38:46,385 --> 01:38:47,725
Your call.

1510
01:38:48,595 --> 01:38:50,305
Here we go.

1511
01:39:06,363 --> 01:39:09,993
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1512
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:18,584
Clearly you weren't actually
born here, right?

1513
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,250
The idea of me was.

1514
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:22,960
Right.
Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1515
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:26,380
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1516
01:39:27,718 --> 01:39:29,298
where do you hide it?

1517
01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:31,139
In plain sight.

1518
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:00,671
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

1519
01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:03,384
Good luck on your project, Doctor.

1520
01:40:06,798 --> 01:40:07,878
You new here?

1521
01:40:10,427 --> 01:40:11,757
Not exactly.

1522
01:40:18,435 --> 01:40:20,225
Come on, you bastard.

1523
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:28,527
Gotcha.

1524
01:40:46,088 --> 01:40:47,758
Back in the game.

1525
01:40:50,425 --> 01:40:51,625
Arnim, you in there?

1526
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:53,644
Arnim?

1527
01:40:58,934 --> 01:41:00,274
Hey!

1528
01:41:00,936 --> 01:41:02,646
The door is this way, pal.

1529
01:41:03,647 --> 01:41:04,517
Oh, yeah.

1530
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:06,570
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him?

1531
01:41:06,733 --> 01:41:10,153
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1532
01:41:11,655 --> 01:41:12,995
Pardon me.

1533
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:15,370
Do I know you?

1534
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:17,618
No, sir.

1535
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:20,869
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1536
01:41:21,456 --> 01:41:22,576
MIT.

1537
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:24,171
Got a name?

1538
01:41:24,626 --> 01:41:25,746
Howard.

1539
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:28,419
-That'll be easy to remember.
-Howard...

1540
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:30,423
Potts.

1541
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,218
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1542
01:41:33,385 --> 01:41:34,295
Hi.

1543
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:35,759
Shake that, don't pull it.

1544
01:41:35,929 --> 01:41:36,929
Yeah.

1545
01:41:38,348 --> 01:41:40,558
You look a little green
around the gills, there, Potts.

1546
01:41:40,726 --> 01:41:42,886
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1547
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:44,771
You wanna get some air?

1548
01:41:47,316 --> 01:41:49,106
-Hello, Potts.
-Yeah.

1549
01:41:49,276 --> 01:41:50,526
-That'd be swell.
-That way.

1550
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:51,654
Okay.

1551
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:53,490
Need your briefcase?

1552
01:41:57,826 --> 01:42:00,406
You're not one of those beatniks,
are you, Potts?

1553
01:42:06,251 --> 01:42:08,041
-Hello?
-Doctor Pym?

1554
01:42:08,212 --> 01:42:10,422
That would be the number
that you called, yes.

1555
01:42:10,589 --> 01:42:12,839
This is Captain Stevens from shipping.

1556
01:42:13,008 --> 01:42:14,128
We have a package for you.

1557
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:15,680
Bring it up.

1558
01:42:15,844 --> 01:42:17,804
That's the thing, sir, we can't.

1559
01:42:18,931 --> 01:42:21,561
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1560
01:42:21,725 --> 01:42:23,095
Well, it's just...

1561
01:42:23,268 --> 01:42:24,728
Sir, the box is glowing...

1562
01:42:24,895 --> 01:42:27,695
and to be honest, some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.

1563
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:29,566
They didn't open it, did they?

1564
01:42:29,733 --> 01:42:31,903
Yeah, they did.
You better get down here.

1565
01:42:32,736 --> 01:42:34,646
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1566
01:43:01,849 --> 01:43:05,349
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1567
01:43:06,103 --> 01:43:07,563
My wife's expecting.

1568
01:43:07,729 --> 01:43:10,569
And too much time at the office.

1569
01:43:12,401 --> 01:43:13,781
Congratulations.

1570
01:43:13,944 --> 01:43:16,074
-Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
-Yeah, sure.

1571
01:43:17,155 --> 01:43:19,235
-How far along is she?
-I don't know.

1572
01:43:21,034 --> 01:43:23,794
She's at the point where
she can't stand the sound of my chewing.

1573
01:43:23,954 --> 01:43:27,424
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

1574
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:29,333
I have a little girl.

1575
01:43:29,501 --> 01:43:31,001
A girl would be nice.

1576
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:33,170
Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

1577
01:43:33,839 --> 01:43:35,299
What'd be so awful about that?

1578
01:43:35,465 --> 01:43:40,845
Let's just say that the greater good
has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.

1579
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:45,932
And you've never seen these two men before?

1580
01:43:46,101 --> 01:43:47,941
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1581
01:43:48,103 --> 01:43:50,363
-Can you describe them?
-One of them had a hippie beard.

1582
01:43:50,522 --> 01:43:52,692
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1583
01:43:52,858 --> 01:43:53,898
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1584
01:43:54,067 --> 01:43:56,237
Yeah, this is Chesler.
I need every available MP to sublevel six.

1585
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:58,283
We have a potential breach.

1586
01:44:16,173 --> 01:44:17,133
I said bring them in.

1587
01:44:17,299 --> 01:44:19,469
They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit
has been stopped by lightning strikes.

1588
01:44:19,635 --> 01:44:20,475
Oh, for the love of...

1589
01:44:20,636 --> 01:44:22,136
I'll look at the weather projections.

1590
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:48,161
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.

1591
01:44:59,508 --> 01:45:01,218
So, where you at with names?

1592
01:45:01,385 --> 01:45:04,515
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

1593
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:07,772
Might wanna let that stew awhile.
You got time.

1594
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,060
Let me ask you a question.

1595
01:45:12,062 --> 01:45:15,322
When your kid was born, were you nervous?

1596
01:45:15,482 --> 01:45:16,822
Wildly.

1597
01:45:17,067 --> 01:45:18,777
-Yeah.
-Did you feel qualified?

1598
01:45:18,944 --> 01:45:22,534
Like you had any idea
how to successfully operate that thing?

1599
01:45:22,948 --> 01:45:25,778
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1600
01:45:25,951 --> 01:45:27,951
I thought about what my dad did.

1601
01:45:28,662 --> 01:45:30,832
My old man, he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1602
01:45:31,623 --> 01:45:33,673
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1603
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:36,544
And now, looking back on it,
I just remember the good stuff.

1604
01:45:36,712 --> 01:45:38,302
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

1605
01:45:38,463 --> 01:45:39,843
Yeah? Like what?

1606
01:45:40,966 --> 01:45:43,466
"No amount of money
ever bought a second of time."

1607
01:45:44,803 --> 01:45:45,853
Smart guy.

1608
01:45:46,263 --> 01:45:47,723
He did his best.

1609
01:45:49,099 --> 01:45:53,059
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

1610
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,200
Good to meet you, Potts.

1611
01:46:03,864 --> 01:46:04,704
Yeah.

1612
01:46:05,115 --> 01:46:06,275
Howard...

1613
01:46:06,867 --> 01:46:08,447
everything's gonna be all right.

1614
01:46:11,455 --> 01:46:12,715
Thank you...

1615
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:14,995
for everything...

1616
01:46:15,417 --> 01:46:17,707
you've done for this country.

1617
01:46:20,589 --> 01:46:21,719
Jarvis.

1618
01:46:25,427 --> 01:46:26,967
Have we ever met that guy?

1619
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:30,472
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1620
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:34,731
Seems very familiar.

1621
01:46:35,646 --> 01:46:37,106
Weird beard.

1622
01:46:45,447 --> 01:46:46,447
You're weak.

1623
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,070
I'm you.

1624
01:47:05,717 --> 01:47:07,797
You could stop this.

1625
01:47:08,095 --> 01:47:09,895
You know you want to.

1626
01:47:10,597 --> 01:47:12,767
Did you see what happens in the future?

1627
01:47:14,059 --> 01:47:16,439
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1628
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:19,980
You wanna know how he does that?

1629
01:47:21,358 --> 01:47:25,528
You wanna know what he does to you?

1630
01:47:26,029 --> 01:47:27,029
That's enough.

1631
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:41,290
You disgust me.

1632
01:47:42,588 --> 01:47:47,468
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

1633
01:48:09,156 --> 01:48:10,866
How do I look?

1634
01:48:17,456 --> 01:48:18,456
Wow.

1635
01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:22,588
Under different circumstances...

1636
01:48:22,753 --> 01:48:24,753
this would be totally awesome.

1637
01:48:36,892 --> 01:48:39,732
I bet the raccoon
didn't have to climb a mountain.

1638
01:48:39,895 --> 01:48:41,815
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

1639
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:43,520
Whatever.
He eats garbage.

1640
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:45,030
Welcome.

1641
01:48:48,195 --> 01:48:49,535
Natasha.

1642
01:48:49,696 --> 01:48:50,696
Daughter of Ivan.

1643
01:48:52,032 --> 01:48:53,162
Clint.

1644
01:48:53,325 --> 01:48:55,625
Son of Edith.

1645
01:49:00,999 --> 01:49:02,459
Who are you?

1646
01:49:03,085 --> 01:49:05,555
Consider me a guide...

1647
01:49:05,712 --> 01:49:07,382
to you...

1648
01:49:07,548 --> 01:49:09,378
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

1649
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:10,590
Oh, good.

1650
01:49:10,759 --> 01:49:12,889
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1651
01:49:16,807 --> 01:49:19,057
If only it were that easy.

1652
01:49:31,154 --> 01:49:34,874
What you seek lies in front of you.

1653
01:49:36,118 --> 01:49:38,538
As does what you fear.

1654
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:45,338
The stone's down there.

1655
01:49:45,961 --> 01:49:47,881
For one of you.

1656
01:49:48,172 --> 01:49:49,882
For the other...

1657
01:49:52,551 --> 01:49:54,471
In order to take the stone...

1658
01:49:54,636 --> 01:49:57,636
you must lose that which you love.

1659
01:49:59,016 --> 01:50:02,186
An everlasting exchange.

1660
01:50:03,187 --> 01:50:07,267
A soul for a soul.

1661
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:11,240
How's it going?

1662
01:50:14,656 --> 01:50:16,066
Jesus.

1663
01:50:16,408 --> 01:50:18,118
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1664
01:50:18,994 --> 01:50:20,334
No.

1665
01:50:21,163 --> 01:50:22,163
I don't think so.

1666
01:50:22,873 --> 01:50:25,043
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

1667
01:50:26,668 --> 01:50:27,588
I didn't.

1668
01:50:29,087 --> 01:50:31,457
Thanos left here with the stone...

1669
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:33,682
without his daughter.

1670
01:50:33,842 --> 01:50:35,932
That's not a coincidence.

1671
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:38,642
Yeah.

1672
01:50:40,349 --> 01:50:42,229
Whatever it takes.

1673
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:48,230
Whatever it takes.

1674
01:50:52,611 --> 01:50:54,571
If we don't get that stone...

1675
01:50:54,738 --> 01:50:56,408
billions of people stay dead.

1676
01:50:57,282 --> 01:50:58,452
Yeah.

1677
01:51:00,327 --> 01:51:02,447
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1678
01:51:03,205 --> 01:51:04,375
I guess we do.

1679
01:51:12,798 --> 01:51:17,508
I'm starting to think
we mean different people here, Natasha.

1680
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:19,851
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

1681
01:51:20,013 --> 01:51:21,263
Get to right here.

1682
01:51:21,431 --> 01:51:23,431
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1683
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,810
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1684
01:51:25,978 --> 01:51:27,978
What, you think I wanna do it?

1685
01:51:28,564 --> 01:51:30,324
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1686
01:51:30,482 --> 01:51:32,822
Yeah, well, I don't want you to.
How's that?

1687
01:51:33,735 --> 01:51:35,945
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1688
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:39,414
You know what I've become.

1689
01:51:41,535 --> 01:51:44,125
I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1690
01:51:48,292 --> 01:51:49,542
Maybe you should.

1691
01:51:50,419 --> 01:51:51,959
You didn't.

1692
01:51:58,135 --> 01:52:00,355
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

1693
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:12,650
Okay.

1694
01:52:14,401 --> 01:52:15,901
You win.

1695
01:52:22,367 --> 01:52:23,537
Tell my family I love 'em.

1696
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:28,457
You tell 'em yourself.

1697
01:53:01,323 --> 01:53:02,323
Damn you.

1698
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:10,831
Wait.

1699
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:20,722
Let me go.

1700
01:53:21,969 --> 01:53:22,969
No.

1701
01:53:24,721 --> 01:53:25,721
No. Please, no.

1702
01:53:29,101 --> 01:53:30,941
It's okay.

1703
01:53:33,146 --> 01:53:33,976
Please.

1704
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:37,066
No!

1705
01:55:18,544 --> 01:55:19,544
Did we get 'em all?

1706
01:55:20,963 --> 01:55:22,763
Are you telling me this actually worked?

1707
01:55:27,594 --> 01:55:28,804
Clint, where's Nat?

1708
01:55:58,041 --> 01:55:59,041
Do we know if she had family?

1709
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:01,380
Yeah.

1710
01:56:01,545 --> 01:56:02,555
Us.

1711
01:56:03,964 --> 01:56:05,014
What?

1712
01:56:06,967 --> 01:56:08,127
-What are you doing?
-Just asked him a question.

1713
01:56:08,302 --> 01:56:09,552
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1714
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:12,180
Why are we acting like she's dead?
We have the stones, right?

1715
01:56:12,347 --> 01:56:13,347
As long as we have the stones...

1716
01:56:13,515 --> 01:56:15,265
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1717
01:56:15,434 --> 01:56:17,444
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.

1718
01:56:17,603 --> 01:56:18,813
Can't get her back.

1719
01:56:21,815 --> 01:56:23,065
What's he...?
What?

1720
01:56:23,233 --> 01:56:24,443
It can't be undone.

1721
01:56:25,027 --> 01:56:26,737
It can't.

1722
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:32,369
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,
but you're a very earthly being, okay?

1723
01:56:32,534 --> 01:56:33,834
And we're talking about space magic.

1724
01:56:33,994 --> 01:56:36,004
And "can't" seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

1725
01:56:36,163 --> 01:56:39,003
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside
my pay grade here.

1726
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:40,626
But she still isn't here, is she?

1727
01:56:40,792 --> 01:56:41,792
No, that's my point.

1728
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:44,920
It can't be undone.

1729
01:56:45,088 --> 01:56:48,428
Or that's at least
what the red, floating guy had to say.

1730
01:56:48,592 --> 01:56:50,052
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

1731
01:56:50,219 --> 01:56:53,259
Go grab your hammer
and you go fly and you talk to him.

1732
01:57:01,813 --> 01:57:03,863
It was supposed to be me.

1733
01:57:06,109 --> 01:57:08,399
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1734
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:10,030
She bet her life on it.

1735
01:57:14,952 --> 01:57:17,292
She's not coming back.

1736
01:57:19,081 --> 01:57:20,621
We have to make it worth it.

1737
01:57:21,124 --> 01:57:22,584
We have to.

1738
01:57:24,002 --> 01:57:25,672
We will.

1739
01:57:50,362 --> 01:57:51,492
Boom!

1740
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:58,620
All right, the glove's ready.

1741
01:57:59,413 --> 01:58:02,003
Question is,
who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

1742
01:58:02,165 --> 01:58:04,245
-I'll do it.
-Excuse me?

1743
01:58:04,418 --> 01:58:05,378
It's okay.

1744
01:58:05,544 --> 01:58:06,464
Stop, stop. Slow down.

1745
01:58:06,628 --> 01:58:08,128
Thor. Just wait.

1746
01:58:08,297 --> 01:58:10,127
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1747
01:58:10,507 --> 01:58:13,427
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

1748
01:58:13,594 --> 01:58:14,724
We should at least discuss it.

1749
01:58:14,887 --> 01:58:18,717
Look, sitting here staring at the thing
is not gonna bring everybody back.

1750
01:58:19,766 --> 01:58:22,686
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?
So, this responsibility falls upon me.

1751
01:58:22,853 --> 01:58:24,063
-Normally, you're right.
-It's my duty.

1752
01:58:24,229 --> 01:58:26,019
-It's not about that.
-It's not that.

1753
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:27,980
-Hey, buddy...
-Stop it! Just let me.

1754
01:58:30,986 --> 01:58:32,486
Just let me do it.

1755
01:58:32,654 --> 01:58:35,164
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1756
01:58:35,324 --> 01:58:36,324
Look, it's not just the fact...

1757
01:58:36,491 --> 01:58:38,621
that that glove is channeling enough energy
to light up a continent.

1758
01:58:38,785 --> 01:58:40,785
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1759
01:58:40,954 --> 01:58:44,004
What do you think
is coursing through my veins right now?

1760
01:58:44,166 --> 01:58:45,206
Cheez Whiz?

1761
01:58:47,753 --> 01:58:48,753
Lightning.

1762
01:58:48,921 --> 01:58:50,051
-Yeah.
-Lightning.

1763
01:58:50,214 --> 01:58:51,594
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1764
01:58:51,757 --> 01:58:53,587
It's gotta be me.

1765
01:58:54,927 --> 01:58:57,097
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

1766
01:58:57,262 --> 01:58:58,812
They almost killed him.

1767
01:59:00,224 --> 01:59:02,104
None of you could survive.

1768
01:59:02,809 --> 01:59:04,439
How do we know you will?

1769
01:59:04,603 --> 01:59:05,653
We don't.

1770
01:59:05,938 --> 01:59:08,478
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1771
01:59:11,985 --> 01:59:13,565
It's like...

1772
01:59:15,447 --> 01:59:17,367
I was made for this.

1773
01:59:36,301 --> 01:59:37,801
Good to go, yeah?

1774
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:40,930
Let's do it.

1775
01:59:41,098 --> 01:59:44,138
Okay, remember, everyone
Thanos snapped away five years ago...

1776
01:59:44,309 --> 01:59:46,769
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1777
01:59:46,937 --> 01:59:48,357
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1778
01:59:49,773 --> 01:59:50,943
Got it.

1779
02:00:07,332 --> 02:00:10,132
Friday, do me a favor
and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

1780
02:00:10,294 --> 02:00:11,594
Yes, boss.

1781
02:00:20,179 --> 02:00:22,009
Everybody comes home.

1782
02:00:45,412 --> 02:00:46,832
Take it off! Take it off!

1783
02:00:46,997 --> 02:00:48,117
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

1784
02:00:49,291 --> 02:00:50,501
Talk to me, Banner.

1785
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:54,670
I'm okay.

1786
02:00:55,172 --> 02:00:56,462
I'm okay.

1787
02:01:27,913 --> 02:01:29,043
Bruce!

1788
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:32,381
Don't move him.

1789
02:01:39,258 --> 02:01:41,258
-Did it work?
-We're not sure. It's okay.

1790
02:02:27,764 --> 02:02:28,644
Honey.

1791
02:02:28,807 --> 02:02:29,767
Clint?

1792
02:02:29,933 --> 02:02:31,183
Honey.

1793
02:02:32,019 --> 02:02:33,349
Guys...

1794
02:02:35,814 --> 02:02:37,194
I think it worked.

1795
02:03:19,816 --> 02:03:21,686
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

1796
02:03:22,945 --> 02:03:24,745
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1797
02:03:31,370 --> 02:03:33,160
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

1798
02:03:34,331 --> 02:03:35,871
Let me up! Let me up!

1799
02:03:36,625 --> 02:03:37,385
Come on!

1800
02:03:47,511 --> 02:03:48,351
Rhodey!

1801
02:03:56,895 --> 02:03:59,935
Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy?
We're on the lower level. It's flooding!

1802
02:04:00,107 --> 02:04:01,817
What? What?

1803
02:04:01,984 --> 02:04:04,154
We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1804
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:06,489
Wait! I'm here!

1805
02:04:06,655 --> 02:04:08,165
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1806
02:04:27,801 --> 02:04:29,011
Cap?

1807
02:04:52,993 --> 02:04:54,123
Okay.

1808
02:05:13,388 --> 02:05:14,508
Daughter.

1809
02:05:14,681 --> 02:05:15,851
Yes, Father.

1810
02:05:17,726 --> 02:05:19,436
So, this is the future.

1811
02:05:20,103 --> 02:05:20,943
Well done.

1812
02:05:21,855 --> 02:05:23,355
Thank you, Father.

1813
02:05:23,524 --> 02:05:24,904
They suspected nothing.

1814
02:05:27,236 --> 02:05:28,696
The arrogant never do.

1815
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:32,777
Go.

1816
02:05:33,742 --> 02:05:36,162
Find the stones, bring them to me.

1817
02:05:36,328 --> 02:05:38,038
What will you do?

1818
02:05:39,373 --> 02:05:41,043
Wait.

1819
02:06:06,275 --> 02:06:07,945
Tell me something.

1820
02:06:09,069 --> 02:06:11,489
In the future...

1821
02:06:11,655 --> 02:06:13,535
what happens to you and me?

1822
02:06:15,826 --> 02:06:17,446
I try to kill you.

1823
02:06:19,162 --> 02:06:20,662
Several times.

1824
02:06:21,748 --> 02:06:23,708
But eventually...

1825
02:06:23,876 --> 02:06:25,836
we become friends.

1826
02:06:27,337 --> 02:06:29,047
We become sisters.

1827
02:06:36,722 --> 02:06:37,932
Come on.

1828
02:06:39,975 --> 02:06:41,775
We can stop him.

1829
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:51,190
Come on, buddy, wake up!

1830
02:06:51,737 --> 02:06:53,197
That's my man.

1831
02:06:54,114 --> 02:06:56,164
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1832
02:06:59,703 --> 02:07:00,873
What happened?

1833
02:07:01,038 --> 02:07:03,158
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1834
02:07:03,332 --> 02:07:04,212
You'll see.

1835
02:07:26,313 --> 02:07:27,693
What's he been doing?

1836
02:07:29,608 --> 02:07:31,028
Absolutely nothing.

1837
02:07:32,778 --> 02:07:34,648
Where are the stones?

1838
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:36,870
Somewhere under all this.

1839
02:07:38,242 --> 02:07:40,452
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

1840
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:42,369
So, we keep it that way.

1841
02:07:42,538 --> 02:07:43,908
You know it's a trap, right?

1842
02:07:44,081 --> 02:07:45,421
Yeah.

1843
02:07:45,582 --> 02:07:46,922
I don't much care.

1844
02:07:47,668 --> 02:07:48,668
Good.

1845
02:07:49,628 --> 02:07:52,128
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

1846
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:03,890
Let's kill him properly this time.

1847
02:08:13,277 --> 02:08:16,197
You could not live with your own failure.

1848
02:08:17,698 --> 02:08:19,528
Where did that bring you?

1849
02:08:22,494 --> 02:08:24,374
Back to me.

1850
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:30,631
I thought by eliminating half of life...

1851
02:08:31,378 --> 02:08:33,758
the other half would thrive.

1852
02:08:33,922 --> 02:08:35,262
But you've shown me...

1853
02:08:36,425 --> 02:08:38,185
that's impossible.

1854
02:08:40,095 --> 02:08:43,385
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

1855
02:08:43,557 --> 02:08:48,767
there will always be those
that are unable to accept what can be.

1856
02:08:49,521 --> 02:08:50,771
They will resist.

1857
02:08:51,273 --> 02:08:53,193
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

1858
02:08:54,109 --> 02:08:55,689
I'm thankful.

1859
02:08:57,863 --> 02:08:59,613
Because now...

1860
02:08:59,781 --> 02:09:01,911
I know what I must do.

1861
02:09:02,367 --> 02:09:05,327
I will shred this universe...

1862
02:09:05,495 --> 02:09:07,535
down to its last atom.

1863
02:09:08,332 --> 02:09:10,002
And then...

1864
02:09:10,167 --> 02:09:12,497
with the stones you've collected for me...

1865
02:09:13,295 --> 02:09:15,425
create a new one...

1866
02:09:15,589 --> 02:09:17,799
teeming with life...

1867
02:09:17,966 --> 02:09:19,836
that knows not what it has lost...

1868
02:09:20,010 --> 02:09:22,390
but only what it has been given.

1869
02:09:25,474 --> 02:09:26,894
A grateful universe.

1870
02:09:27,434 --> 02:09:28,854
Born out of blood.

1871
02:09:29,019 --> 02:09:30,689
They'll never know it.

1872
02:09:31,897 --> 02:09:34,817
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

1873
02:09:49,414 --> 02:09:50,714
See you on the other side, man.

1874
02:09:53,043 --> 02:09:55,053
Hang on! I'm coming!

1875
02:10:25,325 --> 02:10:26,325
Yeah!

1876
02:10:41,216 --> 02:10:42,756
Oh, hey.

1877
02:10:42,926 --> 02:10:44,636
I know you.

1878
02:10:47,556 --> 02:10:48,556
Father...

1879
02:10:49,308 --> 02:10:50,728
I have the stones.

1880
02:10:50,893 --> 02:10:51,813
What?

1881
02:10:53,187 --> 02:10:54,097
Stop.

1882
02:10:59,318 --> 02:11:00,738
You're betraying us?

1883
02:11:06,742 --> 02:11:08,032
You don't have to do this.

1884
02:11:10,871 --> 02:11:13,371
I am this.

1885
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:15,460
No, you're not.

1886
02:11:15,918 --> 02:11:17,788
You've seen what we become.

1887
02:11:23,884 --> 02:11:26,094
Nebula, listen to her.

1888
02:11:27,554 --> 02:11:28,434
You can change.

1889
02:11:35,103 --> 02:11:36,603
He won't let me.

1890
02:11:38,232 --> 02:11:38,982
No!

1891
02:11:58,627 --> 02:11:59,997
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1892
02:12:16,645 --> 02:12:17,945
Boss, wake up!

1893
02:13:09,239 --> 02:13:10,529
I knew it!

1894
02:14:32,906 --> 02:14:35,736
In all my years of conquest...

1895
02:14:37,035 --> 02:14:38,785
violence...

1896
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:41,790
slaughter...

1897
02:14:42,916 --> 02:14:45,336
it was never personal.

1898
02:14:47,921 --> 02:14:50,011
But I'll tell you now...

1899
02:14:52,009 --> 02:14:58,259
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn, annoying little planet...

1900
02:15:00,017 --> 02:15:02,227
I'm gonna enjoy it...

1901
02:15:03,145 --> 02:15:05,735
very, very much.

1902
02:16:09,002 --> 02:16:10,552
Hey, Cap, you read me?

1903
02:16:16,552 --> 02:16:18,852
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

1904
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:24,270
On your left.

1905
02:17:49,937 --> 02:17:51,227
Is that everyone?

1906
02:17:51,396 --> 02:17:53,606
What? You wanted more?

1907
02:18:20,133 --> 02:18:22,093
Avengers...

1908
02:18:27,224 --> 02:18:28,314
assemble.

1909
02:19:03,510 --> 02:19:04,760
Die!

1910
02:19:25,407 --> 02:19:28,157
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

1911
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,670
Hey!

1912
02:19:43,675 --> 02:19:44,675
Holy cow!

1913
02:19:44,843 --> 02:19:46,223
You will not believe what's been going on.

1914
02:19:46,303 --> 02:19:47,513
Do you remember when we were in space?

1915
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:49,059
And I got all dusty?

1916
02:19:49,223 --> 02:19:51,893
And I must've passed out,
because I woke up and you were gone.

1917
02:19:52,059 --> 02:19:53,689
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
And he was like...

1918
02:19:53,852 --> 02:19:55,352
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

1919
02:19:55,521 --> 02:19:57,191
And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time.

1920
02:19:57,356 --> 02:19:58,186
He did? Oh, no.

1921
02:19:58,357 --> 02:19:59,647
What are you doing?

1922
02:20:04,696 --> 02:20:06,196
This is nice.

1923
02:20:27,970 --> 02:20:28,970
Gamora?

1924
02:20:38,397 --> 02:20:40,067
I thought I lost you.

1925
02:20:44,653 --> 02:20:47,573
Don't touch me!

1926
02:20:50,576 --> 02:20:52,406
You missed the first time.

1927
02:20:52,578 --> 02:20:54,578
Then you got 'em both the second time.

1928
02:20:56,582 --> 02:20:57,672
This is the one?

1929
02:20:57,833 --> 02:20:58,833
Seriously?

1930
02:20:59,001 --> 02:21:01,001
Your choices were him or a tree.

1931
02:21:11,805 --> 02:21:12,805
Cap!

1932
02:21:12,973 --> 02:21:14,723
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

1933
02:21:17,436 --> 02:21:19,476
Get those stones as far away as possible!

1934
02:21:19,646 --> 02:21:20,686
No!

1935
02:21:21,857 --> 02:21:23,817
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

1936
02:21:23,984 --> 02:21:26,574
No way to get 'em back.
Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1937
02:21:26,737 --> 02:21:27,567
Hold on!

1938
02:21:29,448 --> 02:21:31,568
That wasn't our only time machine.

1939
02:21:37,581 --> 02:21:39,501
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

1940
02:21:40,042 --> 02:21:43,132
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

1941
02:21:43,295 --> 02:21:45,425
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

1942
02:21:46,798 --> 02:21:47,798
Maybe 10 minutes.

1943
02:21:47,966 --> 02:21:49,466
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

1944
02:21:49,635 --> 02:21:51,185
We're on it, Cap.

1945
02:22:00,938 --> 02:22:02,058
Hey.

1946
02:22:02,231 --> 02:22:05,231
You said one out of 14 million,
we win, yeah?

1947
02:22:06,151 --> 02:22:07,151
Tell me this is it.

1948
02:22:07,569 --> 02:22:09,449
If I tell you what happens...

1949
02:22:09,613 --> 02:22:10,783
it won't happen.

1950
02:22:14,368 --> 02:22:15,368
You better be right.

1951
02:22:23,794 --> 02:22:25,174
It's a mess back here.

1952
02:22:26,171 --> 02:22:27,171
It's dead.

1953
02:22:28,465 --> 02:22:29,965
-What?
-It's dead.

1954
02:22:30,133 --> 02:22:31,553
I have to hot-wire it.

1955
02:22:34,638 --> 02:22:35,848
Where's Nebula?

1956
02:22:36,974 --> 02:22:38,314
She's not responding.

1957
02:22:38,684 --> 02:22:40,024
Sire...

1958
02:22:49,778 --> 02:22:51,028
Clint!

1959
02:22:53,073 --> 02:22:54,203
Give it to me.

1960
02:23:16,471 --> 02:23:19,851
You took everything from me.

1961
02:23:20,225 --> 02:23:22,555
I don't even know who you are.

1962
02:23:22,728 --> 02:23:24,348
You will.

1963
02:23:46,793 --> 02:23:47,753
I got it!

1964
02:23:50,297 --> 02:23:51,377
Activate Instant Kill.

1965
02:24:14,821 --> 02:24:16,161
Rain fire!

1966
02:24:16,865 --> 02:24:18,775
But, sire, our troops!

1967
02:24:18,951 --> 02:24:20,701
Just do it!

1968
02:24:40,848 --> 02:24:43,218
Is anyone else seeing this?

1969
02:24:57,155 --> 02:24:58,275
I got this!

1970
02:24:58,532 --> 02:25:00,332
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

1971
02:25:00,659 --> 02:25:01,829
Help, somebody help!

1972
02:25:01,994 --> 02:25:03,874
Hey, Queens, heads up!

1973
02:25:13,922 --> 02:25:14,962
Hang on. I got you, kid.

1974
02:25:18,594 --> 02:25:19,764
Hey! Nice to meet you...

1975
02:25:19,928 --> 02:25:21,758
Oh, my God!

1976
02:25:58,008 --> 02:25:59,468
What the hell is this?

1977
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:01,340
Friday, what are they firing at?

1978
02:26:01,512 --> 02:26:03,392
Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

1979
02:26:16,652 --> 02:26:18,822
Oh, yeah!

1980
02:26:38,715 --> 02:26:41,125
Danvers, we need an assist here.

1981
02:26:49,893 --> 02:26:52,483
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

1982
02:26:53,105 --> 02:26:54,525
Hey, Peter Parker.

1983
02:26:54,690 --> 02:26:55,860
You got something for me?

1984
02:27:01,989 --> 02:27:04,069
I don't know how you're gonna get it
through all of that.

1985
02:27:05,742 --> 02:27:07,162
Don't worry.

1986
02:27:08,036 --> 02:27:09,616
She's got help.

1987
02:29:57,456 --> 02:30:00,956
I am inevitable.

1988
02:30:21,063 --> 02:30:22,613
And I...

1989
02:30:24,274 --> 02:30:25,444
am...

1990
02:30:29,154 --> 02:30:30,664
Iron Man.

1991
02:32:29,358 --> 02:32:31,068
Mr. Stark?

1992
02:32:31,485 --> 02:32:32,745
Hey!

1993
02:32:33,737 --> 02:32:36,697
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

1994
02:32:36,865 --> 02:32:38,405
It's Peter.

1995
02:32:39,701 --> 02:32:41,331
Hey.

1996
02:32:42,371 --> 02:32:45,421
We won, Mr. Stark.

1997
02:32:47,251 --> 02:32:49,421
We won, Mr. Stark.

1998
02:32:51,046 --> 02:32:53,876
We won!
You did it, sir, you did it.

1999
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:56,090
I'm sorry.

2000
02:32:56,260 --> 02:32:57,260
Tony.

2001
02:33:10,941 --> 02:33:11,981
Hey.

2002
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:13,990
Hey, Pep.

2003
02:33:18,282 --> 02:33:19,372
Friday?

2004
02:33:19,533 --> 02:33:22,293
Life functions critical.

2005
02:33:30,878 --> 02:33:31,878
Tony?

2006
02:33:33,130 --> 02:33:34,210
Look at me.

2007
02:33:36,884 --> 02:33:38,804
We're gonna be okay.

2008
02:33:43,515 --> 02:33:45,385
You can rest now.

2009
02:35:30,914 --> 02:35:33,714
Everybody wants a happy ending, right?

2010
02:35:33,876 --> 02:35:36,086
But it doesn't always roll that way.

2011
02:35:38,172 --> 02:35:39,842
Maybe this time.

2012
02:35:41,425 --> 02:35:44,095
I'm hoping if you play this back...

2013
02:35:45,762 --> 02:35:47,102
it's in celebration.

2014
02:35:48,348 --> 02:35:52,018
I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.

2015
02:35:52,186 --> 02:35:56,106
And something like a normal version
of the planet has been restored.

2016
02:35:56,273 --> 02:35:58,233
If there ever was such a thing.

2017
02:35:58,817 --> 02:36:01,817
God, what a world.
Universe, now.

2018
02:36:02,779 --> 02:36:04,779
If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...

2019
02:36:04,948 --> 02:36:08,618
let alone to this extent, I mean,
I wouldn't have been surprised...

2020
02:36:08,785 --> 02:36:10,405
but come on, who knew?

2021
02:36:10,579 --> 02:36:15,209
The epic forces of darkness and light
that have come into play.

2022
02:36:15,375 --> 02:36:17,085
And for better or worse...

2023
02:36:17,252 --> 02:36:21,422
that's the reality Morgan's gonna
have to find a way to grow up in.

2024
02:36:24,676 --> 02:36:26,466
So, I thought I'd probably
better record a little greeting...

2025
02:36:26,637 --> 02:36:30,267
in the case of an untimely death.
On my part.

2026
02:36:30,432 --> 02:36:33,692
Not that death at any time isn't untimely.

2027
02:36:34,895 --> 02:36:37,945
This time travel thing
that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow...

2028
02:36:38,106 --> 02:36:40,316
it's got me scratching my head
about the survivability of it all.

2029
02:36:40,484 --> 02:36:41,944
That's the thing.

2030
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:45,824
Then again, that's the hero gig, right?

2031
02:36:45,989 --> 02:36:47,069
Part of the journey is the end.

2032
02:36:49,076 --> 02:36:50,076
What am I even tripping for?

2033
02:36:50,244 --> 02:36:54,334
Everything is gonna work out
exactly the way it's supposed to.

2034
02:36:57,835 --> 02:36:59,505
I love you 3.000.

2035
02:39:14,429 --> 02:39:18,179
You know, I wish there was a way
that I could let her know.

2036
02:39:20,686 --> 02:39:22,806
That we won.

2037
02:39:24,189 --> 02:39:25,899
We did it.

2038
02:39:29,486 --> 02:39:31,276
She knows.

2039
02:39:36,159 --> 02:39:38,239
They both do.

2040
02:39:47,212 --> 02:39:48,302
How you doing, squirt?

2041
02:39:48,463 --> 02:39:49,463
Good.

2042
02:39:49,631 --> 02:39:50,971
-You good?
-Mm-hmm.

2043
02:39:51,133 --> 02:39:53,843
-Good. You hungry?
-Mm-hmm.

2044
02:39:54,261 --> 02:39:55,261
What do you want?

2045
02:39:55,971 --> 02:39:57,391
Cheeseburgers.

2046
02:40:02,186 --> 02:40:04,436
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2047
02:40:04,605 --> 02:40:06,025
Okay.

2048
02:40:08,609 --> 02:40:10,859
I'm gonna get you
all the cheeseburgers you want.

2049
02:40:11,028 --> 02:40:12,028
Okay.

2050
02:40:28,795 --> 02:40:30,205
So...

2051
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:32,634
when can we expect you back?

2052
02:40:34,718 --> 02:40:36,048
About that...

2053
02:40:36,303 --> 02:40:38,473
Thor, your people need a king.

2054
02:40:38,639 --> 02:40:40,519
No, they already have one.

2055
02:40:42,643 --> 02:40:43,643
That's funny.

2056
02:40:49,233 --> 02:40:51,073
Are you being serious?

2057
02:40:54,738 --> 02:40:56,988
It's time for me to be who I am...

2058
02:40:57,574 --> 02:41:00,164
rather than who I'm supposed to be.

2059
02:41:01,453 --> 02:41:03,203
But you, you're a leader.

2060
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:05,540
That's who you are.

2061
02:41:08,043 --> 02:41:10,003
You know, I'd make a lot of changes
around here.

2062
02:41:10,170 --> 02:41:11,670
I'm counting on it...

2063
02:41:11,839 --> 02:41:13,339
Your Majesty.

2064
02:41:23,475 --> 02:41:24,675
What will you do?

2065
02:41:25,435 --> 02:41:26,845
I'm not sure.

2066
02:41:27,020 --> 02:41:30,570
For the first time in a thousand years,
I have no path.

2067
02:41:30,732 --> 02:41:32,152
I do have a ride though.

2068
02:41:32,317 --> 02:41:34,277
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2069
02:41:38,782 --> 02:41:40,332
Here we are!

2070
02:41:40,784 --> 02:41:42,334
Tree, good to see you.

2071
02:41:46,915 --> 02:41:50,205
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2072
02:41:50,627 --> 02:41:52,497
Where to first?

2073
02:41:53,630 --> 02:41:54,670
Hey.

2074
02:41:55,299 --> 02:41:57,259
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2075
02:41:57,426 --> 02:41:58,426
I'm in charge.

2076
02:41:58,969 --> 02:42:01,509
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2077
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:03,220
Of course.

2078
02:42:05,851 --> 02:42:08,401
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2079
02:42:08,562 --> 02:42:11,062
It makes you think that maybe
you didn't realize I was in charge.

2080
02:42:11,690 --> 02:42:13,020
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2081
02:42:13,192 --> 02:42:14,192
Quail?

2082
02:42:14,359 --> 02:42:16,609
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service
and assisting.

2083
02:42:16,778 --> 02:42:17,988
Quill.

2084
02:42:18,155 --> 02:42:19,035
That's what I said.

2085
02:42:19,198 --> 02:42:21,568
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2086
02:42:21,742 --> 02:42:23,122
Sounds fair.

2087
02:42:25,871 --> 02:42:28,251
-It's not necessary, okay?
-It's not.

2088
02:42:28,415 --> 02:42:30,785
I got some blasters,
unless you guys wanna use knives.

2089
02:42:30,959 --> 02:42:33,169
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2090
02:42:33,337 --> 02:42:34,417
Yeah. Knives.

2091
02:42:34,588 --> 02:42:36,128
I am Groot.

2092
02:42:41,887 --> 02:42:43,257
Not necessary.

2093
02:42:43,430 --> 02:42:44,890
There shall be no knifing one another.

2094
02:42:45,057 --> 02:42:48,057
Everybody knows who's in charge.

2095
02:42:51,647 --> 02:42:52,857
Me.

2096
02:42:53,941 --> 02:42:54,771
Right?

2097
02:42:55,692 --> 02:42:57,902
Yes, you.

2098
02:42:58,153 --> 02:43:00,573
Of course! Of course.

2099
02:43:00,739 --> 02:43:02,409
Of course.

2100
02:43:04,159 --> 02:43:05,699
Remember...

2101
02:43:06,537 --> 02:43:08,827
you have to return the stones
to the exact moment you got 'em...

2102
02:43:08,997 --> 02:43:12,207
or you're gonna open up
a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2103
02:43:12,376 --> 02:43:13,376
Don't worry, Bruce.

2104
02:43:13,919 --> 02:43:15,799
Clip all the branches.

2105
02:43:16,338 --> 02:43:18,088
You know, I tried.

2106
02:43:19,383 --> 02:43:23,603
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,
I really tried to bring her back.

2107
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:28,520
I miss her, man.

2108
02:43:28,892 --> 02:43:29,892
Me too.

2109
02:43:33,981 --> 02:43:36,401
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2110
02:43:38,986 --> 02:43:40,446
You're a good man, Sam.

2111
02:43:40,988 --> 02:43:42,528
This one's on me, though.

2112
02:43:46,994 --> 02:43:48,914
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

2113
02:43:50,747 --> 02:43:51,997
How can I?

2114
02:43:52,165 --> 02:43:53,955
You're taking all the stupid with you.

2115
02:44:01,550 --> 02:44:03,340
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2116
02:44:03,719 --> 02:44:05,219
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2117
02:44:12,603 --> 02:44:14,403
How long is this gonna take?

2118
02:44:14,646 --> 02:44:17,396
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2119
02:44:22,487 --> 02:44:23,737
You ready, Cap?

2120
02:44:23,906 --> 02:44:26,316
All right, we'll meet you back here, okay?

2121
02:44:26,992 --> 02:44:28,122
You bet.

2122
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:31,200
Going quantum.
Three...

2123
02:44:31,788 --> 02:44:32,618
two...

2124
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:34,500
one.

2125
02:44:36,376 --> 02:44:38,416
And returning in five...

2126
02:44:38,587 --> 02:44:39,547
four...

2127
02:44:39,713 --> 02:44:41,553
three, two...

2128
02:44:41,715 --> 02:44:43,045
one.

2129
02:44:50,307 --> 02:44:51,307
Where is he?

2130
02:44:51,475 --> 02:44:53,235
I don't know.
He blew right by his time stamp.

2131
02:44:53,393 --> 02:44:54,853
He should be here.

2132
02:45:00,359 --> 02:45:01,279
Get him back.

2133
02:45:01,443 --> 02:45:02,573
-I'm trying.
-Get him the hell back.

2134
02:45:02,736 --> 02:45:04,606
-Hey, I said I'm trying.
-Sam.

2135
02:45:28,595 --> 02:45:30,175
Go ahead.

2136
02:45:48,156 --> 02:45:48,906
Cap?

2137
02:45:51,243 --> 02:45:52,993
Hi, Sam.

2138
02:45:55,998 --> 02:45:59,038
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2139
02:46:01,170 --> 02:46:05,010
Well, after I put the stones back,
I thought...

2140
02:46:06,133 --> 02:46:07,473
maybe...

2141
02:46:07,968 --> 02:46:12,758
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2142
02:46:14,766 --> 02:46:16,886
How'd that work out for ya?

2143
02:46:19,396 --> 02:46:20,806
It was beautiful.

2144
02:46:22,149 --> 02:46:23,859
Good. I'm happy for you.

2145
02:46:24,026 --> 02:46:25,066
Truly.

2146
02:46:25,819 --> 02:46:27,109
Thank you.

2147
02:46:28,447 --> 02:46:29,697
Only thing bumming me out...

2148
02:46:29,865 --> 02:46:33,455
is the fact I have to live in a world
without Captain America.

2149
02:46:37,247 --> 02:46:40,037
That reminds me.

2150
02:46:48,550 --> 02:46:49,760
Try it on.

2151
02:47:15,285 --> 02:47:16,785
How does it feel?

2152
02:47:19,373 --> 02:47:21,083
Like it's someone else's.

2153
02:47:24,127 --> 02:47:25,297
It isn't.

2154
02:47:38,642 --> 02:47:40,232
Thank you.

2155
02:47:41,937 --> 02:47:43,227
I'll do my best.

2156
02:47:48,610 --> 02:47:50,530
That's why it's yours.

2157
02:47:52,239 --> 02:47:53,619
You wanna tell me about her?

2158
02:48:00,205 --> 02:48:01,705
No.

2159
02:48:02,124 --> 02:48:04,254
No, I don't think I will.
