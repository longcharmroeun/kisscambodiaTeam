00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:04,459
May I have your attention, please?

5
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:09,416
Now, all candidates will move

6
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,833
to the Union Hall for a haircut.

7
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:17,667
Say farewell to
your family and friends promptly.

8
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,126
Salute!

9
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:22,250
Listen to your superiors.

10
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:25,751
Don't skip meals. Stay warm at night.

11
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:27,833
Stay strong, baby.

12
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,541
Come home if it gets too tough.

13
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:30,626
Okay?

14
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,708
I'll be fine. Don't you worry a thing.

15
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,459
You stay well and healthy.

16
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,209
Bye.

17
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,251
Bye.

18
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,541
Who are you texting?

19
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:46,542
Mom.

20
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,959
Should we hug too?

21
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,084
You're right. I thought so.

22
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,584
- Bye, Dad.
- Hee-yeol.

23
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:02,292
I'm proud of you.

24
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,251
It's cold today. Zip up before you go.

25
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,126
Company, attention.

26
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,042
Parade, rest.

27
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,334
Flight, attention.

28
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,501
To your parents. Present, arms.

29
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,042
Order, arms.

30
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,501
Left, face.

31
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,626
Forward, march.

32
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:58,083
Could you not cut it too short?

33
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,958
My sideburns take forever to grow back.

34
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,834
Please. It took me a year to grow my hair.

35
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:07,042
The sideburns...

36
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,084
Right there. Don't cut it too...

37
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:24,167
Retard?

38
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,667
Excuse me.

39
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,500
Did you sterilize that hair clipper?

40
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,459
No.

41
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,084
That's what I was afraid of.

42
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:52,041
Without sterilization,
it can cause bacterial skin infection.

43
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,583
What if one hair clipper
infected everyone here...

44
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,167
Wait, wait.

45
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:04,251
Bacterial skin infection...

46
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:12,416
This training is a condensed
2-week military training program.

47
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:16,041
I hope you all complete the training by
following your drill instructors.

48
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:21,166
Last year, 4 candidates out
of 96 dropped out of the program.

49
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,500
You must remain alert till the end.

50
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,042
Yes, sir.

51
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,041
You kids better learn to speak up.

52
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,542
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,709
That's it.

54
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:37,833
My father was
Class of 1985 of Police University.

55
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,125
From early on, my father taught me well

56
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,750
about public order and justice.

57
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:45,208
You'll eventually learn them here.

58
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,792
Order and justice are important.

59
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:51,000
I want to become a police officer
just like my father.

60
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,542
What brings you here?

61
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,792
Me?

62
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:57,376
I...

63
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:00,376
What? You don't know?

64
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,709
You came here to fool around?

65
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,833
Attention, please.

66
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,291
All candidates report immediately

67
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,833
in full battle uniform that you received today

68
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,250
to the center field in 3 minutes.

69
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:16,876
Anyone late will be severely punished.

70
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:18,001
Move!

71
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,751
What the...

72
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:22,542
1 min 40 sec left.

73
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,209
Run. Out!

74
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,251
1 min 30 sec left.

75
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,417
Come out!

76
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,209
Run forward.

77
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,376
81

78
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,334
Jump higher.

79
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,584
83

80
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:41,126
85

81
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:42,751
Squad, halt.

82
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:45,583
Get up!

83
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,626
Can't walk as a team?

84
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:51,083
Go again from 1 to 100.

85
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,626
Start.

86
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,251
One.

87
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:02,417
Two.

88
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:03,542
United.

89
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,126
Mind.

90
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,459
Lower.

91
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,167
Who's lying down?

92
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,292
United.

93
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,126
Squad, halt.

94
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:14,584
Squad, halt.

95
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,209
Cross-country Roll, start.

96
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,209
Cross-country Roll, start.

97
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:21,667
Roll faster. Go!

98
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,292
Faster, faster, faster!

99
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:24,876
Roll faster!

100
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:25,626
Faster, faster!

101
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:27,626
Wake up. Roll faster.

102
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,667
Roll faster.

103
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:38,417
One.

104
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:39,667
Two.

105
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,167
Three.

106
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,584
Four.

107
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:48,709
One, two, three, four.

108
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,959
Sausages.

109
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,041
Can I get more sausages?

110
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:03,292
Then some won't get any.

111
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:07,417
How can I eat all this rice
with just two sausages?

112
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:11,041
Put some of the rice back.

113
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,125
How can I?

114
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:14,292
You come and sit down now.

115
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:21,542
They're feeding us like kindergarteners.

116
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,376
Aren't you gonna eat your sausages?

117
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:37,751
No.

118
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:38,709
Why not?

119
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:44,959
Sausage is made with sodium glutamate
and sodium nitrate, which are carcinogens.

120
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,042
So why won't you eat them?

121
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,500
Why would you eat carcinogens on purpose?

122
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:50,834
Then I'll take them.

123
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,626
Sodium glutamate...

124
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:56,459
Eat up.

125
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:08,751
Lift your arms.

126
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,250
Chest, 36.

127
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:13,834
Put your arms down.

128
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:14,667
Hey.

129
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:17,250
Waist, 30 and 1/2.

130
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:18,167
Pull this up, please. That's good.

131
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,667
You asshole.

132
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,126
Look front.

133
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,209
Pay attention.

134
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:33,916
Or you'll be seriously injured.

135
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:34,917
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:39,917
Ma'am.

137
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,542
Call a medic now!

138
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,459
Stay still. Do not move.

139
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:48,541
Hurry!

140
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:53,750
As a commissioned officer out in the field,
you could face real danger.

141
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:55,791
In preparation,
here at the Martial Arts Center,

142
00:08:55,792 --> 00:09:00,375
you'll choose one from Taekwondo,
Judo, Aikido, and Kendo

143
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,959
and train for 4 years.

144
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,459
Got it?

145
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,501
Yes, sir.

146
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:09,625
I understand you're upset

147
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:11,500
because two classmates have dropped out.

148
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:15,666
But you're almost there. Keep going.

149
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,501
Got it?

150
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:17,791
Yes, sir.

151
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:20,083
Always answer loud and clear.

152
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:21,209
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,208
Today is the final round of the training.

154
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,458
It's the Mt. Buphwa race.

155
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,666
According to our tradition,

156
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,708
candidates who can run up and back down
the mountain in one hour

157
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,458
will be accepted into the university.

158
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:37,458
But those who fail will be denied entrance
for lack of physical competence.

159
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:40,125
Those who fail to reach the top
will also be denied entrance.

160
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,666
Run with all your might. Understood?

161
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,751
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:51,792
Get set.

163
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,459
Watch your step.

164
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,667
Hey, help me.

165
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,626
I'm sorry, man.

166
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,334
You little shit.

167
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:40,542
Geez.

168
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:43,750
What're you doing here?

169
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:44,292
Hey.

170
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,751
Help me. I can't walk.

171
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,916
Sorry but gotta go.

172
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,751
Hey!

173
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,875
I gave you my sausages.

174
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:57,001
Sausages.

175
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,500
I ate them because you wouldn't.

176
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:00,750
You asked first.

177
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:02,834
If you've eaten them, I wouldn't have.

178
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,292
Shit, dude.

179
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,459
Please help me. I wanna get into the school.

180
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:14,876
Damn it.

181
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,209
Hey.

182
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,541
I'll buy you a steak.

183
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,334
Steak?

184
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,709
My dad is a big-timer at Majang Meat Market.

185
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,251
Korean beef.

186
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:23,751
Perfect marbling.

187
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:24,792
Perfect marbling.

188
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,292
Perfect marbling.

189
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:30,251
Climb on my back.

190
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:31,584
Seriously?

191
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:32,334
Come on.

192
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,126
Let's go.

193
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:38,667
Holy shit.

194
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:40,959
What did you eat?

195
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,500
You're freaking heavy.

196
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,667
We don't have time. Hurry up.

197
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:47,084
Let's go.

198
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,167
Lift your head. Go over there.

199
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,958
Jae-hang, how many is that?

200
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,251
There are two left.

201
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:03,167
What the...

202
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:03,959
What?

203
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:05,750
We passed the hour mark.

204
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:07,417
Then go faster.

205
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,292
You try, asshole.

206
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,458
Dude, you ruined everything!

207
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,250
You crazy asshole.

208
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,208
I'm gonna throw you over there.

209
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,126
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,001
Downhill.

211
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,501
Hurry up.

212
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:27,876
Get down.

213
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:37,126
What happened?

214
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:44,417
I fell down running.

215
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,125
And I sprained my ankle.

216
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:49,791
Gi-jun Park assisted me all the way.

217
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:54,251
Please accept him into the university.

218
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,666
Plus I don't lack physical competence either.

219
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,667
Shut up.

220
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:03,834
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:12,334
Raise your hand if you've seen
these two helping each other.

222
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,126
Put your hand down.

223
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:17,376
Raise your hand if you haven't seen these two.

224
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:20,751
Candidates, on the ground.

225
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,209
Now!

226
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:30,333
It's our job to help people in need.

227
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:33,333
But you've neglected your classmates
when he was hurt.

228
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:36,708
How can you call yourselves police
when you only care about yourselves?

229
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,833
Even if you made it back on time,
you've all failed.

230
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:39,917
Get up.

231
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:44,709
You'll climb Mt. Buphwa again.

232
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:46,459
Lead the way.

233
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,751
Squad, move!

234
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:49,626
Go!

235
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,126
You two go to the infirmary.

236
00:13:57,584 --> 00:13:59,416
Did we pass?

237
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,751
Now!

238
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,667
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,959
Yes! We're good.

240
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:18,501
Let's go.

241
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:19,541
Oh, my foot.

242
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,041
Where'd you go to high school?

243
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,042
Seoul Science High School.

244
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:25,500
Shouldn't you be at KAIST or something?

245
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:27,125
[KAIST: Korean equivalent of MIT]
KAIST is dull.

246
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,750
[KAIST: Korean equivalent of MIT]
I wanna do something unique.

247
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,458
I think going to KAIST is pretty unique.

248
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,291
All my friends went to KAIST.

249
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:34,709
At my high school,
going to Police University is unique.

250
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,042
You mean eccentric?

251
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,083
Why'd you come here?

252
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:43,000
Tuition is free here. My mom has no money.

253
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:43,751
What about your dad?

254
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,667
I was raised by a single mom.

255
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:49,501
That's a bit blunt.

256
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,709
I'm not ashamed of it.

257
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,792
You're right.

258
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,500
So when are we gonna eat a steak?

259
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,041
Whenever you wish.

260
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:00,208
You wanna know something?

261
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,126
What?

262
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,584
I can eat like a food fighter.

263
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:05,958
Well, we also own the butcher shop.

264
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,626
Holy cow!

265
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:09,917
Let's be best friends.

266
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:11,292
All right.

267
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,666
Are you a pervert?

268
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,376
What do you mean?

269
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,584
Don't rub it. Pound it.

270
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:20,251
Let's go again.

271
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,792
Don't disappoint me, bro. Come on.

272
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,459
I do swear

273
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:32,876
I do swear

274
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,333
that I'll abide by University's regulations.

275
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,875
As a member of the university,
I'll uphold honor and pride

276
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:42,083
and devote myself to my studies,

277
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:44,042
fulfilling my duty.

278
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,376
Hand down.

279
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,042
To the University president. Present, arms.

280
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,584
Salute!

281
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,251
Salute!

282
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,834
"2 Years Later"

283
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,376
Man...

284
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,167
Gi-jun.

285
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,042
Yeah?

286
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,751
I wanna wear civilian clothes.

287
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,334
I hate the color green.

288
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:46,666
Especially this shade of green.

289
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,001
Hey, wait up.

290
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:50,792
Wait up.

291
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:59,001
"List 3 sources of investigation
Examine victim, evidence, crime scene."

292
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:06,584
"Passion, tenacity,"

293
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:14,209
"Big heart"

294
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,376
Okay.

295
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:22,500
Most abduction cases target
female adults and children under 13.

296
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:26,500
Time is the most important factor
in abduction cases.

297
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:31,333
A missing person's survival rate
falls significantly as the time passes.

298
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:37,251
What do you call the time period that
a victim's most likely to be killed?

299
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:39,667
Jae-ho.

300
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,042
It's the golden time.

301
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,126
That's for hospitals.

302
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:46,042
It's the critical hours.

303
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:48,459
Bingo.

304
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,709
Listen carefully.

305
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:04,333
For an adult female,
the critical hours are 7 hours afterwards.

306
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:09,209
Statistically, 70% of the victims are
killed during that time.

307
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:16,751
As I've said last week, today I'll teach you
very useful self-defense techniques.

308
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,291
Any volunteers?

309
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,376
I will.

310
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:29,792
When a suspect attacks with a weapon.

311
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:30,917
Slowly.

312
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:33,542
Slowly!

313
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,500
When a perpetrator attacks with a weapon,

314
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:41,416
you cross your wrists and
trap the suspect's arm.

315
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,167
Jump and boom!

316
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,000
See that?

317
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:47,751
Yes, sir.

318
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,875
His arm is stuck in between my wrists.

319
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:49,459
Yes, sir.

320
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,459
Then you make a big semicircle
and bend his wrist.

321
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,251
Now the attacker is bound to drop his knife.

322
00:18:58,834 --> 00:18:59,917
See that?

323
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,292
Yes, sir.

324
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,959
Now, you'll strike his nose with your palm.

325
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:09,833
If the attacker's still standing,
play your last secret card.

326
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:13,167
Strike the attacker's neck. Hi-yah!

327
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:23,417
That looks truly helpful.

328
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:26,751
A round of applause.

329
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,459
Applause.

330
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:38,709
Hee-yeol.

331
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,750
What're you doing for Christmas?

332
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:42,791
I'm going to an Internet café with Gi-jun.

333
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,001
I'm gonna hang out with my girlfriend.

334
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,876
You don't have a girlfriend.

335
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,459
I know.

336
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:54,292
You stupid fools.

337
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:55,251
What?

338
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,501
What's this?

339
00:19:58,751 --> 00:19:59,875
My girlfriend.

340
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:01,000
Where'd you meet her?

341
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:06,626
I don't see why I have to tell you that.

342
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:10,001
Nope, I don't think so.

343
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,501
Gi-jun, make him talk.

344
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,126
Let me interrogate.

345
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:23,626
Where'd you meet her?

346
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,042
Where?

347
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,042
At a club.

348
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:26,959
Which club?

349
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,084
No way. I'm not telling you.

350
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:30,876
Which club?

351
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,833
Octagon.

352
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,083
It's club Octagon.

353
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,001
He met her at Octagon?

354
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,666
Is it expensive to get in to Octagon?

355
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,626
Octagon?

356
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:41,250
$30 for a cover.
With drinks, it'll get seriously expensive.

357
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:42,792
We won't order drinks.

358
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,500
How will you pick up girls
without buying them drinks?

359
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:48,208
Look. My mom said that
women fall for men with cute smiles.

360
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:49,417
Give me a smile.

361
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,041
Wow, you've got lots of teeth.

362
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,292
Shut your trap.

363
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:59,209
Try showing only up to your cuspids.

364
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,001
A little more.

365
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,666
This is no good either.

366
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:04,251
Darn you.

367
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:05,916
But you're better looking than Jae-ho.

368
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,001
Shit, he looks old.

369
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,958
That just looked good.

370
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,709
- This
- Yeah.

371
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,791
- This looks good?
- Yeah.

372
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:12,958
Say that I'm better looking than Jae-ho again.

373
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:15,375
You're better looking than Jae-ho.

374
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:16,583
Shit, he looks old.

375
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:17,708
This?

376
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,125
- You got it.
- Oh yeah?

377
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:20,084
- I got it, I got it.
- You got it, you got it.

378
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,667
We're ready to go.

379
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:23,459
Bang!

380
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:31,666
Hey, which one looks better?

381
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,709
Shit. They're all crap.

382
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,459
This one's better.

383
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,833
What about me?

384
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:37,834
Shit.

385
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:41,501
It's a duffel coat and its twin.

386
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,041
What're you gonna wear?

387
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,584
I know what I'm gonna wear.

388
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,375
Shit, is that from a donation bin?

389
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:49,875
This is Cambridge Members.

390
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,583
Cambridge or whatever it is.

391
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:54,541
If you wear that, we won't get in
even with a $30 cover charge.

392
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,584
Then what do I do? This is all I got.

393
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:01,376
This ain't good. Let's get some help.

394
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,208
No matter how hard you try,
you can't flip Gi-jun over.

395
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:04,209
I can do it.

396
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,333
- Hi.
- I can do it.

397
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:06,042
Choose from here.

398
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:06,959
Choose what?

399
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,208
- What?
- Thanks.

400
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,167
No, that's brand new!

401
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,000
What're you looking at?

402
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,875
Wait, I have to focus. Okay, got it.

403
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,041
Let me borrow this for a day.

404
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:16,792
Why should I?

405
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:17,751
Because we're friends?

406
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:19,542
Not good enough.

407
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,375
What do you want?

408
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:22,292
Me?

409
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,250
During judo class,

410
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,500
let me win by ippon in front of everyone.

411
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:28,667
Crazy ass...

412
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:30,667
Okay.

413
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,251
A shoulder-throw?

414
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:31,792
Okay.

415
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:32,917
Yahoo!

416
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,167
You need cologne.

417
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:44,584
That smells great.

418
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,209
Let's go.

00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:49,625

Are you two up to something no good?

422
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,834
No, sir.

423
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,292
Go. Your bus will leave.

424
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:04,917
Thank you, sir.

425
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:09,834
I'm jealous.

Jae-ho's clothes aren't half bad.

428
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,500
You look good in them.

429
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:16,667
You too.

430
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,875
Uh-oh. The bus is leaving.

431
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:20,167
- Oh, no!
- Wait!

432
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,917
Are you a cop?

433
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:32,959
No, we're still students.

434
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:35,667
Celebrity? Who?

435
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,417
Please wait.

436
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,041
A celebrity? Really?

437
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:39,751
Celebrity!

438
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,208
I think a celebrity is here.

439
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:41,834
What the...

440
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:43,167
It's Chansung!

441
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:43,917

You rock!

445
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,667
I know. Put your hands up!

446
00:23:57,042 --> 00:24:00,541
Is this what I think it is? Grinding?

447
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,084
Grinding!

448
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:05,041
Holy shit. It's so packed!

449
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:06,334
No joke.

450
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:08,166
Wow, Octagon.

451
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:09,709
Let's go.

452
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:14,916
- Excuse me.
- It's AHN Soo-min.

453
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:17,334
It's AHN Soo-min. You rock!

454
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:18,791
She's from the TV show, Unpretty Rapstar.

455
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,375
- What's up?
- Unpretty Rapstar!

456
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,376
Yeah, AHN Soo-min.

459
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:24,916
Kickass!

460
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:26,126
- Over there.
- Let's go.

461
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:46,751
Finally!

462
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,126
Hello.

463
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,959
Are you on your military leave?

464
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:55,875
Pardon me?

465
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:57,375
Are you in the military?

466
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:58,292
I see.

467
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm a Police University student.

468
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,709
Oh, you're a cop.

469
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:05,334
Hi, sweetie.

470
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:09,834
Shit, he looks old.

471
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:14,417
Hey there.

472
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,751
You're cute.

473
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:27,584
Pardon?

474
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:28,876
Let's go dance.

475
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:34,459
What about me?

476
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,417
Where's mine?

477
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,041
You're so cute.

478
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,959
I'm cute. So cute.

479
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:46,667
Hi, sweetie.

480
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:57,542
Bye.

481
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,126
Hello.

482
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:21,084
What're you doing for Christmas?

483
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,209
What line of work are you in?

484
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,542
I'm a student.

485
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:30,500
Are you studying abroad?

486
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,376
No, at Police University.

487
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,666
So you're a police officer?

488
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,667
Yes. No, when I graduate.

489
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:47,751
Why would you do that? You'll be poor for life.

490
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,251
"MISSING: Sanmyung Group
owner's grandson CHOI"

00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,792
You really think we should become cops?

492
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:24,167
What's wrong?

493
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:26,709
I've been thinking.

494
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:31,709
At least Jae-ho has a goal. We don't.

495
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:35,209
I'm here because I'm penniless,
and you came here by accident.

496
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:39,834
Dang.

497
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,459
After we graduate, we'll be cops for life.

498
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,792
I don't know if this is right.

499
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,751
School is boring for me too.

500
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:57,333
Hi-yah, my ass. They teach useless stuff.

501
00:27:57,334 --> 00:28:00,001
I put up with it for 2 years already.
I can't drop out now.

502
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:02,000
What're we doing for Christmas?

503
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,750
I don't know. Christmas, my ass.

504
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,709
How about Italian? I'll buy.

505
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:08,583
I know. I'm sorry.

506
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:10,001
Idiot.

507
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,666
Let's get out. I feel suffocated.
What do you wanna do?

508
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,333
How about Internet café right about now?

509
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:19,376
I think it's Overwatch time?

510
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,334
Die. Die.

511
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:23,542
Die.

512
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:25,167
Let's go.

513
00:28:25,168 --> 00:28:27,376
Nerf this!

514
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,501
I love you too, girl.

515
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:35,501
All right. I'll be home soon.

516
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:39,583
Hee-yeol, you saw that?

517
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,041
Yup. The pink one.

518
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:44,833
I think God has given us one last chance.

519
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:46,708
If she turns around right now,
it's a sign from God.

520
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,001
Okay. Turn around.

521
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:50,209
Turn around.

522
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:53,084
Turn around.

523
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:54,417
Turn...

524
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,250
- Holy.
- Wow.

525
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,458
What just happened?

526
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:59,708
Holy geez.

527
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:01,833
- Jackpot! Sweet!
- No way.

528
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:04,709
She's gone. Let's go!

529
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,416
If we follow her like this,
she might take it the wrong way.

530
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,958
Then what should we do? Let's just follow her.

531
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,667
Don't hit me, asshole.

532
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,541
It's now or never. Go ask her number.

533
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,708
You do it.

534
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:31,833
You're better looking than me. Come on.

535
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,583
I agree with you on that,
but let's do rock-paper-scissors.

536
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:36,416
Rock Paper Scissors! Play or you go.

537
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:39,376
Rock Paper Scissors! Rock Paper Scissors!

538
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,167
Don't do this now.

539
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:43,626
Hurry up.

540
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,334
One round only.

541
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:48,542
Rock Paper Scissors!

542
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,417
Scissors!

543
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:02,584
Go get her number. Hurry up.

544
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,001
What the...

545
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,209
We almost got them!

546
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:31,792
Stop!

547
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,750
It's dialing. Pick up!

548
00:31:14,751 --> 00:31:16,584
Come here.

549
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,959
Pick up, pick up!

550
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,166
Please pick up.

551
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,416
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hello?

552
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:25,041
I just saw a girl being kidnapped.

553
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:26,001
Yes.

554
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:28,000
She looked like a college girl.

555
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:30,583
Some men knocked her out

556
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,667
and put her in a van.

557
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,876
Yes, I witnessed it myself.

558
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:37,875
Yes. Excuse me?

559
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:40,042
No, I don't know her.

560
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:42,333
The license plate number?

561
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,751
You know it?

562
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:47,000
37GU8338, a green Starex van.

563
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:50,501
- We got them.
- We can do this.

564
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,334
Yes!

565
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,042
- Pardon?
- What's wrong?

566
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:57,541
No way. I have a really good memory.

567
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:00,458
Then what about 8838?

568
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,834
That's right. Hurry!

569
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:03,501
Pardon?

570
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:07,126
Then what about 8383?

571
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,251
Shit.

572
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,959
Pardon? Oh, okay.

573
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,208
What did he say?

574
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:13,834
They can't find it.

575
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:14,459
What?

576
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:17,084
They want us to wait here for the patrol car.

577
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:18,458
How long will that take?

578
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:19,167
About 10 minutes?

579
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:19,959
10 minutes?

580
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:21,251
Let's go.

581
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:22,167
Go where?

582
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:25,791
We'll still need to go to the station
to make a report.

583
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:26,916
In 10 minutes,

584
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:29,459
we can go to Gangnam Police Station.

585
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,458
Let's save time. Come on.

586
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:32,042
Okay!

587
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,417
Taxi!

588
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,584
Salute.

589
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,667
Salute.

590
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:46,834
Salute.

591
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,167
Thank you.

592
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,416
We're from Police University.

593
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:52,834
We're here to report a crime.

594
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:57,501
Good evening.

595
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,125
Which floor is Missing Persons Unit on?

596
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:00,666
They're getting ready to be dispatched.

597
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:01,417
Pardon?

598
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,417
There they are.

599
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:05,376
Sir, they're here for Missing Persons Unit.

600
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:06,376
What can I do for you?

601
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:09,166
We're Police University students
and want to report a crime.

602
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,583
What class are you in?

603
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:11,417
Pardon?

604
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:13,417
We're Class of 2017.

605
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,417
I was Class of 1999.

606
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:17,000
Hello, sir.

607
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:18,583
So what was the crime?

608
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:22,375
We saw a woman getting kidnapped
near Nonhyun station, 30 minutes ago.

609
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,583
Are you sure?

610
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,208
- Yes, sir.
- You knew her?

611
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,209
No, sir.

612
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,750
I see. We're on the move on
a Chief's special order.

613
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:32,083
Some business mogul's grandson went missing.

614
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:34,458
I'll lead the initial investigation
and be back asap. Wait here.

615
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:35,750
Excuse me, sir.

616
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:38,208
For adult women, since the critical hours

617
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:40,416
- occur during the first 7 hours of abduction,
- Captain, please hurry.

618
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,083
We were taught to start investigating asap.

619
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:43,250
That's right. You were taught correctly.

620
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:45,708
But the Chief's order comes first.

621
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,626
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

622
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,417
What do we do now?

623
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:00,292
It'll be too late when he gets back.

624
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:03,292
Then what do we do? We can't go looking.

625
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,917
Seriously?

626
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:06,709
Yeah.

627
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,916
We're the only ones who know she's kidnapped.

628
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:10,834
She could die without us.

629
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:13,959
That's true.

630
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,916
But we can't track her phone
or see the CCTV tapes.

631
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:17,917
What can we do?

632
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,416
I know you're smart,
especially at a time like this.

633
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:23,626
Think of something you've learned from school.

634
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:29,292
Hey.

635
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:32,542
Should we use the 3 sources of investigation?

636
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,375
How do we do that?

637
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,625
3 sources of investigation.

638
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,416
Examine victim, evidence, crime scene.

639
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:42,792
Let's do that.

640
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,709
What's wrong?

641
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:50,083
Nothing. Keep going.

642
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:54,708
We can't examine the victim
because we don't know the victim.

643
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,750
We can't examine evidence
because there's no evidence.

644
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:58,917
So we examine the crime scene.

645
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,208
That's true, but...

646
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:01,250
Let's go back there.

647
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,416
I don't think we'll find anything.

648
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,417
Even if we don't, we should try.

649
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:10,376
Okay. Let's go.

650
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:11,542
Come on.

651
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:17,376
Here, here.

652
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:19,917
This is it. Thank you.

653
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:22,084
Wasn't it this way?

654
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:22,792
Yeah.

655
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,167
I think we're almost there.

656
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:33,001
I think it's here.

657
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:35,959
Hey, the van was here.

658
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,251
- Here?
- Yeah.

659
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:44,458
So if the van was waiting here,
it's likely that it was premeditated.

660
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:47,751
If it was premeditated,
it's likely that they're habitual offenders.

661
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,876
Which lowers the chance of us catching them.

662
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:54,584
You're right.

663
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:58,792
Hey, look.

664
00:35:58,876 --> 00:36:02,667
Wasn't the pink girl carrying that earlier?

665
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:03,376
Yeah.

666
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:04,501
Right?

667
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,584
What's wrong?

668
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:11,959
You open it.

669
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,459
I think it's alive.

670
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:21,626
What's this? Blood!

671
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,708
It's Topokki.

672
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:24,667
Is it?

673
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:26,750
That's a lot of Topokki.
Maybe enough for 4 people.

674
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:27,959
Who cares?

675
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:31,875
You know of anyone
who freezes Topokki for later?

676
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,708
I've never done that.

677
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:36,375
It means she has people to share at home.

678
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,209
Kickass lifestyle inference!

679
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:43,041
Only if we knew her address, we'd find more.

680
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,416
There's not even a receipt.

681
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:49,083
We can't find her house,
but we might find the Topokki stand.

682
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,625
Because Topokki gets mushy easily
so people buy them near homes.

683
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,417
Freaking forensics.

684
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:56,626
Let's go.

685
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:10,167
Yes, iPhone 6. Pink.

686
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:13,917
What do you mean?

687
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:18,042
Mr. Hwang, how could you do this to me?

688
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:21,041
You paid $300 last time.

689
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:24,084
I want $500 for this one
or you won't get the girl.

690
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:26,376
Is this from your stand?

691
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,750
It's too sweet.

692
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,417
It's not mine.

693
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:37,208
Are there many Topokki stands around here?

694
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:40,250
There are a few,
but they're all about to close.

695
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:41,126
Really?

696
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:42,292
Let's hurry.

697
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:43,042
Thank you.

698
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:44,042
Thank you.

699
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:48,541
Where do we go? Let's go this way.

700
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:49,501
Okay.

701
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,708
Excuse me.

702
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:53,126
Are there any Topokki shops near here?

703
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:55,625
There's one Kukde Topokki shop over there.

704
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:56,459
Over there?

705
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,709
Thank you.

706
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,834
Did you sell these Topokki?

707
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:05,584
Our scallions are rectangular,
but these are stringy.

708
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,417
It's not ours.

709
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:11,791
I'm sorry, but do you know where this is from?

710
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:14,584
How should I know? Try another place.

711
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,001
Okay. Right?

712
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:17,917
Okay.

713
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,876
Stop interfering with my business
and please leave.

714
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,542
We're sorry.

715
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,876
Let's go.

716
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,208
- No, it's not ours.
- Okay.

717
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:27,959
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

718
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:31,375
Is this a mistake?

719
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:32,626
Where to?

720
00:38:33,084 --> 00:38:34,250
- Sorry.
- We're sorry.

721
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:36,376
- Let's go over here.
- Come on.

722
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:38,001
Hello, ma'am.

723
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:41,458
Could you please see
if this Topokki is from your stand?

724
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:42,209
I don't know anything.

725
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,459
Excuse me, ma'am.

726
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,876
It might be closed already.

727
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,916
Should we call Prof. Yang?
He worked in Serious Crime Unit.

728
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:02,208
He'll be more upset
if he knows what we're doing.

729
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,959
Gi-jun, listen.

730
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,667
Can we examine evidence right now?

731
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,084
No.

732
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:10,041
Then can we examine the victim?

733
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:11,042
No.

734
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,042
So calling Prof. Yang

735
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:16,251
would be a bad idea, right?

736
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,958
I know this isn't the right time to say this.

737
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,708
But you know what I wrote
as the 3 sources of investigation?

738
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:22,376
What?

739
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:24,626
Passion, tenacity, big heart.

740
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:29,667
I got it wrong.

741
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,417
Are you a moron?

742
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:32,501
I think so.

743
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:38,083
Come on. We can find it.

744
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,084
Okay.

745
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,166
There must be one.

746
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,459
There must be.

747
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:44,501
Hello.

748
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:45,709
No one's here.

749
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:48,584
The scallion!

750
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:50,834
You're right.

751
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,667
- We found it.
- This is it.

752
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:55,375
Hello, handsome boys.

753
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:57,291
Is this Topokki from your stand?

754
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,209
Yes.

755
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:01,208
Then do you remember the girl who bought this?

756
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,833
I have a lot takeout customers.

757
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,791
She was wearing a pink parka and
had a very small face.

758
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:09,209
Like this big.

759
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:14,666
She sounds like the girl,
who comes here often at midnight.

760
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,626
Tall.

761
00:40:15,627 --> 00:40:16,791
That's her!

762
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:17,292
My goodness.

763
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:19,916
You wouldn't know her house, would you?

764
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,584
No.

765
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:26,167
Oh, I know where she works.

766
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,791
7-Eleven over there.

767
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,500
I met her there once.

768
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:34,001
I saw her coming up
from the building's basement in front.

769
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:37,334
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

770
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,292
Across.

771
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:42,542
The basement.

772
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:43,501
This is the place.

773
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:47,084
Gi-jun.

774
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:47,834
Yeah?

775
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:50,041
She must work at the ear-cleaning salon.

776
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,333
What's that?

777
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:52,916
You rest your head in a girl's lap
while she cleans your ear.

778
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,458
If you work her up to it,
she'd let you touch her boobs.

779
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,376
Holy mother.

780
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:57,541
How do you know about this?

781
00:40:57,542 --> 00:41:00,126
In high school,
my friends wanted to go so I googled it.

782
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,626
You went.

783
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,500
I didn't go
because they don't sterilize ear picks.

784
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:04,376
You did go, loser.

785
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:05,458
I did not, loser.

786
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:06,209
You so did.

787
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:06,917
Shush.

788
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:10,626
If we get caught in this shady place,
we'll be expelled.

789
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,458
But we don't go in, we'll never find her.

790
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:14,083
But we could get expelled.

791
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:15,042
Then don't get caught.

792
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:16,500
One keeps watch while the other goes in.

793
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:17,292
I'll keep watch.

794
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:18,084
No.

795
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:19,917
I don't want to either.

796
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:20,709
Do rock-paper-scissors.

797
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,626
- Is that all you know?
- Play or go. Rock Paper Scissors!

798
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:24,709
Get in there.

799
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:26,333
Please just this once. Two out of three.

800
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:27,626
So damn bitter.

801
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:28,958
Rock Paper Scissors!

802
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:29,542
Get in there.

803
00:41:29,543 --> 00:41:30,583
You always play rock.

804
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:33,376
Idiot, it's you who always play scissors. Go!

805
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:36,292
Shit.

806
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:23,876
Come on in.

807
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:28,459
Okay.

808
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:35,916
Go to Room 3.

809
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:37,916
I'm actually here to find someone.

810
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:39,291
Room 3.

811
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:40,251
Yes, sir.

812
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,417
That looks yummy.

813
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:30,541
It's just ramen noodles. Geez.

814
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:32,834
Hold back the urge. I can do it.

815
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:34,292
I must.

816
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,042
Wow, sausage.

817
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:40,792
That's my favorite.

818
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:46,001
I can keep watch from inside.

819
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:56,375
Who are you looking for?

820
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:57,834
She's got a small face.

821
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:01,959
I don't know her name.

822
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:09,542
What about her body?

823
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:11,834
She's tall.

824
00:44:15,626 --> 00:44:16,792
You know her?

825
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:19,876
What the...

826
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:25,917
Oh my god.

827
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:27,876
It's so good.

828
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,834
I need sausage.

829
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:42,750
How cute! Are you in the army?

830
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:43,709
Yes.

831
00:44:50,626 --> 00:44:51,959
What're you doing?

832
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:54,792
The text...

833
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:57,334
Sit.

834
00:44:58,292 --> 00:44:59,459
Yes, ma'am.

835
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:06,667
I'll start.

836
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:10,292
Lie down. What's wrong?

837
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:16,334
Wait, wait. Did you sterilize the ear pick?

838
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:19,376
No, does it need to be?

839
00:45:20,626 --> 00:45:21,542
No, ma'am.

840
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:24,459
Okay then. Relax.

841
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:34,334
Uh oh. That isn't good.

842
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:44,667
Oh man.

843
00:45:49,001 --> 00:45:50,542
Hey, pigs!

844
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,959
Sir, just ignore him.

845
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:57,750
Kids like him end up criminals.

846
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:58,791
I think he's drunk.

847
00:45:58,792 --> 00:45:59,959
Hello, pigs!

848
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:00,751
Pigs.

849
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:01,667
Sir?

850
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:03,917
Hey, pigs.

851
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:07,376
Pigs!

852
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:08,751
You come here.

853
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:10,167
Stop right there.

854
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:11,792
Why would I do that?

855
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:15,042
Hey!

856
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,709
You guys need to work out.

857
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:21,542
Stop, stop, stop!

858
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:24,208
I'm gonna go in deeper.

859
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:25,042
Okay, ma'am.

860
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,417
That's a big one. Stay still.

861
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:43,542
Is he Captain America or something?

862
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:48,334
I think he realized his mistakes.

863
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:53,001
Justice rains from above. You, pigs.

864
00:46:53,542 --> 00:46:54,459
He realized?

865
00:46:54,626 --> 00:46:55,584
Uh oh.

866
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:58,751
Stop right there.

867
00:46:58,752 --> 00:46:59,959
Stop, you little punk!

868
00:47:03,084 --> 00:47:07,126
You should come here more often.
Look at all these.

869
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,209
Okay.

870
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:13,875
You know what?
I'm not here to get my ear cleaned.

871
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:14,792
What?

872
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,501
Then why're you here?

873
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:25,501
Should I tell you?

874
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:28,625
Oh my goodness.

875
00:47:28,626 --> 00:47:30,583
Dear Mama, get well.

876
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:31,667
What's wrong?

877
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:38,083
A few hours ago, my friend and I saw

878
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:41,916
some men knocking out a girl
and kidnapping her.

879
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:44,208
Then I found out that she works here.

880
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:45,500
Wait. Who?

881
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:46,959
She has a small face.

882
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,500
She's about 5'7".

883
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:51,417
Her hair is about this long.

884
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:55,292
We got a lot of girls like that. Anything else?

885
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:59,751
I think she left work around midnight tonight.

886
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:03,833
- Is it Yun-jung?
- Yun-jung.

887
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:05,500
- Her hair color?
- Brown.

888
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:08,791
Oh my. I think it's Yun-jung.

889
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:10,750
What should we do?

890
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,167
Please calm down.

891
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:17,001
You know her address?

892
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:20,166
No, she ran away from home a long time ago.

893
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,001
She ran away?

894
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:22,792
Yeah, she's 17.

895
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:26,583
Isn't it illegal to hire a minor?

896
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:28,125
I'm working illegally too.

897
00:48:28,126 --> 00:48:30,250
This whole place is illegal.

898
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:33,792
So you don't know where Yun-jung lives.

899
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:38,501
She told me she lives with
her runaway friends nearby.

900
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,416
Should I ask the other girls?

901
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:42,292
Yes, please.

902
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:42,834
Okay.

903
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:47,000
64 Nonhyun-ro 27.

904
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:47,792
Geez.

905
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:48,792
What the heck?

906
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:50,166
Run.

907
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,250
- What's wrong?
- Run fast!

908
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:52,001
I got her address.

909
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:52,959
Run for now.

910
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,167
- What's with the patrol car?
- Just run.

911
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,376
What's going on?

912
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:02,834
Is this it?

913
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:05,626
Watch your head.

914
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,501
I think this is the place.

915
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:19,042
Hello.

916
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:21,584
Someone's home.

917
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:27,667
Who are you?

918
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:30,542
Hello.

919
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:33,542
I was told that Yun-jung lives here.

920
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,292
Who are you?

921
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:39,083
We're from Police University.

922
00:49:39,084 --> 00:49:42,126
We saw Yun-jung get kidnapped.

923
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:47,292
Is someone else in there?

924
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:50,375
Okay. I'll open the door.

925
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:51,209
Okay.

926
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:53,834
Gun-young, is Yun-jung okay?

927
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:55,209
Shut the fuck up.

928
00:49:59,626 --> 00:50:00,834
You hear something?

929
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:03,626
Hey, open up.

930
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:09,917
Pull it.

931
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:12,126
He ran away through there.

932
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:15,334
Go that way.

933
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:16,876
I'll go outside.

934
00:50:22,334 --> 00:50:23,167
I'll go this way.

935
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,042
I'll go there.

936
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:21,001
Shit.

937
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:24,792
Shit.

938
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:27,209
Did you do that?

939
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:29,501
Yeah.

940
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,334
Jackpot.

941
00:51:32,376 --> 00:51:34,167
What do we do?

942
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:38,126
This actually works.

943
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:40,750
Do as you were taught.

944
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:42,167
As we were taught?

945
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:48,501
Come here.

946
00:51:52,334 --> 00:51:53,751
Why'd you run?

947
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:56,000
Because you were coming after me.

948
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:58,208
You must've run
because you've done something bad.

949
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:00,000
I didn't do anything bad.

950
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:02,417
Please tell me the passcode.

951
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:04,459
Don't be so polite.

952
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,375
Tell me the passcode, biatch.

953
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:08,376
Yeah, asshole.

954
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:09,666
This really hurts.

955
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:10,959
Tell me now.

956
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:13,751
1111

957
00:52:14,917 --> 00:52:16,084
Stupid ass.

958
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:17,541
How do you know Yun-jung?

959
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:19,042
This really hurts a lot.

960
00:52:19,334 --> 00:52:20,750
I'll tell you everything if you let me loose.

961
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:22,542
I wired $1,000.

962
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:25,126
You sold off Yun-jung, didn't you?

963
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:30,667
I don't know anything.

964
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,751
I just told them her name.

965
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:36,208
To who? To Gun-ho?

966
00:52:36,209 --> 00:52:38,625
He said he'll pay for runaway kids.

967
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:40,416
Who is Gun-ho?

968
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,376
He's just a guy I know.

969
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:44,208
Where's he right now?

970
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:45,458
Where is he?

971
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:48,042
Lamb kebabs. In Daerim-dong.

972
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:50,166
I have his business card in my wallet.

973
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,459
Find his wallet.

974
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:55,042
Come here, asshole.

975
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:56,959
He's loaded.

976
00:52:57,209 --> 00:52:58,791
What're they doing to the kids?

977
00:52:58,792 --> 00:52:59,958
I don't know.

978
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,500
You don't know what they'll do,
yet you still sold them off?

979
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:04,667
I need money.

980
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:06,709
Asshole.

981
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:10,333
No matter how poor you are. Have you no shame?

982
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:11,251
Gi-jun.

983
00:53:12,209 --> 00:53:13,417
Hegang Lamb Kebab

984
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:15,001
Hegang?

985
00:53:15,002 --> 00:53:17,208
Let's go talk to the kids at Yun-jung's place.

986
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:18,541
Get statements from acquaintances.

987
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:21,542
It'll be dangerous for them
to stay there tonight.

988
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,459
I bet you're hungry.

989
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:35,376
We need to ask some questions about Yun-jung.
Can we come in?

990
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:39,167
How did you meet Yun-jung?

991
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:41,916
We met at the runaway shelter.

992
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:42,834
When?

993
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:45,626
About a year ago.

994
00:53:48,084 --> 00:53:50,042
Why did Yun-jung run away from home?

995
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:52,833
She said her stepfather beat her all the time.

996
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,876
She said sometimes he beat her unconscious.

997
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:00,792
Where's Yun-jung?

998
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:08,959
Some bad men knocked her down
with a bat and kidnapped her.

999
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,959
Oh, Yun-jung.

1000
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:21,667
Oh no.

1001
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:25,042
How could you tell them that, crazy ass?

1002
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:27,584
I thought they should know.

1003
00:54:27,626 --> 00:54:28,916
Is she hurt badly?

1004
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:31,250
What? No.

1005
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:32,708
She wasn't hurt too badly.

1006
00:54:32,709 --> 00:54:35,917
We're looking for her so don't worry.

1007
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:38,250
Mister.

1008
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:40,250
I can't live without her.

1009
00:54:40,251 --> 00:54:42,375
Could you please find her?

1010
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:43,791
Please?

1011
00:54:43,792 --> 00:54:45,709
Please save her.

1012
00:54:53,459 --> 00:54:54,376
Girls.

1013
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:01,459
We'll find Yun-jung no matter what.

1014
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:04,251
So don't cry.

1015
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,334
Take this.

1016
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:22,208
And get out of here.

1017
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:24,083
Find some place warm to sleep.

1018
00:55:24,084 --> 00:55:26,292
When we find Yun-jung, we'll call you.

1019
00:55:31,376 --> 00:55:32,209
I see a taxi.

1020
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:33,417
Taxi, taxi!

1021
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:35,084
Get in.

1022
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:37,751
Hello.

1023
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,416
To Daerim-dong, please.

1024
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:40,209
Where in Daerim-dong?

1025
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,792
Here's the address.

1026
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,666
For police to work,

1027
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:50,458
someone needs to report a crime,
or police need orders from above.

1028
00:55:50,459 --> 00:55:51,459
That's right.

1029
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,666
But no one'll report a crime
when a runaway is kidnapped.

1030
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:58,333
Family won't know she's missing
because she's already gone.

1031
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:02,251
Runaway friends are afraid of cops
so they won't call in.

1032
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:06,126
They calculated the target,
place and everything else.

1033
00:56:06,459 --> 00:56:07,834
They're smart.

1034
00:56:09,334 --> 00:56:13,709
What do you think
they're doing to the kidnap victims?

1035
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:18,167
Human trafficking.

1036
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:25,459
Sir, please hurry.

1037
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:54,375
Fucking bitch.

1038
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:56,042
- Get her.
- Okay.

1039
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:01,667
Please don't kill me.

1040
00:57:08,084 --> 00:57:09,334
Medicine time.

1041
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:16,126
Student ID: Yun-jung Lee

1042
00:57:27,126 --> 00:57:29,667
Guys, this is Daerim-dong.

1043
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:46,626
I can't believe this is Korea.

1044
00:57:47,084 --> 00:57:49,626
Look at the signs. This is China.

1045
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:51,626
I've never seen anything like it.

1046
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:53,876
What the...

1047
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:58,834
You guys.

1048
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,958
Only Korean Chinese live here.

1049
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:02,917
Many stabbing incidents happen at night.

1050
00:58:03,042 --> 00:58:07,001
There are many ruthless illegals that
cops won't even touch.

1051
00:58:07,376 --> 00:58:09,917
You shouldn't walk around if unnecessary.

1052
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:11,876
Thank you.

1053
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:22,334
This is the place. Thank you.

1054
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:23,709
Thank you.

1055
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:28,376
Right?

1056
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:29,167
Yup.

1057
00:58:30,584 --> 00:58:31,626
Let's go.

1058
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:51,375
We close at 4 am. Order from 2 servings.

1059
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:52,376
Okay.

1060
00:58:55,376 --> 00:58:57,042
He's pretty good.

1061
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,291
- This game is fixed.
- Give me the phone.

1062
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:02,167
What?

1063
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:03,333
The phone.

1064
00:59:03,334 --> 00:59:04,542
It's not fixed.

1065
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:07,376
But how come I keep losing?

1066
00:59:13,376 --> 00:59:15,251
Stupid moron.

1067
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:18,001
Not yours. The asshole's.

1068
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:29,209
Gun-ho

1069
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:34,626
If I lose again, this game is fixed.

1070
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:37,875
- That's our guy.
- That's him.

1071
00:59:37,876 --> 00:59:40,166
You sure the game isn't fixed?

1072
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:41,126
What do we do now?

1073
00:59:42,084 --> 00:59:43,376
First, let's order.

1074
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:50,626
Stupid ass.

1075
00:59:59,084 --> 01:00:01,208
This place is expensive. Shall we go?

1076
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:02,250
Okay, let's go.

1077
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:03,917
- Let's go.
- Who are you?

1078
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:06,001
Where's Gun-young?

1079
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:08,667
Where's Gun-young?

1080
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:14,251
Why do you have Gun-young's phone?

1081
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:17,084
Who are you?

1082
01:00:17,459 --> 01:00:19,458
Who the fuck are you?

1083
01:00:19,459 --> 01:00:22,334
Who are you?

1084
01:00:34,292 --> 01:00:35,334
Hee-yeol!

1085
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:02,416
Gi-jun, you okay?

1086
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:03,084
Yeah.

1087
01:01:03,085 --> 01:01:04,501
We kick ass.

1088
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:06,626
Let's get him to talk.

1089
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:10,458
Where's Yun-jung?

1090
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,251
Start talking.

1091
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,126
Tell us now.

1092
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:15,334
I'll never tell you, shithead.

1093
01:01:15,501 --> 01:01:18,083
Crazy ass, you think this is a joke?

1094
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:19,084
Hold him down.

1095
01:01:19,084 --> 01:01:19,834
Okay.

1096
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:25,667
I said, talk.

1097
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:30,459
Hell yeah.

1098
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:32,333
What're you gonna do with that?

1099
01:01:32,334 --> 01:01:33,417
I don't know.

1100
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:36,834
Start talking now.

1101
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:39,333
What're you poking me with?

1102
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:40,916
I won't tell you either, asshole.

1103
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:42,959
Let's use words.

1104
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:46,500
Words? He's freaking vicious and ignorant.

1105
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:47,875
I'm freaking ignorant.

1106
01:01:47,876 --> 01:01:50,126
I can stick this all the way up to your mouth.

1107
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:55,250
I won't tell you a thing, shithead.

1108
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:57,626
Crazy ass.

1109
01:01:58,542 --> 01:01:59,876
Then die.

1110
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:03,417
Hurry up.

1111
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:06,501
Which way? Talk now.

1112
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:09,000
- Hurry up.
- Talk!

1113
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:10,209
This way.

1114
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:15,751
We have a situation at Hegang.
We need to go now.

1115
01:02:15,876 --> 01:02:16,459
What?

1116
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,084
Gun-ho was taken.

1117
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:20,042
Everyone, up!

1118
01:02:20,043 --> 01:02:22,251
Get out now. Hurry up!

1119
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:32,667
Is this the right place?

1120
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:38,834
Is this the right key?

1121
01:02:42,834 --> 01:02:43,792
Go up.

1122
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:50,458
I'll go upstairs.

1123
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:51,334
Okay.

1124
01:03:37,334 --> 01:03:38,251
Mister.

1125
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:39,501
Please save me.

1126
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:40,917
Mister.

1127
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:44,042
I'm in here. Please help me.

1128
01:03:44,126 --> 01:03:45,584
Save me.

1129
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:47,376
Get us out of here.

1130
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:59,501
What is this place? What're you up to?

1131
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,501
We're getting eggs.

1132
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:06,334
We give the girls shots and get their eggs.

1133
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:09,709
Gi-jun.

1134
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:12,709
You need to come here now.

1135
01:04:12,834 --> 01:04:13,751
Okay.

1136
01:04:16,959 --> 01:04:18,417
Don't worry.

1137
01:04:18,959 --> 01:04:20,750
Even after we get their eggs out,

1138
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:23,001
you can still screw them.

1139
01:04:23,751 --> 01:04:25,542
Fucking asshole.

1140
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:33,958
This room?

1141
01:04:33,959 --> 01:04:36,375
No, all these rooms.

1142
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:37,084
What?

1143
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:38,501
Open this door.

1144
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:56,042
She's burning up.

1145
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:00,125
Isn't this blood?

1146
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:01,126
Blood?

1147
01:05:04,459 --> 01:05:05,417
Shit.

1148
01:05:05,959 --> 01:05:07,251
What do we do?

1149
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:08,666
Let's take her to the hospital.

1150
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:10,250
What about the other girls?

1151
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:11,750
Let's take her to the hospital first.

1152
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:14,167
Let's come back with the police.

1153
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:16,167
Be careful.

1154
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:20,251
Let's go.

1155
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:29,501
Hello, shitface.

1156
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:37,334
Head!

1157
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:42,584
Gi-jun, go.

1158
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:44,167
Hurry and go.

1159
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:46,126
I'll hurry back.

1160
01:05:47,251 --> 01:05:48,292
Don't come near.

1161
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:49,709
Get back!

1162
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:55,959
Get back!

1163
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:00,667
Get back!

1164
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:03,584
What?

1165
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:05,584
Wait here.

1166
01:06:07,334 --> 01:06:08,292
Oh no.

1167
01:06:09,584 --> 01:06:10,459
Head!

1168
01:06:22,084 --> 01:06:23,459
You stay put.

1169
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:27,792
Get him.

1170
01:06:30,834 --> 01:06:31,834
Hee-yeol!

1171
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:37,334
Where are you going, fucker?

1172
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:41,917
Gi-jun!

1173
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:43,459
Who are you?

1174
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,501
The police.

1175
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,792
Can I see your badge?

1176
01:06:57,042 --> 01:06:59,292
You shouldn't play cop.

1177
01:07:01,042 --> 01:07:02,209
Fucker.

1178
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:15,334
This fucker can take it pretty well.

1179
01:07:35,209 --> 01:07:36,251
Get up.

1180
01:07:36,459 --> 01:07:38,126
Get up, bitch.

1181
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:49,459
Police?

1182
01:07:50,542 --> 01:07:52,126
Motherfucker.

1183
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:14,917
Gi-jun.

1184
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:49,542
Gi-jun.

1185
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,125
Get up.

1186
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:52,084
Gi-jun.

1187
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,251
Hee-yeol.

1188
01:08:59,459 --> 01:09:01,917
Something's dripping down my face.

1189
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:04,750
Your head's bleeding a lot.

1190
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:06,209
I knew it.

1191
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:08,750
It feels really hot.

1192
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:11,417
I think they extract organs here.

1193
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,209
Do something.

1194
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:27,667
You go!

1195
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:44,209
Be quiet.

1196
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:47,084
It freaking hurts.

1197
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:53,084
My shoulders hurt.

1198
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:01,626
Where are our jackets?

1199
01:10:02,126 --> 01:10:05,792
It's all gone. No wallet and no phone.

1200
01:10:07,459 --> 01:10:08,625
Let's get out of here for now.

1201
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:10,376
Okay. No buttons either.

1202
01:10:41,334 --> 01:10:42,417
Was that you?

1203
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:09,917
Gi-jun.

1204
01:11:13,042 --> 01:11:14,709
Go!

1205
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:21,459
Run, run!

1206
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:23,792
Run!

1207
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:27,501
Get them!

1208
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,792
It's a dead end.

1209
01:11:38,834 --> 01:11:40,209
Stop right there.

1210
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:03,584
Go.

1211
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,751
Shit!

1212
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,541
Police station.

1213
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:46,209
- Police station!
- We're almost there.

1214
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:58,001
We're safe.

1215
01:12:58,126 --> 01:13:00,708
Fuckers. Go get the girls. Now!

1216
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:01,917
Hurry!

1217
01:13:02,459 --> 01:13:04,541
Where are they going?

1218
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:06,375
Are they going back to get the girls?

1219
01:13:06,376 --> 01:13:08,042
Let's go report them.

1220
01:13:11,376 --> 01:13:12,251
Hello.

1221
01:13:12,334 --> 01:13:13,625
How may I help you?

1222
01:13:13,626 --> 01:13:17,041
There are girls locked up
in an abandoned building.

1223
01:13:17,042 --> 01:13:17,876
An abandoned building?

1224
01:13:17,877 --> 01:13:19,666
I don't know exactly where it is.

1225
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:21,541
It's within a 5 minute running distance.

1226
01:13:21,542 --> 01:13:23,791
Come with us. We can explain.

1227
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:24,667
Let's go.

1228
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:26,583
First, let me see your IDs, please.

1229
01:13:26,584 --> 01:13:29,291
Pardon? They took our wallets and phones.

1230
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:32,416
I have to see your IDs first.
It's part of the process.

1231
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:35,625
Can't you just look up our resident number?

1232
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:37,251
I need your photo IDs.

1233
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:40,291
If we don't go now, I don't know
what's gonna happen to the girls.

1234
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:42,500
- We must go now.
- He's right.

1235
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,083
We have to follow the process.

1236
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:45,958
Is the process more important than
a person's life?

1237
01:13:45,959 --> 01:13:46,792
Look.

1238
01:13:47,042 --> 01:13:49,334
Because of the process, we can save people.

1239
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:52,500
Fucking police. Fuck you.

1240
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:53,292
Fuck you?

1241
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:55,333
- Gi-jun.
- Come on!

1242
01:13:55,334 --> 01:13:57,458
Are you gonna be responsible
if something happens to those girls?

1243
01:13:57,459 --> 01:13:59,125
Huh? Are you?

1244
01:13:59,126 --> 01:14:00,750
You punks.

1245
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:01,542
We're sorry.

1246
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:02,501
Let's go.

1247
01:14:02,502 --> 01:14:03,791
You two, stop right there.

1248
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,833
- Stop and do what?
- Gi-jun.

1249
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:07,375
- Stop it.
- You're gonna shoot us?

1250
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:08,001
Yes, I am.

1251
01:14:08,002 --> 01:14:09,291
Shoot me then.

1252
01:14:09,292 --> 01:14:10,709
- I will shoot.
- Shoot me.

1253
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,126
What's this?

1254
01:14:26,251 --> 01:14:27,417
"3 Missed Calls"

1255
01:14:35,959 --> 01:14:38,000
Why're they handcuffed?

1256
01:14:38,001 --> 01:14:39,833
They didn't have IDs.

1257
01:14:39,834 --> 01:14:42,042
And they made a scene at the police station.

1258
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:46,916
They're Police University students.
Please let them go.

1259
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:48,542
Please show me your ID.

1260
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:52,209
I'm Prof. Yang Sung-ii at Police University.

1261
01:14:55,126 --> 01:14:57,791
Sir, girls are locked up in
an abandoned building.

1262
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:58,584
What?

1263
01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:00,959
Someone's retrieving their eggs.

1264
01:15:07,126 --> 01:15:08,542
Where's this abandoned building?

1265
01:15:10,042 --> 01:15:14,416
In 2007, I caught an egg broker and
saw that ovulation drug for the first time.

1266
01:15:14,417 --> 01:15:17,333
A healthy woman normally
produces one egg per month.

1267
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:20,541
With this drug, she can produce up to 20 eggs.

1268
01:15:20,542 --> 01:15:25,750
Egg brokers connect infertile couples and
egg donors for a fee.

1269
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:27,041
Listening to your story,

1270
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:29,666
I think some criminal organization kidnaps and
locks up high school girls

1271
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:33,001
and periodically retrieves their eggs,
like in an egg farm.

1272
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:40,876
Sir, this is the place.

1273
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:49,792
They're gone.

1274
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:51,834
They were locked up here.

1275
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:55,251
She had severe bleeding and a high fever.

1276
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:09,667
This isn't something that
a patrol division can handle.

1277
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:13,167
Let me ask someone from RIU,
the Regional Investigation Unit.

1278
01:16:14,959 --> 01:16:17,458
Will they start the investigation today?

1279
01:16:17,459 --> 01:16:19,501
No, not that fast.

1280
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:20,792
Pardon?

1281
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:24,083
Then when can they start?

1282
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:26,916
They have their own schedules.

1283
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,875
Internal investigation alone will take 2 weeks.

1284
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,001
2 weeks.

1285
01:16:30,959 --> 01:16:35,750
But you said the most crucial factor
in kidnapping cases is time.

1286
01:16:35,751 --> 01:16:40,416
That's correct, but there are
other lives to save also.

1287
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:43,626
Every life is important.

1288
01:16:44,459 --> 01:16:47,916
Is there any unit that can start sooner?

1289
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:50,333
There's something called
intelligence-based investigation.

1290
01:16:50,334 --> 01:16:54,166
Special Investigation Unit and RIU
usually handle them.

1291
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:57,917
But SIU is busier than RIU right now.

1292
01:17:00,584 --> 01:17:04,250
Then can we look for them ourselves?

1293
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:05,042
That's right.

1294
01:17:05,043 --> 01:17:07,541
They couldn't have taken
all the girls too far away.

1295
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:11,333
I understand how you feel
but there's nothing we can do.

1296
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:12,375
Go back to school.

1297
01:17:12,376 --> 01:17:13,459
Prof. Yang!

1298
01:17:18,376 --> 01:17:20,584
They were younger than us.

1299
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:23,083
They were kidnapped and locked up.

1300
01:17:23,084 --> 01:17:24,334
You kids.

1301
01:17:25,209 --> 01:17:26,959
You're not police officers.

1302
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:29,041
You're still students.

1303
01:17:29,042 --> 01:17:30,667
Even if we're students,

1304
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:33,125
we witnessed the crime and have evidence.

1305
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:35,041
Why can't we do anything?

1306
01:17:35,042 --> 01:17:37,167
Don't get smart with me.

1307
01:17:38,917 --> 01:17:42,084
Let the adults take it from here.

1308
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:43,584
Got it?

1309
01:17:44,584 --> 01:17:46,334
- You punks.
- Prof. Yang.

1310
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:50,126
I know the license plate number
of the kidnapper's van.

1311
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:55,083
It's an old green Starex. 37GU8338.

1312
01:17:55,084 --> 01:17:57,708
I know you can run a plate number
with one phone call.

1313
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:59,291
Please, just this once.

1314
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:00,876
Please, I beg you.

1315
01:18:10,209 --> 01:18:11,501
Hi, Do-chul.

1316
01:18:11,917 --> 01:18:14,042
I know. It's been 10 years.

1317
01:18:14,334 --> 01:18:15,666
I need a favor.

1318
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:17,542
Will you run a plate number?

1319
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:20,292
37GU...

1320
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,334
- 8338.
- Let's go.

1321
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:25,792
Yes, now.

1322
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:28,209
Is that right?

1323
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:31,626
Thanks. Bye.

1324
01:18:40,084 --> 01:18:41,626
It's an unregistered vehicle.

1325
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:45,626
They have to manually search the CCTV tapes.

1326
01:18:46,376 --> 01:18:50,166
The case's detective has to file
an official request to the CCTV center.

1327
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:54,291
RIU will be done with their case in a month.

1328
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:55,375
They'll be able to help then.

1329
01:18:55,376 --> 01:18:56,334
One...

1330
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:00,501
How can we wait a month?

1331
01:19:00,834 --> 01:19:03,666
Then should they throw out everything
and work on our case?

1332
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:06,042
That's not what I meant.

1333
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,667
I'm done talking.

1334
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:15,791
So you two go back to school and study hard.

1335
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,458
If you get involved with this again,
you'll be expelled.

1336
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:19,501
Got it?

1337
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:21,626
Yes, sir.

1338
01:19:22,126 --> 01:19:25,416
You kids. Always answer loud and clear!

1339
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:26,751
Yes, sir!

1340
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:04,876
Hee-yeol.

1341
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:05,709
Yeah.

1342
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:11,001
Are they gonna be okay?

1343
01:20:18,334 --> 01:20:20,292
The upside is that

1344
01:20:20,834 --> 01:20:23,000
we still have time to save them.

1345
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:24,959
Hey, where's my jacket?

1346
01:20:26,751 --> 01:20:29,500
Geez, what's wrong with you two?

1347
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:32,958
Something came up.
I'll buy you a jacket. Sorry.

1348
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:34,292
Well...

1349
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:36,459
Forget it.

1350
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:38,917
Did you go to the hospital?

1351
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,792
We just got back.

1352
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:45,417
Hey, your father still
works for the force, right?

1353
01:20:45,626 --> 01:20:48,875
You bet. The chief loves my father.

1354
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:52,334
Then he might have friends
at Gangnam CCTV center, right?

1355
01:20:52,792 --> 01:20:55,125
We know someone there too.

1356
01:20:55,126 --> 01:20:55,709
Who?

1357
01:20:55,792 --> 01:20:57,042
Who?

1358
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:58,583
I'm too afraid to say it.

1359
01:20:58,584 --> 01:21:00,584
Just spit it out.

1360
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:02,542
No, I can't.

1361
01:21:02,543 --> 01:21:03,792
Just tell us.

1362
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:05,376
No.

1363
01:21:05,377 --> 01:21:08,042
- Why not?
- Say it. Come on, loser.

1364
01:21:09,584 --> 01:21:10,833
Medusa.

1365
01:21:10,834 --> 01:21:13,458
You were playing phone games
during working hours?

1366
01:21:13,459 --> 01:21:14,875
How dare you?

1367
01:21:14,876 --> 01:21:15,958
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1368
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:17,125
I bet you're sorry.

1369
01:21:17,126 --> 01:21:19,126
We're sorry, ma'am.

1370
01:21:24,042 --> 01:21:25,042
Hello?

1371
01:21:28,209 --> 01:21:31,292
Hello? Good afternoon, ma'am.

1372
01:21:31,626 --> 01:21:34,750
This is cadet Gi-jun Park, Class of 2017.

1373
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:35,667
Hi.

1374
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:38,333
Long time no see.

1375
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:40,958
How have you been, ma'am?

1376
01:21:40,959 --> 01:21:42,791
I'm good.

1377
01:21:42,792 --> 01:21:44,125
What do you want?

1378
01:21:44,126 --> 01:21:48,375
My friend was the victim in
a hit-and-run in Gangnam.

1379
01:21:48,376 --> 01:21:52,333
Police said the driver's car was unregistered.

1380
01:21:52,334 --> 01:21:55,708
We'll have to manually search
all the CCTV tapes to find that.

1381
01:21:55,709 --> 01:21:56,584
It'll take days.

1382
01:21:56,585 --> 01:22:01,084
Yes, I heard about that.

1383
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:05,376
It's really important. Just this once, please.

1384
01:22:08,251 --> 01:22:09,209
All right.

1385
01:22:09,751 --> 01:22:11,166
License plate number, make and model.

1386
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:13,875
Time and place of the crime, last place seen.

1387
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:15,041
Text me all those.

1388
01:22:15,042 --> 01:22:15,501
Yes, ma'am.

1389
01:22:15,502 --> 01:22:19,458
I'll find it no matter what.
You catch the driver.

1390
01:22:19,459 --> 01:22:20,292
Yes, ma'am.

1391
01:22:20,293 --> 01:22:23,041
So there'll be no other victims. Got it?

1392
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:25,792
Thank you, ma'am.

1393
01:22:26,834 --> 01:22:29,459
- She said okay?
- This is great.

1394
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:32,583
Now, we should prepare.

1395
01:22:32,584 --> 01:22:34,209
So now.

1396
01:22:34,542 --> 01:22:36,459
We get weapons.

1397
01:22:41,334 --> 01:22:43,584
Two police batons.

1398
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:46,042
Two handcuffs.

1399
01:22:47,001 --> 01:22:48,542
Two Taser guns.

1400
01:22:49,084 --> 01:22:50,542
Two protective gear.

1401
01:22:51,376 --> 01:22:52,334
Is this correct?

1402
01:22:54,626 --> 01:22:57,666
Is this everything Prof. Yang asked for?

1403
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,876
I think so.

1404
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:01,126
Yup.

1405
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:03,583
Return them by next Wednesday
in original condition.

1406
01:23:03,584 --> 01:23:04,459
Wednesday.

1407
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:05,834
- Yes.
- Okay, Wednesday.

1408
01:23:06,626 --> 01:23:07,417
Thank you.

1409
01:23:07,584 --> 01:23:08,417
Thank you.

1410
01:23:12,126 --> 01:23:13,084
I'll shoot.

1411
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:14,459
Be careful.

1412
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:17,459
I did it.

1413
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:18,376
You did?

1414
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:19,167
Wow!

1415
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,375
We can definitely catch him with this.

1416
01:23:20,376 --> 01:23:21,542
Heck ya.

1417
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,251
We gotta get them out.

1418
01:23:36,501 --> 01:23:37,626
Nasty.

1419
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:39,834
We can't use this.

1420
01:23:39,959 --> 01:23:41,334
Fuck.

1421
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,751
Forget the eggs. Get her organs.

1422
01:23:44,876 --> 01:23:47,041
Please don't kill me.

1423
01:23:47,042 --> 01:23:49,667
Where are you taking her?

1424
01:23:51,334 --> 01:23:52,708
Please save her.

1425
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:53,876
Please I beg you.

1426
01:23:54,001 --> 01:23:55,542
Please.

1427
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:04,584
Hey.

1428
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:06,792
Are you okay?

1429
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:10,167
Oh my goodness.

1430
01:24:20,126 --> 01:24:21,042
96

1431
01:24:21,126 --> 01:24:22,126
97

1432
01:24:22,251 --> 01:24:23,209
98

1433
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:24,667
99

1434
01:24:25,501 --> 01:24:26,542
99

1435
01:24:27,376 --> 01:24:28,625
- Asshole.
- One more.

1436
01:24:28,626 --> 01:24:29,626
99

1437
01:24:29,751 --> 01:24:31,042
Just one more.

1438
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:32,709
99

1439
01:24:32,751 --> 01:24:34,417
Last one.

1440
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:36,251
99

1441
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:39,376
96

1442
01:24:39,959 --> 01:24:41,126
97

1443
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:43,001
98

1444
01:24:43,167 --> 01:24:44,542
99

1445
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:46,126
99

1446
01:24:46,834 --> 01:24:49,584
Nope, cancel that. 98.

1447
01:24:55,542 --> 01:24:59,958
One, two, three, four five, six, seven.

1448
01:24:59,959 --> 01:25:02,001
Eight, nine, ten.

1449
01:25:03,126 --> 01:25:04,542
They're dead meat.

1450
01:25:05,709 --> 01:25:09,917
Intelligence-based investigation starts
without receiving a crime report.

1451
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:17,459
Police are first to recognize the crime
and start investigating.

1452
01:26:04,417 --> 01:26:05,709
Let's grill them all.

1453
01:26:35,501 --> 01:26:37,041
It's Medusa.

1454
01:26:37,042 --> 01:26:38,459
I almost shit myself.

1455
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:39,501
Hello, ma'am.

1456
01:26:39,502 --> 01:26:41,250
What took you so long to answer?

1457
01:26:41,251 --> 01:26:42,500
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1458
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,000
The van you're looking for.

1459
01:26:44,001 --> 01:26:46,291
It's 37GU8338, correct?

1460
01:26:46,292 --> 01:26:47,209
Yes, ma'am.

1461
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:49,875
On Nov. 13th and 27th at 5 pm,

1462
01:26:49,876 --> 01:26:53,667
I have it turning left on Kyodae junction
toward Seoul Arts Center.

1463
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:56,001
I also found something interesting.

1464
01:26:56,584 --> 01:26:59,416
On both times,
there's another Starex behind it.

1465
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:02,125
With H Fertility Clinic logo on it.

1466
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:04,333
It might be connected so do your research.

1467
01:27:04,334 --> 01:27:06,751
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

1468
01:27:13,959 --> 01:27:15,334
"H Fertility Clinic"

1469
01:27:17,751 --> 01:27:19,459
"Closed 2nd and 4th Sundays"

1470
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:21,751
I think this is where they retrieve eggs.

1471
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:24,584
2nd Sunday is...

1472
01:27:25,209 --> 01:27:26,667
Two days from now.

1473
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:31,626
You think we can do this?

1474
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:36,917
You cracking up?

1475
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:38,876
You scared, wuss?

1476
01:27:38,959 --> 01:27:40,501
Shut up, idiot.

1477
01:27:43,626 --> 01:27:45,001
The girls.

1478
01:27:46,376 --> 01:27:48,042
Let's go save them.

1479
01:27:49,709 --> 01:27:51,334
Stay alive until then.

1480
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:03,750
Ms. Yun-jung is a college student,
majoring in English.

1481
01:28:03,751 --> 01:28:07,166
To support herself financially,

1482
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:09,375
she has donated her eggs.

1483
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:13,500
I've met her myself.
She's healthy and outgoing.

1484
01:28:13,501 --> 01:28:14,916
She's tall too.

1485
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:16,833
She's beautiful.

1486
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:17,709
Yes, she is.

1487
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:27,417
The cost of IVF with Ms. Lee's eggs
will be about $80,000.

1488
01:28:29,084 --> 01:28:31,001
Anything for our baby.

1489
01:28:31,334 --> 01:28:35,959
I promise you
the most beautiful baby in the world.

1490
01:28:36,459 --> 01:28:37,709
Have faith in me.

1491
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:40,875
This, this, this, this.

1492
01:28:40,876 --> 01:28:43,209
This, this, this. Get them in the van.

1493
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:54,584
Young police officers, be ambitious.

1494
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:09,001
There they come, 8338.

1495
01:29:15,251 --> 01:29:17,709
Hurry and get off the van. Fucking bitches.

1496
01:29:22,209 --> 01:29:24,459
That's $20,000. I put in a bit more.

1497
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:25,959
Thank you.

1498
01:30:01,042 --> 01:30:02,792
To the operating room, please.

1499
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:16,958
When are you gonna play next?

1500
01:30:16,959 --> 01:30:19,376
I don't know. If you got money...

1501
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:21,959
What's that noise?

1502
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:39,292
Those fuckers are back.

1503
01:30:53,876 --> 01:30:56,167
That's a lot of thugs.

1504
01:30:58,084 --> 01:30:59,126
Let's go.

1505
01:32:49,876 --> 01:32:51,376
Gi-jun, you okay?

1506
01:32:51,417 --> 01:32:52,876
Geez. You scared me.

1507
01:32:53,251 --> 01:32:54,417
You okay?

1508
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:57,501
What happened to your hand?

1509
01:32:58,001 --> 01:32:59,375
I'm sorry.

1510
01:32:59,376 --> 01:33:00,917
Bitch.

1511
01:33:01,792 --> 01:33:03,083
I think it's fractured.

1512
01:33:03,084 --> 01:33:04,751
Dumbass.

1513
01:33:05,334 --> 01:33:07,084
What about your Taser guns?

1514
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:09,083
They're smashed.

1515
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:10,042
What?

1516
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:12,167
We're screwed.

1517
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:14,376
What do we do?

1518
01:33:15,792 --> 01:33:19,001
Before they wake up, let's go up.

1519
01:33:19,959 --> 01:33:21,001
Get up.

1520
01:33:31,834 --> 01:33:33,167
Doors opening.

1521
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:36,459
What the...

1522
01:33:39,376 --> 01:33:40,584
Excuse me.

1523
01:33:41,751 --> 01:33:44,001
Which floor is the operating room?

1524
01:33:44,209 --> 01:33:45,417
The 8th floor.

1525
01:33:46,292 --> 01:33:47,417
Thank you.

1526
01:33:53,751 --> 01:33:55,334
My nose freaking hurts.

1527
01:33:56,917 --> 01:33:58,167
Shit.

1528
01:34:21,376 --> 01:34:22,417
Gi-jun!

1529
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,709
Lots of eggs.

1530
01:34:31,459 --> 01:34:32,751
I don't know about this.

1531
01:34:59,334 --> 01:35:00,833
Let's cuff him.

1532
01:35:00,834 --> 01:35:01,834
Okay. You go first.

1533
01:35:01,835 --> 01:35:03,125
No, you go first.

1534
01:35:03,126 --> 01:35:04,791
No, you hit him with the baton first.

1535
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:05,959
Fuckers.

1536
01:35:08,084 --> 01:35:10,626
You're gonna die today, fucking bitches.

1537
01:35:25,334 --> 01:35:26,376
What the heck?

1538
01:36:17,584 --> 01:36:18,792
Let's gang up on him.

1539
01:36:18,876 --> 01:36:20,042
All right!

1540
01:36:42,834 --> 01:36:44,334
Cuff his legs first.

1541
01:36:50,542 --> 01:36:52,084
We're okay now.

1542
01:36:55,084 --> 01:36:56,375
Where's the operating room?

1543
01:36:56,376 --> 01:36:57,500
The operating room?

1544
01:36:57,501 --> 01:36:58,625
I think it's that way.

1545
01:36:58,626 --> 01:36:59,667
Let's go.

1546
01:37:08,334 --> 01:37:10,751
We almost made a big mistake.
We gotta return these.

1547
01:37:11,751 --> 01:37:12,667
Come on.

1548
01:37:13,834 --> 01:37:15,834
Enjoy your right to remain silent.

1549
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:21,625
Stop right there!

1550
01:37:21,626 --> 01:37:22,626
Who the hell are you?

1551
01:37:22,627 --> 01:37:24,251
Don't you know what stop means?

1552
01:37:24,792 --> 01:37:25,792
Good job.

1553
01:37:26,959 --> 01:37:28,166
Is she okay?

1554
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:30,042
She was put under general anesthesia.

1555
01:37:31,001 --> 01:37:32,584
Where are the other girls?

1556
01:37:39,917 --> 01:37:41,042
Hee-yeol?

1557
01:37:41,251 --> 01:37:42,209
Yeah.

1558
01:37:44,042 --> 01:37:45,541
Let's call Prof. Yang.

1559
01:37:45,542 --> 01:37:46,751
Prof. Yang...

1560
01:37:47,709 --> 01:37:49,167
Then we'll get expelled.

1561
01:37:51,042 --> 01:37:52,667
We have no choice.

1562
01:37:53,417 --> 01:37:54,584
Let's call him.

1563
01:37:57,292 --> 01:37:58,459
Okay, let's do it.

1564
01:38:22,834 --> 01:38:23,792
One.

1565
01:38:24,126 --> 01:38:25,084
Two.

1566
01:38:25,501 --> 01:38:26,459
Three.

1567
01:38:26,876 --> 01:38:27,876
Four.

1568
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:44,251
You two have no regrets even
if you get expelled, correct?

1569
01:38:46,959 --> 01:38:49,459
I believe I've done the right thing, sir.

1570
01:38:50,751 --> 01:38:52,209
Same here, sir.

1571
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:54,167
But Prof. Yang.

1572
01:38:55,084 --> 01:38:56,834
I still want to go to class, sir.

1573
01:38:57,042 --> 01:38:58,001
Why?

1574
01:38:58,251 --> 01:39:00,917
I thought we learned useless stuff in school.

1575
01:39:01,459 --> 01:39:02,876
But it wasn't true.

1576
01:39:03,251 --> 01:39:04,876
I want to learn more.

1577
01:39:05,959 --> 01:39:07,208
How about you, Gi-jun?

1578
01:39:07,209 --> 01:39:09,209
I'd like to stay also, sir.

1579
01:39:11,126 --> 01:39:12,167
I...

1580
01:39:13,834 --> 01:39:15,042
want...

1581
01:39:17,167 --> 01:39:18,584
to be a police officer.

1582
01:39:27,334 --> 01:39:32,916
If we don't take disciplinary action,
it would set a bad precedent.

1583
01:39:32,917 --> 01:39:36,375
But in the end,
our students did the right thing.

1584
01:39:36,376 --> 01:39:38,791
They saved over 20 kidnap victims.

1585
01:39:38,792 --> 01:39:41,375
They should be rewarded not punished.

1586
01:39:41,376 --> 01:39:43,125
Are you out of your mind?

1587
01:39:43,126 --> 01:39:46,250
How could you reward someone
who committed violence?

1588
01:39:46,251 --> 01:39:49,333
Strictly speaking, they've committed a crime.

1589
01:39:49,334 --> 01:39:51,750
Are you crazy calling our students criminals?

1590
01:39:51,751 --> 01:39:55,125
Then everyone should
go catch criminals instead of studying.

1591
01:39:55,126 --> 01:39:57,875
I think you're out of line.

1592
01:39:57,876 --> 01:40:00,250
They're not just regular students.

1593
01:40:00,251 --> 01:40:02,041
They're the future police officers.

1594
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:05,542
- They're not officers yet.
- Expel them.

1595
01:40:11,167 --> 01:40:13,084
Prof. Yang, what do you think?

1596
01:40:17,084 --> 01:40:19,792
Someone talked about setting a bad precedent.

1597
01:40:20,501 --> 01:40:22,625
If Gi-jun Park and Hee-yeol Kang

1598
01:40:22,626 --> 01:40:25,959
neglected the kidnap victims and
stayed in school,

1599
01:40:26,459 --> 01:40:29,417
I think that would be a worse precedent.

1600
01:40:29,584 --> 01:40:35,916
We taught them to be the first ones
to respond to civilians in danger.

1601
01:40:35,917 --> 01:40:42,417
But if they've neglected victims
so they wouldn't be punished,

1602
01:40:43,209 --> 01:40:47,917
I think that's more dishonorable,
and they should be expelled.

1603
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:52,833
Personally, I was envious of the two.

1604
01:40:52,834 --> 01:40:56,167
We once had that kind of passion.

1605
01:40:57,667 --> 01:41:03,251
We weren't afraid of punishment
when it came to catching bad guys.

1606
01:41:03,667 --> 01:41:07,751
I think we've taught them well.

1607
01:41:08,459 --> 01:41:11,916
They're not like those selfish kids.

1608
01:41:11,917 --> 01:41:15,709
For others, they'd run all night.

1609
01:41:15,959 --> 01:41:19,167
It makes me happy that we've taught them well.

1610
01:41:21,751 --> 01:41:25,417
So what do you want to do with them?

1611
01:41:35,292 --> 01:41:37,751
You punks should study with such enthusiasm.

1612
01:41:54,459 --> 01:41:56,751
Gi-jun Park. Hee-yeol Kang.

1613
01:41:58,542 --> 01:42:02,459
You two should've been expelled.

1614
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:10,001
But President showed mercy,
and you're to be held back a year.

1615
01:42:13,417 --> 01:42:14,459
Don't like it?

1616
01:42:16,251 --> 01:42:18,167
I like it, sir.

1617
01:42:18,584 --> 01:42:20,167
Thank you, sir.

1618
01:42:21,126 --> 01:42:24,542
And you have 500 detention hours.

1619
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:30,376
Since you'll be in school one more year,
you should have enough time.

1620
01:42:31,876 --> 01:42:32,834
Don't like it?

1621
01:42:32,835 --> 01:42:33,958
It's great, sir.

1622
01:42:33,959 --> 01:42:36,666
You kids don't sound sincere.

1623
01:42:36,667 --> 01:42:38,417
It's really great, sir.

1624
01:42:39,001 --> 01:42:39,917
Attention.

1625
01:43:02,667 --> 01:43:03,667
Thank you, sir.

1626
01:43:03,668 --> 01:43:05,458
This is not the end

1627

Hee-yeol.

1633
01:44:24,209 --> 01:44:25,084
Yeah.

1634
01:44:25,085 --> 01:44:27,166
How many hours of detention do we have left?

1635
01:44:27,167 --> 01:44:28,667
473 hours

1636
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:30,459
and 20 minutes.

1637
01:44:33,459 --> 01:44:35,791
Not bad. Let's finish it up and
go to an Internet café.

1638
01:44:35,792 --> 01:44:37,042
Let's go shoot guns.

1639
01:44:38,584 --> 01:44:39,917
What're you looking at?

1640
01:44:39,959 --> 01:44:40,959
That.

1641
01:44:54,751 --> 01:44:55,751
Hi.

1642
01:45:12,042 --> 01:45:13,542
Thank you.

1643
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:17,167
Oh, this wind.

1644

You're welcome.

1645
01:45:34,584 --> 01:45:36,209
You've survived.

1646
01:45:42,584 --> 01:45:43,626
Are you okay?

1647
01:45:44,042 --> 01:45:45,417
Let me see if she's okay.

1648
01:45:47,751 --> 01:45:49,792
Would you like a campus tour?

1649
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:50,959
Come on.

1650
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,792
You look so good.
