20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,479
The Long Ballad

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,980
Episode 23

22
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:56,639
Stop!

23
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,118
Who are you?

24
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,558
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:06,279
I newly joined the Battalion of Slaves.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,918
And I happened to pass by.

27
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,760
Passing by?

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,879
What about the guards on the ground?

29
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,878
I have no idea.

30
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,279
When I passed by,
they have been sleeping.

31
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,319
What a glib tongue.

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,119
If you don't tell the
truth, I'll cut your tongue.

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,920
I...

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,840
Aunt Alir, why are you here?

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,519
He is a slave from Khatun's tent?

36
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,839
Aunt Alir, thankfully
you're here in time.

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,279
Otherwise he won't be fine.

38
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,638
By the way, I didn't
do anything to him.

39
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,680
Please let Khatun forgive us.

40
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,960
Don't wander around anymore.

41
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:21,599
Get up!

42
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,039
Get up!

43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,559
What's wrong with you?

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,599
Please forgive us, General.

45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,679
We're too tired for night shift.

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,919
Somehow we fell asleep.

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,078
Such an important prisoner.

48
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,079
How dare you fall asleep?

49
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,798
Guards here. Take them away.

50
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,599
Yes.

51
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,399
General!

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,279
It won't happen anymore.

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,779
Send more people guard here day and night.

54
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,119
General!

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
Yes.

56
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,999
Greetings to Khatun.

57
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,320
We're both women from Central Plains.

58
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,040
I prefer to be called Princess Yicheng.

59
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,480
How did Princess know...

60
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,520
How did I know that you're a woman?

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,279
People here might think we all look similar.

62
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,040
I used to be like you,
loving wearing men's clothes.

63
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,480
How can't I know it?

64
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:38,639
Good insight, Princess.

65
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:44,200
Alir, fetch some medicine
and food to this...

66
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,599
I still don't know how to call you.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,839
I'm Li Changge.

68
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:52,519
Do it.

69
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,279
Why do you want to save General Luo?

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,998
You misunderstood, Princess.

71
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,759
I'm new in the capital and I got lost.

72
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,678
That's why I went to the prison by mistake.

73
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,398
No need to hoke me with these lies.

74
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,519
If I wanted to do harm to you,

75
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,920
I wouldn't have let Alir
take the risk saving you.

76
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,319
Princess wants to know why
I'd like to save General Luo.

77
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,839
But I wonder why Princess saved me.

78
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:26,640
You must have suffered a lot.

79
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:34,240
Otherwise such a young girl
like you wouldn't be so alert.

80
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,200
But if you want to survive here,

81
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,399
it's good to be wary.

82
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,118
I helped you, because
I don't want to see

83
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:50,679
you dying here with General Luo.

84
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,678
Princess is the daughter of one emperor of Sui.

85
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,678
You married here for Sui.

86
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,920
Though many years passed,

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,480
your reputation for righteousness

88
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:03,079
is still well known in Central Plains.

89
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,200
And people highly praise it.

90
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,480
Changge, Sui doesn't exist anymore.

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Now we're just people from Central Plains.

92
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,800
Sorry for my slip of the tongue.

93
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,880
Princess.

94
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,760
General Luo has been fighting in
the battle
with my father for years.

95
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:27,119
He helped my whole family a lot.

96
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,080
I've respected General Luo since little.

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,678
And I take him as an elder of my family.

98
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,080
That's why I took the risk.

99
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,240
Your father worked for Luo Yi before?

100
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,679
Yes.

101
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,119
No wonder. I see.

102
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:47,199
When Sui still existed, General
has been staying in Zhuojun

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,719
and protecting the territory.

104
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,520
He's a loyal, brave and righteous hero.

105
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,320
I admire him.

106
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,718
But I can't do anything.

107
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:01,040
To protect you, I've
taken a huge risk.

108
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:05,519
Princess, I don't understand.

109
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,999
It's the first time that we meet.

110
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,920
Why are you so frank to me?

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,719
Because we two are so similar.

112
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,958
I also heard about what you did in Weishui.

113
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,639
If I guessed it correctly,

114
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,480
it's you that saved the emperor of Tang, right?

115
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,440
On behalf of people in Central Plains,

116
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,720
I have to kowtow to express my gratitude.

117
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,760
You protected Central Plains from wars.

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,399
Please get up, Princess.

119
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,559
Princess, that's too much.

120
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
In that case,

121
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,759
how about us thinking of a
way to get General Luo out?

122
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,800
That's an impossible task.

123
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,759
Khan's Tent is like a huge prison.

124
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,158
No one can escape.

125
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,919
But you're Khatun.

126
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,200
What you can do is surely
much more than what I can.

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,278
You don't understand.

128
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,439
Though I'm Khatun,

129
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:06,239
I'm only a woman they don't
believe from Central Plains.

130
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,480
Great Khan...

131
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,158
Never mind.

132
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:13,959
But...

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,480
We're both homeless people

134
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,719
wandering here in the poor northern region.

135
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,839
Changge, please try to survive.

136
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,159
Alir, put those things there.

137
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,079
I'm back.

138
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,039
I dare not go too far away,
so I just walked around.

139
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,440
Thankfully there are some dry wood.

140
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,880
What are you drawing?

141
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,158
Nothing.

142
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,240
I'm boring. Just draw it for fun.

143
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Is this... your family?

144
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,158
You miss your parents, Xiao Wu?

145
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,559
No.

146
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,679
I don't even remember what they look like.

147
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,480
How can I miss them?

148
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,759
Then they must look like this.

149
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,838
So ugly.

150
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,120
Just like you now.

151
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,559
You're same.

152
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,439
I don't survive depending on my appearance.

153
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,078
But you do.

154
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,078
You're so ugly.

155
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,959
I'm afraid you can't get married in the future.

156
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,360
You're coughing again.

157
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,959
I'm not cold. Cover yourself.

158
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,838
You're my little brother.

159
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,879
You don't need to pretend
in front of your sister.

160
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,839
Understand?

161
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,279
Xiao Wu.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,440
Missing someone isn't a humiliating thing.

163
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,399
I also miss my father very much.

164
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
Tell you a secret.

165
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,839
I even felt angry with him before.

166
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,919
Why?

167
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,600
Because he's always very busy.

168
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,480
He didn't even have time to meet me.

169
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,759
But now I can understand.

170
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,519
Though he's my own father,

171
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,680
he's more than my own father.

172
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,560
It's in famine everywhere now.

173
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,319
He must be working very hard.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,880
Don't know whether he has a good rest or not.

175
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,559
Why doesn't he look for you?

176
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,079
He must have looked for me.

177
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,039
But it's such a big world.

178
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,560
How can he know where I am?

179
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,758
Therefore, as long as
we hold on together,

180
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,399
when we're in Luoyang, things will go well.

181
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,159
At that time, I'll take you to
Changan and meet my father.

182
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,600
Chang... Changan?

183
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,480
That's my hometown.

184
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,879
When we're in Changan, we won't
need to wander from place to place

185
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,479
or fight against anyone for food.

186
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,879
You can eat whatever you want.

187
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,600
And I'll teach you

188
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,158
literature, etiquette, music and poems.

189
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,439
If you really want to learn martial arts,

190
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,880
I'll find famous teachers
for you and teach you that.

191
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,600
If you like freedom,

192
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,638
I can take you to see

193
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,279
the beautiful scenery and
great mountains in Changan.

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,440
As long as we're in Luoyang,

195
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,639
things will be better.

196
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,319
<i>I hope one day,</i>

197
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,800
<i>it'll be a peaceful and harmony world.</i>

198
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,000
It's been long

199
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
since I saw someone from hometown.

200
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:30,759
Princess.

201
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,079
Do you miss your home?

202
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,480
I can't go back anymore.

203
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
But you still have the chance,

204
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,680
have the chance to go back to Central Plains,

205
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,000
to our hometown.

206
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
If it happens one day,

207
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,920
please look at it for me

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,399
whether it changes or not.

209
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,719
OK. I promise.

210
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,759
Kid. Don't take impulsive actions.

211
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,880
Being alive matters most.

212
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,840
Thank you.

213
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
You can go back. See you.

214
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,239
Why are you here?

215
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,599
Great Khan asked me to
accompany him in his tent.

216
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,800
I can't walk around at will.

217
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,398
I can only come out secretly to meet you.

218
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,158
Don't take the risk coming here anymore.

219
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:40,959
I'm fine.

220
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,430
Someone changed the dressing for you.

221
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,519
It's Princess Yicheng.

222
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,079
She also sent me some food and medicines.

223
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,199
Changge, in the capital,
don't trust anyone except me,

224
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,230
even though she's from Central Plains.

225
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,040
OK.

226
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,560
Kurultai is coming soon.

227
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,679
I'll try to get you out of here.

228
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,399
Sun. General Luo Yi is here.

229
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,718
Li Changge, are you crazy?

230
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:13,679
That's General Luo.

231
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,078
I can't just leave him here.

232
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:15,999
You want to get Luo Yi out.

233
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,599
Impossible.

234
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,880
I still have to take the risk.

235
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,719
I hope at that time,

236
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,519
you won't stop me.

237
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,720
Li Changge.

238
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,240
Please stay alive.

239
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,399
I have to go.

240
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,519
Great!

241
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,158
Who's that?

242
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,718
I can't believe you don't know her.

243
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,799
She's Lady Jinse.

244
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,479
Great Khan cherishes her most.

245
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,280
Really?

246
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,000
She's so pretty.

247
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,880
Great Khan.

248
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,520
How dare you!

249
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,079
My tent isn't a place that you
can come and go at your will.

250
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,198
I haven't been here for only three months.

251
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,919
And now I can't even enter it?

252
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,240
Great Khan is indeed fickle.

253
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:35,438
In Dingxiang, how is it going with
the orphans and widows of Sui?

254
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,199
Please be assured, Great Khan.

255
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,639
Empress Xiao and the little Prince of Sui

256
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,919
are now well-behaved after my 'guidance'.

257
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,000
They wouldn't dare cause any trouble.

258
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:49,759
Great Khan.

259
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,479
When Khan Shule picked up
Empress Xiao and little prince,

260
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,799
he promised to treat them well.

261
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,400
But now...

262
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,480
Now I'm Great Khan,

263
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,000
not Shule.

264
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,839
Are you trying to restrain me with Shule's rule?

265
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,879
I dare not do that.

266
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,559
However, Great Khan,
if you do it in this way,

267
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,679
I'm afraid you'll lose the
support of people in Dingxiang.

268
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,359
There are only tens of
thousand people in Dingxiang.

269
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,119
And they're all from Central Plains.

270
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,880
It doesn't matter whether I lose it or not.

271
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:31,438
I think you're worrying about
losing Shule's son's support.

272
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,239
No like that.

273
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,318
I haven't blamed Sher for what he did

274
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:38,438
during this expedition to the south.

275
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,520
I haven't looked into it.

276
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:45,480
On behalf of Sher, I have
to express my thankfulness.

277
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,480
I had better go,

278
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,480
so I won't disturb you, Great Khan.

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,078
Great Khan.

280
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,558
After this journey, I'm so tired.

281
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,359
Look, there's only one goblet.

282
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,160
Yicheng.

283
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:08,559
Haven't you heard Lady
Jinse saying that she's thirsty?

284
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:15,519
I've heard that.

285
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,558
Then come and serve her the wine.

286
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,120
Do you want me to serve?

287
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:34,719
Thank you, Khantun.

288
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
Why are you just standing there?

289
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,600
Look at her.

290
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,640
Useless!

291
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,399
You can't even serve the wine.

292
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,959
So useless.

293
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,999
You look so unpleasant again.

294
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
It was you that sent her to me.

295
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,160
Now you look like this.

296
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,119
Get out!

297
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,679
Yes, Great Khan. See you.

298
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,079
You're so pretty.

299
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,119
Khatun.

300
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,799
That's too offensive.

301
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,359
Khatun, are you okay?

302
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,798
Please don't mind.

303
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,198
You'll always be the only Khatun.

304
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,120
Sorry for what you saw, General Shixin.

305
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:06,679
I'm fine.

306
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,438
Go and get Changge here.

307
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,719
And don't get noticed by others.

308
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,400
Khatun.

309
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,480
Who hurt you?

310
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,199
Was that Great Khan?

311
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,280
I didn't ask you to come
here caring about my stuff.

312
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,958
How can Great Khan hurt you?

313
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,280
You're Khatun.

314
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,079
I'll help you to save General Luo.

315
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,080
Why?

316
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,919
I've had it enough.

317
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,079
I've had it enough staying here.

318
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,120
People only know I'm a princess of Sui.

319
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,359
And I marry here out of my willingness

320
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,319
for the righteousness and peace.

321
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,760
But no one knows what I've
been going through all these years.

322
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,280
Thirty years ago,

323
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I got married with Khan Qimin.

324
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,880
When he died,

325
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,360
his son Khan Shibi married me.

326
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,120
Then it was Khan Shule.

327
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,640
At last it's Yanli.

328
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,919
I'm also a woman from Central Plains.

329
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
I've been receiving education since little.

330
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,319
But now I'm so disgraced like this.

331
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,199
I can't even meet my own son.

332
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,919
You have a son?

333
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,480
You've seen him.

334
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,919
Sher.

335
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,839
Sher?

336
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,000
But I can only be Yanli's Khatun,

337
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,760
not my son's mother.

338
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,558
Great Khan forced Sher to
swear that if he meets me secretly,

339
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,959
I'd be cursed by the God of
Sirius and I'd die immediately.

340
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,719
I didn't expect Sher's your son.

341
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:56,959
Changge.

342
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,679
Sher's a good boy.

343
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,079
Though he's a little
impatient, he won't harm you.

344
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,039
Listen,

345
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,439
Kurultai is a great festival here.

346
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,359
Leaders from all tribes will come.

347
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,359
Today Great Khan will host those aristocrats.

348
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,958
After Kurultai,
tomorrow morning,

349
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,798
Great Khan will go hunting with these leaders.

350
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,679
At that time...

351
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,679
Why were you in Khatun's tent?

352
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,280
I didn't really expect that.

353
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,799
You enchanted Ashile Sun and Mimi Guli.

354
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,640
Now you even enchanted Khatun.

355
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,798
You really seek by all
means to achieve your plan.

356
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,279
What are you trying to say?

357
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,718
You try in every way to get close to her.

358
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,038
What do you want?

359
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,679
Sher, she misses you very much.

360
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,558
You're not qualified to mention her.

361
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,439
She's living a hard life now.

362
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,799
Shut up!

363
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,360
You... You have no Adam's apple.

364
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,919
You're a woman!

365
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,760
<i>Don't worry. I'm fine.</i>

366
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,480
<i>I'll return to Eagle Division safely.</i>

367
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,198
That's why.

368
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:54,198
I was still wondering how Mimi
can fall in love with a man so soon

369
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:57,119
and why Ashile Sun cares about a man so much.

370
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,439
What do you want?

371
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:02,119
Now you're under my control.

372
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,479
If you don't want Ashile
Sun to see your dead body,

373
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,958
just do as what I tell you.

374
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:09,399
Khatun told me you're a good
boy and you won't hurt people.

375
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,200
Shut up.

376
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,240
What I do has nothing to do with her.

377
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,879
If Great Khan knew Ashile Sun brought a woman

378
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,439
who knows shooting arrows
and has set my Wolf Division up.

379
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,399
What would Great Khan do to Ashile Sun?

380
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,240
What do you want?

381
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,079
You have to do exactly as what I tell you.

382
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,079
Drink it.

383
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,919
Come here.

384
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,640
Open your mouth.

385
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,119
Let me fill this up.

386
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,640
Drink. Cheers.

387
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,400
Fill it up. Cheers.

388
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,280
Cheers.

389
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,039
Come. Drink it.

390
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Fill it up.

391
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,079
Kurultai is a great festival here.

392
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,678
You're all invited here.

393
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:50,839
Allow me to toast to you.

394
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,599
Thank you, Great Khan.

395
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,480
Thank you, Great Khan.

396
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,319
Why hasn't Sher arrived?

397
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,558
Great Khan.

398
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,119
Young Khan must have been delayed by something.

399
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,920
I'll have a check.

400
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:43,839
I'm late.

401
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,039
I'm sorry for that, Uncle Khan.

402
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,120
You're so late.

403
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,719
Have a seat.

404
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,279
Why are you hiding?

405
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,559
Serve the wine for me.

406
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:43,879
One more.

407
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,560
Sher.

408
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,360
The slave beside you looks really pretty.

409
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:58,880
Uncle Khan,

410
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,359
she's just a slave from my tent.

411
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,759
She's nothing special.

412
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,480
Today I asked her to dress up

413
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,799
and liven things up here in Kurultai.

414
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,199
You're really in the mood.

415
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,199
But this salve... I think
she looks quiet familiar.

416
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:19,679
In our tent,

417
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:22,880
when did such a beauty join here?

418
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,798
Can't our pretty Khatun satisfy you, Khan?

419
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,319
What kind of beauty do you want?

420
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:39,719
Look at you, you're
not making any sense.

421
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,959
Was I wrong?

422
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:45,079
Khan can't be too greedy.

423
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,400
Khatun was the prettiest lady of Central Plains.

424
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,679
Khatun, am I right?

425
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:01,798
Enough.

426
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,159
You're not qualified to talk here.

427
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,160
Everyone, cheers.

428
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,239
You.

429
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:23,160
Go serve the wine for my brother Sun.

430
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:31,039
Can't you understand?

431
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,440
What do you think?

432
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,799
Don't you think it tastes better?

433
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,079
Father, I want to toast to
you and ask for an award.

434
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,159
What do you want, Sun?

435
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Just go ahead.

436
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:03,799
Except for people from Khatun's
tent, I can give you anything.

437
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,039
Today is Kurultai.

438
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,679
I want to duel according to the custom.

439
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,120
I want to challenge Sher.

440
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,760
If I win,

441
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,439
give me the slave next to him as a reward.

442
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,798
You two were both taught by Khan since little.

443
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,279
In our Ashile Tribe,

444
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,399
you two's martial arts
are among the first-class.

445
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,640
If you two duel, that
must be spectacular.

446
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,679
Sher. Do you want to accept that?

447
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,600
Uncle Khan,

448
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,000
since Tegin Sun invited
me, how can I refuse?

449
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:08,119
But I also want some reward.

450
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,199
What do you want?

451
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,279
Since Ashile Sun wants the slave from my tent,

452
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,640
if I win the duel,

453
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,880
I want the female slave
called Mimi Guli in your tent.

454
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,440
<i>Mimi.</i>

455
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,960
Good!

456
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,639
You two duel for the beauty.

457
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,919
That's a much-told tale of our Ashile Tribe.

458
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,720
Do it!

459
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:27,519
I remember when you two were
little, you fought for a little wolf.

460
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,400
After so many years, you
two will fight for women.

461
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,959
You two are like the lions.

462
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,318
And you're the glory of Ashile Tribe.

463
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:43,680
Warriors always fight for the honor and belief.

464
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,239
Try your best!

465
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,479
Things happened years
before haven't been solved yet.

466
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:08,359
Good!

467
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,549
Give up now.

468
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,719
Otherwise you'd be disgraced.

469
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,960
That can't happen.

470
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,320
Do you know how she suffered at my place?

471
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,359
Enough!

472
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,478
Stop!

473
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,278
You are brothers!

474
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:46,120
Shut up!

475
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,200
Sher!

476
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:21,799
You lost!

477
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,680
Great!

478
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,599
Wonderful!

479
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,439
Bravo!

480
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,599
Great!

481
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:53,680
Bravo! Marvelous!

00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,479
Let's go.

512
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:45,079
Sher.

513
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,518
You're Khan Shule's son.

514
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,360
You're the real descendant
of the God of Sirius here.

515
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,599
But today on the Kurultai,
in front of all leaders,

516
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,199
you were defeated by Sun.

517
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,160
Do you want a man from
Central Plains to govern here?

518
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,319
Uncle Khan.

519
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,519
Great Khan.

520
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,479
I don't want to leave the capital.

521
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,919
Why?

522
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,279
I belong here, so I
want to follow my master.

523
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,079
I don't want to change to another master.

524
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,159
Have you heard that? Ashile Sun,

525
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,039
even a slave doesn't want to follow you.

526
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,160
Shut up.

527
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,440
You're too wordy as a loser.

528
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:01,160
Sun. I'll let people tie her up and
send her to your Eagle Division.

529
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,200
No need.

530
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,600
This female slave has made me sick.

531
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,239
Just let her stay with Sher.

00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,159
<i>♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫</i>

547
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,439
<i>♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫</i>

548
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,009
<i>♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫</i>

549
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,769

<i>♫ It turns into eternity. ♫</i>

551
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:45,680
<i>♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫</i>

552
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:54,089
<i>♫ There's always a moment ♫</i>

553
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:59,719
<i>♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫</i>

554
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,329
<i>♫ There's always solicitude ♫</i>

555
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:09,639
<i>♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫</i>

556
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,199
<i>♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫</i>

557
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,569
<i>♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫</i>

558
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:19,049

<i>♫ layer after layer. ♫</i>

560
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,919
<i>♫ It turns into eternity. ♫</i>

561
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,330
<i>♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫</i>

562
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,500
<i>♫ It is sleepless. ♫</i>
