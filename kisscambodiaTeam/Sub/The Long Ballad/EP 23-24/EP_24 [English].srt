<i>♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫</i>

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
<i>♫ No bough to alight. ♫</i>

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
<i>♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫</i>

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
<i>♫ Never give in. ♫</i>

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,950
<i>♫ Forget about the youth. ♫</i>

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,919
<i>♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫</i>

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,789

00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,840

19

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,479
The Long Ballad

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,098
Episode 24

22
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:44,818
I'll ask some people to tie her up

23
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,500
and send to your Eagle Division.

24
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:50,540
No need.

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,940
I'm fed up with this servant.

26
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:02,580
Just let her take care of Sher.

27
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,180
I think they make a perfect match.

28
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,020
Okay.

29
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,739
I'll do as you want.

30
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,580
What else do you want?

31
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,099
I'll give them to you.

32
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,139
I heard Monan pay a jar of
good wine as tribute for Kurultai.

33
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,699
I want to drink a cup of that wine.

34
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,418
The whole jar is here.

35
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,698
You can drink as you want.

36
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:40,220
Let's drink together.

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,660
More.

38
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,939
Good!

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,059
Men in our tribe should be as bold as you.

40
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,300
You'll show your heroic
posture at tomorrow's hunting.

41
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,300
I'm injured.

42
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,259
If I can't hunt as many
preys as last year tomorrow,

43
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,539
I choose to be absent.

44
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,138
Sun.

45
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,778
That doesn't sound like you.

46
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:52,339
I won enough cheers in today's battle.

47
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,779
Let's give Sher a chance to win cheers tomorrow.

48
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,419
My injury today is more serious than yours.

49
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,259
I'm afraid you want to see me lose face again.

50
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,099
Uncle Khan.

51
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,379
No matter how serious my injury is,

52
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,379
I want to win my honor back from Ashile Sun.

53
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,619
If he doesn't go hunting,
even if I win, so what?

54
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,099
Look at you two brothers.

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,219
As an old saying goes in Central Plains,

56
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,260
why does the destiny make
Zhou Yu confront Zhuge Liang?

57
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,618
Okay.

58
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:34,540
You can stay here and cure
your injury in tomorrow's hunting.

59
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,578
Thank you, Father Khan.

60
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,820
Thank you, Uncle Khan.

61
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:42,339
Then I shall leave now.

62
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,939
What are Ashile Sun and you conspiring?

63
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,699
You misunderstand me.

64
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,139
I simply don't want to
go back to Eagle Division.

65
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,778
You think I'll believe you?

66
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,778
He suddenly said he wouldn't go hunting.

67
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,579
This is not like him.

68
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,058
What do you want?

69
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,859
I don't care whether you believe me.

70
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,819
I refused Ashile Sun in front
of Great Khan, that's true.

71
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,458
About what he is thinking,
you can go and ask him.

72
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:33,779
How would I know?

73
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,338
I don't know what you are doing.

74
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,499
If you don't want to go with him,
why didn't you say that earlier?

75
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,539
You don't want to go with him.

76
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,660
But maybe Mimi would like to go with me.

77
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,260
So you're anxious now.

78
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:49,338
You don't need to feel regretful.

79
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:52,980
I can guarantee Mimi would
rather die than come back.

80
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:05,100
Sun.

81
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,339
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,460
You abandoned the chance
and trapped yourself here.

83
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,339
How do you want to save Luo Yi?

84
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,940
How do you know that?

85
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,859
I've promised to someone.

86
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:26,778
I can't tell you.

87
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,220
Who did you promise to?

88
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:31,820
Princess Yicheng?

89
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:37,739
You can't save Luo
Yi, neither can Yicheng.

90
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:42,459
Stop overestimating your ability, okay?

91
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,660
Why didn't you go hunting?

92
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,738
Sher has noticed there's
something wrong with you.

93
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,420
I don't care what your plan is.

94
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,820
I hope you won't hinder my action.

95
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
How's your injury?

96
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,179
I won't die.

97
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:12,739
Sun.

98
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,660
Thank you so much.

99
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,859
If you really want to thank me,

100
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,899
listen to me this time.

101
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:21,859
Okay?

102
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,459
Just go.

103
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,140
Don't get involved in it.

104
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,579
Go back to Eagle Division.

105
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,779
I want to cure my injury.

106
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,058
Tegin, how did you...

107
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,978
Arrange a few people to guard here.

108
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:29,429
What do you want to do?

109
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,019
No matter what happened in
Khan's tent, report to me immediately.

110
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,658
Especially, the
news about Luo Yi.

111
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,539
Yes, Tegin.

112
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:41,299
Make sure Sher knows I have
gone back to Eagle Division.

113
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,099
I understand.

114
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,858
Go!

115
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,019
Go!

116
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,820
Go!

117
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,619
Xiao Wu.

118
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,418
Let's set off early, so that
we can arrive at Luoyang early.

119
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,820
When we arrive there, I'll find
you a doctor to cure your disease.

120
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,259
I have no disease.

121
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,900
I just want to have more sleep.

122
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:34,739
Our food is running out.

123
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,858
It's okay.

124
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,058
We're getting closer to Luoyang.

125
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,978
Didn't you notice it?

126
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:45,899
The villagers in near villages
are fleeing from famine.

127
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,659
If we keep going, I'm afraid
we can't ask for food anymore.

128
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,259
Xiao Wu.

129
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,019
There is always a way out.

130
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,780
We can make it to Luoyang.

131
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,299
Xiao Wu.

132
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,139
Xiao Wu.

133
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,298
I thought you have became thinner recently.

134
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,699
Well, I have flatulence.

135
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,538
I have no appetite these days.

136
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,619
You can eat the two pancakes for today.

137
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:18,779
Sister.

138
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,978
You really don't know how to lie.

139
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,419
How could you survive in this world?

140
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:37,659
Right, there's some way out.

141
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,218
I'm here.

142
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:43,539
I won't let you starve to death.

143
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,779
Khan.

144
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,339
The division leaders who will go
hunting are waiting for you outside.

145
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,179
Let's go.

146
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,858
Let's go!

147
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,659
Yes, Khan!

148
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,978
Young Khan.

149
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,858
Ashile Sun went back to cure his injury.

150
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:35,058
Until Great Khan led a
team to go hunting just now,

151
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,380
he hadn't been back.

152
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,658
Maybe you thought too much this time.

153
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,619
Think too much?

154
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,139
His action is always beyond my imagination.

155
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,738
Keep an eye on him.

156
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:47,858
Yes, sir.

157
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:49,379
Young Khan.

158
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,978
What's wrong?

159
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,579
Great Khan's ferghana horse ran out somehow.

160
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,619
The guards are catching it.

161
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,019
It happened after Great Khan has left?

162
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,618
Right.

163
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:00,059
Maybe it noticed Great Khan
left, so it wanted to go with him.

164
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,058
That's not right.

165
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,099
What a coincidence.

166
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,058
Tuluk, let's go.

167
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:08,299
Go to the servant camp and
check if Li Changge is there.

168
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,779
Where's that new-coming slave?

169
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,699
Siqin.

170
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,538
He worked with us this morning.

171
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,020
But he's gone later.

172
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:36,899
She's not here.

173
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:39,820
I knew she did it.

174
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,899
When did she disappear?

175
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,939
They said she worked with them in the morning.

176
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,058
Did she sneak when the guards didn't notice her?

177
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:47,978
It's not right.

178
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:49,580
What on earth happened?

179
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,780
What will they do when Great Khan is not here?

180
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,259
All soldiers are guarding...

181
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,618
Luo Yi.

182
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:00,539
Hurry up! Go to Luo Yi's prison.

183
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,900
Alir.

184
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,618
Alir.

185
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:20,779
Why do you go to fetch water so early?

186
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,618
Khatun has just fetched water two days ago.

187
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:24,099
You used it up so soon?

188
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,940
Toruch.

189
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,140
Khatun.

190
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,459
Stand up.

191
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,539
Thank you, Khatun.

192
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,298
I don't like soda water in Khan's Tent.

193
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:11,139
So I always ask Alir to
fetch river water for me.

194
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,260
You know this.

195
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:16,579
I took a shower for yesterday's Kurultai.

196
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,379
So I used up all water.

197
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,699
Did I cause you any trouble?

198
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,858
Not at all.

199
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:25,099
If you want water, I
can just let Alir go.

200
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,739
Go ahead.

201
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:37,419
Well,

202
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,940
I heard you had a baby girl recently.

203
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,658
I made a pair of shoes for the baby.

204
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,899
When you are off-duty, come and fetch it.

205
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,858
And take some cheese back.

206
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:50,380
Hand it out to our brothers.

207
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,379
Thank you so much.

208
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,819
You are so generous.

209
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,058
You treat our brothers so nicely.

210
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,659
It's just a gift for you.

211
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,700
Just as we expected.

212
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:24,380
Li Changge.

213
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:28,460
If no one helps her, she
can't take that old man away.

214
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,418
Besides, that old man is seriously injured.

215
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:32,499
They can't go far.

216
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,499
Tuluk.

217
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,058
Ask the guards to search Luo
Yi now instead of the horse.

218
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:36,859
Yes, sir.

219
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:38,419
Wait.

220
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,579
Ask a team of Wolf Division to come here.

221
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,218
What's wrong, Young Khan?

222
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:45,218
I think they haven't gone far.

223
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:46,459
Let's separate to chase them.

224
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,340
Yes, sir.

225
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,339
I didn't imagine I can escape there.

226
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,420
Even if I die today, I won't regret!

227
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:31,499
Come on.

228
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,139
Mr. Luo.

229
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,739
Your leg is bleeding again.

230
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,420
It's okay.

231
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:01,180
Alir.

232
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:07,859
Thank you for what you've done
for us regardless of the risk of life.

233
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,379
Madam.

234
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,540
Thank you so much.

235
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,699
Thank you.

236
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,139
Changge.

237
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,618
Did you contact Luo Shiba?

238
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:51,260
Last night, I played that ballad as you said.

239
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,179
Okay.

240
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,978
She should be around here.

241
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:11,179
Mr. Luo, I'll help you walk.

242
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,980
Okay.

243
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,458
Tegin.

244
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:35,779
You're right.

245
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,659
Luo Yi was gone.

246
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,978
All the guards in the capital went to chase him.

247
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,338
Where's Sher?

248
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:41,779
He's also chasing them.

249
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,978
Lead a team and follow me.

250
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:44,939
Yes, sir.

251
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,780
What are you doing?

252
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,899
Is Luo Yi's escape related to you?

253
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,299
It wasn't.

254
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,458
But it is related to me now.

255
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,818
Sun.

256
00:19:58,819 --> 00:19:59,899
You can't go.

257
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,578
He is Great Khan's most hated person.

258
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,059
He's also a General of Tang.

259
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,060
If you get involved in
this, it'll be hard to explain.

260
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:21,539
Wait.

261
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:05,739
Why is there blood?

262
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:10,899
Take her away.

263
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,700
Yes, sir.

264
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:13,299
Go!

265
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,100
Go!

266
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:21,098
Go!

267
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:22,059
Go!

268
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,860
Go!

269
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,180
Go!

270
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:00,738
Young Khan.

271
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:04,738
When Alir came back just now,
Uncle Lei found blood on her water cart.

272
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,939
Alir has already been arrested by them.

273
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,900
<i>It's Alir?</i>

274
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:11,020
<i>Did mom...</i>

275
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:12,978
Take Alir to my tent.

276
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,338
Don't let others know it.

277
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,458
Yes, sir.

278
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,779
Which way did Luo Yi escape?

279
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,899
They went east along the
populus euphratica forest.

280
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,459
Uncle Lei went to chase them along the track.

281
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:25,458
Follow me.

282
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:27,578
Let's stop them from the south.

283
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,499
Yes, sir!

284
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,300
Go!

285
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,460
Go!

286
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,579
Nice horse.

287
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,259
I spend my whole life on the battlefield.

288
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,739
I won't regret since I can tame the horse.

289
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,059
General Luo.

290
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,578
I'll give you a swift horse.

291
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:03,379
Okay.

292
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,099
Luo Shiba.

293
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,179
Changge.

294
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,179
What did I say just now?

295
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,019
Shiba, good girl.

296
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,180
Stand up.

297
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:22,939
Let's go.

298
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:26,899
Go!

299
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:35,539
What a huge team!

300
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,780
They think so much of me.

301
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,860
Go!

302
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:45,499
Go!

303
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,860
Go!

304
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,539
Shiba.

305
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,858
Take General Luo away.

306
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,379
I'll draw their attention.

307
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,699
Someone must have helped us in this rescue.

308
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:15,938
Yongning can't simulate me.

309
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:18,419
It's a bad idea.

310
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,499
Then I'll leave with Shiba.

311
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,539
After we've drawn them
away, we'll pick you up.

312
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,500
No need.

313
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,260
It seems to be the god's will.

314
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:29,180
I may die here today.

315
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,619
For Tang,

316
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:40,259
I'm a rebel.

317
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,019
For tribes, I'm an enemy that
should be killed hundreds of times.

318
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,738
Where can I escape to?

319
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:49,060
Maybe I'll die today.

320
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:50,858
I choose here to die.

321
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:51,779
You won't.

322
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,578
General.

323
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:54,780
No matter what happened, I'll save you.

324
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,218
How lucky I am!

325
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,179
I survived until today.

326
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,299
And I got a chance to atone.

327
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,419
Even if we die here today, we
won't leave you here and run away.

328
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,219
Luo Shiba, listen to my order.

329
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,699
From now on, Li Changge
will be your new master.

330
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,140
Why don't you kneel down to her?

331
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,579
You want to betray me order?

332
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,060
Stop.

333
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,098
General Luo, what are you doing?

334
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,218
Princess Yongning.

335
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,979
Luo Shiba will work for you from now on.

336
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,419
18 Cavalrymen of Yanyun
have risked their lives with me.

337
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,938
Now there's only Shiba left.

338
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:00,938
I watched her grow up.

339
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:03,978
Instead of master and servant,
we're more like father and daughter.

340
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:04,900
Today,

341
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,260
I'll entrust my daughter to you.

342
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,699
General.

343
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,938
You're still young.

344
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:25,420
Don't die for me.

345
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,858
I spend my whole life fighting.

346
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,819
If I can die on the battlefield
as I wish, I would be very happy.

347
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,339
Luo Shiba.

348
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:38,738
This is my last order for you.

349
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:40,140
Take Changge away.

350
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,300
General.

351
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,260
Go!

352
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,420
Stop them.

353
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,060
Go!

354
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,940
Chase them!

355
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,180
Go!

356
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,379
Go!

357
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,618
Go!

358
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:27,299
Go!

359
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,100
Go!

360
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,100
Stop.

361
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,698
I didn't imagine you have some ability.

362
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:48,499
You can take a disabled man
out
of the capital which is full of guards.

363
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,659
Shiba.

364
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,980
Your kung fu is better than mine.

365
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,180
Once you get the chance, just escape.

366
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,060
Escape?

367
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,539
No one can escape.

368
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,779
I want to catch you alive.

369
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,819
Catch them!

370
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,299
Go!

371
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,100
Go!

372
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,259
Stop.

373
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:15,139
Stop.

374
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,179
They're my people.

375
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,739
I want to take them away.

376
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,339
Why do you think you're
qualified to talk to me like that?

377
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:53,098
Tegin Sun.

378
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,020
Calm down.

379
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,860
Sher.

380
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:05,739
You'll never know what fighting for guard is.

381
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,098
I like to destroy the
thing you like most.

382
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,618
I want you to have a taste of
beloved one being taken away.

383
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:16,419
You're just a coward that
doesn't want to grow up.

384
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,659
Say that again.

385
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,579
Coward!

386
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,499
You should understand.

387
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,978
It's something between us.

388
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:27,579
It has nothing to do with them.

389
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:34,938
Tegin Sun.

390
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,578
Wolf Division can let Li Changge go.

391
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:39,459
Let's take a step back, okay?

392
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:49,459
Let's go.

393
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,978
Young Khan, don't chase them.

394
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:06,779
Let me go!

395
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:14,939
Didn't you hear what that asshole said to me?

396
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,059
Calm down, Young Khan.

397
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,060
Maybe this time, we can inflict
heavy losses on Eagle Division.

398
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,979
In Great Khan's opinion, that servant is yours.

399
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,539
She let Luo Yi go.
It means she is a
spy that colludes with Eagle Division.

400
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,938
It also means she shot the arrow
at
Weihe River to save Li Shimin on purpose.

401
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:36,420
But now, this spy was
saved by Ashile Sun.

402
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,779
Only if you let her go,
you won't get involved in it.

403
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,939
And we can get Eagle Division involved.

404
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:46,659
You can't get a better bargain.

405
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Bargain?

406
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,458
I don't want to take advantage of Ashile Sun.

407
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:52,859
He's my prey.

408
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,978
I want to win him.

409
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:58,019
I want all divisions to
admit I'm better than him.

410
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,739
Have you ever thought for Princess?

411
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:03,419
It's my duty to help you get
the kingship in all divisions.

412
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,859
As long as we can wipe out
Eagle Division for Princess,

413
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,500
I'll do whatever it takes.

414
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,259
Sun.

415
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,060
Stop.

416
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,060
Sun!

417
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:33,499
Stop.

418
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,900
What do you want now?

419
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,419
Sher has seen Eagle Division pick me up.

420
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,698
What can we do then?

421
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:45,060
I'll consider about it.

422
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,899
You don't need to care about it.

423
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,180
Mu Jin?

424
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,019
Sun, I finally find you.

425
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,020
Why are you here?

426
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,179
You saved her?

427
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,980
Yes.

428
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,818
A letter delivered by the pigeon.

429
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,739
Have a look.

430
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:22,019
What happened?

431
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:24,660
Take her away.

432
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:26,779
What happened?

433
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,580
Don't ask so much.

434
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:29,738
Take her away.

435
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:30,899
No.

436
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,260
If I leave, what about you?

437
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,738
It's my own business.

438
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,059
You don't need to care about it.

439
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,059
But if I leave now, everyone
has seen you save me,

440
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,738
how would you explain it?

441
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:44,338
One should answer for what he did.

442
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:45,818
I won't leave like this.

443
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:48,540
If I leave, people in Eagle
Division will... Shut up!

444
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,858
Who do you think you are?

445
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:52,499
What do you think you can do?

446
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,098
You never belong to here.

447
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,860
No matter what happened in Eagle
Division,
it's none of your business!

448
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,139
Ashile Sun.

449
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,338
Don't you think you can
solve everything by yourself.

450
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,139
If you know things would go
like this, why would you save him?

451
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,858
Did you save Luo Yi?

452
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,379
What did I tell you?

453
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,459
Now Luo Yi died, and you
sacrificed Eagle Division and yourself!

454
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,339
Li Changge.

455
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,859
This is the result of your self-approbation.

456
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,658
I won't leave now.

457
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,580
You have caused me enough trouble.

458
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,219
From now on,

459
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:30,659
you have nothing to do with Eagle Division.

460
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,820
Go back to Central Plain.

461
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:38,100
Go away!

462
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,739
<i>♫ The heart gradually
responds, gradually revives, ♫</i>

463
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,178
<i>♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫</i>

464
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,138
Mu Jin!

465
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,579
Ask your soldiers to tie her
up and throw her to the border.

466
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,380
I...

467
00:34:57,004 --> 00:35:00,650
<i>♫ Entwist your figure, ♫</i>

468
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,580
- Counsellor.
- No need.

469
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,020
I can leave on my own.

470
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:15,164
<i>♫ The longing flows. ♫</i>

471
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,339
Go!

472
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,140
Go!

473
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,389
<i>♫ Which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫</i>

474
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,204
<i>♫ There's always solicitude ♫</i>

475
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:33,219
Didn't you hear what I said?

476
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,379
Follow her and send her back to Central Plain!

477
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:43,779
<i>♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫</i>

478
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,580
Go!

479
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:54,284
<i>♫ Layer after layer, it turns into eternity. ♫</i>

480
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,100
Shiba, just go.

481
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:46,820
Stand up.

482
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,059
No matter what General
Luo said, it won't work.

483
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,579
You don't need to regard
me as your master. You...

484
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,738
Yanyun Cavalrymen's rule,

485
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:59,138
after following one master,
we'll die rather than betray.

486
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,658
You can talk?

487
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:01,459
I can.

488
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,820
Then why didn't you talk before?

489
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:05,499
Because it's not necessary.

490
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:08,939
In all,

491
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,820
you don't need to regard
anyone as your master now.

492
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,458
You can leave now.

493
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:14,738
Leave?

494
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:15,539
Where can I go?

495
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:17,620
You can go wherever you want.

496
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,659
Do whatever you want to do.

497
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,539
You're free now.

498
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,979
No one can restrain you now.

499
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:24,779
Free?

500
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:29,779
Go!

501
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,500
Why are you here?

502
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:42,739
Are you afraid I won't leave?

503
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,659
According to Sun,
he is afraid of this.

504
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,779
Did you see the letter?

505
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,580
What?

506
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:53,819
Where did you get that letter?

507
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,819
It's from Khan's tent.

508
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,059
There's some pigeon blood on it.

509
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,179
It means it's urgent.

510
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,898
I didn't see the letter.

511
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:00,860
But there's something in it.

512
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:03,739
I saw it.

513
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:09,540
It's a pair of earrings.

514
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,219
Earrings?

515
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,899
Is any woman related to Sun in Khan's tent?

516
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,779
His mom!

517
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,699
His mom?

518
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:20,500
Isn't he an orphan?

519
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,378
She's his foster mother, called Alir.

520
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:28,299
If Alir didn't pick him and bring
him up when he was young,

521
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,259
he would have died.

522
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,300
For all these years,

523
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:34,539
Great Khan has been
asking Alir to work in his tent.

524
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,658
He wants Sun to be loyal to him.

525
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:38,620
No wonder Sun listens to Great Khan.

526
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:41,100
It's because of Alir.

527
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,339
Where're you going?

528
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,019
Mu Jin.

529
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,340
This is a trap.

530
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,459
If Sun goes back alone,
he'll be dangerous.

531
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,418
Now something must happen to Alir as well.

532
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,340
Just go!

533
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:03,059
Why are you here?

534
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,698
You said it.

535
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:04,779
I can go wherever I want.

536
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,820
I want to save Alir.

537
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,859
Call Eagle Division.

538
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,580
If we can't save her, we can just grab her.

539
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,500
Sher!

540
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,139
You're finally here.

541
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:50,539
Sher.

542
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,339
It's just something between us.

543
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,178
Don't let innocent people get involved.

544
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:54,979
Okay.

545
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,460
As long as you kneel down and apologize to me,

546
00:39:58,139 --> 00:39:59,580
maybe I won't kill her.

547
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,579
Sher, how dare you!

548
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,459
Of course I dare.

549
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:19,459
Now her life is depending on you.

550
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,020
Kneel or not, make your choice.

551
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:31,939
It seems you need some help.

552
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,059
You threaten me with a woman.

553
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,178
Sher.

554
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:56,779
You're a coward!

555
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,938
You!

556
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:58,860
If you're a real man,

557
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,218
come and fight with me.

558
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:02,540
Don't let me look down on you!

559
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,140
Tegin Sun.

560
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,378
A wise man submits to fate.

561
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,860
You're not qualified to
negotiate with Young Khan now.

562
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,300
Kneel or not?

563
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,379
Let my mom go.

564
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,299
Since you have kneeled down,
what about having a kowtow?

565
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,540
Entertain us.

566
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,420
What?

567
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:48,459
Your dignity is more
important than your mom's life?

568
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,279
<i>♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫</i>

569
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,759
<i>♫ gradually revives, ♫</i>

570
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,079
<i>♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫</i>

571
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,230
<i>♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫</i>

572
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,560
<i>♫ we expect an encounter. ♫</i>

573
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:36,039
<i>♫ Entwist your figure, ♫</i>

574
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,470
<i>♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫</i>

575
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,869
<i>♫ Before the daybreak, ♫</i>

576
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,359
<i>♫ through the obsession of love, ♫</i>

577
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,189
<i>♫ the longing flows. ♫</i>

578
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,559
<i>♫ There's always a moment ♫</i>

579
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,359
<i>♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫</i>

580
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,799
<i>♫ There's always solicitude ♫</i>

581
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,519
<i>♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫</i>

582
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,909
<i>♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫</i>

583
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,189
<i>♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫</i>

584
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,759
<i>♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫</i>

585
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,519
<i>♫ layer after layer. ♫</i>

586
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,559
<i>♫ It turns into eternity. ♫</i>

587
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,430
<i>♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫</i>

588
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,839
<i>♫ There's always a moment ♫</i>

589
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,469
<i>♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫</i>

590
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,079
<i>♫ There's always solicitude ♫</i>

591
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:53,389
<i>♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫</i>

592
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,949
<i>♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫</i>

593
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,319
<i>♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫</i>

594
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,799
<i>♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫</i>

595
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,669

596
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,669

597
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:14,080
<i>♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫</i>

598
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,250
<i>♫ It is sleepless. ♫</i>
