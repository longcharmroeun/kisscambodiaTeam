Hao Du sent a message,

00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,499
saying that Princess Yongning used Li Shisi as the alias name

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,459
and assisted the governor Gongsun Heng in Shuozhou

27

to protect the city from enemies' attack.

After Shuozhou was conquered,

Princess Yongning got caught by Ashile Tribe.

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,079
Like the pouch you embroidered?

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,378
That's the ugliest pouch I've ever seen.

59
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,099
With such level of embroidery,

60
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,979

From now on, she'll work with you.

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,218
Yesterday, didn't you say that she'd stay for only one day?

79
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,139
I'm in a good mood today.

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,378
Can't I keep her?

81
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:50,498
Surely you can.

82

But she can't know how to work, according to her appearance.

Tegin, the list of spoils in Shuozhou has been sorted.

105
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,428
Should I send it to Khan's Tent?

106
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:58,309
Let several reliable men send it.

107
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,310
Yes.

108
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,909
You're not gonna send it on your own?

109
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,029
It's such an achievement.

110
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,909
And you don't show your loyalty in front of Great Khan.

111
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,069
Since he's very suspicious, he might think you wanna betray him.

112
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,708
I used to let others send it.

113
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,109
If I go there myself this time, he will get suspicious.

114

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,310

- Just go.
 - I can be your military counselor.

Now you're bragging.

120
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,428
I mean. Who are you?

121
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,189
Are you making decisions in Eagle Division?

122
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,190
Stop driving a wedge between Sun and me.

123
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:44,709
You...

124
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:47,668
Your reason?

125
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,309
Since I work for you, and mainly assistant you,

126
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,870
I have to do something useful.

127
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,988
I'm good at strategies.

128
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:57,590
That Tegin brought me here must be out of that reason.

129
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,910
Please allow me to be your assistant.

130
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,069
My defeated opponent.

131
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,789
You can really brag.

132
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,828
Tell me, why should I use a stranger like you as my assistant.

133
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:14,590
Actually, I've been thinking about a question.

134
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,828
Great Khan let Eagle Division be the pioneer to attack Shuozhou.

135
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,589
However, the army that Tegin led was not for attacking a city.

136
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,029
Besides, you haven't fought against Tang before.

137
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,268
Therefore, Great Khan seemed not to care about the result.

138
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:32,790
What's worse, he might want you to lose.

139
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,790
Nonsense!

140
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,749
Go on.

141
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,948
It reminds me of what was like in Shuozhou that day.

142
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:44,469
Eagle Division and Bear Division hindered each other.

143
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,828
And you were even competing in public.

144
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,388
If Bear Division wasn't supported by someone,

145
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,668
it's hard for him to do that.

146
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,699
After all, you're the adopted son of Great Khan.

147
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,029
What exactly are you trying to say?

148
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,388
So I guessed it correctly.

149
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,268
Tegin's position in Ashile Tribe

150
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,150
is way less solid than what others think about.

151
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,309
But you're the adopted son of Great Khan.

152
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,149
And you have an army.

153
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,309
I don't believe you want to do nothing.

154
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,228
I'm loyal to Great Khan.

155
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,259
Great Khan also trusts me.

156
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,469
You don't need to incite between us two.

157
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,869
About your words, does Great Khan believe it?

158
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,750
Do Great Khan's nephews believe that?

159
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,910
How did you know these things?

160
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:28,950
So, do you think I'm qualified to be your assistant?

161
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,909
What's your requirement?

162
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,828
I'll be your military counselor, and can realize three wishes for you.

163
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,989
However, you can't do harm to Tang.

164
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,669
And you can't do ruthless things.

165
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,989
When I finish the three tasks, please let me leave here.

166
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,349
Okay.

167
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,589
Sun!

168
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,068
From now on, you're no longer a slave.

169
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,989
But I won't help you, either.

170
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,989
You need to depend on your ability to survive here in Eagle Division.

171
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,589
When you finished three wishes, I would set you free.

172
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,590
After that,

173
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,270
if you still want to take revenge on me,

174
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,670
I'd wait for you.

175
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,989
Have you decided your three wishes?

176
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,469
Not yet.

177
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,708
But it's like making wishes.

178
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:23,388
The time when I decide it, you should realize it for me.

179
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,989
Okay. I accept that.

180
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,268
But just as what I said, you can't do harm to Tang.

181
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,230
And you can't do ruthless things.

182
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,789
These days, I'll depend on my own ability

183
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,868
to get a firm foothold here in Eagle Division.

184
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,828
Please wait for my performance, Tegin.

185
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:39,829
OK. Deal.

186
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,030
Unlock her iron chain.

187
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,010
[Weaving Workshop of Western Suburb]

188
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,989
Let's pause and have a rest.

189
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,909
You must feel tired.

190
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,029
I bought some pastries.

191
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,188
Everyone can eat.

192
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:09,029
Pastries?

193
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,109
- Pastries!
 - Pastries.

194
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,268
Come here.

195
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,868
Come.

196
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:12,268
Thank you.

197
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:13,308
You all can enjoy it.

198
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:14,349
- Thanks.
 - Thank you.

199
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,308
- Thank you.
 - Ms. Chai.

200
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:16,868
Why are you so generous today?

201
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:17,868
- Right.
 - Yeah.

202
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,628
You didn't even buy sesame cakes in normal days.

203
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:20,589
Did you get any order?

204
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,188
Right.

205
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,349
A businessman Mr. Hu ordered a batch of goods.

206
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,828
It's enough for us to spend for several months!

207
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:28,909
Really?

208
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,789
- Great!
 - That's great.

209
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,268
So you have to work hard.

210
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,188
After finishing the pastries, continue working.

211
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,308
Okay. Let's go.

212
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,828
Continue working.

213
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:37,829
That's tasty.

214
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,109
Miss Li.

215
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,669
Have some pastries also.

216
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,068
You can do it later.

217
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,469
You're new here.

218
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,469
I don't have any expectation for you.

219
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,549
Whether you do it well or badly, it doesn't matter.

220
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,789
Ms. Chai.

221
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,909
If I do it badly, I can start over.

222
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,828
It doesn't matter.

223
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:57,868
Eat some pastries first.

224
00:10:57,869 --> 00:10:58,869
You can do it later.

225
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,748
Li Leyan!

226
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,508
What have you done?

227
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,229
Look!

228
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,909
Look at it!

229
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,469
Did you see?

230
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,308
I'll do it again.

231
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:09,989
I'll start over.

232
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,508
No. No. Don't do it.

233
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,589
Please stop. Please.

234
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,269
Look at the thread on your head.

235
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,909
I...

236
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,910
That's...

237
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,990
I...

238
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:22,549
Sun.

239
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,308
Great Khan is suddenly coming. And he's with Sher.

240
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,669
Great Khan never came here on his own initiative.

241
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,948
I suppose something big might happen.

242
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,828
Could it be about Shuozhou?

243
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:32,829
About Shuozhou,

244
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:36,989
it's me that made agreements secretly with Gongsun Heng.

245
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,859
You knew nothing.

246
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,469
It also has nothing to do with men in Eagle Division.

247
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,508
Understand?

248
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,299
What are you gonna do?

249
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,109
Since I accepted Gongsun Heng's offer,

250
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,070
I'd thought about things that would happen today.

251
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,669
I made the decision myself.

252
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,150
If Great Khan wants to blame us,

253
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,429
you only need to protect yourself.

254
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,989
Have you thought of a way to get yourself out of this?

255
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,789
No one can be totally sure about anything.

256
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,790
I'll do my best.

257
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:07,629
Prepare the list of spoils to welcome Great Khan.

258
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,670
Come.

259
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,549
You...

260
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,789
Li Shisi. Let me go.

261
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,268
Tell me what happened exactly.

262
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,268
I don't know.

263
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,268
Stop playing dumb.

264
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:28,429
What are you gonna do?

265
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,509
I wanna know the truth.

266
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:33,789
Pardoning Shuozhou was Sun's own decision.

267
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,429
Great Khan didn't know that.

268
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,030
If Great Khan were there, almost everyone in Shuozhou would die.

269
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,789
Though Sun looks indifferent and cold,

270
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,188
he's actually the most humane one.

271
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:49,748
He already knew it was you that led the army in Shuozhou.

272
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,948
About that arrow to you, he missed the target on purpose.

273
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:54,909
He even worried if he's too good at shooting.

274
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,268
And he kept asking me if you were fine.

275
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:01,068
Also, before taking you away from Shuozhou,

276
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:05,229
he posted that you tried to kill the leader of Ashile Tribe but failed

277
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,828
and have been executed and died for the people.

278
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,308
That was for your reputation as the Commandant of Shuozhou.

279
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:11,149
And you?

280
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,309
How did you treat him?

281
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,628
I don't wanna talk too much with you.

282
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,508
Great Khan comes here this time.

283
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,589
Sun did disobey Great Khan's order.

284
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,229
As for Sher.

285
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,149
He's Sun's sworn enemy.

286
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,030
If his plot works, Sun will be in danger.

287
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,950
I have to think of a way to save him.

288
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,909
Did Ashile Sun tell you how he would deal with that?

289
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,910
I don't know.

290
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,189
Greetings to Great Khan from Ashile Sun.

291
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,230
Stand up.

292
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,429
Father comes here on your own this time.

293
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,790
I wonder what your instruction is.

294
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,350
No need to be so serious.

295
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:18,868
Take a seat.

296
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:19,869
Yes.

297
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:26,628
Sun.

298
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:29,230
We two haven't seen each other for long.

299
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,989
I want to visit here out of whim.

300
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,268
Now Eagle Division is well trained and equipped.

301
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,508
Your people all look energetic.

302
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,909
That's good.

303
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,669
I feel relieved.

304
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,268
The prosperity in Ashile Tribe owes to father.

305
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:47,509
What Eagle Division depends on is also father's grace.

306
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,789
Sun, that's too modest for you to say that.

307
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,748
I dare not lie to you, father.

308
00:14:54,749 --> 00:15:00,589
I've been hearing that Sun's the God of War here.

309
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,229
I thought that was boasting.

310
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,499
I didn't expect at the first battle between Eagle Division and Tang,

311
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,029
you successfully conquered Shuozhou within only ten days.

312
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:17,189
Sun, you're indeed the God of War.

313
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:21,149
Ashile Tribe is well known for its battle-wise soildiers.

314
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,590
It's natural that Eagle Division can conquer Shuozhou successfully.

315
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:27,429
Ashile Sun.

316
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,029
You're indeed good at the art of language.

317
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,110
But you seemed not to have told the truth.

318
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,349
What do you mean?

319
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,369
Shuozhou has been hard to conquer.

320
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,868
Uncle Khan has been attacking for years,

321
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,989
but still couldn't conquer it.

322
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,308
Why did they open the city gate for you once you were there?

323
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:48,030
Uncle Khan. Don't you think that's too strange?

324
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,829
Sher, tell me why it's strange.

325
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,469
Just be straightforward.

326
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,409
Great Khan has ordered that after conquering the city,

327
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,909
you have to eliminate all of the soldiers and supplies.

328
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,508
Shuozhou is the key place to the northern pass.

329
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,789
Only by so can we give Tang no chance to take a breath.

330
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,589
But I heard that after you conquered the city,

331
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,948
you not only held an elaborate funeral for Gongsun Heng,

332
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:15,749
but also pardoned everyone in the city.

333
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,628
Ashile Sun, is it because you're afraid of death

334
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,150
so that you want to betray us?

335
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:27,990
Sun. Is that true?

336
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:34,189
Right. I did give the order.

337
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,068
Uncle Khan, have you heard that?

338
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:41,389
He admitted that he betrayed you and Ashile Tribe.

339
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:45,389
Are you doubting my loyalty, father?

340
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,549
He already knew it was you that led the army in Shuozhou.

341
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,029
About that arrow to you, he missed the target on purpose.

342
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,628
He even worried if he's too good at shooting.

343
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,349
And he kept asking me if you were fine.

344
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,268
As for Sher, he's Sun's sworn enemy.

345
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:12,229
If his plot works, Sun will be in danger.

346
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:16,949
Though Ashile Sun didn't do exactly as what Great Khan ordered,

347
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,670
he won the battle at such a low price after all.

348
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,348
Anyway, that can't be a fault.

349
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,339
Great Khan came here on his own to inquire Sun.

350
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,060
There should be something more complicated.

351
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,269
What's that exactly?

352
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,909
Go get some water.

353
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,910
Yes.

354
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,468
If it weren't Young Khan that wanna make use of you,

355
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:47,268
I'd definitely beat you to death. Bastard Tang man.

356
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,588
You kept making the request.

357
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:51,588
Do you really think you're a big figure?

358
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:53,748
I'll kill you someday.

359
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:55,549
Tang man?

360
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,349
Why did Young Khan bring a Tang man here?

361
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Something's wrong.

362
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,070
If I don't trust you,

363
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,949
I won't give you any chance to explain.

364
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,950
Thank you, father.

365
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,149
This is the letter that Gongsun Heng,

366
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,748
governor of Shuozhou, wrote to me.

367
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,869
Please have a check, father.

368
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,268
Gongsun Heng's been guarding the frontier for years.

369
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,588
Our tribe launched many attacks but was defeated by him.

370
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,628
We lost a lot.
 [Tegin Sun...]

371
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,629
If I attacked Shuozhou by force, many of our men would die.

372
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,748
Gongsun Heng sued for peace this time.

373
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:00,189
He'd like to suicide for people's lives in that city.

374
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,669
When he died, big harm to our tribe would disappear,

375
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,190
and we can also win at the lowest price.

376
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,470
That's why I accepted his offer.

377
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,909
You even pardoned Tang's soldiers.

378
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,979
How can you explain that?

379
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,189
Most of soldiers in Shuozhou died.

380
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,949
There were only old and disabled soldiers left.

381
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,468
They can't attack at all.

382
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:22,109
If not so, Gongsun Heng wouldn't have the request.

383
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,069
He killed himself as promised and opened the city gate for us.

384
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,869
As the son of Great Khan, how could I break my promise?

385
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,629
Father, please pass judgment.

386
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,789
These are Gong Sunheng's head and the list of all spoils.

387
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,190
Please have a look, Great Khan.

Enough. No need to check it.

390
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,388
Sun. You were right.

391
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:30,909
The descendants born in the grasslands

392
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,789
have always been upright and magnanimous.

393
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,909
Gongsun Heng is a respectable opponent.

394
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,388
Just hold the funeral on behalf of me according to our etiquette.

395
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:44,910
Yes, father.

396
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,108
Sun.

397
00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:59,710
I have another thing to ask you this time.

398
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:14,259
Nuer.

399
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,949
What are you doing?

400
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,189
Though you're not a slave now,

401
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,628
you still can't order me to do anything.

402
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:20,259
Nuer. You have to help me this time.

403
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,109
You're indeed not taking yourself as a stranger.

404
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,388
Listen, if you don't help me this time,

405
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:28,550
your Tegin and the whole Eagle Division would face a disaster.

406
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,789
Ashile Sun, if you admit it yourself,

407
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,228
I can still plead for you to Uncle Khan.

408
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:40,108
I don't know what you're talking about.

409
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,310
So you refuse to admit until you face the reality.

410
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,710
Uncle Khan, Ashile Sun colluded with Tang and harmed our tribe.

411
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,029
That's venomously slander!

412
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,429
When I was in Youzhou, I could almost succeed.

413
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,259
But Ashile Sun, you colluded the envoy of Tang

414
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,669
and let him take the army to assist.

415
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,429
Then Tang won back Youzhou again.

416
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,150
And my Wolf Division's effort was in vain.

417
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:08,429
You betrayed Great Khan and colluded with Tang.

418
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,388
Stop pretending to be loyal.

419
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:13,509
Sun, is that true?

420
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,229
I swear to God of Sirius, that it never happens.

421
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,429
Uncle Khan, there's a general betraying Tang.

422
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,669
He escaped on his way being sent to Changan.

423
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,309
And he's finally under my control.

424
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,269
He used to work for King of Lujiang, called Wang Junkuo.

425
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,348
Young Khan, you ruined things in Youzhou yourself.

426
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,268
And now you want to slander Tegin Sun.

427
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,029
What do you mean?

428
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,589
Mu Jin. Stop.

429
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:47,789
Ashile Sun, you must be familiar with him.

430
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,710
If you haven't done anything, dare you talk with him in person?

431
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,149
Uncle Khan,

432
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,109
my men of Wolf Division all died for nothing. That's unfair.

433
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:01,509
Guards.

434
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,910
- Bring the traitor here.
 - Yes.

435
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,268
I might be insane that I'd follow you here.

436
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,189
You want to do it in front of Great Khan.

437
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,228
That's impossible.

438
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:21,069
Even Tegin Sun can't protect you.

439
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,549
I didn't say I'd do anything.

440
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,789
You won't do anything? You wanna win by just talking?

441
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,150
I indeed plan to win by talking.

442
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,429
Later I'll yell that Young Khan's horse is lost.

443
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,549
I'll keep away the guards.

444
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,189
You should finish the rest part.

445
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,829
What do you mean?

446
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,108
I'm just here helping you.

447
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:38,309
The man that Young Khan brought here was the General of Youzhou.

448
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,149
He met me before.

449
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,268
I can't go inside.

450
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,709
Only you can do this.

451
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,949
You...

452
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,429
Do you mean it?

453
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,508
I'll teach you how to do it.

454
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,268
Come here.

455
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,430
When you get in...

456
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,029
Will it work?

457
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,030
It's on you now.

458
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:03,829
Young Khan's horse's running away!

459
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,510
Young Khan's horse's running away! Get it!

460
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:16,229
Ashile Sun, have you well considered it?

461
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:21,309
If you admit your mistake now, maybe Uncle Khan would spare your life

462
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,829
considering your previous achievements.

463
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,069
When Wang Junkuo gets here and explains everything,

464
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,229
you won't feel easy by that time.

465
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,468
Even if you don't care about yourself,

466
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:34,310
you should think about Eagle Division.

467
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:44,029
Sun, as long as you can admit your mistake and explain yourself,

468
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,589
I'll forgive you.

469
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,070
I feel no shame.

470
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,550
I haven't done anything harmful to father.

471
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,550
Great Khan. The man is here.

472
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,749
Bring him in.

473
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,469
Greetings to Great Khan from Wang Junkuo.

474
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,389
Explain to me what happened in Youzhou.

475
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,388
Wang Junkuo.

476
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:31,389
Have you seen Ashile Sun in Youzhou?

477
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,869
Great Khan.

478
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:44,588
I don't have those things.

479
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:46,748
I gave the key to Young Khan.

480
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:50,979
Everything was done by Young Khan himself.

481
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,348
As for the loss of treasury, I think...

482
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:55,988
only Young Khan knows what happened.

483
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,829
Wang Junkuo.

484
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,549
What are you talking about?

485
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,829
Explain first what you have seen about Ashile Sun in Youzhou.

486
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,388
Please. Great Khan. It's true.

487
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:08,388
I want to work for you sincerely.

488
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:10,829
How would I dare occupy the treasury myself?

489
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,748
About those things... Young Khan must have them.

490
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:15,348
He has been following Tegin Sun.

491
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:17,030
I think he must want something from Sun.

492
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:29,789
Uncle Khan.

493
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:34,588
Ashile Sun, you conquered Shuozhou within ten days.

494
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,949
That was a great achievement.

495
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,829
You deserve a big award.

496
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,388
You can take half of the spoils of the war in Shuozhou.

497
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:42,389
Thank you, father.

498
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:49,588
Sun, you seem not to have enough people in your tent.

499
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:54,189
When I'm back, I'll carefully select several bondwomen for you

500
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,108
and send them to your tent.

501
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:57,469
Thanks a lot, father.

502
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:03,468
Sher.

503
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:04,429
Uncle Khan.

504
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,789
That's quite a 'good job' this time.

505
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,189
Uncle Khan.

506
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,790
Uncle Khan, please allow me to explain.

507
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:41,269
I was so scared.

508
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,430
Well done.

509
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,499
How did you know about the treasury in Youzhou?

510
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,988
When Wang Junkuo heard that Young Khan

511
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,388
would say he secretly occupied the treasury in Youzhou,

512
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:53,709
he got panic instantly.

513
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,829
Then he didn't remember to slander Tegin Sun.

514
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,189
Actually Sher didn't occupy the treasury.

515
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,268
But Wang Junkuo knew nothing.

516
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:03,468
He had nothing, so he cherished his life very much.

517
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:06,388
He was afraid that Great Khan would think he stole the treasury,

518
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:08,309
that's why he said Sher did that.

519
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,588
Actually I just wanted to gamble.

520
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,268
I didn't expect that was quite a success.

521
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:18,379
It must be because Tegin is lucky, so we could win the bet.

522
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,149
Thanks to God of Sirius.

523
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,309
Military counselor. You're marvelous.

524
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,268
You saved not only Tegin, but also the whole Eagle Division.

525
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:27,030
I really admire you.

526
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,670
From now on, we're friends.

527
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:55,149
I knew you're here.

528
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,268
Every time when Great Khan did something to you due to Sher,

529
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,630
you'd stay here and say nothing.

530
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,750
What happened today,

531
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,188
wasn't solved by you, right?

532
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,870
What? You don't think I can do that?

533
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,388
Fine.

534
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,869
It was Li Shisi. He solved it.

535
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,028
He can think of different ideas and is good at using people's mind.

536
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:22,829
I don't know where he got the information

537
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,829
that the taboo here is secretly holding spoils.

538
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,149
That's why he could entrap Sher.

539
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:31,308
Thanks to my wisdom.

540
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:34,869
I told him everything about what you did in Shuozhou.

541
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,308
Otherwise he might not help you.

542
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,309
You...

543
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,909
Wait. What are you going?

544
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,350
Sun.

545
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:49,429
Roast lamb leg!

546
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,509
You asked Nuer to keep an eye on Li Shisi.

547
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,870
I think it's not gonna work.

548
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:58,789
What do you mean?

549
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,269
They live in the same tent.

550
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,989
And today they uncovered Sher's plot together.

551
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,469
Naturally their relationship would be better.

552
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,908
Look at Nuer.

553
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:10,069
He treats Li Shisi with food and wine.

554
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:13,589
Good wine.

555
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,668
You can really drink.

556
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:16,428
Mu Jin.

557
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:18,548
Arrange a single tent for Li Shisi.

558
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:19,268
OK.

559
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:20,589
I'll do it tomorrow.

560
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,590
Do it now.

561
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,829
Look at your eyes.

562
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,830
I want to arrange it tomorrow.

563
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,829
Never mind.

564
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,190
I don't care about your pettiness.

565
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,629
One more cup.

566
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,630
Cheers.

567
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,028
Really tasty.

568
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,148
Not bad, right?

569
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:47,509
Why are you here?

570
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,308
Newly roasted lamb leg. Wanna taste?

571
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:50,469
No.

572
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,790
Within only one day, you're already bribed by him.

573
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:57,309
Bribe?

574
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,349
Don't talk nonsense.

575
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,268
Well.

576
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:03,629
So you can't bear seeing me in harmony with your people?

577
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,830
It's not me that can't bear it, but someone else.

578
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:10,869
Pack up your things and follow me.

579
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,308
Where to?

580
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:16,548
Since you're the military counselor now, how can you live with Nuer?

581
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:17,268
Come.

582
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:19,069
I prepared a wide and good tent.

583
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,068
You must forget who you are,

584
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:50,110
getting drunk in such a little county government.

585
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:53,148
Isn't it humiliating?

586
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:54,908
I know.

587
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:56,069
You despise me.

588
00:31:57,069 --> 00:32:01,148
You think I'm just an indecisive exalted man.

589
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:02,549
Without my father,

590
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,389
in your eyes, I might be even less than a magistrate.

591
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,429
Right?

592
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,470
I'm asking you. Yes or no?

593
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,470
You're drunk.

594
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,148
Let me tell you one more thing.

595
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,989
Actually Changge despises me as well.

596
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,029
Otherwise,

597
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:32,549
in all these years, can't she understand my feelings for her?

598
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,869
You're still thinking about Li Changge.

599
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,989
I thought you're worrying about Noble Princess.

600
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,389
I am worried.

601
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,268
I'm worried. I'm afraid.

602
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,189
I feel guilty for that.

603
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:48,309
Leyan is lost.

604
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:51,309
We haven't found her until now.

605
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,509
Changge is dead.

606
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,909
I didn't see her before she died.

607
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:00,830
I even despise myself.

608
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,188
Come. Sit here.

609
00:33:06,189 --> 00:33:07,309
Drink with me.

610
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,870
So you don't wanna drink.

611
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,388
You always look so indifferent about everything.

612
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:19,148
Isn't it boring?

613
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:20,350
Have you been drunk before?

614
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,149
Have you felt heart-broken before?

615
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:28,109
Hao Du.

616
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,309
I feel sorry for you.

617
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:37,230
You're like a doll, a doll of... your adoptive father.

618
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,308
Wei Shuyu, if you dare talk any rubbish again, you won't be fine.

619
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,309
Hit me.

620
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,149
I wish you can beat me to death.

621
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,830
If I can't find Leyan, I feel ashamed to return to Changan,

622
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:06,590
and even more ashamed to meet my father.

623
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,730
[County Government in Yunzhou]

624
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,628
Mr. Wei. Good morning.

625
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:54,709
Have you found Noble Princess?

626
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,908
Not yet. But... Commander Hao has left.

627
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,229
What?

628
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,828
- He left?
 - Right.

629
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:04,789
He said it's a waste of time to search together.

630
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,828
Better separately.

631
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:07,428
He left early in the morning.

632
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,148
Where did he go?

633
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,349
About that... I don't know.

634
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,229
Mr. Wei.

635
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,230
Mr. Wei!

636
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,629
Where are you going?

637
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:23,629
To look for Noble Princess, of course.

638
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,510
That's...

639
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,990
Greetings to your Majesty.

640
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,629
Wei. Get up.

641
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,789
We've known each other for long.

642
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,148
No need for that.

643
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:17,909
I dare not accept that kindness.

644
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:23,388
I need your assistance.

645
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:28,470
Your Majesty, I'll do whatever I can.

646
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:31,349
Come.

647
00:36:48,149 --> 00:36:53,069
Your Majesty, I've already known what happened in Jingzhou.

648
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,588
Luo Yi has been good friends with Jiancheng.

649
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,428
The Tianjie Army he leads

650
00:36:57,429 --> 00:37:01,550
has indeed contributed a lot to Tang all these years.

651
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:04,589
I knew that.

652
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:09,269
Wei, you don't want the royal court

653
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,749
to punish these meritorious officials, but now...

654
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,668
Your Majesty misunderstood me.

655
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:17,388
I'm not a stupid man caring only about personal feelings

656
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:19,789
but unaware of loyalty.

657
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,109
No. I just think

658
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,070
that you wouldn't want to see me

659
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,108
being ruthless to Luo Yi.

660
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:29,388
Quite the contrary.

661
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:32,188
After your Majesty was enthroned, everyone has been pardoned.

662
00:37:32,189 --> 00:37:36,108
But Luo Yi ignored your Majesty's kindness and wanted to revolt.

663
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:40,628
Jingzhou is a key place to defend Ashile Tribe.

664
00:37:40,629 --> 00:37:43,709
If your Majesty doesn't make a quick move

665
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,348
and eliminate Luo Yi and his Tianjie Army,

666
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,108
I'm afraid the turmoil happened in the late Sui Dynasty

667
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,230
would start again.

668
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,549
Besides, I've got some news

669
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,588
that the traitor Wang Junkuo flew to Ashile Tribe.

670
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:04,189
But he was killed by Ashile people for some reason.

671
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:09,109
Your Majesty can't hesitate now.

672
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:13,230
Wang Junkuo.

673
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,229
He was asking for an insult.

674
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,828
No one would feel sorry for his death.

675
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:22,510
After talking with you, I feel relieved now.

676
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:27,029
But... if Tianjie Army got defeated,

677
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,668
Ashile Tribe would definitely swoop in.

678
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:34,868
Could Tang be safe if your Majesty doesn't deal with Jingzhou?

679
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:40,070
Would Ashile Tribe stop attacking Tang if it's fine with Jingzhou?

680
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,789
Your Majesty, whether showing weakness or toughness

681
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:51,070
wouldn't let Ashile give up coveting Tang's territory.

682
00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:54,550
I understand.

683
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:58,619
I'll ask General Yuchi to meet me now.

684
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,029
Please be assured, your Majesty.

685
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:06,149
Whatever it is, we'd stand behind your Majesty.

686
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,588
By the way, Mr. Wei Junior has been looking for Yan for days.

687
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:17,229
I think he must have suffered a lot.

688
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,989
I'll arrange more people to search for her.

689
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,348
Let him come back now.

690
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:23,388
I have another arrangement for him.

691
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:26,949
I also haven't heard from him for days.

692
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,620
I think he must feel embarrassed for not having found Noble Princess.

693
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:38,188
You were too strict with Shuyu.

694
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:41,388
Shuyu focuses only on searching for Yan,

695
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:44,709
which must be harmful to his health both mentally and physically.

696
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,388
Fang still needs a Supervisory Censor.

697
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:49,749
I've thought about it.

698
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,749
Shuyu is perfect for that.

699
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,309
Your Majesty. He's not proper to do it.

700
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,229
Shuyu often makes big mistakes.

701
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,270
It's already decided.

702
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,949
Your Majesty.

703
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,070
Thanks to your Majesty on behalf of Shuyu.

704
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:18,949
Li Leyan.

705
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,628
Do you have too much free time?

706
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:21,629
What are you doing?

707
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,428
I'm just doing it for fun.

708
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:27,029
You even have the time to do that?

709
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,510
Why didn't you put more strength in working?

710
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:32,868
I'll learn how to do it soon.

711
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:34,949
Just give me some more time.

712
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,148
When I was in the Palace, I didn't take charge of such things.

713
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:39,989
Palace?

714
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,989
Really? Palace?

715
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,709
She dreams of being a princess again.

716
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,909
Dear 'Princess', in the Palace, are they using gold shuttles to weave?

717
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:54,709
Miss, did your head get hit?

718
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,628
Or were you seriously ill?

719
00:40:56,629 --> 00:40:58,229
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

720
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,108
Does she need to see a doctor?

721
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:03,229
We should ask Ms. Chai not to beat her head.

722
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,349
She's already so dumb.

723
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,828
I'll hand these bondwomen to you now.

724
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:17,789
As for the rest part, you should take care of it.

725
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,108
What's going on?

726
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:23,868
Bondwomen from Khan's Tent.

727
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:25,550
It's said to be the award for Tegin.

728
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:30,668
Tegin never keeps bondwoman in his tent.

729
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:31,669
Take them away.

730
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:38,108
How Great Khan treats Tegin is like giving sweets after slapping you.

731
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:39,668
That's a pity.

732
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:41,668
You can't tell if those are poisonous or not.

733
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:45,489
Things from Khan have always been difficult to deal with.

734
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,549
Keep an eye on them.

735
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,469
Don't let them wander.

736
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,470
Okay.

737
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,230
Mother.

738
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:14,990
Please turn back and look at me.

739
00:42:16,629 --> 00:42:17,629
Mother.

740
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:24,310
Please turn back... Please... Turn back and look at me.

741
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,908
Let me go!

742
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:29,188
Come.

743
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:30,349
Let go!

744
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:33,749
Let go of me!

745
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,108
Don't hide from us, beauty.

746
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:36,828
Drink with us two.

747
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:37,829
- Come.
 - Let me go!

748
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:40,989
Good.

749
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:41,990
Stop.
