<i>The Long Ballad</i>

3
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,280
<i>This is a work of fiction.</i>

4
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,159
<i>Episode 16</i>

5
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,879
Starting today,

6
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,079
you're just a slave in the Eagle Army.

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,079
What do you want me to do?

8
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,359
I want you to disappear from Tang.

9
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,200
I have the final say in deciding whether I'm dead or not.

10
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,840
What you say is useless.

11
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,920
That depends on your capability.

12
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,000
Keeping me by your side...

13
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,040
is like raising a tiger.

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,560
It makes no difference.

15
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,719
Make sure you survive first...

16
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,959
before you are worried about that.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,120
The law of survival on the grasslands...

18
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,680
is only the strongest survives.

19
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,400
Behind me...

20
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,240
is Shuozhuo...

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,919
that has been looted but the people escaped the battle unscathed.

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,599
Behind it...

23
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,400
is endless mountains.

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,000
Beyond that...

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,319
is my homeland, a million miles away.

26
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,240
Chang'an.

27
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,960
In the end, I couldn't go back there.

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,960
In the past, you achieved glory for the motherland.

29
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,360
Now, you're just a slave.

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Li Chang Ge.

31
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,120
Even I feel bad for you.

32
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,479
<i>Fuju Inn</i>

33
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,599
After receiving the order,

34
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,919
I hurried here right away.

35
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,919
Please give me your instructions, Commander Hao.

36
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,199
Follow Ashina Tribe at once.

37
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,520
I want to know what happened to Li Chang Ge in the end.

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,560
Should I kill her?

39
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,520
If she colludes with Ashina Tribe,

40
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,639
kill her.

41
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,800
What if she doesn't?

42
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,680
Ashina Tribe won't keep her.

43
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,439
Yes.

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,120
Send whatever news you have...

45
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,159
through the pigeon.

46
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,199
You may leave.

47
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,599
Yes.

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,319
The people dearest to me...

49
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,560
were all slaughtered like pigs and dogs.

50
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,800
The place I was born and raised...

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,480
banished me.

52
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,439
I felt like dying every single day.

53
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,610
But I had to do what I had to do.

54
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,730
Once this is over,

55
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,199
it won't be too late to kill me.

56
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,360
<i>Noble and integrate</i>

57
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,959
Li Chang Ge.

58
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,730
I hope you can sacrifice for the people.

59
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,639
Recently,

60
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,279
all the county offices around the kingdom...

61
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,560
are secretly looking for the princess.

62
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,170
However, the portrait that was sent to the capital...

63
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,480
looks nothing like the princess.

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,639
Furthermore, the princess lost in the four states in the north.

65
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,639
Until now,

66
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,000
we haven't heard anything yet.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Your Highness.

68
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,240
Princess Yong'an is very blessed.

69
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,319
Didn't Li Chun Feng make a prediction...

70
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,639
that she'll come back safely?

71
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,360
I hope so.

72
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,680
Lately,

73
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,050
I always dreamed of...

74
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,399
Le Yan and Chang Ge when they were younger.

75
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,240
Both of them...

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,399
were hanging around in the garden.

77
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,600
I waved at them...

78
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,639
but they couldn't see me.

79
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,920
I called out their names.

80
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,680
But they couldn't hear me either.

81
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,319
Worse,

82
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,959
they kept running away.

83
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,040
Your Highness...

84
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,519
worries too much.

85
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,560
That's why...

86
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,000
Your Highness had weird dreams.

87
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,079
Your Highness, I'll get the imperial kitchen...

88
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,279
to make some soothing soup for Your Highness.

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,199
Will those two girls...

90
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,600
be further away from me?

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,480
No.

92
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,920
They will always be...

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,480
the most daring daughter and official to you.

94
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Perhaps at this moment,

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,839
no news is the best news.

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,560
That's right.

97
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Your Highness, there is urgent military news.

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Ashina Tribe suddenly attacked the north border.

99
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,079
The chief commander, Sima Tu...

100
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,120
and the governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng...

101
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,720
were killed in the battle.

102
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
When did it happen?

103
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,199
No one reported it!

104
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,000
Ashina Tribe besieged the city.

105
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,480
The frontier couldn't deliver the message.

106
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,560
Hao Du sent his men to speed things up.

107
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,160
Five horses were sacrificed...

108
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
before the news reached Chang'an.

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,360
Send our army there now to regain the north region.

110
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,920
Make sure we chase the Ashina Tribe out of the border.

111
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,439
After that,

112
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,879
the troops will camp at the same place...

113
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,240
to comfort the people in the north.

114
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,439
Yes, Your Highness.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Mr. Du.

116
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,839
Mr. Du.

117
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,160
I need to talk to you.

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,240
You always know your own mind.

119
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,439
What do you want to discuss with me?

120
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,800
Mr. Du, don't be sarcastic.

121
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,800
You and I are the ministers of the imperial court.

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,199
It's good to have someone to discuss with.

123
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,639
Furthermore,

124
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,839
I really need a favor from you.

125
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,600
Just tell me what it is.

126
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
As you know,

127
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
Princess Yong'an is missing in action.

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,480
It's His Highness's biggest concern.

129
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,920
The portrait of Princess Yong'an...

130
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,519
has been sent to all local government offices...

131
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,079
for a secret investigation.

132
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,199
However, Princess Yong'an is nowhere to be found.

133
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,000
But we didn't receive any news...

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,759
from the north.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm just worried.

136
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,519
What do you want me to do?

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,199
People in the north...

138
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,560
have never seen Princess Yong'an before.

139
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,160
Your godson is in the north, right?

140
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Although Wei Shu Yu...

141
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,199
allegedly lost her,

142
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
at that time,

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,079
your godson, Hao Du...

144
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,319
was with Princess Yong'an.

145
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,680
The more collaborative the effort,

146
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,439
the better.

147
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,920
Furthermore, under your guidance,

148
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
- your godson is already... - That's enough.

149
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,759
Talk properly.

150
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,759
Don't flatter me.

151
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Since His Highness...

152
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,399
has entrusted you with this case,

153
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,199
you should work on it.

154
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

155
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,210
Eat up.

156
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,639
Here.

157
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,559
What's the point of keeping him here?

158
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,759
If you ask me, I'll just kill him.

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
- Hold on. - Here.

160
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,450
Leave it there.

161
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,450
Give me more.

162
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,759
Here.

163
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,279
Where are you going?

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,679
I didn't expect to see you here.

165
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,720
Here.

166
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,639
Actually, the Eagle Army...

167
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,000
isn't too far from Shuozhou.

168
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,090
It's near a river and there are trees.

169
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,330
You'll get used to it.

170
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,399
Eat up.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,090
Let me tell you.

172
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,559
If His Highness didn't care about you,

173
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,039
I wouldn't care about you either.

174
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,960
My goodness.

175
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,519
Your friend is insensible.

176
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,480
I think you're wasting your effort on him.

177
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,210
Look at that body.

178
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,360
I don't think he can survive in the grasslands.

179
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,720
No, he'll survive.

180
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,960
How do you know that?

181
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,450
He is someone who has a strong desire to live.

182
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,840
He won't be defeated...

183
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,720
so easily.

184
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,519
It looks like...

185
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,039
you know him very well.

186
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,600
But I think...

187
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,840
you're just the enemy to him.

188
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,330
It doesn't matter.

189
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,330
You've never treated me so nicely after all these years.

190
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,399
That person...

191
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,799
has been following us for a long time.

192
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,879
I know.

193
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,519
He's here to see Shi Si Lang.

194
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,879
Do something for me.

195
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,639
What are you doing?

196
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,799
Let go!

197
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,360
Listen to me.

198
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,919
You're our slave.

199
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,480
Just do whatever I tell you to do.

200
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,000
What?

201
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,559
Are you refusing to work?

202
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,639
You must have a death wish.

203
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,639
Take him away.

204
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,840
Cut him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!

205
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,000
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

206
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,120
What are you doing?

207
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,200
What are you doing?

208
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,399
Let go of me!

209
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,200
Let go!

210
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,759
Come on!

211
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,840
Let go!

212
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,879
Come on!

213
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Elder Qin.

214
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,759
I feel bad for Yuan Niang.

215
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,720
She has been homeless and travels with us for so long.

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,639
Not at all.

217
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,559
She has the best father and mother in the world.

218
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,320
How is Shuozhou doing?

219
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,000
I heard that...

220
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,600
the Ashina Tribe has left.

221
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,440
Someone from the imperial court will come and take over the rest.

222
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,759
Aside from that...

223
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,559
"Aside from that"?

224
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,919
Are you going to tell me...

225
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
about Young Master?

226
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,879
He failed in the assassination.

227
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,879
He was killed.

228
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
I see. He's...

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,159
He's too strong and impulsive.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,519
It's easy to destroy those who are strong and impulsive.

231
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,320
If...

232
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,320
Stop it.

233
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,000
I think Young Master...

234
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,679
is still alive.

235
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,600
He's still alive?

236
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,879
Since Ashina Sun...

237
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,080
made a promise with Governor Gongsun,

238
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,240
he won't kill him for sure.

239
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,480
Perhaps he has brought him to the grasslands.

240
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,200
Let's not wait any longer.

241
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,159
- Let's look for him. - In the grasslands,

242
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,080
they have spies everywhere.

243
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,840
We can't barge in as we like.

244
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,759
Let's take care of Yuan Niang first.

245
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,440
We should use our previous connection...

246
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,679
and see if we can get some information.

247
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,759
Then I'll make a decision.

248
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,960
<i>Someone has been executed by Ashina Sun.</i>

249
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,159
Li Chang Ge.

250
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,679
Perhaps this is the best place for you.

251
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,080
Why are you here?

252
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,159
That's my question for you.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Losing the princess is a serious matter...

254
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,759
yet His Highness didn't blame you.

255
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,919
I'll find Le Yan for sure.

256
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,039
I'll wait and see.

257
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,519
It has been so long.

258
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,799
You didn't return to Chang'an.

259
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,039
Are you looking for Chang Ge?

260
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,480
What happened to her?

261
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
She's dead.

262
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,200
How did she die?

263
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,840
Did you kill her?

264
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Tell me!

265
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,639
Wei Shu Yu.

266
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,039
Do you plan to sacrifice yourself and your family...

267
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,039
just to avenge your lover?

268
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,360
After killing you,

269
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,159
I'll kill myself to atone for it.

270
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,000
Do you think that His Highness...

271
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
will punish the Wei family just for you?

272
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,960
Then why didn't you do it?

273
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,000
When Li Chang Ge was alive, you couldn't do anything.

274
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,039
Now that she's dead,

275
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,240
you found the courage to take revenge.

276
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,279
I guess,

277
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,639
that's because you know that since Li Chang Ge is dead,

278
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,879
your family's glory won't be affected.

279
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,279
Even if you want revenge,

280
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,399
you've come to the wrong person.

281
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,679
I didn't kill Li Chang Ge.

282
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,720
It was done by Ashina Tribe.

283
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,679
Ashina Tribe?

284
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,559
Ashina Tribe invaded Shuozhou.

285
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,279
Li Chang Ge was captured by them.

286
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,159
With that temper of hers,

287
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,399
do you think she can survive?

288
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,600
I can't believe you went after me with him.

289
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,399
From now on,

290
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,679
we're no longer related.

291
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,879
From now on,

292
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,799
I won't rely on anyone else but myself.

293
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,559
Le Yan gave me an amulet. But what's the point?

294
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
In the end,

295
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:14,000
I failed to protect both of them.

296
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,440
That's enough.

297
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,200
Li Chang Ge is no longer here.

298
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,000
Make sure Princess Yong'an is safe.

299
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,399
Also,

300
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,080
I received a message from Chang'an.

301
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,519
They want me to stay at the north border...

302
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,600
to look for Princess Yong'an.

303
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
Obviously,

304
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
they don't trust you.

305
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,120
I'll make sure I find Le Yan before you do.

306
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,759
It doesn't matter.

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,120
I won't compete with you.

308
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,559
But I'll give you a hint.

309
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,720
In Shuozhou, Li Chang Ge...

310
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,440
is the Commandant of Light Chariot known by everyone.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,519
If Princess Yong'an is in Shuozhou,

312
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,840
there must be a trace of her.

313
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,799
So, your trip to Shuozhuo...

314
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,919
is in vain.

315
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,080
<i>Fuju Inn</i>

316
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,000
What happened last night?

317
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,599
Why did you knock me out after covering my head?

318
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,960
Why didn't you kill me?

319
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,319
Last night, a slave died for you.

320
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,680
Take him away.

321
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,759
Cut him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!

322
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,759
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

323
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,720
- Let go of me! - Come on.

324
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,279
Let go!

325
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,410
Come on.

326
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,650
Come on.

327
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,359
Don't move.

328
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,359
Hurry up.

329
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
What is Ashina Sun doing?

330
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,039
I don't get him either.

331
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,079
If I were him,

332
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,319
I would have lost my patience a long time ago.

333
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,410
What a slave.

334
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,759
You're already challenging the limit of Eagle Army.

335
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,000
If I don't torture you,

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,480
you won't know how great we are.

337
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,759
You look fragile.

338
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,599
What's the point of bringing you back?

339
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:48,279
<i>Yunzhou County Office</i>

340
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,079
This way, please.

341
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,410
Excuse me.

342
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,650
Are you the magistrate?

343
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,000
Where do you come from?

344
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,119
You can't even recognize the magistrate.

345
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,200
Magistrate, I need a favor.

346
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,279
How dare you!

347
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,359
You have no manners.

348
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,599
He has work to attend to.

349
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,680
Move.

350
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,839
Magistrate.

351
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,119
You are the magistrate of Yunzhou.

352
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,480
If I didn't have an urgent request,

353
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,839
I wouldn't be so bold.

354
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,839
Go.

355
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,000
Hit the drum if you are seeking justice.

356
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,319
What brings you here?

357
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,480
Please listen to me.

358
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,000
I can't reveal my identity there.

359
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,680
If you don't mind,

360
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,170
can you help me send a message to Chang'an...

361
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,410
or Luoyang?

362
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,680
Who are you?

363
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,799
I'm Princess Yong'an.

364
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,240
I accidentally got separated from my guards.

365
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,480
After the siege,

366
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,920
I escaped to this place.

367
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,039
Magistrate.

368
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,480
If you could help me get home,

369
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,650
His Highness will reward you heavily for sure.

370
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,839
Do you have any proof?

371
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,000
Proof?

372
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,759
When I got separated from my guards,

373
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,410
I didn't bring any tokens.

374
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,559
But I really am a princess.

375
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,119
The title was conferred by my grandfather.

376
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,440
Do you have any carry-on piece from the palace?

377
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,720
Handmade items from the palace that is easy to recognize.

378
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,000
All of them were taken away from me.

379
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,410
Where did you get that information from?

380
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,960
You're quite nimble.

381
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,799
There is indeed a secret order from the imperial court...

382
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,000
to find a princess in secret.

383
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,170
Just because you claim that you're a princess,

384
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,170
it doesn't mean that you are one.

385
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,920
I knew that my father would look for me.

386
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,920
Magistrate.

387
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm really a princess.

388
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,319
Trust me. It's true.

389
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,279
Magistrate, please! Please send a message to Luoyang!

390
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,519
You can be sentenced to corporal punishment for imitation.

391
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,480
- I'm really a princess. - You two. Arrest her!

392
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,519
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

393
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,599
Magistrate!

394
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,650
Magistrate...

395
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,920
Why don't you believe me?

396
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,000
What are you waiting for? Arrest her!

397
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,170
That's enough.

398
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,170
Let her go.

399
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,759
She's just a poor thing who doesn't have a choice.

400
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,839
It's very chaotic here.

401
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,650
The new governor will be here soon.

402
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,519
I don't have the time to deal with a refugee.

403
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,279
Be careful.

<i>Hongfa Textile Workshop</i>

405
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,720
Father.

406
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,000
Why didn't you come and fetch me?

407
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Are you abandoning me?

If you have too much energy,

410
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,079
you may go for a run.

411
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,559
I just don't get it.

412
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,759
What do you plan to do with Shi Si Lang?

413
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,400
You tried so hard to save Shi Si Lang.

414
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,640
Now, you're just ignoring him...

415
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
and let him be bullied by everyone.

416
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,400
You're getting weirder.

417
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,920
The more I pay attention to him,

418
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,319
the more he will suffer.

419
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,559
Rather than making him hate himself,

420
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,240
just let him hate me.

421
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,759
You are really odd!

422
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,880
Did he bewitch you?

423
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,599
Should I summon a shaman?

424
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,519
Do you want to clean horse manure?

425
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,039
Why should I?

426
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,079
I'm Eagle Army's military adviser.

427
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,720
Can you at least let me save my face?

428
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,680
He has to get a foothold...

429
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
in the Eagle Army on his own.

430
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,200
I can't be monitoring him all the time.

431
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,759
He's just a witty-minded man from the Central Plain.

432
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,359
Is he even worth the effort?

433
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,640
He is not grateful to you at all.

434
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,599
I don't need him to be grateful to me.

435
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,640
I just want him to live.

Your Highness and Military Adviser.

437
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,559
The slave that you told me to keep an eye on has passed out.

438
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,640
You're exhausted from protecting Shuozhou.

439
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,799
You didn't eat or drink throughout the journey.

440
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,359
You don't want to live anymore.

441
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,039
What's wrong?

442
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,039
Are you afraid that I might do something to you?

443
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,559
I'm not interested in a woman like you.

444
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,400
How do you know?

445
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,400
I found out when I saved you at the river.

446
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,319
Since you want to hide it,

447
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,480
I didn't bother to expose you.

448
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
You've been playing me this whole time.

449
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,799
Think of it however you want.

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,079
Your Highness.

451
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,319
This is the medicine you asked for.

452
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,680
The shaman said you're worrying too much.

453
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,960
Hence, you have weak energy.

454
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,200
If you don't want to die,

455
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,119
take the medicine.

456
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,519
Take the medicine.

457
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Li Shi Si!

458
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm surprised at how weak you are!

459
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,519
People in Shuozhou are sound and safe.

460
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,960
I have kept my promise.

461
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,160
It's your turn now.

462
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Don't forget...

463
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,000
your life belongs to me now.

464
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,359
What a joke.

465
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,559
You want someone from the Central Plain to serve you.

466
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,599
Why don't you just kill me?

467
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,799
You'll regret it soon.

468
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,960
I won't repeat myself.

469
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,759
Take your medicine.

470
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,960
Is that how you solve problems?

471
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,319
It's better than enduring a life of humiliation.

472
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,480
Since my life is in your hands,

473
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,079
you don't have to humiliate me!

474
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,839
Humiliate you?

475
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,079
I just don't want you to die so easily!

476
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,319
Li Shi Si.

477
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,240
You'd better find a way to survive.

478
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Do it so that you can live long enough to kill me one day soon.

479
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,440
Do it so that you can avenge Gongsun Heng!

480
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,680
Avenge?

481
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,920
Yes.

482
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,480
Avenge.

483
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,119
Avenge Gongsun Heng.

484
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,400
Avenge the troops and people of Shuozhuo.

485
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,599
Have you forgotten about it?

486
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,039
Gongsun Heng is ridiculous.

487
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,160
How could he trust a coward?

488
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,960
If I were you,

489
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,640
I would gain a firm footing in the Eagle Army at all costs.

490
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,720
I would gain the trust of the people around me at all costs...

491
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,240
and wait for the right time to strike!

492
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,319
If you don't want to let him down,

493
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
you should clench your teeth and live.

494
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,640
Being able to entrust the lives of the civilians in Shuozhou City...

495
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
to a Tang princess...

496
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,720
and commit an act of benevolence...

497
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,039
is considered a happy ending for me.

498
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,319
<i>Shuozhou</i>

499
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,279
In the city,

500
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,000
there are thousands of families.

501
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,240
I can't let them down.

502
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,799
But in the end,

503
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,880
I'll have to let my wife and daughter down.

504
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,079
Dou!

505
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,119
It's not just about avenging Governor Gongsun.

506
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,599
It's not just about avenging Shuozhou.

507
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Yes.

508
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,400
How could I die just like that?

509
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,960
How could I die here?

510
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,039
It's easy to die.

511
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,839
Living has always been the hardest.

512
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,599
Go!

513
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Go!

514
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Stop.

515
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,079
Stop.

516
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Let's go.

517
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,039
Don't go there.

518
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,839
We came from that direction.

519
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,839
Yan Er is not there.

520
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,160
Let's go to Yunzhou.

521
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,599
Go!

522
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Go!

523
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,240
This is the magistrate's office!

524
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,640
Both of you can't go inside without permission!

525
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
Magistrate.

526
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,680
We're ordered by Crown Prince...

527
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
to look for Princess Yong'an.

528
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
We need your people.

529
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,079
What can I help you with?

530
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,400
Just let me know.

531
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,960
Send your people...

532
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,279
to all the hideouts of refugees...

533
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,960
to look for the lady in the portrait.

534
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Yes.

535
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,000
This...

536
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,240
This...

537
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,880
Have you seen her?

538
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,440
Where is she?

539
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,400
She didn't have anything that can prove her identity.

540
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,440
I thought she's a refugee.

541
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,559
So I sent her away.

542
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,599
No matter what it takes,

543
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,240
you must find her!

544
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,920
Yes, sir.

545
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,920
Where are you going, Madam Chai?

546
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,480
- I'm taking a walk. - Are you leaving?

547
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,519
Your embroidery is awful.

548
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,920
You need to work on it to make money.

549
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,119
- All right, I get it. - No need.

550
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,559
Madam Xiang.

551
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,160
How is your business?

552
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,480
It's good.

553
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,880
You should burn more incense.

554
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,359
The pepper cookies are fragrant and crispy.

555
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,920
You're finally here.

556
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,759
- Yes. - Give me three of those.

557
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,400
There are so many of them.

558
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,519
- Three cookies are not enough. - Nonsense!

559
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,039
They should be grateful that they have food to eat.

560
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,720
They don't deserve pepper cookies.

561
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,839
Hurry up.

562
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:34,559
- I'm hungry. - All right. Hold on.

563
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,559
There are so many of them.

564
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,599
Look!

565
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,519
We're not doing charity.

566
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,240
Go somewhere else to beg for food.

567
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,559
I have money.

568
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,319
I want to buy some cookies.

569
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,960
You scared her.

570
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,400
One cookie is three cents.

571
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,640
Don't think that it's expensive.

572
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,680
The war is still going on.

573
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,759
The price of food is about the same.

574
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,160
Here, this is your cookie.

575
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,759
Young lady.

576
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,519
In broad daylight,

577
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,039
are you going to do that for a cookie?

578
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,359
Young lady!

579
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,200
I'm an honorable man.

580
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,039
It's three cents for a cookie.

581
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,920
I won't ask for anything else.

582
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,640
No. I'm afraid that someone else might steal it.

583
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,920
That's why I keep my pouch in the innermost layer.

584
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,920
I see.

585
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,720
I can tell right away that you know nothing about sewing.

586
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,279
What is that? The embroidery on the pouch is so ugly.

587
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
I think...

588
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,640
this is the prettiest pouch.

589
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,559
All right. Hold on.

590
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,400
Here's your cookie.

591
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,680
- Thank you. - All right.

592
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,599
Hey.

593
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,039
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,079
It's all right.

595
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,119
I've had something dirtier before.

596
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,359
If you don't mind,

597
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,279
I'll give you half.

598
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,799
I'll give you some.

599
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,759
- I didn't mean any harm. - Hey.

600
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,839
Nowadays,

601
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,680
kind-hearted people get bullied.

602
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,400
What are you waiting for? You should check your pouch.

603
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,720
You even thought of sharing the food with him.

604
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,400
You must be a fool.

605
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,319
Come and take a look.

606
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
My pouch.

607
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,079
My pouch!

608
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,680
Stop right there!

609
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,400
Stop right there!

610
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,559
My pouch!

611
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,720
Stop right there!

612
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,799
Stop right there!

613
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,400
Stop right there!

614
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,640
Give me back my pouch.

615
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,839
You can take the money.

616
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,119
Right.

617
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,279
Here. This is for you.

618
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,559
It's so ugly. What's this?

619
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,079
My hands got pricked in order to make that,

620
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,200
and you're even complaining that it's ugly.

621
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,799
- Forget it then. - It is ugly,

622
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,319
but I like it.

623
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,039
Chang Ge.

624
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,119
Where are you?

625
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,960
Have you seen the lady...

626
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,119
on the portrait?

627
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,289
No.

628
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,769
Have you seen this lady?

629
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,769
No.

630
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,119
This lady in the portrait,

631
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,400
have you seen her before?

632
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
No.

633
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,809
- Have you seen her before? - No.

634
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,289
You!

635
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,199
- No, I haven't seen her. - Are they...

636
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,519
Are they after me?

637
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,329
- You! - Stop right there!

638
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,809
After her!

639
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:45,809
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

640
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,679
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

641
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,360
- Stop right there! - Stop!

642
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,769
After her!

643
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,480
You lost your money.

644
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,920
Why are you following me?

645
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,599
They want to arrest me.

646
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,159
What did you do?

647
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,679
I didn't do anything wrong.

648
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,559
They accused me of pretending to be the princess.

649
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,679
Why did you do that?

650
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,519
Young lady.

651
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,119
Are you a fool?

652
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:43,440
I'm not pretending to be a princess. I really...

653
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,400
Open the door!

654
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,719
Open the door!

655
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,159
Coming.

656
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,440
Are you going to pay me if you break the door?

657
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,679
It's still daytime.

658
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,000
What's the rush?

659
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,809
Are you here to buy clothes?

660
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,329
We're chasing after a girl.

661
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,079
I saw her walking on this street.

662
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,079
Have you seen her before?

663
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,519
We're looking for her.

664
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:18,960
Yes, I have.

665
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:23,960
This lady was pickpocketed on the street earlier.

666
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,719
She went after the perpetrator, heading south.

667
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,289
Sir, what did she do?

668
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,119
Is she a robber?

669
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,239
This area is not safe lately.

670
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,559
- Search the place. - Hey!

671
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,400
Sir!

672
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,289
<i>Great virtue brings happiness</i>

673
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,400
What's the matter?

674
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,880
- I don't know. - What's wrong?

675
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,840
- We didn't find anything. - We didn't find anything.

676
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,039
She's not there either.

677
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,480
Sir, as I said, she's not here.

678
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,679
My textile workshop is operating.

679
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:36,199
You simply look around the workshop.

680
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,639
It will leave a bad impression.

681
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,679
That's enough.

682
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,199
If you see her again,

683
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,199
inform us right away.

684
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,599
Of course.

685
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,679
Let's go.

686
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
You're smart.

687
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,519
At least you hid in the tank.

688
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,559
Thank you for the help.

689
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:07,559
I thought you wouldn't save me.

690
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,719
That's enough.

691
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,809
You don't seem like a bad person.

692
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,360
They have nothing better to do.

693
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,289
You're just pretending to be a princess.

694
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Do they really have to do that?

695
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,719
Ma'am.

696
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,920
I'm not pretending.

697
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,639
I'm really a princess.

698
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,769
All right.

699
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,880
It doesn't matter if you're a princess or a lord.

700
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
I need to get back to work.

701
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,039
You should go.

702
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,440
Ma'am.

703
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,400
If I go out right now,

704
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,840
I'll get caught.

705
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,039
I beg you.

706
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,679
Please let me stay here for one more day.

707
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,159
I beg you.

708
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,639
All right.

709
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:39,480
Go inside and get changed.

710
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,769
Don't blame me when you get sick.

711
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,809
Thank you, ma'am.

712
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,289
So this is the grassland.

713
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:01,880
It's so vast.

714
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,039
Madam Su Yi Li.

715
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,119
Do you have more cheese?

716
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,039
- Please keep some for me. - Sure.

717
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,440
Come to my tent later.

718
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,639
You can have as much as you want.

719
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,769
Your Highness, are there any presents for us?

720
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,480
Ye, everyone gets a present.

721
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,960
Ya Luo.

722
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,809
Your Highness, the herbs are ready.

723
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:23,880
Here they are.

724
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,599
Take a look.

725
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,639
It's not bad.

726
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,239
- Here, Your Highness. - Take a look.

727
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,480
Help yourself.

728
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,400
- There are presents! - I want this.

729
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,159
This is good.

730
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,719
- Look. - Let me see.

731
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,679
Uncle Shi Min, where is my reward?

732
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:44,809
- Where is my reward? - Where is my reward?

733
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,329
- Stand still. - Where is my reward?

734
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,440
Stand still and close your eyes.

735
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,039
Close your eyes. Close them.

736
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,719
What about me, Uncle Shi Min? Where's mine?

737
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,079
- Give it to me - I only have one pony.

738
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,880
- I'll give it if you can reach it. - Give it to me, Father!

739
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,519
Give it to me.

740
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,400
Father!

741
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,400
Uncle Shi Min!

742
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,480
Father, don't go against your words.

743
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
Father!

744
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,289
Uncle Shi Min!

745
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,920
Give it to me, Uncle Shi Min!

746
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,289
You promised me!

747
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,159
- Here, let me help you. - Thank you.

748
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,679
Not bad.

749
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,039
That was fun.

750
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,840
Hey!

751
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:41,199
You're good in Cuju, right?

752
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
This is for you.

753
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,039
Can we have the ball?

754
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,079
Here.

755
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,519
- Stop right there! - Come on!

756
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,519
Wait for me!

757
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,199
Slow down!

758
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,000
- Give it to me. - No.

759
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,840
I'll send the present home for them.

760
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,480
- Hold it properly. - Can you take it to him?

761
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,159
The pay is so low.

762
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,360
Madam Zhang, you should consider yourself lucky.

763
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,920
At least we still have work to do.

764
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,960
We won't be starving to death.

765
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,039
That's not bad.

766
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:31,840
You're right.

767
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,559
It's getting difficult to use the machine.

768
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,809
Yes.

769
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,920
Madam Chai.

770
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,519
You finally hired someone.

771
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,519
I found her on the street.

772
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,639
She'll leave tomorrow.

773
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,440
Greetings, everyone.

774
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,639
What are you looking at?

775
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:00,639
Get back to work!

776
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,440
She's so pretty.

777
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,329
What kind of salutation was that?

778
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,809
I don't know. It looks nice though.

779
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:13,809
Exactly.

780
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,329
Greetings, everyone.

781
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,329
That's not correct.

782
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:17,440
It's like this.

783
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:19,559
- No. - That's what she did.

784
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,880
You'll sleep here tonight.

785
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,679
You have to leave tomorrow.

786
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,289
I don't feed people for nothing.

787
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,289
Thank you, ma'am.

788
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:30,199
I will repay you someday.

789
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,599
Thank you.

790
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,039
What should I do tomorrow?

791
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:45,960
<i>Yunzhou County Office</i>

792
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,360
What did you say?

793
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:55,840
I didn't hear it clearly.

794
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,639
Please pardon me.

795
00:42:58,639 --> 00:42:59,769
Princess Yong'an...

796
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:01,880
We lost her.

797
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:05,400
It's fine if you can't find her.

798
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,840
What do you mean you lost her?

799
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,559
We saw a lady who looks like her on the street.

800
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:13,480
But she got away.

801
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,719
A lady who looks like her?

802
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,079
How did she run away?

803
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,840
Mr. Wei, we'll keep looking.

804
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,159
However, Princess Yong'an has feet.

805
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:23,840
We are unsure...

806
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,960
whether she's still in Yunzhou or not.

807
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,400
How dare you absolve yourself?

808
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,679
Yes.

809
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,960
We'll keep looking.

810
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,239
- I'll look for her tomorrow! - I'll look for her tomorrow!

811
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:34,559
- Get lost! - Get lost!

812
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:35,559
Yes, sir!

813
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,599
Yan Er.

814
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,559
Where are you?
