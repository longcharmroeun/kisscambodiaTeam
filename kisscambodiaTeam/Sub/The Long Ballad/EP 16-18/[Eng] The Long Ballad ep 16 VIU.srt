<i>The Long Ballad</i>

3
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>This is a work of fiction.</i>

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,759
<i>Episode 16</i>

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,479
Starting today,

6
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,679
you're just a slave in the Eagle Army.

7
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,679
What do you want me to do?

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,959
I want you to disappear from Tang.

9
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,800
I have the final say in deciding whether I'm dead or not.

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,440
What you say is useless.

11
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,520
That depends on your capability.

12
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,600
Keeping me by your side...

13
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,640
is like raising a tiger.

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,160
It makes no difference.

15
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,319
Make sure you survive first...

16
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,559
before you are worried about that.

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,720
The law of survival on the grasslands...

18
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,280
is only the strongest survives.

19
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,000
Behind me...

20
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,840
is Shuozhuo...

21
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,519
that has been looted but the people escaped the battle unscathed.

22
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,199
Behind it...

23
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:10,000
is endless mountains.

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,600
Beyond that...

25
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,919
is my homeland, a million miles away.

26
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,840
Chang'an.

27
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,560
In the end, I couldn't go back there.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,560
In the past, you achieved glory for the motherland.

29
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
Now, you're just a slave.

30
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Li Chang Ge.

31
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,720
Even I feel bad for you.

32
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,079
<i>Fuju Inn</i>

33
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,199
After receiving the order,

34
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,519
I hurried here right away.

35
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,519
Please give me your instructions, Commander Hao.

36
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,799
Follow Ashina Tribe at once.

37
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,120
I want to know what happened to Li Chang Ge in the end.

38
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,160
Should I kill her?

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,120
If she colludes with Ashina Tribe,

40
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,239
kill her.

41
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,400
What if she doesn't?

42
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,280
Ashina Tribe won't keep her.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,039
Yes.

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,720
Send whatever news you have...

45
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,759
through the pigeon.

46
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:10,799
You may leave.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,199
Yes.

48
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,919
The people dearest to me...

49
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,160
were all slaughtered like pigs and dogs.

50
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,400
The place I was born and raised...

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,080
banished me.

52
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,039
I felt like dying every single day.

53
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,210
But I had to do what I had to do.

54
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,330
Once this is over,

55
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,799
it won't be too late to kill me.

56
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,960
<i>Noble and integrate</i>

57
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,559
Li Chang Ge.

58
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,330
I hope you can sacrifice for the people.

59
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,239
Recently,

60
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,879
all the county offices around the kingdom...

61
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,160
are secretly looking for the princess.

62
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,770
However, the portrait that was sent to the capital...

63
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,080
looks nothing like the princess.

64
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,239
Furthermore, the princess lost in the four states in the north.

65
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,239
Until now,

66
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,600
we haven't heard anything yet.

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Your Highness.

68
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,840
Princess Yong'an is very blessed.

69
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,919
Didn't Li Chun Feng make a prediction...

70
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,239
that she'll come back safely?

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,960
I hope so.

72
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,280
Lately,

73
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,650
I always dreamed of...

74
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,999
Le Yan and Chang Ge when they were younger.

75
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:30,840
Both of them...

76
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,999
were hanging around in the garden.

77
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,200
I waved at them...

78
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,239
but they couldn't see me.

79
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,520
I called out their names.

80
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,280
But they couldn't hear me either.

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,919
Worse,

82
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,559
they kept running away.

83
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,640
Your Highness...

84
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,119
worries too much.

85
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,160
That's why...

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,600
Your Highness had weird dreams.

87
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,679
Your Highness, I'll get the imperial kitchen...

88
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,879
to make some soothing soup for Your Highness.

89
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,799
Will those two girls...

90
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,200
be further away from me?

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,080
No.

92
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,520
They will always be...

93
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,080
the most daring daughter and official to you.

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Perhaps at this moment,

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,439
no news is the best news.

96
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,160
That's right.

97
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,400
Your Highness, there is urgent military news.

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Ashina Tribe suddenly attacked the north border.

99
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,679
The chief commander, Sima Tu...

100
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,720
and the governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng...

101
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,320
were killed in the battle.

102
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,160
When did it happen?

103
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,799
No one reported it!

104
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,600
Ashina Tribe besieged the city.

105
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,080
The frontier couldn't deliver the message.

106
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,160
Hao Du sent his men to speed things up.

107
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,760
Five horses were sacrificed...

108
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
before the news reached Chang'an.

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,960
Send our army there now to regain the north region.

110
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,520
Make sure we chase the Ashina Tribe out of the border.

111
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,039
After that,

112
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,479
the troops will camp at the same place...

113
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,840
to comfort the people in the north.

114
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,039
Yes, Your Highness.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Mr. Du.

116
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,439
Mr. Du.

117
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,760
I need to talk to you.

118
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,840
You always know your own mind.

119
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,039
What do you want to discuss with me?

120
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,400
Mr. Du, don't be sarcastic.

121
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,400
You and I are the ministers of the imperial court.

122
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,799
It's good to have someone to discuss with.

123
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,239
Furthermore,

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,439
I really need a favor from you.

125
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,200
Just tell me what it is.

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,960
As you know,

127
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,720
Princess Yong'an is missing in action.

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,080
It's His Highness's biggest concern.

129
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,520
The portrait of Princess Yong'an...

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,119
has been sent to all local government offices...

131
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,679
for a secret investigation.

132
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,799
However, Princess Yong'an is nowhere to be found.

133
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,600
But we didn't receive any news...

134
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,359
from the north.

135
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm just worried.

136
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,119
What do you want me to do?

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,799
People in the north...

138
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,160
have never seen Princess Yong'an before.

139
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,760
Your godson is in the north, right?

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Although Wei Shu Yu...

141
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,799
allegedly lost her,

142
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
at that time,

143
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,679
your godson, Hao Du...

144
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,919
was with Princess Yong'an.

145
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,280
The more collaborative the effort,

146
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,039
the better.

147
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,520
Furthermore, under your guidance,

148
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
- your godson is already... - That's enough.

149
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,359
Talk properly.

150
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,359
Don't flatter me.

151
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Since His Highness...

152
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,999
has entrusted you with this case,

153
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,799
you should work on it.

154
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,600
Yes.

155
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,810
Eat up.

156
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,239
Here.

157
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,159
What's the point of keeping him here?

158
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,359
If you ask me, I'll just kill him.

159
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
- Hold on. - Here.

160
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,050
Leave it there.

161
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,050
Give me more.

162
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,359
Here.

163
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,879
Where are you going?

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,279
I didn't expect to see you here.

165
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,320
Here.

166
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,239
Actually, the Eagle Army...

167
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,600
isn't too far from Shuozhou.

168
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,690
It's near a river and there are trees.

169
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,930
You'll get used to it.

170
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,999
Eat up.

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,690
Let me tell you.

172
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,159
If His Highness didn't care about you,

173
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,639
I wouldn't care about you either.

174
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,560
My goodness.

175
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,119
Your friend is insensible.

176
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,080
I think you're wasting your effort on him.

177
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,810
Look at that body.

178
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,960
I don't think he can survive in the grasslands.

179
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
No, he'll survive.

180
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,560
How do you know that?

181
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,050
He is someone who has a strong desire to live.

182
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,440
He won't be defeated...

183
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,320
so easily.

184
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,119
It looks like...

185
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,639
you know him very well.

186
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,200
But I think...

187
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:05,440
you're just the enemy to him.

188
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,930
It doesn't matter.

189
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,930
You've never treated me so nicely after all these years.

190
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:30,999
That person...

191
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,399
has been following us for a long time.

192
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,479
I know.

193
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,119
He's here to see Shi Si Lang.

194
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,479
Do something for me.

195
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,239
What are you doing?

196
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,399
Let go!

197
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,960
Listen to me.

198
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,519
You're our slave.

199
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,080
Just do whatever I tell you to do.

200
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,600
What?

201
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,159
Are you refusing to work?

202
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,239
You must have a death wish.

203
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,239
Take him away.

204
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,440
Cut him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!

205
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,600
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

206
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,720
What are you doing?

207
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,800
What are you doing?

208
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,999
Let go of me!

209
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,800
Let go!

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,359
Come on!

211
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,440
Let go!

212
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,479
Come on!

213
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Elder Qin.

214
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,359
I feel bad for Yuan Niang.

215
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,320
She has been homeless and travels with us for so long.

216
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,239
Not at all.

217
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,159
She has the best father and mother in the world.

218
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,920
How is Shuozhou doing?

219
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,600
I heard that...

220
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,200
the Ashina Tribe has left.

221
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,040
Someone from the imperial court will come and take over the rest.

222
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,359
Aside from that...

223
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,159
"Aside from that"?

224
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,519
Are you going to tell me...

225
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,200
about Young Master?

226
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,479
He failed in the assassination.

227
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,479
He was killed.

228
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
I see. He's...

229
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,759
He's too strong and impulsive.

230
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,119
It's easy to destroy those who are strong and impulsive.

231
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,920
If...

232
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,920
Stop it.

233
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,600
I think Young Master...

234
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,279
is still alive.

235
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,200
He's still alive?

236
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,479
Since Ashina Sun...

237
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,680
made a promise with Governor Gongsun,

238
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,840
he won't kill him for sure.

239
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,080
Perhaps he has brought him to the grasslands.

240
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,800
Let's not wait any longer.

241
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,759
- Let's look for him. - In the grasslands,

242
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,680
they have spies everywhere.

243
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,440
We can't barge in as we like.

244
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,359
Let's take care of Yuan Niang first.

245
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,040
We should use our previous connection...

246
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,279
and see if we can get some information.

247
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,359
Then I'll make a decision.

248
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:27,560
<i>Someone has been executed by Ashina Sun.</i>

249
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,759
Li Chang Ge.

250
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
Perhaps this is the best place for you.

251
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,680
Why are you here?

252
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,759
That's my question for you.

253
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,440
Losing the princess is a serious matter...

254
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,359
yet His Highness didn't blame you.

255
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,519
I'll find Le Yan for sure.

256
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,639
I'll wait and see.

257
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,119
It has been so long.

258
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,399
You didn't return to Chang'an.

259
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,639
Are you looking for Chang Ge?

260
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
What happened to her?

261
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
She's dead.

262
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,800
How did she die?

263
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,440
Did you kill her?

264
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Tell me!

265
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,239
Wei Shu Yu.

266
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,639
Do you plan to sacrifice yourself and your family...

267
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
just to avenge your lover?

268
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,960
After killing you,

269
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,759
I'll kill myself to atone for it.

270
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,600
Do you think that His Highness...

271
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,960
will punish the Wei family just for you?

272
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,560
Then why didn't you do it?

273
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,600
When Li Chang Ge was alive, you couldn't do anything.

274
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,639
Now that she's dead,

275
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,840
you found the courage to take revenge.

276
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,879
I guess,

277
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,239
that's because you know that since Li Chang Ge is dead,

278
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,479
your family's glory won't be affected.

279
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,879
Even if you want revenge,

280
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,999
you've come to the wrong person.

281
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,279
I didn't kill Li Chang Ge.

282
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,320
It was done by Ashina Tribe.

283
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,279
Ashina Tribe?

284
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:31,159
Ashina Tribe invaded Shuozhou.

285
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,879
Li Chang Ge was captured by them.

286
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,759
With that temper of hers,

287
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,999
do you think she can survive?

288
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,200
I can't believe you went after me with him.

289
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,999
From now on,

290
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,279
we're no longer related.

291
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,479
From now on,

292
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,399
I won't rely on anyone else but myself.

293
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,159
Le Yan gave me an amulet. But what's the point?

294
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
In the end,

295
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,600
I failed to protect both of them.

296
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,040
That's enough.

297
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,800
Li Chang Ge is no longer here.

298
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,600
Make sure Princess Yong'an is safe.

299
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,999
Also,

300
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,680
I received a message from Chang'an.

301
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,119
They want me to stay at the north border...

302
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,200
to look for Princess Yong'an.

303
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,600
Obviously,

304
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,960
they don't trust you.

305
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,720
I'll make sure I find Le Yan before you do.

306
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,359
It doesn't matter.

307
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,720
I won't compete with you.

308
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,159
But I'll give you a hint.

309
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,320
In Shuozhou, Li Chang Ge...

310
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,040
is the Commandant of Light Chariot known by everyone.

311
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,119
If Princess Yong'an is in Shuozhou,

312
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,440
there must be a trace of her.

313
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,399
So, your trip to Shuozhuo...

314
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,519
is in vain.

315
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,680
<i>Fuju Inn</i>

316
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,600
What happened last night?

317
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,199
Why did you knock me out after covering my head?

318
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:28,560
Why didn't you kill me?

319
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,919
Last night, a slave died for you.

320
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,280
Take him away.

321
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,359
Cut him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!

322
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,359
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

323
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:39,320
- Let go of me! - Come on.

324
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:40,879
Let go!

325
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,010
Come on.

326
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,250
Come on.

327
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,959
Don't move.

328
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:53,959
Hurry up.

329
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,639
What is Ashina Sun doing?

330
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,639
I don't get him either.

331
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:13,679
If I were him,

332
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,919
I would have lost my patience a long time ago.

333
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,010
What a slave.

334
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,359
You're already challenging the limit of Eagle Army.

335
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,600
If I don't torture you,

336
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,080
you won't know how great we are.

337
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,359
You look fragile.

338
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,199
What's the point of bringing you back?

339
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:53,879
<i>Yunzhou County Office</i>

340
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:57,679
This way, please.

341
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,010
Excuse me.

342
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,250
Are you the magistrate?

343
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,600
Where do you come from?

344
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,719
You can't even recognize the magistrate.

345
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,800
Magistrate, I need a favor.

346
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,879
How dare you!

347
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:10,959
You have no manners.

348
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,199
He has work to attend to.

349
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,280
Move.

350
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,439
Magistrate.

351
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,719
You are the magistrate of Yunzhou.

352
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,080
If I didn't have an urgent request,

353
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,439
I wouldn't be so bold.

354
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,439
Go.

355
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,600
Hit the drum if you are seeking justice.

356
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,919
What brings you here?

357
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,080
Please listen to me.

358
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,600
I can't reveal my identity there.

359
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,280
If you don't mind,

360
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:41,770
can you help me send a message to Chang'an...

361
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,010
or Luoyang?

362
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,280
Who are you?

363
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,399
I'm Princess Yong'an.

364
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,840
I accidentally got separated from my guards.

365
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,080
After the siege,

366
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,520
I escaped to this place.

367
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,639
Magistrate.

368
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,080
If you could help me get home,

369
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,250
His Highness will reward you heavily for sure.

370
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,439
Do you have any proof?

371
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,600
Proof?

372
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,359
When I got separated from my guards,

373
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,010
I didn't bring any tokens.

374
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,159
But I really am a princess.

375
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:16,719
The title was conferred by my grandfather.

376
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:19,040
Do you have any carry-on piece from the palace?

377
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,320
Handmade items from the palace that is easy to recognize.

378
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,600
All of them were taken away from me.

379
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:27,010
Where did you get that information from?

380
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,560
You're quite nimble.

381
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,399
There is indeed a secret order from the imperial court...

382
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,600
to find a princess in secret.

383
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,770
Just because you claim that you're a princess,

384
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,770
it doesn't mean that you are one.

385
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
I knew that my father would look for me.

386
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,520
Magistrate.

387
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm really a princess.

388
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,919
Trust me. It's true.

389
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:45,879
Magistrate, please! Please send a message to Luoyang!

390
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,119
You can be sentenced to corporal punishment for imitation.

391
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,080
- I'm really a princess. - You two. Arrest her!

392
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,119
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

393
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,199
Magistrate!

394
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,250
Magistrate...

395
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,520
Why don't you believe me?

396
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,600
What are you waiting for? Arrest her!

397
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,770
That's enough.

398
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,770
Let her go.

399
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,359
She's just a poor thing who doesn't have a choice.

400
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,439
It's very chaotic here.

401
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:08,250
The new governor will be here soon.

402
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,119
I don't have the time to deal with a refugee.

403
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,879
Be careful.

405

Father.

406
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,600
Why didn't you come and fetch me?

407
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Are you abandoning me?

If you have too much energy,

410
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,679
you may go for a run.

411
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,159
I just don't get it.

412
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:28,359
What do you plan to do with Shi Si Lang?

413
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,000
You tried so hard to save Shi Si Lang.

414
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,240
Now, you're just ignoring him...

415
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
and let him be bullied by everyone.

416
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,000
You're getting weirder.

417
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,520
The more I pay attention to him,

418
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,919
the more he will suffer.

419
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:44,159
Rather than making him hate himself,

420
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,840
just let him hate me.

421
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,359
You are really odd!

422
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,480
Did he bewitch you?

423
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,199
Should I summon a shaman?

424
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,119
Do you want to clean horse manure?

425
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,639
Why should I?

426
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:00,679
I'm Eagle Army's military adviser.

427
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,320
Can you at least let me save my face?

428
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,280
He has to get a foothold...

429
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,600
in the Eagle Army on his own.

430
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,800
I can't be monitoring him all the time.

431
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:13,359
He's just a witty-minded man from the Central Plain.

432
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,959
Is he even worth the effort?

433
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,240
He is not grateful to you at all.

434
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,199
I don't need him to be grateful to me.

435
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,240
I just want him to live.

Your Highness and Military Adviser.

437
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:31,159
The slave that you told me to keep an eye on has passed out.

438
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,240
You're exhausted from protecting Shuozhou.

439
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,399
You didn't eat or drink throughout the journey.

440
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,959
You don't want to live anymore.

441
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:05,639
What's wrong?

442
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:07,639
Are you afraid that I might do something to you?

443
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,159
I'm not interested in a woman like you.

444
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
How do you know?

445
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:17,000
I found out when I saved you at the river.

446
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,919
Since you want to hide it,

447
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,080
I didn't bother to expose you.

448
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,000
You've been playing me this whole time.

449
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,399
Think of it however you want.

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,679
Your Highness.

451
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,919
This is the medicine you asked for.

452
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,280
The shaman said you're worrying too much.

453
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,560
Hence, you have weak energy.

454
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,800
If you don't want to die,

455
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:49,719
take the medicine.

456
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,119
Take the medicine.

457
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,000
Li Shi Si!

458
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,520
I'm surprised at how weak you are!

459
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,119
People in Shuozhou are sound and safe.

460
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,560
I have kept my promise.

461
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,760
It's your turn now.

462
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Don't forget...

463
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,600
your life belongs to me now.

464
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,959
What a joke.

465
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,159
You want someone from the Central Plain to serve you.

466
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,199
Why don't you just kill me?

467
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,399
You'll regret it soon.

468
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,560
I won't repeat myself.

469
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,359
Take your medicine.

470
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,560
Is that how you solve problems?

471
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,919
It's better than enduring a life of humiliation.

472
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,080
Since my life is in your hands,

473
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,679
you don't have to humiliate me!

474
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,439
Humiliate you?

475
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,679
I just don't want you to die so easily!

476
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,919
Li Shi Si.

477
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:02,840
You'd better find a way to survive.

478
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Do it so that you can live long enough to kill me one day soon.

479
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,040
Do it so that you can avenge Gongsun Heng!

480
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,280
Avenge?

481
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,520
Yes.

482
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,080
Avenge.

483
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:17,719
Avenge Gongsun Heng.

484
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,000
Avenge the troops and people of Shuozhuo.

485
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,199
Have you forgotten about it?

486
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,639
Gongsun Heng is ridiculous.

487
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
How could he trust a coward?

488
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,560
If I were you,

489
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,240
I would gain a firm footing in the Eagle Army at all costs.

490
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:37,320
I would gain the trust of the people around me at all costs...

491
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,840
and wait for the right time to strike!

492
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,919
If you don't want to let him down,

493
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
you should clench your teeth and live.

494
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:54,240
Being able to entrust the lives of the civilians in Shuozhou City...

495
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
to a Tang princess...

496
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,320
and commit an act of benevolence...

497
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,639
is considered a happy ending for me.

498
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,919
<i>Shuozhou</i>

499
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,879
In the city,

500
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,600
there are thousands of families.

501
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:07,840
I can't let them down.

502
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:10,399
But in the end,

503
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:12,480
I'll have to let my wife and daughter down.

504
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,679
Dou!

505
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,719
It's not just about avenging Governor Gongsun.

506
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,199
It's not just about avenging Shuozhou.

507
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Yes.

508
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,000
How could I die just like that?

509
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,560
How could I die here?

510
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,639
It's easy to die.

511
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,439
Living has always been the hardest.

512
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,199
Go!

513
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Go!

514
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Stop.

515
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:21,679
Stop.

516
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Let's go.

517
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,639
Don't go there.

518
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,439
We came from that direction.

519
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,439
Yan Er is not there.

520
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,760
Let's go to Yunzhou.

521
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,199
Go!

522
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Go!

523
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,840
This is the magistrate's office!

524
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,240
Both of you can't go inside without permission!

525
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Magistrate.

526
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,280
We're ordered by Crown Prince...

527
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,600
to look for Princess Yong'an.

528
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,080
We need your people.

529
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,679
What can I help you with?

530
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,000
Just let me know.

531
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,560
Send your people...

532
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,879
to all the hideouts of refugees...

533
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,560
to look for the lady in the portrait.

534
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Yes.

535
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,600
This...

536
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,840
This...

537
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,480
Have you seen her?

538
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,040
Where is she?

539
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,000
She didn't have anything that can prove her identity.

540
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,040
I thought she's a refugee.

541
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,159
So I sent her away.

542
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:02,199
No matter what it takes,

543
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,840
you must find her!

544
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
Yes, sir.

545
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,520
Where are you going, Madam Chai?

546
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,080
- I'm taking a walk. - Are you leaving?

547
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,119
Your embroidery is awful.

548
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,520
You need to work on it to make money.

549
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,719
- All right, I get it. - No need.

550
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,159
Madam Xiang.

551
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,760
How is your business?

552
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,080
It's good.

553
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,480
You should burn more incense.

554
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,959
The pepper cookies are fragrant and crispy.

555
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,520
You're finally here.

556
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,359
- Yes. - Give me three of those.

557
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,000
There are so many of them.

558
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,119
- Three cookies are not enough. - Nonsense!

559
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,639
They should be grateful that they have food to eat.

560
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:36,320
They don't deserve pepper cookies.

561
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,439
Hurry up.

562
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:40,159
- I'm hungry. - All right. Hold on.

563
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,159
There are so many of them.

564
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,199
Look!

565
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,119
We're not doing charity.

566
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,840
Go somewhere else to beg for food.

567
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,159
I have money.

568
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:53,919
I want to buy some cookies.

569
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,560
You scared her.

570
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,000
One cookie is three cents.

571
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
Don't think that it's expensive.

572
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,280
The war is still going on.

573
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,359
The price of food is about the same.

574
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,760
Here, this is your cookie.

575
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,359
Young lady.

576
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,119
In broad daylight,

577
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,639
are you going to do that for a cookie?

578
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,959
Young lady!

579
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,800
I'm an honorable man.

580
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,639
It's three cents for a cookie.

581
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,520
I won't ask for anything else.

582
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,240
No. I'm afraid that someone else might steal it.

583
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,520
That's why I keep my pouch in the innermost layer.

584
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,520
I see.

585
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,320
I can tell right away that you know nothing about sewing.

586
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,879
What is that? The embroidery on the pouch is so ugly.

587
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
I think...

588
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,240
this is the prettiest pouch.

589
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,159
All right. Hold on.

590
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:58,000
Here's your cookie.

591
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,280
- Thank you. - All right.

592
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,199
Hey.

593
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,639
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:19,679
It's all right.

595
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,719
I've had something dirtier before.

596
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,959
If you don't mind,

597
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,879
I'll give you half.

598
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,399
I'll give you some.

599
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,359
- I didn't mean any harm. - Hey.

600
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,439
Nowadays,

601
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:38,280
kind-hearted people get bullied.

602
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,000
What are you waiting for? You should check your pouch.

603
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,320
You even thought of sharing the food with him.

604
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,000
You must be a fool.

605
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,919
Come and take a look.

606
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
My pouch.

607
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,679
My pouch!

608
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,280
Stop right there!

609
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,000
Stop right there!

610
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,159
My pouch!

611
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,320
Stop right there!

612
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,399
Stop right there!

613
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,000
Stop right there!

614
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,240
Give me back my pouch.

615
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,439
You can take the money.

616
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:44,719
Right.

617
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:45,879
Here. This is for you.

618
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,159
It's so ugly. What's this?

619
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,679
My hands got pricked in order to make that,

620
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:53,800
and you're even complaining that it's ugly.

621
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,399
- Forget it then. - It is ugly,

622
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,919
but I like it.

623
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,639
Chang Ge.

624
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,719
Where are you?

625
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,560
Have you seen the lady...

626
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,719
on the portrait?

627
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:24,889
No.

628
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:27,369
Have you seen this lady?

629
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:28,369
No.

630
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,719
This lady in the portrait,

631
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,000
have you seen her before?

632
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
No.

633
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,409
- Have you seen her before? - No.

634
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:37,889
You!

635
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,799
- No, I haven't seen her. - Are they...

636
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:41,119
Are they after me?

637
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,929
- You! - Stop right there!

638
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,409
After her!

639
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,409
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

640
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:53,279
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

641
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:54,960
- Stop right there! - Stop!

642
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,369
After her!

643
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,080
You lost your money.

644
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,520
Why are you following me?

645
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,199
They want to arrest me.

646
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,759
What did you do?

647
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,279
I didn't do anything wrong.

648
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,159
They accused me of pretending to be the princess.

649
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:43,279
Why did you do that?

650
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:45,119
Young lady.

651
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,719
Are you a fool?

652
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:49,040
I'm not pretending to be a princess. I really...

653
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
Open the door!

654
00:35:58,319 --> 00:35:59,319
Open the door!

655
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,759
Coming.

656
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,040
Are you going to pay me if you break the door?

657
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,279
It's still daytime.

658
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,600
What's the rush?

659
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,409
Are you here to buy clothes?

660
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,929
We're chasing after a girl.

661
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,679
I saw her walking on this street.

662
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,679
Have you seen her before?

663
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,119
We're looking for her.

664
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:24,560
Yes, I have.

665
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:29,560
This lady was pickpocketed on the street earlier.

666
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,319
She went after the perpetrator, heading south.

667
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:34,889
Sir, what did she do?

668
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:36,719
Is she a robber?

669
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,839
This area is not safe lately.

670
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,159
- Search the place. - Hey!

671
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,000
Sir!

672
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,889
<i>Great virtue brings happiness</i>

673
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:09,000
What's the matter?

674
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:11,480
- I don't know. - What's wrong?

675
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,440
- We didn't find anything. - We didn't find anything.

676
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,639
She's not there either.

677
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:37,080
Sir, as I said, she's not here.

678
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,279
My textile workshop is operating.

679
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:41,799
You simply look around the workshop.

680
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,239
It will leave a bad impression.

681
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,279
That's enough.

682
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,799
If you see her again,

683
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:46,799
inform us right away.

684
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,199
Of course.

685
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,279
Let's go.

686
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You're smart.

687
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,119
At least you hid in the tank.

688
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,159
Thank you for the help.

689
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,159
I thought you wouldn't save me.

690
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:14,319
That's enough.

691
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,409
You don't seem like a bad person.

692
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,960
They have nothing better to do.

693
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,889
You're just pretending to be a princess.

694
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Do they really have to do that?

695
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,319
Ma'am.

696
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:24,520
I'm not pretending.

697
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:26,239
I'm really a princess.

698
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,369
All right.

699
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,480
It doesn't matter if you're a princess or a lord.

700
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
I need to get back to work.

701
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,639
You should go.

702
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,040
Ma'am.

703
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,000
If I go out right now,

704
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,440
I'll get caught.

705
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,639
I beg you.

706
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,279
Please let me stay here for one more day.

707
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:40,759
I beg you.

708
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,239
All right.

709
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:45,080
Go inside and get changed.

710
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,369
Don't blame me when you get sick.

711
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,409
Thank you, ma'am.

712
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:03,889
So this is the grassland.

713
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:07,480
It's so vast.

714
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,639
Madam Su Yi Li.

715
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,719
Do you have more cheese?

716
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,639
- Please keep some for me. - Sure.

717
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,040
Come to my tent later.

718
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,239
You can have as much as you want.

719
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,369
Your Highness, are there any presents for us?

720
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:23,080
Ye, everyone gets a present.

721
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,560
Ya Luo.

722
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,409
Your Highness, the herbs are ready.

723
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:29,480
Here they are.

724
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,199
Take a look.

725
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,239
It's not bad.

726
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:37,839
- Here, Your Highness. - Take a look.

727
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,080
Help yourself.

728
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:41,000
- There are presents! - I want this.

729
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:44,759
This is good.

730
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,319
- Look. - Let me see.

731
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:49,279
Uncle Shi Min, where is my reward?

732
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:50,409
- Where is my reward? - Where is my reward?

733
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:51,929
- Stand still. - Where is my reward?

734
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:53,040
Stand still and close your eyes.

735
00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:54,639
Close your eyes. Close them.

736
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:01,319
What about me, Uncle Shi Min? Where's mine?

737
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:02,679
- Give it to me - I only have one pony.

738
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:06,480
- I'll give it if you can reach it. - Give it to me, Father!

739
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,119
Give it to me.

740
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,000
Father!

741
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,000
Uncle Shi Min!

742
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,080
Father, don't go against your words.

743
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Father!

744
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:23,889
Uncle Shi Min!

745
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,520
Give it to me, Uncle Shi Min!

746
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:28,889
You promised me!

747
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,759
- Here, let me help you. - Thank you.

748
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,279
Not bad.

749
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,639
That was fun.

750
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,440
Hey!

751
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,799
You're good in Cuju, right?

752
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
This is for you.

753
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,639
Can we have the ball?

754
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:58,679
Here.

755
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,119
- Stop right there! - Come on!

756
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,119
Wait for me!

757
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,799
Slow down!

758
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,600
- Give it to me. - No.

759
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,440
I'll send the present home for them.

760
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,080
- Hold it properly. - Can you take it to him?

761
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:29,759
The pay is so low.

762
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,960
Madam Zhang, you should consider yourself lucky.

763
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,520
At least we still have work to do.

764
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,560
We won't be starving to death.

765
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,639
That's not bad.

766
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:37,440
You're right.

767
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,159
It's getting difficult to use the machine.

768
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:40,409
Yes.

769
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,520
Madam Chai.

770
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,119
You finally hired someone.

771
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,119
I found her on the street.

772
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,239
She'll leave tomorrow.

773
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,040
Greetings, everyone.

774
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,239
What are you looking at?

775
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,239
Get back to work!

776
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,040
She's so pretty.

777
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,929
What kind of salutation was that?

778
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:18,409
I don't know. It looks nice though.

779
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:19,409
Exactly.

780
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,929
Greetings, everyone.

781
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:21,929
That's not correct.

782
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:23,040
It's like this.

783
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:25,159
- No. - That's what she did.

784
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:28,480
You'll sleep here tonight.

785
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,279
You have to leave tomorrow.

786
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,889
I don't feed people for nothing.

787
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,889
Thank you, ma'am.

788
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:35,799
I will repay you someday.

789
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,199
Thank you.

790
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,639
What should I do tomorrow?

791
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:51,560
<i>Yunzhou County Office</i>

792
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,960
What did you say?

793
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,440
I didn't hear it clearly.

794
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,239
Please pardon me.

795
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,369
Princess Yong'an...

796
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,480
We lost her.

797
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:11,000
It's fine if you can't find her.

798
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,440
What do you mean you lost her?

799
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,159
We saw a lady who looks like her on the street.

800
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,080
But she got away.

801
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,319
A lady who looks like her?

802
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,679
How did she run away?

803
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,440
Mr. Wei, we'll keep looking.

804
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,759
However, Princess Yong'an has feet.

805
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:29,440
We are unsure...

806
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,560
whether she's still in Yunzhou or not.

807
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,000
How dare you absolve yourself?

808
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:34,279
Yes.

809
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,560
We'll keep looking.

810
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,839
- I'll look for her tomorrow! - I'll look for her tomorrow!

811
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,159
- Get lost! - Get lost!

812
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,159
Yes, sir!

813
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:47,199
Yan Er.

814
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,159
Where are you?
