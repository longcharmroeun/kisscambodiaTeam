<i>The Long Ballad</i>

3
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,580
<i>This is a work of fiction.</i>

4
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,459
<i>Episode 16</i>

5
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,179
Starting today,

6
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,379
you're just a slave in the Eagle Army.

7
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,379
What do you want me to do?

8
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,659
I want you to disappear from Tang.

9
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,500
I have the final say in deciding whether I'm dead or not.

10
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,140
What you say is useless.

11
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,220
That depends on your capability.

12
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,300
Keeping me by your side...

13
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,340
is like raising a tiger.

14
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,860
It makes no difference.

15
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,019
Make sure you survive first...

16
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,259
before you are worried about that.

17
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,420
The law of survival on the grasslands...

18
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,980
is only the strongest survives.

19
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,700
Behind me...

20
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:02,540
is Shuozhuo...

21
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,219
that has been looted but the people escaped the battle unscathed.

22
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,899
Behind it...

23
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,700
is endless mountains.

24
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,300
Beyond that...

25
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,619
is my homeland, a million miles away.

26
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,540
Chang'an.

27
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,260
In the end, I couldn't go back there.

28
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,260
In the past, you achieved glory for the motherland.

29
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,660
Now, you're just a slave.

30
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,580
Li Chang Ge.

31
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,420
Even I feel bad for you.

32
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:45,779
<i>Fuju Inn</i>

33
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:46,899
After receiving the order,

34
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:48,219
I hurried here right away.

35
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,219
Please give me your instructions, Commander Hao.

36
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,499
Follow Ashina Tribe at once.

37
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:53,820
I want to know what happened to Li Chang Ge in the end.

38
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,860
Should I kill her?

39
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,820
If she colludes with Ashina Tribe,

40
00:03:58,899 --> 00:03:59,939
kill her.

41
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,100
What if she doesn't?

42
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:03,980
Ashina Tribe won't keep her.

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,739
Yes.

44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,420
Send whatever news you have...

45
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,459
through the pigeon.

46
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,499
You may leave.

47
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,899
Yes.

48
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,619
The people dearest to me...

49
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,860
were all slaughtered like pigs and dogs.

50
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,100
The place I was born and raised...

51
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,780
banished me.

52
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,739
I felt like dying every single day.

53
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,910
But I had to do what I had to do.

54
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,030
Once this is over,

55
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,499
it won't be too late to kill me.

56
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:41,660
<i>Noble and integrate</i>

57
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:43,259
Li Chang Ge.

58
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,030
I hope you can sacrifice for the people.

59
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,939
Recently,

60
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,579
all the county offices around the kingdom...

61
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,860
are secretly looking for the princess.

62
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,470
However, the portrait that was sent to the capital...

63
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,780
looks nothing like the princess.

64
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,939
Furthermore, the princess lost in the four states in the north.

65
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:04,939
Until now,

66
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,300
we haven't heard anything yet.

67
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Your Highness.

68
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,540
Princess Yong'an is very blessed.

69
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,619
Didn't Li Chun Feng make a prediction...

70
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,939
that she'll come back safely?

71
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,660
I hope so.

72
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,980
Lately,

73
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,350
I always dreamed of...

74
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,699
Le Yan and Chang Ge when they were younger.

75
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:31,540
Both of them...

76
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,699
were hanging around in the garden.

77
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:35,900
I waved at them...

78
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:37,939
but they couldn't see me.

79
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:40,220
I called out their names.

80
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:41,980
But they couldn't hear me either.

81
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,619
Worse,

82
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:45,259
they kept running away.

83
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:51,340
Your Highness...

84
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,819
worries too much.

85
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,860
That's why...

86
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,300
Your Highness had weird dreams.

87
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,379
Your Highness, I'll get the imperial kitchen...

88
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,579
to make some soothing soup for Your Highness.

89
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,499
Will those two girls...

90
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,900
be further away from me?

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,780
No.

92
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,220
They will always be...

93
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,780
the most daring daughter and official to you.

94
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,780
Perhaps at this moment,

95
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,139
no news is the best news.

96
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,860
That's right.

97
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,100
Your Highness, there is urgent military news.

98
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Ashina Tribe suddenly attacked the north border.

99
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,379
The chief commander, Sima Tu...

100
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,420
and the governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng...

101
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,020
were killed in the battle.

102
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,860
When did it happen?

103
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,499
No one reported it!

104
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,300
Ashina Tribe besieged the city.

105
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,780
The frontier couldn't deliver the message.

106
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,860
Hao Du sent his men to speed things up.

107
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,460
Five horses were sacrificed...

108
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,460
before the news reached Chang'an.

109
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,660
Send our army there now to regain the north region.

110
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,220
Make sure we chase the Ashina Tribe out of the border.

111
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,739
After that,

112
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,179
the troops will camp at the same place...

113
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,540
to comfort the people in the north.

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,739
Yes, Your Highness.

115
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Mr. Du.

116
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,139
Mr. Du.

117
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,460
I need to talk to you.

118
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,540
You always know your own mind.

119
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,739
What do you want to discuss with me?

120
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:26,100
Mr. Du, don't be sarcastic.

121
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,100
You and I are the ministers of the imperial court.

122
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,499
It's good to have someone to discuss with.

123
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:31,939
Furthermore,

124
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,139
I really need a favor from you.

125
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,900
Just tell me what it is.

126
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,660
As you know,

127
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,420
Princess Yong'an is missing in action.

128
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,780
It's His Highness's biggest concern.

129
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,220
The portrait of Princess Yong'an...

130
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,819
has been sent to all local government offices...

131
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,379
for a secret investigation.

132
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,499
However, Princess Yong'an is nowhere to be found.

133
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,300
But we didn't receive any news...

134
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,059
from the north.

135
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,860
I'm just worried.

136
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,819
What do you want me to do?

137
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,499
People in the north...

138
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,860
have never seen Princess Yong'an before.

139
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,460
Your godson is in the north, right?

140
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,460
Although Wei Shu Yu...

141
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,499
allegedly lost her,

142
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,100
at that time,

143
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,379
your godson, Hao Du...

144
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:15,619
was with Princess Yong'an.

145
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:16,980
The more collaborative the effort,

146
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,739
the better.

147
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,220
Furthermore, under your guidance,

148
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
- your godson is already... - That's enough.

149
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,059
Talk properly.

150
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:26,059
Don't flatter me.

151
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Since His Highness...

152
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:30,699
has entrusted you with this case,

153
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:32,499
you should work on it.

154
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,300
Yes.

155
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,510
Eat up.

156
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,939
Here.

157
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,859
What's the point of keeping him here?

158
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,059
If you ask me, I'll just kill him.

159
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,300
- Hold on. - Here.

160
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,750
Leave it there.

161
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,750
Give me more.

162
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,059
Here.

163
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,579
Where are you going?

164
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,979
I didn't expect to see you here.

165
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:14,020
Here.

166
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,939
Actually, the Eagle Army...

167
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,300
isn't too far from Shuozhou.

168
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,390
It's near a river and there are trees.

169
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,630
You'll get used to it.

170
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,699
Eat up.

171
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,390
Let me tell you.

172
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,859
If His Highness didn't care about you,

173
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,339
I wouldn't care about you either.

174
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:34,260
My goodness.

175
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,819
Your friend is insensible.

176
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,780
I think you're wasting your effort on him.

177
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,510
Look at that body.

178
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,660
I don't think he can survive in the grasslands.

179
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,020
No, he'll survive.

180
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:50,260
How do you know that?

181
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:52,750
He is someone who has a strong desire to live.

182
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:57,140
He won't be defeated...

183
00:09:57,979 --> 00:09:59,020
so easily.

184
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,819
It looks like...

185
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,339
you know him very well.

186
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,900
But I think...

187
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,140
you're just the enemy to him.

188
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:08,630
It doesn't matter.

189
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,630
You've never treated me so nicely after all these years.

190
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:31,699
That person...

191
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:33,099
has been following us for a long time.

192
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,179
I know.

193
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,819
He's here to see Shi Si Lang.

194
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,179
Do something for me.

195
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,939
What are you doing?

196
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:47,099
Let go!

197
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,660
Listen to me.

198
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,219
You're our slave.

199
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:51,780
Just do whatever I tell you to do.

200
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,300
What?

201
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:54,859
Are you refusing to work?

202
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,939
You must have a death wish.

203
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:58,939
Take him away.

204
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,140
Cut him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!

205
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,300
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

206
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,420
What are you doing?

207
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,500
What are you doing?

208
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,699
Let go of me!

209
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,500
Let go!

210
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,059
Come on!

211
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,140
Let go!

212
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,179
Come on!

213
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
Elder Qin.

214
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,059
I feel bad for Yuan Niang.

215
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,020
She has been homeless and travels with us for so long.

216
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,939
Not at all.

217
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,859
She has the best father and mother in the world.

218
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,620
How is Shuozhou doing?

219
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,300
I heard that...

220
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:10,900
the Ashina Tribe has left.

221
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,740
Someone from the imperial court will come and take over the rest.

222
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,059
Aside from that...

223
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:18,859
"Aside from that"?

224
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,219
Are you going to tell me...

225
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,900
about Young Master?

226
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:25,179
He failed in the assassination.

227
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,179
He was killed.

228
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,500
I see. He's...

229
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,459
He's too strong and impulsive.

230
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,819
It's easy to destroy those who are strong and impulsive.

231
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:35,620
If...

232
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,620
Stop it.

233
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:41,300
I think Young Master...

234
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,979
is still alive.

235
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:44,900
He's still alive?

236
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:47,179
Since Ashina Sun...

237
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,380
made a promise with Governor Gongsun,

238
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,540
he won't kill him for sure.

239
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,780
Perhaps he has brought him to the grasslands.

240
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,500
Let's not wait any longer.

241
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,459
- Let's look for him. - In the grasslands,

242
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:00,380
they have spies everywhere.

243
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,140
We can't barge in as we like.

244
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,059
Let's take care of Yuan Niang first.

245
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,740
We should use our previous connection...

246
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,979
and see if we can get some information.

247
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:13,059
Then I'll make a decision.

248
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:28,260
<i>Someone has been executed by Ashina Sun.</i>

249
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,459
Li Chang Ge.

250
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:37,979
Perhaps this is the best place for you.

251
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:57,380
Why are you here?

252
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,459
That's my question for you.

253
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,140
Losing the princess is a serious matter...

254
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,059
yet His Highness didn't blame you.

255
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,219
I'll find Le Yan for sure.

256
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,339
I'll wait and see.

257
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,819
It has been so long.

258
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,099
You didn't return to Chang'an.

259
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:14,339
Are you looking for Chang Ge?

260
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,780
What happened to her?

261
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,540
She's dead.

262
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,500
How did she die?

263
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,140
Did you kill her?

264
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
Tell me!

265
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,939
Wei Shu Yu.

266
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,339
Do you plan to sacrifice yourself and your family...

267
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,339
just to avenge your lover?

268
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:48,660
After killing you,

269
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,459
I'll kill myself to atone for it.

270
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:53,300
Do you think that His Highness...

271
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,660
will punish the Wei family just for you?

272
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,260
Then why didn't you do it?

273
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:02,300
When Li Chang Ge was alive, you couldn't do anything.

274
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,339
Now that she's dead,

275
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,540
you found the courage to take revenge.

276
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,579
I guess,

277
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,939
that's because you know that since Li Chang Ge is dead,

278
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:12,179
your family's glory won't be affected.

279
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:21,579
Even if you want revenge,

280
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:22,699
you've come to the wrong person.

281
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:24,979
I didn't kill Li Chang Ge.

282
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,020
It was done by Ashina Tribe.

283
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,979
Ashina Tribe?

284
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,859
Ashina Tribe invaded Shuozhou.

285
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:33,579
Li Chang Ge was captured by them.

286
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,459
With that temper of hers,

287
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,699
do you think she can survive?

288
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:44,900
I can't believe you went after me with him.

289
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,699
From now on,

290
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:49,979
we're no longer related.

291
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,179
From now on,

292
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,099
I won't rely on anyone else but myself.

293
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,859
Le Yan gave me an amulet. But what's the point?

294
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
In the end,

295
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,300
I failed to protect both of them.

296
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:21,740
That's enough.

297
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,500
Li Chang Ge is no longer here.

298
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,300
Make sure Princess Yong'an is safe.

299
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,699
Also,

300
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,380
I received a message from Chang'an.

301
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,819
They want me to stay at the north border...

302
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:30,900
to look for Princess Yong'an.

303
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,300
Obviously,

304
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,660
they don't trust you.

305
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,420
I'll make sure I find Le Yan before you do.

306
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,059
It doesn't matter.

307
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,420
I won't compete with you.

308
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,859
But I'll give you a hint.

309
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:51,020
In Shuozhou, Li Chang Ge...

310
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,740
is the Commandant of Light Chariot known by everyone.

311
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,819
If Princess Yong'an is in Shuozhou,

312
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:56,140
there must be a trace of her.

313
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,099
So, your trip to Shuozhuo...

314
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:00,219
is in vain.

315
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:04,380
<i>Fuju Inn</i>

316
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,300
What happened last night?

317
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,899
Why did you knock me out after covering my head?

318
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,260
Why didn't you kill me?

319
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,619
Last night, a slave died for you.

320
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:33,980
Take him away.

321
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,059
Cut him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!

322
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:36,059
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

323
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,020
- Let go of me! - Come on.

324
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,579
Let go!

325
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:44,710
Come on.

326
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,950
Come on.

327
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:51,659
Don't move.

328
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,659
Hurry up.

329
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,339
What is Ashina Sun doing?

330
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,339
I don't get him either.

331
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:14,379
If I were him,

332
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:15,619
I would have lost my patience a long time ago.

333
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:17,710
What a slave.

334
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,059
You're already challenging the limit of Eagle Army.

335
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,300
If I don't torture you,

336
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,780
you won't know how great we are.

337
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,059
You look fragile.

338
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,899
What's the point of bringing you back?

339
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:54,579
<i>Yunzhou County Office</i>

340
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,379
This way, please.

341
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,710
Excuse me.

342
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,950
Are you the magistrate?

343
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,300
Where do you come from?

344
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,419
You can't even recognize the magistrate.

345
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,500
Magistrate, I need a favor.

346
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,579
How dare you!

347
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:11,659
You have no manners.

348
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,899
He has work to attend to.

349
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:14,980
Move.

350
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,139
Magistrate.

351
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:21,419
You are the magistrate of Yunzhou.

352
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,780
If I didn't have an urgent request,

353
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,139
I wouldn't be so bold.

354
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,139
Go.

355
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,300
Hit the drum if you are seeking justice.

356
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,619
What brings you here?

357
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,780
Please listen to me.

358
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,300
I can't reveal my identity there.

359
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:39,980
If you don't mind,

360
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:42,470
can you help me send a message to Chang'an...

361
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:43,710
or Luoyang?

362
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,980
Who are you?

363
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,099
I'm Princess Yong'an.

364
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,540
I accidentally got separated from my guards.

365
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,780
After the siege,

366
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,220
I escaped to this place.

367
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,339
Magistrate.

368
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:01,780
If you could help me get home,

369
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,950
His Highness will reward you heavily for sure.

370
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,139
Do you have any proof?

371
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,300
Proof?

372
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,059
When I got separated from my guards,

373
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,710
I didn't bring any tokens.

374
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,859
But I really am a princess.

375
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:17,419
The title was conferred by my grandfather.

376
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:19,740
Do you have any carry-on piece from the palace?

377
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,020
Handmade items from the palace that is easy to recognize.

378
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:25,300
All of them were taken away from me.

379
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:27,710
Where did you get that information from?

380
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,260
You're quite nimble.

381
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:31,099
There is indeed a secret order from the imperial court...

382
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:33,300
to find a princess in secret.

383
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,470
Just because you claim that you're a princess,

384
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,470
it doesn't mean that you are one.

385
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,220
I knew that my father would look for me.

386
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,220
Magistrate.

387
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,020
I'm really a princess.

388
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,619
Trust me. It's true.

389
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,579
Magistrate, please! Please send a message to Luoyang!

390
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,819
You can be sentenced to corporal punishment for imitation.

391
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,780
- I'm really a princess. - You two. Arrest her!

392
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,819
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

393
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:51,899
Magistrate!

394
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:52,950
Magistrate...

395
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,220
Why don't you believe me?

396
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,300
What are you waiting for? Arrest her!

397
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,470
That's enough.

398
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:02,470
Let her go.

399
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,059
She's just a poor thing who doesn't have a choice.

400
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,139
It's very chaotic here.

401
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:08,950
The new governor will be here soon.

402
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,819
I don't have the time to deal with a refugee.

403
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,579
Be careful.

405

Father.

406
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,300
Why didn't you come and fetch me?

407
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
Are you abandoning me?

If you have too much energy,

410
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,379
you may go for a run.

411
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,859
I just don't get it.

412
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,059
What do you plan to do with Shi Si Lang?

413
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,700
You tried so hard to save Shi Si Lang.

414
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,940
Now, you're just ignoring him...

415
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
and let him be bullied by everyone.

416
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,700
You're getting weirder.

417
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,220
The more I pay attention to him,

418
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,619
the more he will suffer.

419
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:44,859
Rather than making him hate himself,

420
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,540
just let him hate me.

421
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,059
You are really odd!

422
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,180
Did he bewitch you?

423
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,899
Should I summon a shaman?

424
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,819
Do you want to clean horse manure?

425
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:58,339
Why should I?

426
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:01,379
I'm Eagle Army's military adviser.

427
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,020
Can you at least let me save my face?

428
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,980
He has to get a foothold...

429
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,300
in the Eagle Army on his own.

430
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,500
I can't be monitoring him all the time.

431
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:14,059
He's just a witty-minded man from the Central Plain.

432
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,659
Is he even worth the effort?

433
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,940
He is not grateful to you at all.

434
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,899
I don't need him to be grateful to me.

435
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:23,940
I just want him to live.

Your Highness and Military Adviser.

437
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:31,859
The slave that you told me to keep an eye on has passed out.

438
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:57,940
You're exhausted from protecting Shuozhou.

439
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:00,099
You didn't eat or drink throughout the journey.

440
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,659
You don't want to live anymore.

441
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:06,339
What's wrong?

442
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:08,339
Are you afraid that I might do something to you?

443
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,859
I'm not interested in a woman like you.

444
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,700
How do you know?

445
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:17,700
I found out when I saved you at the river.

446
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:20,619
Since you want to hide it,

447
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,780
I didn't bother to expose you.

448
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,700
You've been playing me this whole time.

449
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,099
Think of it however you want.

00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,379
Your Highness.

451
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,619
This is the medicine you asked for.

452
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:44,980
The shaman said you're worrying too much.

453
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:46,260
Hence, you have weak energy.

454
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,500
If you don't want to die,

455
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:50,419
take the medicine.

456
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,819
Take the medicine.

457
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,700
Li Shi Si!

458
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,220
I'm surprised at how weak you are!

459
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:07,819
People in Shuozhou are sound and safe.

460
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:09,260
I have kept my promise.

461
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,460
It's your turn now.

462
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Don't forget...

463
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,300
your life belongs to me now.

464
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,659
What a joke.

465
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,859
You want someone from the Central Plain to serve you.

466
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:21,899
Why don't you just kill me?

467
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,099
You'll regret it soon.

468
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,260
I won't repeat myself.

469
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,059
Take your medicine.

470
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,260
Is that how you solve problems?

471
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,619
It's better than enduring a life of humiliation.

472
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,780
Since my life is in your hands,

473
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,379
you don't have to humiliate me!

474
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,139
Humiliate you?

475
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,379
I just don't want you to die so easily!

476
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,619
Li Shi Si.

477
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,540
You'd better find a way to survive.

478
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Do it so that you can live long enough to kill me one day soon.

479
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:08,740
Do it so that you can avenge Gongsun Heng!

480
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,980
Avenge?

481
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,220
Yes.

482
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,780
Avenge.

483
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:18,419
Avenge Gongsun Heng.

484
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,700
Avenge the troops and people of Shuozhuo.

485
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,899
Have you forgotten about it?

486
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:27,339
Gongsun Heng is ridiculous.

487
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,460
How could he trust a coward?

488
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,260
If I were you,

489
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,940
I would gain a firm footing in the Eagle Army at all costs.

490
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:38,020
I would gain the trust of the people around me at all costs...

491
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,540
and wait for the right time to strike!

492
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,619
If you don't want to let him down,

493
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,260
you should clench your teeth and live.

494
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:54,940
Being able to entrust the lives of the civilians in Shuozhou City...

495
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,940
to a Tang princess...

496
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,020
and commit an act of benevolence...

497
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,339
is considered a happy ending for me.

498
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,619
<i>Shuozhou</i>

499
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,579
In the city,

500
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,300
there are thousands of families.

501
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,540
I can't let them down.

502
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,099
But in the end,

503
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:13,180
I'll have to let my wife and daughter down.

504
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,379
Dou!

505
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,419
It's not just about avenging Governor Gongsun.

506
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,899
It's not just about avenging Shuozhou.

507
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,460
Yes.

508
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:37,700
How could I die just like that?

509
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,260
How could I die here?

510
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:42,339
It's easy to die.

511
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,139
Living has always been the hardest.

512
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:10,899
Go!

513
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
Go!

514
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Stop.

515
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:22,379
Stop.

516
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
Let's go.

517
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,339
Don't go there.

518
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:56,139
We came from that direction.

519
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:57,139
Yan Er is not there.

520
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,460
Let's go to Yunzhou.

521
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:02,899
Go!

522
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Go!

523
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,540
This is the magistrate's office!

524
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,940
Both of you can't go inside without permission!

525
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
Magistrate.

526
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,980
We're ordered by Crown Prince...

527
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,300
to look for Princess Yong'an.

528
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,780
We need your people.

529
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,379
What can I help you with?

530
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:32,700
Just let me know.

531
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:35,260
Send your people...

532
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,579
to all the hideouts of refugees...

533
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,260
to look for the lady in the portrait.

534
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
Yes.

535
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,300
This...

536
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,540
This...

537
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,180
Have you seen her?

538
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,740
Where is she?

539
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,700
She didn't have anything that can prove her identity.

540
00:29:57,819 --> 00:29:59,740
I thought she's a refugee.

541
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,859
So I sent her away.

542
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:02,899
No matter what it takes,

543
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,540
you must find her!

544
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,220
Yes, sir.

545
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,220
Where are you going, Madam Chai?

546
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,780
- I'm taking a walk. - Are you leaving?

547
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,819
Your embroidery is awful.

548
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,220
You need to work on it to make money.

549
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,419
- All right, I get it. - No need.

550
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:17,859
Madam Xiang.

551
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:20,460
How is your business?

552
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,780
It's good.

553
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:24,180
You should burn more incense.

554
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,659
The pepper cookies are fragrant and crispy.

555
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:27,220
You're finally here.

556
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,059
- Yes. - Give me three of those.

557
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,700
There are so many of them.

558
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,819
- Three cookies are not enough. - Nonsense!

559
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,339
They should be grateful that they have food to eat.

560
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:37,020
They don't deserve pepper cookies.

561
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,139
Hurry up.

562
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:40,859
- I'm hungry. - All right. Hold on.

563
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:41,859
There are so many of them.

564
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:42,899
Look!

565
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,819
We're not doing charity.

566
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,540
Go somewhere else to beg for food.

567
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:51,859
I have money.

568
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:54,619
I want to buy some cookies.

569
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,260
You scared her.

570
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:57,700
One cookie is three cents.

571
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,940
Don't think that it's expensive.

572
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,980
The war is still going on.

573
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,059
The price of food is about the same.

574
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,460
Here, this is your cookie.

575
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,059
Young lady.

576
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,819
In broad daylight,

577
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,339
are you going to do that for a cookie?

578
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,659
Young lady!

579
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,500
I'm an honorable man.

580
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,339
It's three cents for a cookie.

581
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,220
I won't ask for anything else.

582
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,940
No. I'm afraid that someone else might steal it.

583
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:23,220
That's why I keep my pouch in the innermost layer.

584
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,220
I see.

585
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,020
I can tell right away that you know nothing about sewing.

586
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,579
What is that? The embroidery on the pouch is so ugly.

587
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,300
I think...

588
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,940
this is the prettiest pouch.

589
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,859
All right. Hold on.

590
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:58,700
Here's your cookie.

591
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:01,980
- Thank you. - All right.

592
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:05,899
Hey.

593
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,339
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:20,379
It's all right.

595
00:32:20,379 --> 00:32:22,419
I've had something dirtier before.

596
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,659
If you don't mind,

597
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,579
I'll give you half.

598
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,099
I'll give you some.

599
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,059
- I didn't mean any harm. - Hey.

600
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,139
Nowadays,

601
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:38,980
kind-hearted people get bullied.

602
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,700
What are you waiting for? You should check your pouch.

603
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:44,020
You even thought of sharing the food with him.

604
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,700
You must be a fool.

605
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,619
Come and take a look.

606
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
My pouch.

607
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,379
My pouch!

608
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:55,980
Stop right there!

609
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:58,700
Stop right there!

610
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:01,859
My pouch!

611
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,020
Stop right there!

612
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,099
Stop right there!

613
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:21,700
Stop right there!

614
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,940
Give me back my pouch.

615
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,139
You can take the money.

616
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:45,419
Right.

617
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:46,579
Here. This is for you.

618
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,859
It's so ugly. What's this?

619
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:53,379
My hands got pricked in order to make that,

620
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:54,500
and you're even complaining that it's ugly.

621
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,099
- Forget it then. - It is ugly,

622
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,619
but I like it.

623
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,339
Chang Ge.

624
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,419
Where are you?

625
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,260
Have you seen the lady...

626
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:24,419
on the portrait?

627
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:25,589
No.

628
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:28,069
Have you seen this lady?

629
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:29,069
No.

630
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,419
This lady in the portrait,

631
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:32,700
have you seen her before?

632
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,700
No.

633
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:37,109
- Have you seen her before? - No.

634
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:38,589
You!

635
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:40,499
- No, I haven't seen her. - Are they...

636
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:41,819
Are they after me?

637
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,629
- You! - Stop right there!

638
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,109
After her!

639
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:52,109
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

640
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:53,979
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

641
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:55,660
- Stop right there! - Stop!

642
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:57,069
After her!

643
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,780
You lost your money.

644
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,220
Why are you following me?

645
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:36,899
They want to arrest me.

646
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:38,459
What did you do?

647
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,979
I didn't do anything wrong.

648
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,859
They accused me of pretending to be the princess.

649
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:43,979
Why did you do that?

650
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,819
Young lady.

651
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:47,419
Are you a fool?

652
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:49,740
I'm not pretending to be a princess. I really...

653
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,700
Open the door!

654
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:00,019
Open the door!

655
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:02,459
Coming.

656
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:03,740
Are you going to pay me if you break the door?

657
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:06,979
It's still daytime.

658
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:08,300
What's the rush?

659
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,109
Are you here to buy clothes?

660
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,629
We're chasing after a girl.

661
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:14,379
I saw her walking on this street.

662
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:15,379
Have you seen her before?

663
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,819
We're looking for her.

664
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:25,260
Yes, I have.

665
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:30,260
This lady was pickpocketed on the street earlier.

666
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,019
She went after the perpetrator, heading south.

667
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:35,589
Sir, what did she do?

668
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,419
Is she a robber?

669
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,539
This area is not safe lately.

670
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:48,859
- Search the place. - Hey!

671
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:50,700
Sir!

672
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,589
<i>Great virtue brings happiness</i>

673
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:09,700
What's the matter?

674
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,180
- I don't know. - What's wrong?

675
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,140
- We didn't find anything. - We didn't find anything.

676
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,339
She's not there either.

677
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,780
Sir, as I said, she's not here.

678
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,979
My textile workshop is operating.

679
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:42,499
You simply look around the workshop.

680
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:43,939
It will leave a bad impression.

681
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:44,979
That's enough.

682
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:46,499
If you see her again,

683
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:47,499
inform us right away.

684
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:48,899
Of course.

685
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:50,979
Let's go.

686
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
You're smart.

687
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,819
At least you hid in the tank.

688
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,859
Thank you for the help.

689
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:13,859
I thought you wouldn't save me.

690
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,019
That's enough.

691
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,109
You don't seem like a bad person.

692
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,660
They have nothing better to do.

693
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,589
You're just pretending to be a princess.

694
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
Do they really have to do that?

695
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:24,019
Ma'am.

696
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:25,220
I'm not pretending.

697
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,939
I'm really a princess.

698
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:28,069
All right.

699
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:30,180
It doesn't matter if you're a princess or a lord.

700
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
I need to get back to work.

701
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,339
You should go.

702
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,740
Ma'am.

703
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,700
If I go out right now,

704
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:37,140
I'll get caught.

705
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,339
I beg you.

706
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:39,979
Please let me stay here for one more day.

707
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,459
I beg you.

708
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,939
All right.

709
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:45,780
Go inside and get changed.

710
00:38:46,379 --> 00:38:48,069
Don't blame me when you get sick.

711
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,109
Thank you, ma'am.

712
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:04,589
So this is the grassland.

713
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:08,180
It's so vast.

714
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,339
Madam Su Yi Li.

715
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:13,419
Do you have more cheese?

716
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,339
- Please keep some for me. - Sure.

717
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:16,740
Come to my tent later.

718
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:17,939
You can have as much as you want.

719
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,069
Your Highness, are there any presents for us?

720
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:23,780
Ye, everyone gets a present.

721
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,260
Ya Luo.

722
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,109
Your Highness, the herbs are ready.

723
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:30,180
Here they are.

724
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:32,899
Take a look.

725
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:34,939
It's not bad.

726
00:39:36,979 --> 00:39:38,539
- Here, Your Highness. - Take a look.

727
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,780
Help yourself.

728
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,700
- There are presents! - I want this.

729
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:45,459
This is good.

730
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:47,019
- Look. - Let me see.

731
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:49,979
Uncle Shi Min, where is my reward?

732
00:39:49,979 --> 00:39:51,109
- Where is my reward? - Where is my reward?

733
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:52,629
- Stand still. - Where is my reward?

734
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:53,740
Stand still and close your eyes.

735
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:55,339
Close your eyes. Close them.

736
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:02,019
What about me, Uncle Shi Min? Where's mine?

737
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:03,379
- Give it to me - I only have one pony.

738
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:07,180
- I'll give it if you can reach it. - Give it to me, Father!

739
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,819
Give it to me.

740
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,700
Father!

741
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,700
Uncle Shi Min!

742
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,780
Father, don't go against your words.

743
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
Father!

744
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:24,589
Uncle Shi Min!

745
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,220
Give it to me, Uncle Shi Min!

746
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,589
You promised me!

747
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:38,459
- Here, let me help you. - Thank you.

748
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:39,979
Not bad.

749
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,339
That was fun.

750
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,140
Hey!

751
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:47,499
You're good in Cuju, right?

752
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,260
This is for you.

753
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,339
Can we have the ball?

754
00:40:58,379 --> 00:40:59,379
Here.

755
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:02,819
- Stop right there! - Come on!

756
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:03,819
Wait for me!

757
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,499
Slow down!

758
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:08,300
- Give it to me. - No.

759
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:12,140
I'll send the present home for them.

760
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,780
- Hold it properly. - Can you take it to him?

761
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:30,459
The pay is so low.

762
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,660
Madam Zhang, you should consider yourself lucky.

763
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,220
At least we still have work to do.

764
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,260
We won't be starving to death.

765
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,339
That's not bad.

766
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:38,140
You're right.

767
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,859
It's getting difficult to use the machine.

768
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:41,109
Yes.

769
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,220
Madam Chai.

770
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,819
You finally hired someone.

771
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,819
I found her on the street.

772
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:54,939
She'll leave tomorrow.

773
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,740
Greetings, everyone.

774
00:42:04,379 --> 00:42:05,939
What are you looking at?

775
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:06,939
Get back to work!

776
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,740
She's so pretty.

777
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,629
What kind of salutation was that?

778
00:42:16,629 --> 00:42:19,109
I don't know. It looks nice though.

779
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:20,109
Exactly.

780
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,629
Greetings, everyone.

781
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:22,629
That's not correct.

782
00:42:22,629 --> 00:42:23,740
It's like this.

783
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:25,859
- No. - That's what she did.

784
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:29,180
You'll sleep here tonight.

785
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,979
You have to leave tomorrow.

786
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,589
I don't feed people for nothing.

787
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,589
Thank you, ma'am.

788
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:36,499
I will repay you someday.

789
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,899
Thank you.

790
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,339
What should I do tomorrow?

791
00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:52,260
<i>Yunzhou County Office</i>

792
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,660
What did you say?

793
00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:02,140
I didn't hear it clearly.

794
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,939
Please pardon me.

795
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:06,069
Princess Yong'an...

796
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:08,180
We lost her.

797
00:43:09,939 --> 00:43:11,700
It's fine if you can't find her.

798
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:13,140
What do you mean you lost her?

799
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,859
We saw a lady who looks like her on the street.

800
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,780
But she got away.

801
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,019
A lady who looks like her?

802
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,379
How did she run away?

803
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,140
Mr. Wei, we'll keep looking.

804
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,459
However, Princess Yong'an has feet.

805
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,140
We are unsure...

806
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,260
whether she's still in Yunzhou or not.

807
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,700
How dare you absolve yourself?

808
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:34,979
Yes.

809
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,260
We'll keep looking.

810
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,539
- I'll look for her tomorrow! - I'll look for her tomorrow!

811
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:40,859
- Get lost! - Get lost!

812
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:41,859
Yes, sir!

813
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:47,899
Yan Er.

814
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,859
Where are you?
