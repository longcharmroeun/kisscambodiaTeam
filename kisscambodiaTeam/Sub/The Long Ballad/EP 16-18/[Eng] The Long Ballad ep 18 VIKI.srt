♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,959
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,930
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫ Never give in. ♫

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,950
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,819
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

8
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,589
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,789
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

10
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,739

The Long Ballad

22
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,110
Episode 18

23
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,799
Go.

24
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,019
Stop it!

25
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,949
Aren't you the new counselor?

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,829
What do you want?

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,909
You think you can boss us around, because Tegin treats you well.

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,869
We have our own rules.

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,479
Even it is Tegin, he must obey the rules!

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,549
So, you want to meddle in this too?

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,509
How about...

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,119
Well.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,230
Let's have some drinks.

34
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,909
Leave!

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,829
Are you deaf?

36
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,870
Piss off.

37
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,799
Stay and wait.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,519
Wait here!

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Wait!

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
I...

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,270
Thank you.

42
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,960
Get it off your dirty face.

43
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,110
I'll help you.

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
You are so beautiful.

45
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,030
Some drink?

46
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,469
I'm Li Shisi.

47
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,470
What's your name?

48
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,269
Mimi Guli.

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,719
You look different.

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,110
You aren't from Ashile Tribe?

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,880
I am a slave sent to Ashile Tribe.

52
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,999
I only have the clothes for men.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,160
Take them for now.

54
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,270
I'll get changed.

55
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,239
Okay, go ahead.

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
I'll wait you outside.

57
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,760
I finished.

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,160
What's in your clothes?

59
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
I...

60
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,790
I am sorry.

61
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,269
I..

62
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,829
I promise I will never steal!

63
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,879
I'll never do this again!

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,039
Please don't expel me.

65
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,319
I can do a lot of things!

66
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,599
You see, I can clean the house,

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,549
and I... I can do the laundry and cook.

68
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,389
I can do anything, see!

69
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,670
And I am a fast worker.

70
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,110
Don't steal anything from now on.

71
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,270
I will take care of you.

72
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,830
Have some rest here.

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,950
This is my bed.

74
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,899
I'll be off for a while.

75
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,550
Don't answer even someone calls you.

76
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,760
Take a thread with the right.

77
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,039
Cross your hands.

78
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,550
Pass from the middle one.

79
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
Then take one with the left.

80
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,789
Very good.

81
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,790
Flip it.

82
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,789
You want to play this.

83
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,919
Li Leyan, are you stupid?

84
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,110
Look at others' work, and tell me what you've done!

85
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,439
You really piss me off.

86
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,179
I... I just want to unfasten the threads.

87
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,160
If you can't finish, no sleep tonight.

88
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,919
Are you sent by God to ravage and challenge me?

89
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,669
I am so mad.

90
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,159
Come on.

91
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Anyone helps her!

92
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,109
I am so confused.

93
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,920
You've learned for days, and what have you got?

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Who?

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,599
What are you doing?

96
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,880
I am doing housework.

97
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,999
You did all these?

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,759
If you don't like others help you organize your stuff,

99
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,709
I won't do it again!

100
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,879
I am sorry.

101
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
Don't throw me out please.

102
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
It's her!

103
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,879
Li Shisi, you can't leave this woman here.

104
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,349
What if I insist on keeping her?

105
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,349
Are you going to kill her?

106
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,909
It's not necessary.

107
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,879
Just throw her out.

108
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,669
I beg you.

109
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,909
Don't throw me out.

110
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,549
If I can't stay here, I will be eaten by wolves.

111
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,029
Even if I can manage to escape,

112
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,639
if the Great Khan finds that I'm an escaped slave, I will be killed.

113
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,029
Please.

114
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,709
You talked too much nonsense.

115
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,199
Go.

116
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,519
No!

117
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
You...

118
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,669
Are you a dog?

119
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,999
Why did you bite me?

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You...

121
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Enough.

122
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,790
Sun.

123
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,149
Tegin.

124
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,280
Could you give me this slave?

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You may leave.

126
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:44,519
According to my rules, it is bad to have things with ears and mouth.

127
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,549
Since I am the one who work for Tegin,

128
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,759
I will manage my people properly.

129
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
You don't trust me?

130
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,279
I'm leaving.

131
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,030
I... I was bitten for nothing.

132
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,439
Are you fine?

133
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,000
Did you catch a cold?

134
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,709
How about I get you some Kumiss?

135
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,760
Just a second.

136
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Sun.

137
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,439
Though you agreed Li Shisi to be your counselor,

138
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,110
you shouldn't trust him unconditionally.

139
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,079
Why?

140
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,639
We don't really know him.

141
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,709
I do know Shisi.

142
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,519
And he isn't from our region.

143
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,319
Shisi is now.

144
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,640
But the people from the Central Plains are full of tricks.

145
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,150
Sun, I don't mean it.

146
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,549
How are you?

147
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,839
I'm fine.

148
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,759
Let's have some warm soup.

149
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,840
It's good for health.

150
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,470
Why is the soup only for me?

151
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,469
How about yours?

152
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,589
I'm not hungry yet.

153
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,590
Have it now.

154
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,109
You go first.

155
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,879
I don't have an appetite.

156
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,279
When you finish it, get some sleep.

157
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,840
The bed is small, just put up with it.

158
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,999
Don't worry.

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,109
I'll sleep on the ground.

160
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,109
You should go to bed early.

161
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,470
It's good for your recovery.

162
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,030
Whatever.

163
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,910
But you don't have to be alert.

164
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,440
I won't hurt you.

165
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,439
Mom, don't leave me, mom!

166
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,109
Mom.

167
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,110
Mom.

168
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
My mom.

169
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,910
Mom.

170
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,590
Mom, please come back.

171
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,960
I'm so cold.

172
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,279
Buzhen, don't move.

173
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Buzhen?

174
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,640
Who is Buzhen?

175
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,880
Li Shisi, I'm coming.

176
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Not a good time.

177
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,839
Please wait.

178
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Wait.

179
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,639
Hey, you!

180
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,759
Wait!

181
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,879
Stop!

182
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,589
Stop! You!

183
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,709
I've got something to tell you.

184
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,399
I've got things to warn you too!

185
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,109
Dare you walk around camps again!

186
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,469
Don't go to Sun Tegin's place.

187
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,959
What's wrong with you?

188
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,079
Don't come closer.

189
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,789
Are you going to bite me again?

190
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,349
I warn you just to stay there.

191
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,959
Otherwise, I won't be nice.

192
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,549
I really have something to tell.

193
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,079
As I am living with Counselor Li, the food isn't enough for us.

194
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,909
You must prepare more for us.

195
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,709
Don't bother me!

196
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,109
Go and find your Counselor Li.

197
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,839
Time for a meal!

198
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,959
Right.

199
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,759
Come on.

200
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,669
Have more drink.

201
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,670
Drink!

202
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Have more, more!

203
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,519
Why are you here?

204
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,839
Counselor Li is ill.

205
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,149
He shared with me the last food we had.

206
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,669
We need something to eat!

207
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,469
For every tent, food quota is set.

208
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,590
You've taken yours.

209
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,439
No more for you.

210
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,279
Get out of my way.

211
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
You...

212
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,480
The mutton will be ready soon.

213
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,590
Have a seat.

214
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,109
By the way, do you guys like to use this?

215
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,149
I used branches to make a pair.

216
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,670
Hope you'll like it.

217
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,149
Do as locals do.

218
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,550
I don't use it anymore.

219
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,080
But I like your present.

220
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,590
Thank you.

221
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,109
In return, do you want anything?

222
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,110
Me?

223
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,710
Is it Buzhen really from your family?

224
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,200
Do you want to be free and go back to your family?

225
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,710
My family has been invaded by Ashile Tribe.

226
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,840
People died, or left.

227
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,470
I don't have any family members.

228
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,439
So, I'm grateful for staying with you sincerely.

229
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,229
So the same to you.

230
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,230
The same?

231
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,669
Are your family...?

232
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,030
Yes, they are all dead too.

233
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,600
They were killed by the enemy.

234
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,639
Forget all these worries.

235
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,549
Now that we have met each other, it's truly destiny.

236
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,200
From now on, I am your family member.

237
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,080
Here, take the big one.

238
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,279
I'm so tired.

239
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,709
Almost done?

240
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,229
How about taking a break?

241
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,230
I agree.

242
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,280
So tired.

243
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,999
Me too.

244
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,559
Are you tired?

245
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,469
Don't you know tomorrow is due day?

246
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,229
Have you finished the work?

247
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,920
If you can't finish it, just get out of here!

248
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Go back to your work!

249
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,189
Ms. Zhang?

250
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,190
Don't bother me!

251
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,759
Li Leyan!

252
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,879
Did you do it on purpose?

253
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,039
Look what you did!

254
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,229
Get out!

255
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,399
Get her out of here!

256
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,399
Move!

257
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Quick!

258
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,999
Get out!

259
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,999
You! Get out!

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,589
Kick her out right now!

261
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,759
Out!

262
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,189
Leave here!

263
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,879
Do you think Li Leyan is a real fool?

264
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,949
How can she be so silly?

265
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,950
Right, so much trouble.

266
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,709
Finally we finished Mr. Hu's order.

267
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,040
Let's have some rest.

268
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,310
My neck hurts.

269
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,999
Why is she here?

270
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,879
Right, why?

271
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,309
Why didn't you leave?

272
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,759
Why?

273
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,349
Ms. Chai.

274
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,470
My sincere apology.

275
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,559
Please give me another chance.

276
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,109
Please!

277
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,519
Ms. Li, you're so determined.

278
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Here, I do need someone like you!

279
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Well.

280
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,229
Is that what you expect me to say?

281
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,799
Just act nice, then be a free-rider?

282
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,190
You're daydreaming!

283
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,109
Right.

284
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,589
Later, I will meet with Manager Hu.

285
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,999
I'm begging you.

286
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,469
Just leave.

287
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,949
We don't have room for you.

288
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,920
Find elsewhere to bother anyone else.

289
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,399
Why are you crying?

290
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,759
Look at them.

291
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,879
They've worked overnight just because of you.

292
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,189
They want to cry too!

293
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,429
Yes.

294
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,039
Tears can't give you money.

295
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,829
You need to work hard to make a living.

296
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,110
If I were your mom, I would die already.

297
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,229
Leave here now.

298
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,679
You'd better find a tree and get hanged.

299
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,469
People like you are nothing good for society.

300
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,469
Only a waste of food.

301
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,109
Well.

302
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,110
Well.

303
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,709
Is she alright?

304
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,279
Won't she commit suicide?

305
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,159
Who can tell?

306
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,799
Why are you looking at me?

307
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,189
If she has the courage, it's still a good ending for her.

308
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,399
She is a loser.

309
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
Good for nothing in the world.

310
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,229
Alright, girls!

311
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,309
Get some sleep.

312
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,799
Right, so tired!

313
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Let's go.

314
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
Go to rest.

315
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,709
Have you heard it?

316
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,710
The slave of the counselor kicked Mu Jin out of anger.

317
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,519
Really?

318
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,229
True!

319
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,520
This slave is bold.

320
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,880
Mu Jin is so weak.

321
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,879
She got something.

322
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,999
Poor Mu Jin.

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,070
He was humiliated.

324
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,399
Smell good?

325
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,709
Why does it smell so good?

326
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,349
My kid likes it very much!

327
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,349
Mimi Guli.

328
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,799
Are you going to wash your man's clothes?

329
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,519
Yes.

330
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,429
I...

331
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,109
Well, Mimi Guli.

332
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,559
We've heard you kicked Mu Jin.

333
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,799
He is the counselor.

334
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,840
Hope he didn't bother you.

335
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,109
Not at all.

336
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,110
Dare he bother me!

337
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,519
What a relief.

338
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,879
Go to wash.

339
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,589
Yes, right.

340
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,229
See you then.

341
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,919
See you.

342
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Take your time.

343
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,069
What's wrong with you?

344
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,919
Pick it up.

345
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,519
I won't.

346
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,879
You and Li Shisi have humiliated me!

347
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,709
Look at you.

348
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,919
Now you seem easy and relaxed.

349
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,759
It is because you're weak.

350
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,189
Watch your tongue!

351
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,159
Right, you're so weak!

352
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,519
It's you.

353
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,109
Dare you say it again!

354
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,159
Who is weak?

355
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,349
You!

356
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,109
You hurt me.

357
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,110
You're a bitch.

358
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,709
No, it's you!

359
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,679
You!

360
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,759
You're shrew!

361
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
It's you!

362
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,680
You and Li Shisi are evil-minded.

363
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,229
Who?

364
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,639
You two.

365
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
How dare you scold Shisi!

366
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,639
You can't kick me.

367
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Too far.

368
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
You can't.

369
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,470
Bastard!

370
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,709
Why did my heart beat so fast?

371
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,189
Mu Jin, are you a fool?

372
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,469
She is with Li Shisi.

373
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,920
What are you thinking about?

their tongues will become so long.

00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,279
Too much bullshit.

381
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,560
Do you still commit suicide?

382
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,879
By doing this, you can be hanged.

383
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,800
What you did can only exercise your neck.

384
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,999
My husband, years ago, thought he couldn't take care of our family.

385
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,710
So he hanged himself to end everything.

386
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,799
Is your life so worthless?

387
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,759
Why are you going to kill yourself just as you're told?

388
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,159
If you really want to die, nobody can stop you.

389
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,589
But if you want to live, nobody can block you as well!

390
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,039
You should rely on yourself.

391
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
Get it?

392
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,039
Well, well.

393
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,679
It's alright.

394
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Alright. It's alright.

395
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,109
My words were a bit harsh.

396
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,520
I am sorry.

397
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,230
Thank you, Ms. Chai.

398
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,880
Manager Hu, check out this new pattern.

399
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Come, come here.

400
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,280
Pattern from the West.

401
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,469
It's really popular.

402
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,309
Right.

403
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,759
Very nice.

404
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Look at it, this embroidery.

405
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,399
There are golden threads.

406
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,399
Look at the stitches.

407
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,189
How tight!

408
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,190
Right.

409
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,069
Good.

410
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,520
This is your order.

411
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,519
I've heard Ms. Chai's blankets are smooth.

412
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,229
Why aren't the stitches for my order smooth at all?

413
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,279
We could have done better if you give us much time.

414
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,229
Would you take it please?

415
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,230
Right, please.

416
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,399
Well.

417
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,429
Who made this?

418
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:40,919
This?

419
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,109
Well... I told you not to follow me.

420
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,949
It's her work.

421
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,589
Manager Hu, it's her work.

422
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,950
Right, Ms. Li.

423
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Did you make this?

424
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,159
Yes, it's me.

425
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,109
Perfect.

426
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,829
How wonderful!

427
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,949
I'll take it.

428
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,679
Miss.

429
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,829
Could you make more?

430
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,110
I'll buy all of them.

431
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,229
With a good price!

432
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,590
As long as you do, I'll buy the clothes all together.

433
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,279
This girl is our embroider.

434
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,759
As for this handkerchief, as long as the price is good,

435
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,399
you can have as many as you want.

436
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,189
Deal!

437
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,069
You can name the price.

438
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,949
You're great.

439
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,039
Here, take a date.

440
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,229
Take it.

441
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,189
Take two.

442
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,190
Just take them.

443
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,559
Why did Tegin invite me to have grilled mutton leg tonight?

444
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,040
Your slave had a fight with Mu Jin becasue of this.

445
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,999
You're also my counselor.

446
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,799
I hope they feel I've treated you fairly.

447
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,110
Have you grilled mutton legs for Mu Jin?

448
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,349
No.

449
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,350
It's my first time.

450
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,429
When I was a kid, my father grilled it with me once.

451
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,919
I was determined to grill my own.

452
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,109
It ended up a great mess.

453
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,110
All were burnt.

454
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,399
Then for the burnt part, my dad ate them all.

455
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,709
Later, I learnt how to grill.

456
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,589
I don't want to fail him again.

457
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,799
I didn't expect there's such a story between you and your father.

458
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,559
When I was little, my father still cared about me.

459
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
But afterwards...

460
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,950
Let's move on.

461
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,709
Tell me about your father.

462
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,830
I have nothing to share.

463
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,070
He was very busy.

464
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,879
I see.

465
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,160
Because he was the crown prince.

466
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,590
It's normal that he was busy.

467
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,879
How did you know?

468
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,429
In Youzhou you had access to the Governor Mansion,

469
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,950
I knew you were privileged.

470
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,999
Later, I heard they called you Princess Yongning.

471
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,679
Then, I've realized everything.

472
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,309
Since you knew who I am by then, why didn't you reveal my identity?

473
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,880
Is it for taking advantage of me?

474
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,799
Right.

475
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
I used you.

476
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,400
I suffered a lot because of you.

477
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,800
I saved you in Changan, Youzhou, and Shuozhou as well.

478
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,280
Now we are on the prairie.

479
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,870
I am grilling a mutton leg for a slave like you.

480
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,590
I've made full 'use' of you.

481
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,430
Well.

482
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,189
Did you forget everything?

483
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,190
No.

484
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Take it.

485
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,400
Anyway, I'm regarded as dead in Tang.

486
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,829
I have nothing to be afraid of.

487
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,109
From now on, I'm not Li Shisi.

488
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,709
My name is Li Changge.

489
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,230
I like this name, Changge.

490
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,430
Changge.

491
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,819
Changge.

492
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,159
♫ Which froze everything between you and me ♫

493
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,599
♫ Meet each other in different time ♫

494
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,919
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds ♫

495
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,319
♫ My longings become a cocoon ♫

496
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,919
♫ Layer after layer ♫

497
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,180
♫ It turns into an eternity ♫

498
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,109
♫ The cocoon in the dark night ♫

499
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,110
What's she doing?

500
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,990
Does it mean she'll commit herself to me?

501
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,150
It's already late.

502
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,080
I'm at least a man.

503
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Is it appropriate?

504
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,979
Hey.

505
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,449
Changge.

506
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,739
Changge?

507
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
What happened?

508
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,530
Why are they so close late at night?

509
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,380
Mr. Shisi, what happened to you?

510
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,099
I have no idea.

511
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
All of a sudden.

512
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,260
Are you sick?

513
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,620
Have some rest.

514
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,209
Blood?

515
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,620
Why is he bleeding?

516
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
Mimi.

517
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,210
Let me keep you warm.

518
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,019
What happened to him?

519
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,019
Did he get hurt?

520
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,449
No, don't worry.

521
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,169
He's fine.

522
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,289
He... He looks awful.

523
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,290
As I said, he's fine.

524
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,209
But, he looks like he's dying.

525
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,210
He is hurt!

526
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,499
I told you he's fine.

527
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,570
But he's...

528
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,529
What does it mean?

529
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,530
Really?

530
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,409
I told you so.

531
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,129
You're treating her differently.

532
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,719
Did you know that she is a woman?

533
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,359
You're not frank or honest anymore.

534
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,839
Changge is weak.

535
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,409
We need to treat her with a lamb.

536
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,809
Changge?

537
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,319
Her name.

538
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,250
So Mr. Shisi's real name is Changge.

539
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,170
How many secrets did you hide from me?

540
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,480
Tell me more.

541
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Sun.

542
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,199
I thought you're a man.

543
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,960
I've even decided to marry you.

544
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,809
Why are you laughing?

545
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,889
Don't laugh.

546
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,720
I'm really upset.

547
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,079
Mimi.

548
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,289
You can still be my family member.

549
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,330
There's nothing different.

550
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,199
But still it's different.

551
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,049
How so?

552
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,409
I think it's not because you're good at the disguise.

553
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,649
You really don't treat yourself as a woman.

554
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:32,129
In this world, men need to fight and protect their domains and women.

555
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,929
Whereas, women are responsible for fertility

556
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,649
and protecting the senior people and the kids.

557
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,529
But you use men's ways to fight with them,

558
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,480
while using a body of woman.

559
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,249
What's in your mind?

560
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,810
I have no ideas as well.

561
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,679
What makes a man?

562
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,359
What makes a woman?

563
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,410
I've never really thought of it.

564
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,439
My masters are men.

565
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,769
Manage the country by making policies,

566
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,409
and protect it by leading armies.

567
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,769
They are big figures with great talents.

568
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,369
But what's the difference between me and them?

569
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,639
My father's wife and concubines are women.

570
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,010
They are in the finest dresses and look so gorgeous.

571
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,769
They are considerate and attentive.

572
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,640
But what does it matter with me?

573
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,479
Anyhow, you should rest at home for these days.

574
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,010
Don't suffer with them in the wild.

575
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,849
One more thing.

576
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,769
Since you've lied to me, your name can't be Mr. Shisi.

577
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,679
My name is Li Changge.

578
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Li Changge.

579
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,370
So, did Tegin Sun know this secret already?

580
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,809
Then he's keeping it for you.

581
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,440
Does he fall in love with you?

582
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,329
Nonsense.

583
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,639
He thinks I'm useful for him.

584
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,810
So he cares about me a little.

585
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,249
How do you feel now?

586
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,050
You'll feel good to keep the underbelly warm.

587
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,879
What are you waiting for?

588
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,609
Move it!

589
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,880
To carry the wool is the easiest task.

590
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,479
Can you do it?

591
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Yes, I can.

592
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,569
What are you waiting for?

593
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,919
Come and help me!

594
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,609
I'm coming.

595
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,369
Be quick.

596
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,009
Look at the wool.

597
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,199
It gets everywhere.

598
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,919
Take it off!

599
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,199
And here.

600
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,570
Look at your head.

601
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,090
And here.

602
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,569
Wool Yan.

603
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,609
Wool Yan.

604
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,329
Wool Yan.

605
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,479
You got the wool everywhere.

606
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,879
Wool Yan, are you really stupid?

607
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,529
I just asked you to carry the wool.

608
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,089
Look at what you've done.

609
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,090
Ms. Chai, I...

610
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,679
Look at your hair.

611
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,399
Oh my.

612
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Seriously.

613
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Look at you.

614
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,249
This fool knows nothing.

615
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,719
How can she live like this?

616
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
Right.

617
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,369
Thank you!

618
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,089
You're my saviors.

619
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,439
Thanks to your help, I can make it through.

620
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,959
It's the first time I heard that title.

621
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,249
She is not referring to you.

622
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,639
Think about your poor salary.

623
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,959
You're not valuable at all.

624
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,159
Not valuable?

625
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,399
Our wool fabrics are for the use of the government offices.

626
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,250
They might even become the carpets in the palace.

627
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,120
You've worked so hard,

628
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,119
but they might not cherish every stitch you made.

629
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,770
Nonsense.

630
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,959
Those in the palace don't bother by food and clothes.

631
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,960
They won't know how much hard work behind.

632
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,199
The god is fair.

633
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,609
The royal family is supported by the people.

634
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,769
They'll get whatever they want.

635
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,679
So, they need to take the responsibility to protect us.

636
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,679
For us, though we're poor, it's fine if we can feed ourselves.

637
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,479
Am I right?

638
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,329
Yes, indeed.

639
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,049
We just mind our own business.

640
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,089
If we can do, just do it.

641
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,119
If we can't, then sleep.

642
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,960
For the royal members, they won't sleep if they fail.

643
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,719
All we want is the little salary every month.

644
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Indeed.

645
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,399
Mind your business.

646
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,049
Don't skip this question.

647
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,769
Ms. Chai.

648
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,569
- Right.
 - Go back to work.

649
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,369
When was the last raise?

650
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,329
Stop. Answer me about my salary.

651
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,609
Let's talk about it?

652
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,529
No raise is fine.

653
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,769
But give us some seasame cakes.

654
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,639
She's right.

655
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,719
Stop.

656
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Stop there!

657
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,530
Stop.

658
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,640
Leyan, I'll find you!

659
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Go.

660
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Go!

661
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,399
Mimi.

662
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,479
You are a woman.

663
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,809
Don't work so hard.

664
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,009
From now on, you can ask me for help.

665
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,849
I'll help you carry the water.

666
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,289
Don't look down upon me.

667
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,290
You see.

668
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,439
Be careful.

669
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,089
My clothes.

670
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,090
Don't take...

671
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,529
What's wrong? Too heavy?

672
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,719
No...

673
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
My foot.

674
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,610
You're bleeding.

675
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,439
I'm so unlucky.

676
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Who left the nail here?

677
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,249
I'm fine.

678
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,849
Don't be frightened.

679
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,879
Go back first.

680
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,050
Let me take some break.

681
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,329
I'll bring you home.

682
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,330
Leave things here.

683
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,679
Be careful.

684
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,850
I'm fine. I mean it.

685
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Take it slow.

You just got better a bit.

688
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,090
Don't get sick again.

689
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,570
Take it easy. I'm not that weak.

690
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,049
Save it later when it gets colder.

691
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,159
You've done nothing for me so far.

692
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,530
I don't bargain with a loss.

693
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,329
Be relieved, Tegin.

694
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,720
I'll finish three promises for sure.

695
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,640
Do you have anything to demand today?

696
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,769
I just passed by after patrolling.

697
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,770
Alone?

698
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,250
Where is your slave?

699
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,850
She's washing clothes.

700
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,529
She has a good life, as she met a master like you.

701
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,399
We aren't master and slave.

702
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,040
We are friends who care about each other.

703
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,249
In a lifetime, people around will leave one by one.

704
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,159
To trust the new, and farewell to the past.

705
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,050
These are difficulties in life.

706
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,090
I feel luckier than her.

707
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,160
So lucky that I met with someone I care about.

708
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,810
Me too.

709
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,249
Tegin, go for patrolling.

710
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,720
Otherwise it'll be too late.

711
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,049
How about joining me?

712
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,609
You don't know much about this region.

713
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,959
When the night comes, I'll take you somewhere.

714
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,719
But I wonder if you have the gut.

715
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,770
Why not?

I found it when patrolling.

Do you like it?

724
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,400
It'll be my last time to see fireflies this year.

725
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,760
We can see them again next year.

726
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,850
Who knows where we are then.

727
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,120
Will we be available to see fireflies again?

728
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,320
If you want to see them next year,

Besides, like fireflies, such wonderful creatures are ephemeral.

♫ There's always solicitude ♫

751
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:23,149
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

752
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,549
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

753
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,829
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

754
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,389
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

755
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,149
♫ layer after layer. ♫

756
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,189
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

757
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:43,070
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

758
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,469
♫ There's always a moment ♫

759
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:57,109
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

760
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,709
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

761
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:07,029
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

762
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,589
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

763
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,949
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

764
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:16,429
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

765
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,309
♫ layer after layer. ♫

766
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,309
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

767
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:27,710
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

768
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,910
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

769
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:50,030
