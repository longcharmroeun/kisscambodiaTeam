<i>Episode 15</i>

23
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,319
Governor!

24
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,040
Governor!

25
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,019
I promise you.

26
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,299
I'll protect Madam and Yuan.

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,460
Princess.

28
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,659
Then I'm feeling relieved.

29
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,660
Senior Qin.

30
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,420
You can work for Changge in the future.

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,579
Senior Qin and Xu Feng have worked for me for many years.

32
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,140
If you have any difficulty,

33
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:17,660
they'll surely help you.

34
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,940
Senior Qin!

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,428
Do you want to witness governor's death because of the trade?

36
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:28,229
I...

37
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,228
Master.

38
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:34,949
You want me to watch you die, isn't it too cruel?

39
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,789
Senior Qin,

40
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,830
you always say I'm stubborn.

41
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,790
And you?

42
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:11,309
You're stubborn, too.

43
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,309
Work for Changge.

44
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,710
Maybe she'll realize your belief.

45
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:21,910
In this city,

46
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:30,589
at this moment not a single family has escaped.

47
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,429
They trust me so much.

48
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,589
I can't let them down.

49
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,110
However, I'll fail my wife and daughter.

50
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,109
Look.

51
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,630
This Dimi flower blooms beautifully.

52
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,949
We planted it together when I first met my wife.

53
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:02,110
I know it.

54
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,949
My wife likes to plant flowers.

55
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,990
But I don't have time to accompany her.

56
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,910
Honey.

57
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:21,790
Let's meet in our next life.

58
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,029
I'll accompany you more.

59
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:44,790
Ride a quick horse and gallop.

60
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,229
Governor!

61
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,030
Master!

62
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,709
On the way to death,

63
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:58,750
I choose to go first!

64
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,979
♫ The past can't blow away the moon light. I shall never forget ♫

65
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,734
♫ Go somewhere else and look back ♫

66
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,070
Why don't you save him?

67
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,910
Why don't you save him?

68
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,588
How could I save him?

69
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:36,988
Why don't you save him?

70
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:38,309
Tell me.

71
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,470
How could I save him?

72
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,549
Does it deserve?

73
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,829
He did so,

74
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,869
after thousands of years, who will remember Gongsun Heng?

75
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,709
Who will thank him?

76
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:04,350
Does it deserve?

77
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,630
He doesn't care whether he will be remembered.

78
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,190
Even if everyone blames him, so what?

79
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,950
He never cares about this.

80
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,589
What he defends with his life is just caring about people.

81
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,070
Madam.

82
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,670
Everyone will die.

83
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,950
He died for what he wants.

84
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:38,029
It's not his sacrifice.

85
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,149
But as the guard army leader, it's the highest glory for him.

86
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,029
He died suddenly.

87
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,149
Please give me some time.

88
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:55,708
I want to accompany him.

89
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,549
Yes, madam.

90
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,470
Commandant.

91
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,790
When did you have this idea?

92
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,989
Is it three days ago,

93
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,029
five days ago,

94
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:40,549
or everyday?

95
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,589
But you never told me.

96
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:48,589
We've been married for so many years.

97
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,750
How could I not know what you thought?

98
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,900
You never changed.

99
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,740
That year,

100
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,340
you married me with a bride-price of wild geese.

101
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,978
I asked you what your ambition was.

102
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,818
You said even if people's life was hard,

103
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,659
you would overcome difficulties,

104
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,659
settle the chaos

105
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,659
and protect people.

106
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,539
I thought you were bragging.

107
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:27,979
However,

108
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:34,860
you sacrificed your life for this promise.

109
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:41,580
Rest assured.

110
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,179
We've prepared winter coats for soldiers and people.

111
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,499
And we stocked seeds for next spring.

112
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,298
After everything is settled,

113
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:59,499
Shuozhou will be safe and sound as you wish.

114
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,020
We were born in this turbulent world.

115
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:10,059
I hope I can live a peaceful life and spend every day with you.

116
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:15,660
It's just a wild wish now.

117
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,059
Forget it.

118
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,938
You died to defend this city.

119
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:43,499
You died as you wish.

120
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:46,460
But as a mother,

121
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,460
I'm a little selfish.

122
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,299
Yuan may suffer in the future.

123
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,660
Fool!

124
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
You two fools!

125
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:46,419
Governor and his wife died for people.

126
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,379
They died in glory.

127
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,739
But, Princess,

128
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:57,979
do you understand what the home is, what the country is,

129
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,419
what the people are, what the world is?

130
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,340
Governor asked me to work for you.

131
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:10,220
But what do you believe in?

132
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,540
And what is your belief?

133
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,820
Belief...

134
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,460
My belief...

135
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,379
What is my belief?

136
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,029
♫ Your shadow left here ♫

137
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,369
♫ I wish to see you one more time ♫

138
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,939
♫ Don't ask the falling sand ♫

139
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,684
♫ does it ever miss you? ♫

140
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:14,859
I didn't expect Gongsun Heng would surrender so easily.

141
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,140
And you agreed on his conditions so easily.

142
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,379
Gongsun Heng is a hero.

143
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,739
He deserves our worship with wine.

144
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,339
Our brothers don't know you promised Gongsun Heng that

145
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,460
you wouldn't enslave or kill the people in Shuozhou.

146
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:45,298
They respect you.

147
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,660
You can just tell them.

148
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,419
But how do you explain to Great Khan?

149
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,020
You wanted to defy Great Khan's order at the beginning?

150
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:02,540
So you risked your life to meet Gongsun Heng.

151
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,020
I thought you just wanted to check if that Shisi was fine.

152
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,820
Sun.

153
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,660
Are you crazy?

154
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,460
I only care if we can get Shuozhou or not.

155
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,699
I don't want to kill all people there.

156
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,500
You!

157
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:19,979
You are not what you used to be.

158
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,419
When did you become so merciful?

159
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:24,819
There's another thing.

160
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:26,739
Ibukan is dead.

161
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,699
Tu Kashe suffered much losses.

162
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,340
When Shuozhou surrenders tomorrow,

163
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,419
make sure Tu Kashe won't cause us any trouble.

164
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,140
Do you think Shuozhou will pretend to surrender tomorrow?

165
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,739
You don't know them.

166
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,540
They won't.

167
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,259
They?

168
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,140
You shall go back.

169
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,930
<i>Shuozhou</i>

170
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:46,739
Governor.

171
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,179
Let me accompany you to see Shuozhou again.

172
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:56,499
I think I understand the reason why you wanted to guard this place.

173
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:02,299
You chose the hardest way.

174
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,580
After you died, you become god.

175
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,540
Even in hell, your soul will still be a hero.

176
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,738
Although I'm not as kind and brave as you are,

177
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:16,539
I'll guard this place and the people here for you!

178
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,059
Even if there're difficulties and enemies,

179
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,419
I'm not afraid.

180
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,052
<i>Shuozhou</i>

181
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,320
<i>Shuozhou</i>

182
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:27,618
Why did no one come out?

183
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,059
Did they pretend to surrender again?

184
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:33,140
We can't trust what they said.

185
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,500
Wait.

186
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,139
Why isn't Commandant Li here?

187
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,499
Has he left here?

188
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,938
I'll find him.

189
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:50,739
Wait.

190
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,859
He'll surely come.

191
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,748
<i>Memorial Tablet of Gongsun</i>

192
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,499
Gongsun Heng has died.

193
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,819
Shuozhou will surrender.

194
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,380
It's useless to let you live now.

195
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,380
It's not settled yet.

196
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,700
As a Princess of Tang Dynasty,

197
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,539
I'll fight for my people this time.

198
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,539
If you try to stop me, you'll be the enemy of Tang.

199
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,299
My beloved ones were all killed like dogs.

200
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,260
I was expelled from where I was born.

201
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,220
I'd rather die everyday.

202
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,740
After I settled this,

203
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,380
you can kill me.

204
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,204
<i>Shuozhou Governor Gongsun Heng</i>

205
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,419
As a princess,

206
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,139
you knelt down to the surrendered general of Sui.

207
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,500
He deserves it.

208
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,740
Because in Shuozhou,

209
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,580
because of Gongsun Heng,

210
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,779
I've found I have my own belief now.

211
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,620
I don't want to give it up.

212
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,460
He sacrificed his life to defend this city.

213
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,299
He deserves it than anyone else.

215
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,499
Did you remake the accounts of treasury and ordnance?

216
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,658
Yes.

217
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,538
We hid over 70 percent.

218
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,779
When Ashile Sun comes in with pleasure,

219
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,759
you'll send Yuan out of the city.

220
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,720
At the same time, we'll transport these things secretly.

221
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:22,480
Without my message,

222
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,639
no one shall come back.

223
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:29,479
You don't have confidence in this surrender, Commandant Li?

224
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,519
The cities in the north have belonged to Ashile Tribe.

225
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,039
Chang'an didn't come to rescue.

226
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,038
It seems the war in the north

227
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,519
is not important than Li Shimin's throne.

228
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,800
No one knows what will happen after we surrender.

229
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,760
Governor left his daughter and these property with us.

230
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
I can feel relieved after I entrust you with that.

231
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,039
He sacrificed his life to protect Shuozhou.

232
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,840
I'll protect this place for him.

233
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,068
I, Qin Gu, am just a normal person.

234
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:12,068
I'm more than 60 years old.

235
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:15,749
I worked for five masters as their adviser.

236
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,228
They're all great men.

237
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:20,029
Some of them even can be emperors.

238
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,150
But they didn't defeat Family Li and died.

239
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,180
A person like me,

240
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:29,820
do you really want me to work for you?

241
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,499
Although I still don't know what belief I have,

242
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,890
But I know one thing clearly.

243
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:43,929
I've lost my home.

244
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,080
I don't want to lose Tang.

245
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,270
Please help me.

246
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:58,228
Okay.

247
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:02,869
Whatever you do, I'll support you.

248
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,068
Okay.

249
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:05,630
We need to try our best.

250
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:08,029
Okay.

251
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:12,949
You don't need to follow me.

252
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,709
I'll go alone.

253
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,669
♫  Nowhere to escape. No one to rely on  ♫

254
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:31,558
♫  Withdrawing smiles  ♫

255
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:41,270
♫  Never give in. Forget about one's youth  ♫

256
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,649
♫  I've never been afraid of loneliness when
embarking on this journey  ♫

257
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,571
♫  Tears and regrets go hand in hand  ♫

258
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:54,389
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. To the distance ♫

259
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,619
♫ The miserable past is like a dagger ♫

260
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,524
♫ Though my wings are broken ♫

261
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:07,075
♫ I will keep flying ♫

262
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:15,419
♫ Following the direction of the light, I'll forget you ♫

263
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,119
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness ♫

264
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,206
♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night ♫

265
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:27,199
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad ♫

266
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,807
♫ The river of life is under my feet. I don't regret my craziness ♫

267
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:49,059
♫ Following the direction of the light, I'll forget you ♫

268
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:55,349
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness ♫

269
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,399
♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night ♫

270
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,969
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad ♫

271
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:08,416
♫ The river of life is under my feet. I don't regret my craziness ♫

272
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:39,150
Isn't this Shisi?

273
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,468
On behalf of troops and people in Shuozhou,

274
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:45,949
I, Commandant Li Shisi, open the gate and surrender.

275
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:50,790
Shuozhou Governor, Gongsun Heng has committed suicide due to his guilt.

276
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,329
He hoped to use his death to release the anger of Tegin.

277
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,169
His head is here.

278
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,969
Please have a look, Tegin.

279
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,360
Go.

280
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,199
Tegin.

281
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,519
This is Gongsun Heng's head.

282
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:54,998
You knew he's hurt?

283
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:55,998
I bound it up for him.

284
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:56,999
Of course I knew.

285
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,159
You're that veterinarian!

286
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:30,468
My surname is Qin and last name is Zhun.

287
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:31,269
A'Zhun?

288
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,189
Are you really A'Zhun?

289
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,589
We fought against you.

290
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,869
We knew we're sinful.

291
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:59,030
The criminal Gongsun Heng asked me to give you treasury and food.

292
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,630
Now we've counted it.

293
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,069
Please go inside and check, Tegin.

294
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,390
Now we'll open the gate.

295
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:15,869
Tegin and the soldiers of Ashile Tribe can take treasures in the city.

296
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:22,270
As a criminal,

297
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:35,229
I hope Tegin can spare the lives of people in Shuozhou.

298
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,038
If you had known it, why hadn't you surrendered earlier?

299
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,839
Now many of our brothers have died.

300
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,959
Let you go?

301
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,840
Nonsense!

302
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,799
- We can't let him go.
- Kill him!

303
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,278
Kill him!

304
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,878
Revenge for our brothers!

305
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:50,398
Kill him!

306
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,079
Kill them!

307
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,038
We can't let him go!

308
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,998
We can't let him go!

309
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:54,839
Kill him!

310
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,518
Kill him! Kill him!

311
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,998
Kill him!

312
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:59,118
We can't let him go!

313
00:28:59,119 --> 00:28:59,959
Kill him!

314
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,758
We can't let him go!

315
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:02,559
Kill him!

316
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,360
Why do you think I'll promise you?

317
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,439
If you want to kill me, I have nothing to say.

318
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,840
But, if you want all people in this city to die, it's impossible.

319
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:26,519
If so, I'd choose to die together.

320
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,638
You loser.

321
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,158
Why don't you surrender?

322
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,800
Loser, just surrender!

323
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,348
I can kill you now!

324
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,630
Surrender! Surrender!

325
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,230
So,

326
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,559
you think you can still fight with me now?

327
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,840
I'm not bragging.

328
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,319
But there're woods and potassium nitrate in the city.

329
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,399
If you promise not to kill us, we won't choose to die with you.

330
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,720
If you insist on killing all the people in the city,

331
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,600
we'll choose to die together with your troop.

332
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,680
I should have warned you,

333
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:22,600
I hate to be threatened.

334
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,480
It's not like that, Tegin.

335
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,200
This is just a trade.

336
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,600
Okay.

337
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,240
I promise you.

338
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:58,398
The snow has stopped.

339
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:58,959
Right.

340
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,079
It's sunny again.

341
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
That's right.

342
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:03,960
Thank you for your mercy, Tegin.

343
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,440
I hope you can fulfill your promise.

344
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,119
Don't kill the people here.

345
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,960
But I have a condition.

346
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,239
I want you to be my servant.

347
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,960
I'm your master and you should work for me.

348
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,479
Good!

349
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,319
Such a good idea!

350
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,879
Now that Gongsun Heng died, he'll be the commandant of Shuozhou.

351
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,398
Let them see how their commandant became our slave now.

352
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,359
Good idea!

353
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,399
Good idea!

354
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,150
If you agree,

355
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,700
I won't kill the people in Shuozhou.

356
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,780
You...

357
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,299
You want me to be your slave?

358
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:54,699
Right.

359
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:56,819
My slave.

360
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:59,460
Now everyone in Shuozhou has known that

361
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,259
you betrayed your master and become a traitor.

362
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,019
You can't stay here now.

363
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:12,260
Don't make me wait.

364
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,340
I don't have patience.

365
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,860
I can withdraw my promise at anytime.

366
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:37,740
I'll be your servant.

367
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:17,260
Yuan, you're awake.

368
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,299
Where's Brother Li?

369
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,619
Brother Li said he wanted you to behave well.

370
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,500
After a while, he'll come to play with you.

371
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:34,818
I'll behave well.

372
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:38,100
I want to see Brother Li soon.

373
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,018
Yuan is a good girl.

374
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,980
You're such a good girl.

375
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,699
Move!

376
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,580
Step aside!

377
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:15,379
Step aside!

378
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,260
Step aside!

379
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,139
Step aside!

380
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,060
Step aside!

381
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:24,859
Just go! Be quick.

382
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:27,939
Step aside!

383
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,979
Look, what happened?

384
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,780
I don't know.

385
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,619
There're so many people.

386
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:07,178
Traitor! Traitor!

387
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:07,898
Traitor!

388
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:08,979
Traitor!

389
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,459
Traitor! Traitor!

390
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,739
You betrayed your master!

391
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
Why are you still alive?

392
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,739
Traitor!

393
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,578
You traitor!

394
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:20,699
Governor and his wife died all because of you!

395
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,739
You traitor!

396
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,138
Why didn't you die?

397
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:23,898
You villain!

398
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:25,299
Traitor! Traitor!

399
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,649
Traitor! Traitor!

400
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,450
Why didn't you die?

401
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:30,020
Shameless!

402
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,060
Traitor!

403
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,098
Traitor!

404
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:37,179
It's all because of you!

405
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,098
Villain!

406
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,579
It's all because of you!

407
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:44,740
Just go to hell!

408
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,499
Go to hell!

409
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,338
He didn't even explain.

410
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:04,220
Explain?

411
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:06,500
Will it work?

412
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:10,939
People will only believe what they want to believe.

413
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:23,059
Step aside! Step aside!

414
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,539
Shameless!

415
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,618
Step aside!

416
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:25,419
Step aside!

417
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,139
The Governor of Shuozhou has died.

418
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,659
Great Khan admires his courage,

419
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:41,339
so he'll pardon Shuozhou.

420
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,499
Pardon us?

421
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,539
Pardon us?

422
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,098
Great.

423
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:46,658
Right.

424
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:47,658
Right.

425
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:49,539
We won't be killed.

426
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,418
Great.

427
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:51,578
We're pardoned.

428
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:52,618
We're pardoned.

429
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,099
We don't need to die.

430
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:05,819
Tegin Sun won't betray his promise.

431
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,300
Do you feel relived now?

432
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:16,220
Look at them.

433
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:18,700
None of them understands your sacrifice.

434
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:20,859
They hate you.

435
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,939
Does it deserve?

436
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:42,619
Who will thank him?

437
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,780
Does it deserve?

438
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:50,500
What he defends with his life is just caring about people.

439
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,580
Yes, it does.

440
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,938
Sun, you really don't need to watch them packing?

441
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:56,859
What if someone can't tolerate it and kill some of our brothers?

442
00:38:57,899 --> 00:38:58,980
If you are worried,

443
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,020
go to check yourself.

444
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:02,459
Where is he?

445
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:05,338
Tu Kashe.

446
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,178
You're so shameless.

447
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,898
This is not the area of Bear Division.

448
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:10,378
Did we ask you to come in?

449
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:13,219
I never had defeat during these years.

450
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,578
But I has never won since I came here.

451
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,139
I have already been shameless!

452
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,859
Let me ask you, why did you let the defenders go secretly?

453
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,739
It's none of your business.

454
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,858
I asked this for Great Khan.

455
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:30,338
The young men in the city are either dead or injured.

456
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:31,819
The rest are some elders and women.

457
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,259
If we take them back, who will take care of them?

458
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,938
We can kill them and bring their heads back.

459
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,739
Many soldiers in Bear Division died.

460
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,899
How could I explain to them?

461
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:41,659
Many brothers in Eagle Division died as well!

462
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,060
If you didn't plunge into action,

463
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:47,260
how could we fail in camouflage?

464
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,260
Tu Kashe.

465
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,139
You ruined the plan Great Khan made.

466
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:55,139
Now you want to blame me on behalf of Great Khan?

467
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,020
Are you qualified?

468
00:40:00,379 --> 00:40:01,819
I'm not!

469
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,739
But you can't let them go!

470
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,939
If I were you,

471
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,939
I'd choose to shut up.

472
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:10,740
If so,

473
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:15,220
maybe I can share some profit with you.

474
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,139
Otherwise,

475
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,980
I don't know what I'll write on my battle report.

476
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,379
Let's wait and see.

477
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,619
You really want to report this to Great Khan?

478
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,858
In the past, we were merciful to people in Tang.

479
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:47,219
No other people will know it.

480
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,849
But this time, Bear Division saw what we did.

481
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,219
They'll surely take the chance to defame us in front of Great Khan.

482
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,020
Mu Jin.

483
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
Remember,

484
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:00,060
It's my decision. It's not related to Eagle Division.

485
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,858
You...

486
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:02,659
Also,

487
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:04,540
do me a favor.

488
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,178
Have a look.

489
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:12,979
What is this?

490
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,459
Here.

491
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,019
Come on.

492
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,739
What is it?

493
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,540
Have a look.

494
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,578
<i>Notice: Commandant Li Shisi was killed.</i>

495
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,979
If he knew this, why would he do that?

496
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,739
He must have felt guilty.

497
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,740
Since he's dead, it's all over now.

498
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,219
Commandant Li has made contributions to Shuozhou.

499
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,459
That's right.

500
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,938
He paid for it.

501
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:39,499
He has paid for it!

502
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,178
Come on, let's go.

503
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:41,898
Let's go.

504
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,139
He paid for it.

505
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,540
If you die,

506
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,260
I won't let the people here go.

507
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,980
What do you want to do?

508
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,020
Don't forget.

509
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:43,379
I've made Ashile Tribe suffer a great loss.

510
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,859
If you want me to work for you,

511
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,020
what will Tu Kashe do?

512
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:52,579
What will other tribes and Great Khan think of it?

513
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:54,780
What a pity!

514
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:57,500
Commandant Li has died.

515
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,500
From now on,

516
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
you'll just be a slave in Eagle Division.
