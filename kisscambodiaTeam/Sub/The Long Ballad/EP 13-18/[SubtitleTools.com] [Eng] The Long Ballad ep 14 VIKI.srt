<i>The Long Ballad</i>

22
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,710
<i>Episode 14</i>

23
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,369
Assemble the Bear Division now!

24
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,369
Quickly!

25
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,689
But Mu Jin found me.

26
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,690
This is from him.

27
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:52,769
You can leave.

28
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,570
Yes.

29
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,990
<i>Anyone who takes reckless actions would be killed. By Great Khan</i>

30
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,928
How dare he command me by the order of Great Khan!

31
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:06,208
But Tegin!

32
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,369
If it was really from Great Khan,

33
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,689
our dispatch would mess up Great Khan's plan.

34
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,288
I'm afraid of...

35
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,169
Of what?

36
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,488
If you don't march now,

37
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,489
we will be despised by the Eagle Division forever!

38
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:20,450
Dispatch now! Assemble Bear Division!

39
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,208
Tegin.

40
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:38,649
What are you laughing at?

41
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,328
Are you done with your life?

42
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,370
I'm laughing that the famous Tegin of Bear Division is actually a coward!

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,009
Really?

44
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,688
Tegin!

45
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:48,408
You are killing him!

46
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,129
Yes, I am!

47
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,090
Calm down, Tegin!

48
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,128
If you kill me,

49
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,889
then you would lose the last chance to defeat Eagle Division.

50
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,408
You'd better understand the situation.

51
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,208
If you want to say anything, say it now.

52
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,928
Don't waste Tegin's time!

53
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:09,049
Commandant Li, the defender, is my brother.

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,450
I'm the best chip for you to negotiate with him.

55
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,889
How much are you worth?

56
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,730
At least I am worth a half of Shuozhou in my brother's eyes.

57
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,169
Are you telling me the truth?

58
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,370
If I'm not, you can kill me at any time you want.

59
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,450
Stop!

60
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,688
Didn't we arrange to meet under the city.

61
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:44,969
I just received the message.

62
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,208
Tu Kashe and Ibukan was heading to Shuozhou with a man from central plains.

63
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,408
We have to be quick.

64
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,208
We have to arrive before they take reckless moves.

65
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,848
Or all our plans would be destroyed.

66
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,609
Dress up Tegin!

67
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,410
Yes!

68
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,129
Commandant Li, Bear Division has arrived.

69
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,649
How dare they come again?

70
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,568
Just a few of them.

71
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,930
But strangely, a man from central plains is with them.

72
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,030
Go!

73
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,110
Go!

74
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,150
<i>Shuozhou</i>

75
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,650
Li!

76
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,410
Look who he is.

77
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,569
A'Dou!

78
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,370
A'Dou...

79
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,929
Speak, ask them to open the gate!

80
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,530
Speak!

81
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,729
Ask them to open the gate!

82
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:00,208
Speak!

83
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,570
Ask them to open the gate!

84
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:08,009
If you beat him once again, I'll smash your bones!

85
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:10,929
Commandant Li!

86
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,048
As long as you open your gate, and come to negotiate with us,

87
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:16,250
I will let go of him.

88
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:20,609
Or, I will beat him to death in front of you.

89
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:42,649
Commandant Li!

90
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,728
- Leave me alone!
- Commandant Li!

91
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:44,768
Leave me alone!

92
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,328
They are too close to our gate!

93
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:48,569
Even if we just open a little, they can rush in immediately!

94
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,969
The consequence is horrible!

95
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,049
Yes! Commandant Li!

96
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:16,569
You are such a beast!

97
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,929
You even beat a child!

98
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,910
<i>Shuozhou</i>

99
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:47,370
I will be a general!

100
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,210
A'Dou!

101
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,569
No!

102
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,048
Wait! I'm saving you now!

103
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:55,849

104
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,008
Commandant Li!

105
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,569
No!

106
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,089
Leave me alone!

107
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,608
You can't!

108
00:07:58,609 --> 00:07:59,689
Commandant!

109
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,249
Commandant Li!

110
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,809
Set me free!

111
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,810
You can't put the whole Shuozhou in danger just for him!

112
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,689
I will be a general!

113
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,329
A'Dou is saying something?

114
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:39,249
I will be... will be a general!

115
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,889
A'Dou knelt down not to ask us to save him,

116
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:50,410
he is saying...

117
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,800
♫ We get separated. ♫

118
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,150
♫ The grits through the fingers. ♫

119
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,110
♫ The moment I clench, ♫

120
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,125
♫ I've lost them. ♫

121

Don't be silly!

122
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,410
A'Dou!

123
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,899
♫ Forget it. Forget it. ♫

124

Don't be silly, A'Dou!

126
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,049
Stand up!

127
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,128
You stand up!

128
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,170
Stand up, A'Dou!

129
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:51,609
Master.

130
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:56,328
I... finally I can be a general!

131
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,769
I finally become your subordinate!

132
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:02,649
A'Dou! You will be a general when you grow up.

133
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,289
I will take you away from here.

134
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,849
You can't die here, A'Dou!

135
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,769
I take you away from here!

136
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,970
Master.

137
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,129
I can do it.

138
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,688
I can!

139
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:19,609
No, you can't!

140
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,289
A'Dou! No!

141
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,090
A'Dou! Stand up!

142
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:31,610
Daizhou is lost, no reinforcements!

143
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,170
Liar!

144
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,650
I will kill you!

145
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,769
A'Dou!

146
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,729
He said no reinforcement!

147
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,208
Who are they?

148
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,929
They are from Ashile Tribe who are in the disguise of reinforcements.

149
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,769
Use semaphore, 10000 soldiers.

150
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:32,249
These people from Ashile Tribe cannot approach Shuozhou!

151
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:33,929
Commandant Li, Commandant Li!

152
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,489
Use semaphore! Quickly!

153
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,529
Be quick!

154
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,769
Reinforce Commandant Li!

155
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:41,730
Hurry up!

156
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,128
Tegin!

157
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,489
The plan of Ashile Sun is ruined by that boy.

158
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,609
What can we do?

159
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,129
Why not take the lead?

160
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,929
The best hostage is killed by you.

161
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,729
What a good plan!

162
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,448
Take the lead?

163
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:56,169
With such a few soldiers?

164
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,328
Pullout first.

165
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:58,569
Wait until they arrive.

166
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:00,568
Yes.

167
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:01,369
Retreat!

168
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,850
Stop!

169
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:29,650
Kill them!

170
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,329
Bear Division! Retreat!

171
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,609
Retreat!

172
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,410
Retreat!

173
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:55,809
Retreat!

174
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,568
Tu Kashe is such a bastard!

175
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,889
He escaped!

176
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,489
Sun, they are giving no thought to death now!

177
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,170
This is bad for us.

178
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,568
This is for A'Dou.

179
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:55,930
Don't... don't kill me.

180
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,569
This is for people of Shuozhou.

181
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,808
The oppressed will rise to win.

182
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,490
Tu Kashe made us lose our chance.

183
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:18,249
Let's go.

184
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:38,369
Go.

185
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:52,929
The last is for my dead men!

186
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,930
None of my business.

187
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,129
No, don't kill me.

190
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:40,489
Although I have no idea who you are, you are not an ordinary man.

191
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,608
I live a poor life and no one cares about me.

192
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:45,009
I'm afraid that no one would care when I die.

193
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,769
If I can fight with master, it's worthy even if I would die.

194
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,649
Master, you are my future.

195
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,410
I will be with you no matter life or death.

196
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,969
Since you take me as your master, we have to obey the ritual.

197
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,129
From now on, you are my apprentice.

198
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,210
We will never betray each other.

199
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,889
After I make contributions, you will call me General Dou!

200
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,210
I will be a general!

210
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,128
Master, we are fighting with each other now.

211
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:11,248
Ashile Sun is their Tegin.

212
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,129
Why would you write this?

213
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,610
What?

214
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,249
Are you afraid of me colluding with the enemy?

215
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:19,769
I don't dare.

216
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,330
Just kidding.

217
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,368
You have been with me for so many years.

218
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,049
Have I ever done anything with no assurance?

219
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,968
I have thought about all the possible consequences.

220
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,410
Everything is under control.

221
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:38,530
Just hand him this letter.

222
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:40,169
Yes.

223
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,370
Governor.

224
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:48,530
Governor. I have a plan.

225
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,409
Go ahead.

226
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,368
Governor.

227
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:53,088
It becomes cooler and windy in September.

228
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:54,608
We can pretend to retreat,

229
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:56,689
and let Eagle Division take charge of Shuozhou.

230
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,848
And set dried firewood in town.

231
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:01,529
As soon as Ashile Sun's division comes, we set on fire.

232
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,810
Take advantage of the north wind, they would be burnt to nothing.

233
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:12,728
If their division keeps encircling the town,

234
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:16,009
the food left in town can only supply for three days.

235
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,849
According to your plan, jade and stone will be burned together.

236
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,570
All the people in Shuozhou would become refugees.

237
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:32,170
Commandant Li, you think the latter is worthy in this dilemma?

238
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,450
I...

239
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:53,089
So in your opinion, why do I want to defend Shuozhou?

240
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,629
What I'm defending is not just a fortress,

241
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,289
but the people here and their good life.

242
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,410
If not,

243
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,530
I wouldn't have surrendered to Tang right after Li Yuan's revolt.

244
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,129
Now I think,

245
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:18,689
Battle or surrender, just strategies.

246
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,409
People live a stable life without being suffered from battles.

247
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,849
That's the most important.

248
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:29,930
These are what I have stuck to.

249
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,010
Governor.

250
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:36,650
Are you thinking of surrendering to Ashile Tribe?

251
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,050
Did A'Dou and those dead soldiers die in vain?

252
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,608
Commandant Li.

253
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,050
Calm down.

254
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,089
It's just an analogy.

255
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:58,930
It's my fault.

256
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,689
Fine, Commandant Li.

257
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,769
It's late now.

258
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,769
As for the strategy, I already have made a plan.

259
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,729
We can discuss tomorrow.

260
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,090
Yes.

261
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,369
You dare to come yourself.

262
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,290
I admire your courage.

263
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:07,409
I'm very pleased to meet you, governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng.

264
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,690
Since you invited me here,

265
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,489
you wouldn't set any traps.

266
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:12,929
Besides,

267
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,849
you are the same.

268
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,609
What are you going to discuss with me?

269
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,210
Just go ahead.

270
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,769
If you take charge of Shuozhou,

271
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:29,729
would you guarantee never harming the people here?

272
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,170
If I take advantage of the north wind to burn the city,

273
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:46,849
though I won't expect Eagle Division to die with me,

274
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:52,368
all you get would be ashes of Shuozhou at that time.

275
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:56,369
I think, Tegin won't be satisfied with this, right?

276
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,690
If you wanted to do that, you wouldn't have waited till today.

277
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,969
Nor would you threaten me like this.

278
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:06,369
This is not a menace.

279
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,450
It's just a request.

280
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,450
I'm really curious why you would ask me this.

281
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,248
We have been in battles for so long,

282
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:21,409
the casualties of Shouzhou army are heavy.

283
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,530
Am I a softhearted man in your eyes?

284
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,009
When you Eagle Division burnt the granary,

285
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,330
you could have burnt the surrounding houses together.

286
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,930
I could only save people first.

287
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,489
But you didn't do that.

288
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,089
You spared their lives,

289
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,969
and informed me so that I could come in time.

290
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,450
That meant you didn't want to kill innocent people.

291
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,169
These years, you led Eagle Division fighting in many battlefields.

292
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,570
I have already heard about some of your styles.

293
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:03,930
I believe that you have the ability,

294
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,009
and the aspiration to save their lives.

295
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,410
But,

296
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,769
these years I have fought with Ashile Tribe for so many times.

297
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,650
Ashile Tribe hates me and Shuozhou so much.

298
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,690
Now, since I am going to give Shuozhou to you,

299
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,129
then I have to be sincere.

300
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:41,210
I will give you a gift which will satisfy all the soldiers of Ashile Tribe.

301
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:46,769
I won't make you embarrassed, Tegin.

302
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:49,009
Are you sure?

303
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,848
You burnt yourself out.

304
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:52,650
Is it worthy?

305
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:56,690
You can't go back on your promise.

306
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,729
Just a gift.

307
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,210
Comparing to the safety of people in Shuozhou,

308
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,810
it's nothing.

309
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:10,169
I,

310
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,330
Have no regrets.

311
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:24,729
I finally know how you get the name Tribune Gongsun Heng.

312
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:27,050
No worries, governor.

313
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,769
I promise what you asked for.

314
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:33,609
I won't go back on my words.

315
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,488
Okay.

316
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:40,889
Then I will say thank you for all my people in Shuozhou here.

317
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:59,190
<i>Governor Mansion</i>

318
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,409
These days we are in so many battles,

319
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,608
we have defended for so many days.

320
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:04,729
It's been hard for everyone.

321
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,848
It's not that serious, governor.

322
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,570
You've done your best for the people here, It's much harder for you.

323
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:11,409
Yes.

324
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,329
Master is like our backbone.

325
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,389
As long as master is here,

326
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,709
people of Shuozhou won't be afraid of the enemy

327
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,270
will unite together to defend the city.

328
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,968
This time we lost too much.

329
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,608
For all the casualties,

330
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:26,608
we have to do well in comfort and compensation.

331
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:27,728
As soon as we get our chance,

332
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:31,409
we have to send someone to Chang'an to report our situation.

333
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,410
And ask for support.

334
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,849
These years, Shuozhou's harvest has been not good enough.

335
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,489
Now our granary got burnt and the fields got damaged,

336
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:42,768
one disaster after another.

337
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:44,769
How can we get through this spring festival?

338
00:29:45,489 --> 00:29:47,489
What about the livelihood next year?

339
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,249
You have to consider these things carefully.

340
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:01,729
There is still a long way for us to go.

341
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,170
Here, I would like to say thank you on behalf of the army and the people in Shuozhou.

342
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,049
It's not that serious, governor.

343
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,968
These are our duties.

344
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:12,129
No need to say thanks.

345
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,589
This is on behalf of the army and the people

346
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,089
to express their gratitude to your deep affection.

347
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:21,649
Commandant Li,

348
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,848
it's hard to turn down the warm-hearted offer of governor.

349
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:29,129
Drink it.

350
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:36,569
Cheers.

351
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:46,329
It's Millet Wine made by madam.

352
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,008
It's so sweet and mellow!

353
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:49,128
It's hard for you to have rest.

354
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:50,769
Drink more if you like.

355
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:52,529
Today is our family feast.

356
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,650
Make yourself at home.

357
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,369
Yuan.

358
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,848
Put that wooden sword down.

359
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:00,768
Can you play after lunch?

360
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:01,609
Okay.

361
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:05,248
Yuan just got this wooden sword today.

362
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:06,689
She refuses to put it down.

363
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,088
I asked her why.

364
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:11,968
She said that she wants to be like brother Li, brother Dou and her father,

365
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,449
to defend people and help the weak.

366
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,848
Then Yuan has to grow up faster.

367
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:20,009
As soon as you grow up, you can punish the evils with your brother Li.

368
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:24,008
That would be so good!

369
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,330
Yuan, say thanks to brother Li.

370
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:31,930
If Yuan really likes this, practices some martial arts.

371
00:31:32,969 --> 00:31:36,330
If one day father cannot be with you,

372
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:40,729
you can protect yourself, and won't be bullied by bad people.

373
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,249
Why can't father be with me?

374
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,129
Silly girl,

375
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:54,888
Don't you get married this life?

376
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:57,729
Do you want to stay with me, and be an old maid?

377
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,050
Madam, a toast to you too.

378
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,969
These years, I've focused on my job.

379
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:14,769
Thanks for your hard work at home, taking care of the wounded,

380
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,009
and all the rear services,

381
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,608
as well as comforting bereaved families.

382
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:22,170
You've been working hard.

383
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:30,769
Even our Yuan, has been looked after and educated by you.

384
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:37,650
I really don't know how to pay back for all these you have done for me.

385
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,530
We have the same goal, we share the same feeling.

386
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,530
No need to say thanks.

387
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,849
You have your way,

388
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,129
and that would be my choice too.

389
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:04,488
I said you could do anything you want.

390
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:06,889
Although I am just a woman at home,

391
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:10,009
but I will keep my pace with you,

392
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:14,210
and walk on the same road with you.

393
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:32,929
Madam,

394
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,889
you have to take care of yourself.

395
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:39,050
Now autumn comes,

396
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,570
take good care of yourself.

397
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,170
Or when it comes to winter,

398
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,769
your hands and feet would be cold again,

399
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,129
and also suffer from insomnia.

400
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,570
Don't worry about me.

401
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,529
Winter is hard, but the spring will come.

402
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,690
The spring will come.

403
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:50,089
Come on.

404
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:52,410
Let's drink.

405
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,730
This one is for Shuozhou.

406
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,669
Wish our Shuozhou a good weather and harvest

407
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,730
just like before after this war.

408
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,690
We have you, so we will.

409
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,050
Come on.

410
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,230
<i>Protect territory and rehabilitate people</i>

411
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,729
Governor, you kept me here.

412
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,250
Anything else for me?

413
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:43,770
Commandant Li, please sit down.

414
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,250
Please.

415
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,650
This is the defense map of Shuozhou.

416
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:07,450
All the inventory material, grain depots and treasury are indicated here.

417
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,210
And this token,

418
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,849
you can deploy all the defenders of Shuozhou with this,

419
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,650
as well as all the people in my mansion.

420
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,250
Why are you handing me these?

421
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,288
Defenders of Shuozhou can only deployed by you.

422
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,170
Why are you handing me this token?

423
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,490
Defenders of Shuozhou only listen to governor,

424
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:36,410
that because I am here.

425
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:38,889
Governor,

426
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:40,690
what do you mean?

427
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:46,369
I have determined to surrender tomorrow.

428
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:54,770
Ashile Sun also promised me that he would keep my people safe.

429
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,569
The cost...

430
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,129
What's the cost?

431
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:02,930
Cost...

432
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,329
The cost is my head.

433
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,409
Governor!

434
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,009
Please give me some more time.

435
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,930
I can come up with a wonderful plan!

436
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,368
This is already a wonderful plan.

437
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:22,249
Governor!

438
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,650
For these years, Ashile Tribe never occupied Shuozhou once.

439
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,909
So, to defenders of Shuozhou, as long as I am here,

440
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,329
they would never surrender even if they have only one left.

441
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:39,930
But to Ashile Tribe, I have defended the border for so many years,

442
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,169
their Great Khan has been defeated by me for many times.

443
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,970
He has hated my guts.

444
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,930
Now only by giving him my head,

445
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,289
can I eliminate his doubt and piled-up grievances.

446
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,930
And only in this way,

447
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:59,770
can I get people's lives back.

448
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,209
No! I don't agree.

449
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,569
We must have other choices.

450
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:16,729
If I can hand over people's life to the princess of Tang,

451
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,129
that will be my best end.

452
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,528
Princess Yongning is clever and smart,

453
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:27,490
you have many things to do next,

454
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,129
and still have a long way to go.

455
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,809
You can't die now.

456
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:35,889
You know who I am, Governor?

457
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:41,689
The guy who chased you called you Princess Yongning.

458
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,809
Princess Yongning,

459
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,970
any last words?

460
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,848
I fought with him before.

461
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:55,569
From his kungfu skill, I knew he must be a guard from the court.

462
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:59,848
He traveled so far to Shuozhou just for killing you.

463
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:02,849
But he had no official document for arrest.

464
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:05,848
Apart from the former crown prince's subordinate,

465
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,049
who else would you be?

466
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:15,650
Actually to me, it's not important who you are.

467
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,549
For the first time when we met,

468
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,410
you saved my wife and Yuan with a trick,

469
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,410
I knew that you are not an ordinary person.

470
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:31,049
No matter what you wanted from me from the beginning,

471
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:37,609
I was sure that you meant no bad to me and Shuozhou.

472
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:42,529
So I would like to keep you beside me.

473
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,809
But,

474
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:53,410
I can't wait till the day you achieve your goal.

475
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,289
Governor, my name is Li Changge.

476
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,889
I'm the daughter of prince Li Jiancheng.

477
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,730
I have not been Princess Yongning since a long time ago.

478
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,490
Now I just want to fight by your side.

479
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,169
Please recall your order!

480
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,090
Changge will spare no effort to defend Shuozhou!

481
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,288
Princess!

482
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:19,529
Princess! No.

483
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,210
Princess!

484
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:23,729
I've been loyal for my whole life.

485
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,410
At this moment,

486
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,889
I can't arrogate.

487
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:31,849
It's me who should kneel down now.

488
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,450
Princess,

489
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,650
you have such a deep affection towards the people in Shuozhou,

490
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,730
please receive my worship.

491
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,888
Governor!

492
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:44,049
Please stand up, governor.

493
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:46,769
How can I receive this?

494
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,609
Stand up please.

495
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:49,609
Please.

496
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:51,609
Princess,

497
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,250
I still have something to ask for your help.

498
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:01,129
Till now, only this issue worries me.

499
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,569
My Yuan is still a little girl.

500
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:10,689
I know.

501
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,210
After I die,

502
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,609
my wife would not marry others.

503
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,368
So princess, please.

504
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:30,170
Try your best to take care of them.

505
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:39,369
I will say thanks for them here.

506
00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:43,849
Governor,

507
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,609
you should watch Yuan growing up.

508
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:48,170
Governor!

509
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,329
Recall your order!

510
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,490
Recall your order! Governor!

511
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,010
I will bless them to be safe and sound in Heaven.

512
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,089
Senior Qin.

513
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:05,569
Take princess down to have a rest.

514
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,169
Governor!

515
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:08,970
Governor!

516
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:10,690
Governor!
