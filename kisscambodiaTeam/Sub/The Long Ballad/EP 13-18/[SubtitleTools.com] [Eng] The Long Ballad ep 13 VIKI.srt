<i>The Long Ballad</i>

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,030
<i>Episode 13</i>

23
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,968
Governor, this is all my fault.

24
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,848
I capitalize on terrain too much, moving our troops from east to west.

25
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,089
I want to atone for my faults.

26
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,050
Please let me handle them.

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,928
Fine.

28
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,568
The war is all about the wit and moral courage.

29
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:56,969
It's not entirely your fault.

30
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,089
I just didn't know

31
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,050
the elite squad of Ashile Tribe could be this cunning.

32
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,050
Xu Feng, summon all our people

33
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,729
to meet me and Commandant Li

34
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,488
at the East Gate and confront the enemies.

35
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:09,289
Yes.

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,449
But Governor, they were constantly on the run

37
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,809
before they attacked our barn.

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,809
Now they're at the east gate, miles apart from the barn.

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,768
How could they be so quick?

40
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:21,569
Shisi,

41
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,129
you should know that

42
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:24,609
from now on,

43
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,289
you're facing the most elite and powerful cavalry of Ashile Tribe.

44
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:05,730
On my order.

45
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:08,730
Shoot!

46
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,569
Master!

47
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,728
Governor!

48
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:06,208
Master!

49
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:06,608
Governor!

50
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:07,409
Governor!

51
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:11,529
I'm fine.

52
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,769
Put a bandage on it and it'll do.

53
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,450
Governor!

54
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,949
Governor, you should go back.

55
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,069
I'll be here.

56
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,849
You need to lead the troops

57
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,008
and defend the east side.

58
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:31,809
Yes!

59
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,008
Take Governor back, now!

60
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:35,809
Yes.

61
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,730
This isn't good. They've got reinforcements.

62
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:56,569
Yaro has destroyed all the state owned land

63
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,649
according to your plan.

64
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,449
Gongsun Heng shall find out about it soon.

65
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,650
Wear this.

66
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,289
Come on, I'm so handsome.

67
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,489
Why would I wear this?

68
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:10,729
Alright, then.

69
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,209
I should've picked a prettier one.

70
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,179
How about it?

71
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,980
Do I look good?

72
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,320
<i>Shuozhou</i>

73
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,979
Isn't that Shisi?

74
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,499
You're afraid that he'll recognize us.

75
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,938
So you've both hidden your real identites.

76
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:36,739
Shut up.

77
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:40,208
So you're not real friends.

78
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,488
Well, that just makes everything fine.

79
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:42,529
I'll kill him.

80
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,689
Destroy the leader and the gang will collapse.

81
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,769
Shut up!

82
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:54,409
Give out my order.

83
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,849
Go all the way to attack the city.

84
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,328
Attention, Eagle Division!

85
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:00,289
Kill!

86
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,290
Kill!

87
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:15,169
Kill!

88
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,328
Registrar, the east gate has always been the least defended area.

89
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,608
I've sent people to get lookout towers and catapults from elsewhere.

90
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:26,850
Do we have any more javelins?

91
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,690
The remaining iron caltrops are less than 50 kilos.

92
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,289
We can only lay one line of defense

93
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,529
with the iron caltrops now available.

94
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,289
And the Eagle Division can easily avoid it.

95
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,328
We should do whatever we can

96
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,448
to make the best use of the existing iron caltrops.

97
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:51,249
Yes!

98
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,208
Whoever they are, Eagle Divison or reinforcements.

99
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,089
They must've been on the run the entire night.

100
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,208
They wouldn't have enough time

101
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,849
to feed their horses with food and water.

102
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,290
Don't eat that!

103
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,090
Don't eat that!

104
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,530
Stop eating!

105
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:25,889
Stop it!

106
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,090
Rein up!

107
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:50,609
Nice!

108
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,529
It's him again!

109
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,768
Sun, we must kill him.

110
00:08:58,769 --> 00:08:59,929
If we get defeated,

111
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,650
Great Khan would be so mad at us!

112
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,330
Sun!

113
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,329
What are you hesitating about?

114
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,170
Tegin Sun!

115
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,008
Registrar!

116
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:16,930
Master!

117
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,128
Master!

118
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,248
Master!

119
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,049
Registrar!

120
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,009
Help!

121
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,170
Help!

122
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,049
Master!

123
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,328
Master!

124
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,290
Master!

125
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,849
Your commander is now dead.

126
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,129
Surrender now, get disarmed

127
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,929
and we won't kill you.

128
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,729
Surrender! Surrender!

129
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,529
Surrender! Surrender!

130
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,650
Surrender! Surrender! Surrender!

131
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,650
Surrender! Surrender! Surrender!

132
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:00,809
Surrender!

133
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:03,208
Surrender!

134
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:04,650
Surrender!

135
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,249
Surrender!

136
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:17,889
Surrender!

137
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,609
Commandant Li stood up!

138
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,008
Commandant Li didn't die!

139
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,368
Commandant Li didn't die!

140
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:58,449
Commandant Li stood up!

141
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,009
How could it be?

142
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,688
Sun.

143
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:08,729
You're the best warrior on the plains.

144
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,368
You never miss the targets!

145
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:11,128
Great!

146
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,568
Great! Great!

147
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:13,849
Great!

148
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,008
No way, Sun.

149
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,289
The chief commander of Shuozhou didn't die.

150
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,688
It boosted their morale.

151
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,649
It's not a great time for us to launch an attack.

152
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,730
Well...

153
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,090
Withdraw.

154
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:32,809
Encamp outside the walls.

155
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:36,009
Withdraw now!

156
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:41,049
We won!

157
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,850
We won!

158
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,729
We won! We won! We won!

159
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,050
We won! We won! We won!

160
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,650
Master!

161
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:15,489
Master.

162
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,650
Why are you up?

163
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,368
How's Governor doing?

164
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:21,409
Master, you're seriously injured.

165
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,328
I can't believe you're still worring about others.

166
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:24,129
I'm fine.

167
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,249
It's just minor bruising.

168
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,089
Not to mention that the doctor has changed my dressing.

169
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,649
Right now,

170
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,809
what really matters is our war against Ashile Tribe.

171
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,529
Governor is also wounded.

172
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,889
How could I rest?

173
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,089
Governor's new injury triggered his old wounds.

174
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,530
He's at his bedroom now.

175
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,249
A'Dou, You should go to bed now.

176
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,049
I'll go talk to Governor

177
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,208
- and see what we can do.
- Master!

178
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,208
Don't forget that your target is not Shuozhou,

179
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,568
but Changan.

180
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,568
Your health is everything.

181
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:53,369
A'Dou,

182
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,530
compared to this war in Shuozhou,

183
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,449
the personal hatred between me and Li Shimin is nothing.

184
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,970
Right now,

185
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,010
the situation in Shuozhou is grim.

186
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,930
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

187
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,569
Well,

188
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:12,650
you'll change my dressing on time, right?

189
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,090
I'm just worried about your health.

190
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:25,569
Look,

191
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,049
I'm fine.

192
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,489
Wolf Division is targeting Yunzhou and Daizhou.

193
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,289
Great Khan ordered you

194
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,609
to take Shuozhou in ten days.

195
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,050
Or, he'll lead the troops himself.

196
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,849
If we just camp outside the city like this,

197
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,769
I doubt if we can take Shuozhou in 10 days.

198
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,529
By that time,

199
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,609
Eagle Division will be an object of universal derision.

200
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,050
A trapped beast will still struggle.

201
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,129
But it won't last long.

202
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,530
Fair enough.

203
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,008
We've burned their barns,

204
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:21,050
and destroyed their lands.

205
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:22,689
They'll be starved to death.

206
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:24,609
Mu Jin,

207
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,089
what do you think of my archery?

208
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,050
You never miss a target.

209
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,768
Sun, don't tell me you're sneaking into Shuozhou

210
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:42,050
at a time like this.

211
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:43,688
No way.

212
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:44,688
I won't permit that.

213
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:45,969
I was wrong.

214
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,208
Your archery is just great.

215
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,809
Li Shisi must be alright.

216
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,009
Really.

217
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:56,369
Take the reports.

218
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,329
Let's go to see Tu Kashe.

219
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,889
I need to get rid of him.

220
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:03,449
Eagle Division must be the one

221
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,449
to take over Shuozhou.

222
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:14,328
Tegin, there's no need to be angry.

223
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:15,888
If you want to surpass Eagle Division,

224
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,449
I have another plan.

225
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,570
What are you doing here?

226
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,730
Bear Division was badly injured.

227
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:33,689
What are you going to do?

228
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,609
Tegin.

229
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,049
Tegin, have mercy on me.

230
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,929
I swear, I promise!

231
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,289
I will kill Registrar Li.

232
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,489
Please, Tegin, give me another chance.

233
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,368
You missed your chance

234
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,769
and that's it. You lost it forever.

235
00:16:58,329 --> 00:16:59,248
It was your trick

236
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:01,449
that rendered half of the Bear Division dead.

237
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:03,809
If we give you another chance,

238
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:08,129
maybe even Eagle Division couldn't save you.

239
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,008
Tegin, god knows how eager I am

240
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,930
to serve Bear Division.

241
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,410
You think you can just kill him

242
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,729
and get things over with Great Khan?

243
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,729
Bear Division was misled by a treacherous minister.

244
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:52,249
I will explain it to Great Khan myself.

245
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,450
No need.

246
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,170
I have received Khan's order.

247
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:06,608
Now you're taking it to me.

248
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:07,450
What?

249
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,488
Are you trying to humiliate me?

250
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,809
We just want you to stop being reckless.

251
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,929
We don't want to take credit for occupying Shuozhou.

252
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,170
We just want you to stop holding us Eagle Division back.

253
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:22,289
You just can't wait to tread Bear Division underfoot, right?

254
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,810
Why the rush?

255
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,290
Then you leave us no choice but to report the truth to Great Khan.

256
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:30,089
That Tu Kashe defied his intructions openly.

257
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:41,929
Tegin Sun,

258
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,330
Tegin of Bear Division has received your order.

259
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:48,769
Now please.

260
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,489
Ibukan.

261
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:56,729
Ibukan!

262
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,650
Ibukan!

263
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,649
Isn't there anyone who'd guard the entrance for me?

264
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,728
This is the camp of Bear Division.

265
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,369
Do your job and guard the damn door!

266
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,888
Eagle Division changed their camp site.

267
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,728
They must be up to something.

268
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:16,809
Keep an eye on him.

269
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,809
Keep an eye on him!

270
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,610
Understand?

271
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,970
Yes!

272
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,170
And guard the damn door!

273
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,930
Just say it.

274
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:35,809
You could've just bought over that counsellor.

275
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,650
Why did you provoke Tu Kashe into killing him?

276
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:40,170
I don't like traitors.

277
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,649
But he was right.

278
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,329
Gongsun Heng got a brave general all of a sudden.

279
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,848
Things would be much easier

280
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,409
if we kill Li Shisi first.

281
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,728
You know it better than anyone that

282
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,689
what will happen if Great Khan leads the troops himself.

283
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,450
Why are you just laying siege to this city?

284
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,930
Sher's Wolf Division will soon take Daizhou.

285
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,129
Great Khan ordered us to assist them.

286
00:19:57,889 --> 00:20:01,008
I'll send you there.

287
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:01,930
Me?

288
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,368
Ashile Sun, yes, I am a bit talktive.

289
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:07,608
But that doesn't mean you've got to throw me to the wolves.

290
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,089
Once this war ends, you'll leave.

291
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,049
Remember, when you're in Daizhou,

292
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,968
save some clothes of Tang defenders,

293
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,210
and don't hassle common people.

294
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,489
You don't have to tell these to Great Khan.

295
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:22,689
That's it?

296
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,610
Shouldn't you set things straight before you go?

297
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,409
Hurry!

298
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,210
Run!

299
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,248
Run! Run!

300
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:48,289
Run!

301
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,369
Hurry! Hurry!

302
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:52,169
Run!

303
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,450
Hurry! Run!

304
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:54,929
Hurry!

305
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,730
Run!

306
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:12,368
Help!

307
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:12,848
Help!

308
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:14,049
What's going on?

309
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,809
What are you doing?

310
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,409
- Help!
- You can't come in.

311
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,210
Help!

312
00:21:16,729 --> 00:21:17,608
Open the door.

313
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,449
Open the door! Help!

314
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,209
What happened?

315
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,530
The enemies are breaking in.

316
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,569
Close the door.

317
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,728
Please, I'm begging you.

318
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:24,649
Come on.

319
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,368
Help me close the door.

320
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,530
Just take my kid in, okay?

321
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,049
I'm begging you!

322
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,930
Please!

323
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,049
Open the door! Open it!

324
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,368
Please!

325
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:36,488
Just let my kid in!

326
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:37,969
Please help us!

327
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,690
I'm begging you!

328
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:46,409
Let my kid in!

329
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,330
Please!

330
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,410
What are you doing?

331
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,809
Let them in.

332
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,610
Are you nuts?

333
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,049
Who the hell do you think you are?

334
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,488
How dare you point the scissors at me?

335
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:00,489
You're seeking your doom.

Help me!

338
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,570
Where did she go?

339
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:41,809
What are you doing here?

340
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,088
Great Khan sent us to chase after

341
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,008
the Daizhou Force that has fled from the city.

342
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:45,809
Hurry up!

343
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,490
Come on!

344
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,968
Master, where are we going now?

345
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:24,248
Let's go and take a look at the east side.

346
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:26,689
Right now, the east side is under siege by the Eagle Division.

347
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,529
But outside the east gate, there're towering and forested mountains.

348
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,768
We don't have our forces garrisoned there.

349
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,128
So might the Eagle Division.

350
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:33,888
However tight their defense might be,

351
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,728
I don't think they can find us

352
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:35,729
among so many mountains.

353
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,409
A'Dou,

354
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:40,530
you've really grown up.

355
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:51,728
Go now!

356
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:53,409
Master, let's go together!

357
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,210
Get someone here!

358
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,450
You followed me the whole way here.

359
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,649
I guess you want more than the Seal of Crown Prince.

360
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,969
You also want to kill me.

361
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:30,728
So what?

362
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,768
Right now, Governor Gongsun is seriously wounded.

363
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,728
Shuozhou is surrounded by enemies.

364
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:36,809
Do you really have to kill me right now?

365
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,930
Cut the nonsense.

366
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:40,849
It's my duty to execute you here.

367
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,410
Princess Yongning, any last words?

368
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:55,249
Even if I were to die,

369
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,769
I wouldn't be killed by a pawn.

370
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,330
Master, are you okay?

371
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,930
Do you know who she is?

372
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,848
If you help her,

373
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,169
you'll regret it later, for sure.

374
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:24,768
All I know is that she's the commandant

375
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:27,410
who's protecting Shuozhou.

376
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:32,848
Young man, you must've sneaked into Shuozhou

377
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,529
before the siege by Eagle Division, right?

378
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:37,088
Then you must be clear

379
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:38,368
about what's going on here.

380
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:39,650
Governor is wounded.

381
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:44,609
Everyone in Shuozhou rely on Commandant Li.

382
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,810
So I won't let you hurt her.

383
00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:50,170
If you insist on helping her,

384
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:54,050
we'll wait and see.

385
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,930
Senior Qin, thank you.

386
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:15,569
Senior Qin,

387
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:17,570
I have an idea.

388
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:19,170
We can get out of here.

389
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,569
Back then when we flooded Tu Kashe,

390
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,929
we pumped the stone canal dry

391
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,729
that once drained into Wuding River.

392
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,529
Master, just leave it to me.

393
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,450
You're still injured...

394
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,289
I'll go.

395
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,409
I might be a bit more familiar

396
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,810
with this place than you.

397
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:42,689
Commandant Li.

398
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,169
Commandant Li.

399
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:49,970
Governor?

400
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:52,809
Help Senior Qin out.

401
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,289
Governor.

402
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,329
- Commandant Li.
- Why are you here?

403
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,088
Senior Qin told me that you found a stone canal

404
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,689
that might lead out of Shuozhou.

405
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,329
Seeing you dressed like this,

406
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,369
are you going to deliver the message yourself?

407
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,649
The stone canal in the city leads straight to Wuding River.

408
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,888
Shuozhou is now under siege by the Eagle Division.

409
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,969
Wuding River is the only area with no garrison.

410
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:14,088
If we don't spread the message now,

411
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:15,128
I'm afraid we're running out of time.

412
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:16,209
I plan to get out of here

413
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,930
and deliver the message while it's still dark.

414
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,569
You've already been seriously injured.

415
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,049
And today you were almost assassinated,

416
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,609
which just made things even worse.

417
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,570
How could I let you risk your life?

418
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:31,409
Yeah, Commandant Li.

419
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,650
That guy hit you real hard.

420
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:38,929
Commandant Li, let me do it.

421
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,810
Shuozhou need you and Master.

422
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,449
You're the hope of Shuozhou.

423
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,368
Also, I'm Master's bodyguard.

424
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:46,210
This is my duty.

425
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:48,848
No.

426
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:50,449
The stone canal was built for drainage.

427
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,210
It's too small for you to get through.

428
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,088
Governor, Iet me do it.

429
00:28:57,089 --> 00:28:57,930
I can get through it.

430
00:28:58,609 --> 00:28:59,409
A'Dou!

431
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:02,049
Master, I know you're worried about me.

432
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,289
You don't want to put me at risk.

433
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,409
But you're already badly injured.

434
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,529
If you don't get a good rest,

435
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,850
you wouldn't be able to carry on.

436
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,929
You don't want to pass out halfway

437
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,850
and cause delay in reinforcement request, right?

438
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,728
So I'm the best choice for this task.

439
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:17,049
Governor, please place your trust in me.

440
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,608
I won't let you down.

441
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:20,088
Enough of this nonsense.

442
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:21,569
You're just a kid.

443
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,409
How could I put you at risk?

444
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,848
Yes, I'm too young,

445
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:27,089
and that's why I won't attract their attention.

446
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:31,968
Besides, Master accepted me as a disciple

447
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:33,529
because I'm smart.

448
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,209
I've been learning from Master for a long time.

449
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,008
I've commanded so many tricks.

450
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,929
But, when I'm back,

451
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,489
Governor, would you award me some titles?

452
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:49,810
Master, stop hesitating.

453
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,329
We've been through so much.

454
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,769
You don't think I can handle it, do you?

455
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,010
Fine.

456
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,929
Take this baggage with you and don't lose it.

457
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,289
You'll find an escape route map in it

458
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,608
and some pocket crossbows

459
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:15,248
with which you can beat off the enemies.

460
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:16,968
Master, nice choice.

461
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:18,128
And when I'm back in glory,

462
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:21,050
you'll all call me General Dou.

463
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:26,409
A'Dou,

464
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,249
take care of yourself.

465
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:31,008
I will, Master.

466
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,209
Tell everyone to hang in there

467
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,090
and wait for me.

468
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,450
Commandant Li,

469
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,369
you have a great disciple.

470
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,690
I didn't teach him anything.

471
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,690
In fact, I'm the lucky one to meet him.

472
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:07,409
Tegin.

473
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,248
I sent people to spy on Mu Jin.

474
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:14,290
But he managed to get rid of them halfway.

475
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,649
He seemed to be leaving for Daizhou.

476
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,450
Daizhou?

477
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,489
What does that mean?

478
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:26,889
Great Khan has taken Daizhou?

479
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:30,369
What's happening?

480
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:32,050
Why?

481
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:35,449
I know nothing at all!

482
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,809
What? Do they take our Bear Division seriously?

483
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,289
Tegin, don't be anxious.

484
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,088
I will lead a team to keep an eye on Ashile Sun.

485
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:43,049
I won't let him fool Great Khan

486
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,728
and take all the credit for occupying Shuozhou.

487
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:45,690
Enough.

488
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,569
Cut that nonsense.

489
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,768
Get lost!

490
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:49,569
Now!

491
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:01,529
Yuan.

492
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,290
You're finally back.

493
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:06,289
People sent food here just now.

494
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,488
They said they'd eat chaff and herbs

495
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:11,248
as long as you and the soldiers are well fed.

496
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:12,569
And I had people to send it back.

497
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,649
They saved their own food.

498
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,089
I couldn't accept it, really.

499
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,410
Madam, you are right.

500
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,969
Father.

501
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,449
Everyone is saying that

502
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,009
you're the one who's defending Shuozhou.

503
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:33,849
Your mom must have praised me again, right?

504
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:42,609
But I think, they're the reason Shuozhou exists,

505
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,649
not me.

506
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,050
I can't take the credit.

507
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,649
Check all the food provisions

508
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,368
and the grains we have.

509
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:56,969
Distribute it to the common people.

510
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:00,129
We must hold out till A'Dou comes back.

511
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:01,649
Yes.

512
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:40,488
Tegin,

513
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:42,289
we've killed all the Tang soldiers around Daizhou

514
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,248
on Great Khan's command.

515
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:44,368
What about those who fled Daizhou?

516
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:45,728
They were all killed.

517
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:46,608
Good.

518
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,649
Tegin of Eagle Division has sent someone here from Shuozhou.

519
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,608
Great Khan ordered us to meet him.

520
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:51,449
Let's go back to Daizhou.

521
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,848
Don't keep that messenger waiting.

522
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:53,649
Yes.

523
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:03,329
Damn it.

524
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,569
The post road was blocked.

525
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,209
I can't send message to Changan.

526
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,088
And Daizhou fell to the enemies, too.

527
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,569
We won't be able to get any reinforcements.

528
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,410
What should I do now?

529
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:10,730
I must go back

530
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,330
and inform Master of this.

531
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,809
Stop.

532
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,010
You guys.

533
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,568
Find some clothes of Tang soldiers

534
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:36,088
and get changed on our way out of Daizhou.

535
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:36,889
Yes!

536
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:07,009
Come on.

537
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,729
Come on.

538
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,530
Get up.

539
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:20,489
Have mercy on us.

540
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,849
Don't kill us!

541
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:23,609
Please spare us!

542
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,009
Come on, kneel down.

543
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,129
Why should I?

544
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,970
They are the real culprits, the offenders.

545
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,410
Just kneel down.

546
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,809
Have mercy on us! Don't kill us! Please!

547
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:05,930
Please don't kill us!

548
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:07,369
Stop.

549
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:08,889
Stop.

550
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:11,489
Stop it.

551
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,328
Who are you?

552
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:13,689
You don't know me. That's fine.

553
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,610
But I'm sure you can recognize this spike arrow.

554
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:22,848
Since when does Eagle Division get to tell us what to do?

555
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,249
If you're smart, you'd get lost now.

556
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,529
You know well what Eagle Division is capable of.

557
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,608
I suppose you wouldn't want to die

558
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,889
for these refugees.

559
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,050
Let's go!

560
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,449
Go!

561
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,088
Go!

562
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:44,889
Go!

563
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:51,329
You should go now.

564
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,608
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

565
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,009
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

566
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,649
We must get back to Shuozhou as soon as possible.

567
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,729
- Yes!
- Yes!

568
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,530
Go!

569
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:01,969
Thank you!

570
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,849
Thank you! Thank you!

571
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,888
Let's go home.

572
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:15,608
Great!

573
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:16,410
Father.

574
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,689
Isn't he that... That...

575
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,930
That guy's apprentice?

576
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,848
Yes!

577
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:01,649
I know you.

578
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:04,849
Kill him. Just kill him. Now.

579
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:06,808
Wait!

580
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:07,609
My lord! Lord!

581
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,849
I've got an update for you.

582
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,048
Lord?

583
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:12,849
He's our Tegin.

584
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,449
Yeah, okay. Tegin! Tegin!

585
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,608
You got my title wrong.

586
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:19,048
Kill him. Kill him. Just kill him.

587
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,409
Tegin, right now you must be desperate

588
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,170
to know what's going on in Shuozhou.

589
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,089
Spare my life and I'll prove myself useful to you.

590
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,730
Then tell me how you might be helpful to us.

591
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,609
Or, I will kill you myself.

592
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,249
Tegin, you know that

593
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,608
I'm Registrar Li's trusted follower.

594
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:58,128
I know his tricks better than anyone.

595
00:38:58,129 --> 00:38:59,288
During the battle around Wuding River,

596
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:00,848
you lost so many soldiers.

597
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:02,649
The situation for you is grim.

598
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,288
I also heard that

599
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,328
now it's the Eagle Division that's leading the attack.

600
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:06,689
Screw you.

601
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,289
I don't want to hear any of these.

602
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:10,769
Did you take him to me just to piss me off?

603
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:11,808
Kill him. Just kill him. Kill him.

604
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,368
If you were still able to manage the battle,

605
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:14,209
how come you know nothing

606
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,930
about Li's promotion to Commandant?

607
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:20,288
Tegin, spare my life.

608
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:21,689
Let me talk to the generals in Shuozhou.

609
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,769
I'll make Commandant Li

610
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,289
to offer up Shuozhou submissively.

611
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:44,809
Now even a cute little cub dares to cheat me.

612
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,490
Do I look like a fool to you?

613
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:50,528
Do I?

614
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:52,288
Sima Jian, that liar, he cheated you.

615
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,209
Tegin, you don't know it.

616
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,969
Commandant Li and Governor Gongsun are dying at this moment.

617
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,328
The Eagle Division hit them real hard.

618
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:58,568
This is the best time for negotiation.

619
00:39:58,569 --> 00:39:59,888
I know them quite well.

620
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:02,049
I'd be the best one for this task.

621
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,368
It's been so long since the Eagle Division laid siege to Shuozhou

622
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,368
and people there are still closely united with high morale.

623
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,048
Even if I fail, which is highly unlikely,

624
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:18,568
it'll demoralize them greatly.

625
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:21,329
That's something Eagle Division can never do.

626
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:32,049
Let's take his words for the moment.

627
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:34,808
Tie him to my horse.

628
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,289
He'll be going into a battle with me.

629
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,930
Don't kill him yet.

630
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:40,889
Yes.

631
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,128
Great Khan ordered that

632
00:41:08,129 --> 00:41:10,169
any one who makes a rash act will be executed.

633
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:10,970
Come on!

634
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,250
- Hang on.
- I'm too tired.

635
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,889
Miss, I can't take it, Miss.

636
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:44,010
Wear these.

637
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,930
Miss, you're so kind.

638
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,809
Thank you for saving my life.

639
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,650
I wish someone could save my daughter.

640
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,568
You must survive.

641
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:03,409
Maybe you'll get to see your daughter one day.

642
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,848
Tegin, the Eagle Division collected many clothes of the soldiers

643
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,209
defending Daizhou while cleaning up the battlefield.

644
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,009
And later on their way back,

645
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,530
Mu Jin ordered the Eagle Division to change into Tang uniforms.

646
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,930
They want to grab the credit from us.

647
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:42,608
Gather Bear Division now!

648
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:43,409
Hurry! Come on!

649
