♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,559
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,530
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,469
♫ Never give in. ♫

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:30,550
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,419
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

8
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:37,189
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

9
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:40,389
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

10
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:43,339
♫ To the distance. ♫

11
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:46,209

13
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:57,140

The Long Ballad

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,710
Episode 18

23
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,399
Go.

24
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:46,619
Stop it!

25
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,549
Aren't you the new counselor?

26
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,429
What do you want?

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,509
You think you can boss us around, because Tegin treats you well.

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,469
We have our own rules.

29
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,079
Even it is Tegin, he must obey the rules!

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,149
So, you want to meddle in this too?

31
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,109
How about...

32
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,719
Well.

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,830
Let's have some drinks.

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,509
Leave!

35
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,429
Are you deaf?

36
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,470
Piss off.

37
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,399
Stay and wait.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,119
Wait here!

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Wait!

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
I...

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,870
Thank you.

42
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,560
Get it off your dirty face.

43
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,710
I'll help you.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
You are so beautiful.

45
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,630
Some drink?

46
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,069
I'm Li Shisi.

47
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,070
What's your name?

48
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,869
Mimi Guli.

49
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,319
You look different.

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,710
You aren't from Ashile Tribe?

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,480
I am a slave sent to Ashile Tribe.

52
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,599
I only have the clothes for men.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,760
Take them for now.

54
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,870
I'll get changed.

55
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,839
Okay, go ahead.

56
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
I'll wait you outside.

57
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,360
I finished.

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,760
What's in your clothes?

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
I...

60
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,390
I am sorry.

61
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,869
I..

62
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,429
I promise I will never steal!

63
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,479
I'll never do this again!

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,639
Please don't expel me.

65
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,919
I can do a lot of things!

66
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,199
You see, I can clean the house,

67
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,149
and I... I can do the laundry and cook.

68
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,989
I can do anything, see!

69
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,270
And I am a fast worker.

70
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,710
Don't steal anything from now on.

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,870
I will take care of you.

72
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,430
Have some rest here.

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,550
This is my bed.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,499
I'll be off for a while.

75
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,150
Don't answer even someone calls you.

76
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,360
Take a thread with the right.

77
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,639
Cross your hands.

78
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,150
Pass from the middle one.

79
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,960
Then take one with the left.

80
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,389
Very good.

81
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,390
Flip it.

82
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,389
You want to play this.

83
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,519
Li Leyan, are you stupid?

84
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,710
Look at others' work, and tell me what you've done!

85
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,039
You really piss me off.

86
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,779
I... I just want to unfasten the threads.

87
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,760
If you can't finish, no sleep tonight.

88
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,519
Are you sent by God to ravage and challenge me?

89
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,269
I am so mad.

90
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,759
Come on.

91
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Anyone helps her!

92
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,709
I am so confused.

93
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,520
You've learned for days, and what have you got?

94
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Who?

95
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,199
What are you doing?

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,480
I am doing housework.

97
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,599
You did all these?

98
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,359
If you don't like others help you organize your stuff,

99
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,309
I won't do it again!

100
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,479
I am sorry.

101
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,800
Don't throw me out please.

102
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
It's her!

103
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,479
Li Shisi, you can't leave this woman here.

104
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,949
What if I insist on keeping her?

105
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,949
Are you going to kill her?

106
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,509
It's not necessary.

107
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,479
Just throw her out.

108
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,269
I beg you.

109
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,509
Don't throw me out.

110
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,149
If I can't stay here, I will be eaten by wolves.

111
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,629
Even if I can manage to escape,

112
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,239
if the Great Khan finds that I'm an escaped slave, I will be killed.

113
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,629
Please.

114
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,309
You talked too much nonsense.

115
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,799
Go.

116
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,119
No!

117
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
You...

118
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,269
Are you a dog?

119
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,599
Why did you bite me?

120
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
You...

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Enough.

122
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,390
Sun.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,749
Tegin.

124
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,880
Could you give me this slave?

125
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
You may leave.

126
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:50,119
According to my rules, it is bad to have things with ears and mouth.

127
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,149
Since I am the one who work for Tegin,

128
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,359
I will manage my people properly.

129
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
You don't trust me?

130
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,879
I'm leaving.

131
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,630
I... I was bitten for nothing.

132
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,039
Are you fine?

133
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,600
Did you catch a cold?

134
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,309
How about I get you some Kumiss?

135
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,360
Just a second.

136
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Sun.

137
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,039
Though you agreed Li Shisi to be your counselor,

138
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,710
you shouldn't trust him unconditionally.

139
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,679
Why?

140
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,239
We don't really know him.

141
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,309
I do know Shisi.

142
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,119
And he isn't from our region.

143
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,919
Shisi is now.

144
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,240
But the people from the Central Plains are full of tricks.

145
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,750
Sun, I don't mean it.

146
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,149
How are you?

147
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,439
I'm fine.

148
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,359
Let's have some warm soup.

149
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,440
It's good for health.

150
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,070
Why is the soup only for me?

151
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,069
How about yours?

152
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,189
I'm not hungry yet.

153
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,190
Have it now.

154
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,709
You go first.

155
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,479
I don't have an appetite.

156
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,879
When you finish it, get some sleep.

157
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,440
The bed is small, just put up with it.

158
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,599
Don't worry.

159
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,709
I'll sleep on the ground.

160
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,709
You should go to bed early.

161
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,070
It's good for your recovery.

162
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,630
Whatever.

163
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,510
But you don't have to be alert.

164
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,040
I won't hurt you.

165
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,039
Mom, don't leave me, mom!

166
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,709
Mom.

167
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,710
Mom.

168
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
My mom.

169
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,510
Mom.

170
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,190
Mom, please come back.

171
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
I'm so cold.

172
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,879
Buzhen, don't move.

173
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Buzhen?

174
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,240
Who is Buzhen?

175
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,480
Li Shisi, I'm coming.

176
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Not a good time.

177
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,439
Please wait.

178
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Wait.

179
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,239
Hey, you!

180
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,359
Wait!

181
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,479
Stop!

182
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,189
Stop! You!

183
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,309
I've got something to tell you.

184
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,999
I've got things to warn you too!

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,709
Dare you walk around camps again!

186
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,069
Don't go to Sun Tegin's place.

187
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,559
What's wrong with you?

188
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,679
Don't come closer.

189
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,389
Are you going to bite me again?

190
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,949
I warn you just to stay there.

191
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,559
Otherwise, I won't be nice.

192
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,149
I really have something to tell.

193
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,679
As I am living with Counselor Li, the food isn't enough for us.

194
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,509
You must prepare more for us.

195
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,309
Don't bother me!

196
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,709
Go and find your Counselor Li.

197
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,439
Time for a meal!

198
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,559
Right.

199
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,359
Come on.

200
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,269
Have more drink.

201
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,270
Drink!

202
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Have more, more!

203
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,119
Why are you here?

204
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,439
Counselor Li is ill.

205
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,749
He shared with me the last food we had.

206
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,269
We need something to eat!

207
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,069
For every tent, food quota is set.

208
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,190
You've taken yours.

209
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,039
No more for you.

210
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,879
Get out of my way.

211
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
You...

212
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,080
The mutton will be ready soon.

213
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,190
Have a seat.

214
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,709
By the way, do you guys like to use this?

215
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,749
I used branches to make a pair.

216
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,270
Hope you'll like it.

217
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,749
Do as locals do.

218
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,150
I don't use it anymore.

219
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,680
But I like your present.

220
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,190
Thank you.

221
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,709
In return, do you want anything?

222
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,710
Me?

223
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,310
Is it Buzhen really from your family?

224
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,800
Do you want to be free and go back to your family?

225
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,310
My family has been invaded by Ashile Tribe.

226
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,440
People died, or left.

227
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,070
I don't have any family members.

228
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,039
So, I'm grateful for staying with you sincerely.

229
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,829
So the same to you.

230
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,830
The same?

231
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,269
Are your family...?

232
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,630
Yes, they are all dead too.

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,200
They were killed by the enemy.

234
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,239
Forget all these worries.

235
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,149
Now that we have met each other, it's truly destiny.

236
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,800
From now on, I am your family member.

237
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,680
Here, take the big one.

238
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,879
I'm so tired.

239
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,309
Almost done?

240
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,829
How about taking a break?

241
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,830
I agree.

242
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
So tired.

243
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,599
Me too.

244
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,159
Are you tired?

245
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,069
Don't you know tomorrow is due day?

246
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,829
Have you finished the work?

247
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,520
If you can't finish it, just get out of here!

248
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Go back to your work!

249
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,789
Ms. Zhang?

250
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,790
Don't bother me!

251
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,359
Li Leyan!

252
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,479
Did you do it on purpose?

253
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,639
Look what you did!

254
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,829
Get out!

255
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,999
Get her out of here!

256
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,999
Move!

257
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Quick!

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,599
Get out!

259
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,599
You! Get out!

260
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,189
Kick her out right now!

261
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,359
Out!

262
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,789
Leave here!

263
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,479
Do you think Li Leyan is a real fool?

264
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,549
How can she be so silly?

265
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,550
Right, so much trouble.

266
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,309
Finally we finished Mr. Hu's order.

267
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,640
Let's have some rest.

268
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,910
My neck hurts.

269
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,599
Why is she here?

270
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,479
Right, why?

271
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,909
Why didn't you leave?

272
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,359
Why?

273
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,949
Ms. Chai.

274
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,070
My sincere apology.

275
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,159
Please give me another chance.

276
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,709
Please!

277
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,119
Ms. Li, you're so determined.

278
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Here, I do need someone like you!

279
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Well.

280
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,829
Is that what you expect me to say?

281
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,399
Just act nice, then be a free-rider?

282
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,790
You're daydreaming!

283
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,709
Right.

284
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,189
Later, I will meet with Manager Hu.

285
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,599
I'm begging you.

286
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,069
Just leave.

287
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,549
We don't have room for you.

288
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,520
Find elsewhere to bother anyone else.

289
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,999
Why are you crying?

290
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,359
Look at them.

291
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,479
They've worked overnight just because of you.

292
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,789
They want to cry too!

293
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,029
Yes.

294
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,639
Tears can't give you money.

295
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,429
You need to work hard to make a living.

296
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,710
If I were your mom, I would die already.

297
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,829
Leave here now.

298
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,279
You'd better find a tree and get hanged.

299
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,069
People like you are nothing good for society.

300
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,069
Only a waste of food.

301
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,709
Well.

302
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,710
Well.

303
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,309
Is she alright?

304
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,879
Won't she commit suicide?

305
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,759
Who can tell?

306
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,399
Why are you looking at me?

307
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,789
If she has the courage, it's still a good ending for her.

308
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,999
She is a loser.

309
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
Good for nothing in the world.

310
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,829
Alright, girls!

311
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,909
Get some sleep.

312
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,399
Right, so tired!

313
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Let's go.

314
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Go to rest.

315
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,309
Have you heard it?

316
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,310
The slave of the counselor kicked Mu Jin out of anger.

317
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,119
Really?

318
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,829
True!

319
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,120
This slave is bold.

320
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,480
Mu Jin is so weak.

321
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,479
She got something.

322
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,599
Poor Mu Jin.

323
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,670
He was humiliated.

324
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,999
Smell good?

325
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,309
Why does it smell so good?

326
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,949
My kid likes it very much!

327
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,949
Mimi Guli.

328
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,399
Are you going to wash your man's clothes?

329
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,119
Yes.

330
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,029
I...

331
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,709
Well, Mimi Guli.

332
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,159
We've heard you kicked Mu Jin.

333
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,399
He is the counselor.

334
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,440
Hope he didn't bother you.

335
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,709
Not at all.

336
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,710
Dare he bother me!

337
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,119
What a relief.

338
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,479
Go to wash.

339
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,189
Yes, right.

340
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,829
See you then.

341
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,519
See you.

342
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Take your time.

343
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,669
What's wrong with you?

344
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,519
Pick it up.

345
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,119
I won't.

346
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,479
You and Li Shisi have humiliated me!

347
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,309
Look at you.

348
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,519
Now you seem easy and relaxed.

349
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,359
It is because you're weak.

350
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,789
Watch your tongue!

351
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,759
Right, you're so weak!

352
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,119
It's you.

353
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,709
Dare you say it again!

354
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,759
Who is weak?

355
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,949
You!

356
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,709
You hurt me.

357
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,710
You're a bitch.

358
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,309
No, it's you!

359
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,279
You!

360
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,359
You're shrew!

361
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
It's you!

362
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,280
You and Li Shisi are evil-minded.

363
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,829
Who?

364
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,239
You two.

365
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
How dare you scold Shisi!

366
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,239
You can't kick me.

367
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Too far.

368
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
You can't.

369
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,070
Bastard!

370
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,309
Why did my heart beat so fast?

371
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,789
Mu Jin, are you a fool?

372
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,069
She is with Li Shisi.

373
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,520
What are you thinking about?

their tongues will become so long.

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,879
Too much bullshit.

381
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,160
Do you still commit suicide?

382
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,479
By doing this, you can be hanged.

383
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,400
What you did can only exercise your neck.

384
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,599
My husband, years ago, thought he couldn't take care of our family.

385
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,310
So he hanged himself to end everything.

386
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,399
Is your life so worthless?

387
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,359
Why are you going to kill yourself just as you're told?

388
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,759
If you really want to die, nobody can stop you.

389
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,189
But if you want to live, nobody can block you as well!

390
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,639
You should rely on yourself.

391
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Get it?

392
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,639
Well, well.

393
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,279
It's alright.

394
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Alright. It's alright.

395
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,709
My words were a bit harsh.

396
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,120
I am sorry.

397
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,830
Thank you, Ms. Chai.

398
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,480
Manager Hu, check out this new pattern.

399
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Come, come here.

400
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,880
Pattern from the West.

401
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,069
It's really popular.

402
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,909
Right.

403
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,359
Very nice.

404
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Look at it, this embroidery.

405
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,999
There are golden threads.

406
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,999
Look at the stitches.

407
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,789
How tight!

408
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,790
Right.

409
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,669
Good.

410
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,120
This is your order.

411
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,119
I've heard Ms. Chai's blankets are smooth.

412
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,829
Why aren't the stitches for my order smooth at all?

413
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,879
We could have done better if you give us much time.

414
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,829
Would you take it please?

415
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,830
Right, please.

416
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,999
Well.

417
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,029
Who made this?

418
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,519
This?

419
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,709
Well... I told you not to follow me.

420
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,549
It's her work.

421
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,189
Manager Hu, it's her work.

422
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,550
Right, Ms. Li.

423
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Did you make this?

424
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,759
Yes, it's me.

425
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,709
Perfect.

426
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,429
How wonderful!

427
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,549
I'll take it.

428
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,279
Miss.

429
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,429
Could you make more?

430
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,710
I'll buy all of them.

431
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,829
With a good price!

432
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,190
As long as you do, I'll buy the clothes all together.

433
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,879
This girl is our embroider.

434
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,359
As for this handkerchief, as long as the price is good,

435
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,999
you can have as many as you want.

436
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,789
Deal!

437
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,669
You can name the price.

438
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,549
You're great.

439
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,639
Here, take a date.

440
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,829
Take it.

441
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,789
Take two.

442
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,790
Just take them.

443
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,159
Why did Tegin invite me to have grilled mutton leg tonight?

444
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,640
Your slave had a fight with Mu Jin becasue of this.

445
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,599
You're also my counselor.

446
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,399
I hope they feel I've treated you fairly.

447
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,710
Have you grilled mutton legs for Mu Jin?

448
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,949
No.

449
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,950
It's my first time.

450
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,029
When I was a kid, my father grilled it with me once.

451
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,519
I was determined to grill my own.

452
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,709
It ended up a great mess.

453
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,710
All were burnt.

454
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,999
Then for the burnt part, my dad ate them all.

455
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,309
Later, I learnt how to grill.

456
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,189
I don't want to fail him again.

457
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,399
I didn't expect there's such a story between you and your father.

458
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,159
When I was little, my father still cared about me.

459
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
But afterwards...

460
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,550
Let's move on.

461
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,309
Tell me about your father.

462
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,430
I have nothing to share.

463
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,670
He was very busy.

464
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,479
I see.

465
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,760
Because he was the crown prince.

466
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,190
It's normal that he was busy.

467
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,479
How did you know?

468
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,029
In Youzhou you had access to the Governor Mansion,

469
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,550
I knew you were privileged.

470
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,599
Later, I heard they called you Princess Yongning.

471
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,279
Then, I've realized everything.

472
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,909
Since you knew who I am by then, why didn't you reveal my identity?

473
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,480
Is it for taking advantage of me?

474
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,399
Right.

475
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
I used you.

476
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,000
I suffered a lot because of you.

477
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,400
I saved you in Changan, Youzhou, and Shuozhou as well.

478
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,880
Now we are on the prairie.

479
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,470
I am grilling a mutton leg for a slave like you.

480
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,190
I've made full 'use' of you.

481
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,030
Well.

482
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,789
Did you forget everything?

483
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,790
No.

484
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Take it.

485
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,000
Anyway, I'm regarded as dead in Tang.

486
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,429
I have nothing to be afraid of.

487
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,709
From now on, I'm not Li Shisi.

488
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,309
My name is Li Changge.

489
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,830
I like this name, Changge.

490
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,030
Changge.

491
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,419
Changge.

492
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,759
♫ Which froze everything between you and me ♫

493
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,199
♫ Meet each other in different time ♫

494
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,519
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds ♫

495
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,919
♫ My longings become a cocoon ♫

496
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,519
♫ Layer after layer ♫

497
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,780
♫ It turns into an eternity ♫

498
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,709
♫ The cocoon in the dark night ♫

499
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,710
What's she doing?

500
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,590
Does it mean she'll commit herself to me?

501
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,750
It's already late.

502
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm at least a man.

503
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
Is it appropriate?

504
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,579
Hey.

505
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,049
Changge.

506
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,339
Changge?

507
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
What happened?

508
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,130
Why are they so close late at night?

509
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,980
Mr. Shisi, what happened to you?

510
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,699
I have no idea.

511
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
All of a sudden.

512
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,860
Are you sick?

513
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,220
Have some rest.

514
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,809
Blood?

515
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,220
Why is he bleeding?

516
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
Mimi.

517
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,810
Let me keep you warm.

518
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,619
What happened to him?

519
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,619
Did he get hurt?

520
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,049
No, don't worry.

521
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,769
He's fine.

522
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,889
He... He looks awful.

523
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,890
As I said, he's fine.

524
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,809
But, he looks like he's dying.

525
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,810
He is hurt!

526
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,099
I told you he's fine.

527
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,170
But he's...

528
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,129
What does it mean?

529
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,130
Really?

530
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,009
I told you so.

531
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,729
You're treating her differently.

532
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,319
Did you know that she is a woman?

533
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,959
You're not frank or honest anymore.

534
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,439
Changge is weak.

535
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,009
We need to treat her with a lamb.

536
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,409
Changge?

537
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,919
Her name.

538
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,850
So Mr. Shisi's real name is Changge.

539
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,770
How many secrets did you hide from me?

540
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,080
Tell me more.

541
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Sun.

542
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,799
I thought you're a man.

543
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,560
I've even decided to marry you.

544
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,409
Why are you laughing?

545
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,489
Don't laugh.

546
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,320
I'm really upset.

547
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,679
Mimi.

548
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,889
You can still be my family member.

549
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,930
There's nothing different.

550
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,799
But still it's different.

551
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,649
How so?

552
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,009
I think it's not because you're good at the disguise.

553
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,249
You really don't treat yourself as a woman.

554
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,729
In this world, men need to fight and protect their domains and women.

555
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,529
Whereas, women are responsible for fertility

556
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,249
and protecting the senior people and the kids.

557
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,129
But you use men's ways to fight with them,

558
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,080
while using a body of woman.

559
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,849
What's in your mind?

560
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,410
I have no ideas as well.

561
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,279
What makes a man?

562
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,959
What makes a woman?

563
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,010
I've never really thought of it.

564
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,039
My masters are men.

565
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,369
Manage the country by making policies,

566
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,009
and protect it by leading armies.

567
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,369
They are big figures with great talents.

568
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,969
But what's the difference between me and them?

569
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,239
My father's wife and concubines are women.

570
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,610
They are in the finest dresses and look so gorgeous.

571
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,369
They are considerate and attentive.

572
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,240
But what does it matter with me?

573
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,079
Anyhow, you should rest at home for these days.

574
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,610
Don't suffer with them in the wild.

575
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,449
One more thing.

576
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,369
Since you've lied to me, your name can't be Mr. Shisi.

577
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,279
My name is Li Changge.

578
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Li Changge.

579
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,970
So, did Tegin Sun know this secret already?

580
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,409
Then he's keeping it for you.

581
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,040
Does he fall in love with you?

582
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,929
Nonsense.

583
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,239
He thinks I'm useful for him.

584
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,410
So he cares about me a little.

585
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,849
How do you feel now?

586
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,650
You'll feel good to keep the underbelly warm.

587
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,479
What are you waiting for?

588
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,209
Move it!

589
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,480
To carry the wool is the easiest task.

590
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,079
Can you do it?

591
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Yes, I can.

592
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,169
What are you waiting for?

593
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,519
Come and help me!

594
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,209
I'm coming.

595
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,969
Be quick.

596
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,609
Look at the wool.

597
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,799
It gets everywhere.

598
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,519
Take it off!

599
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,799
And here.

600
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,170
Look at your head.

601
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,690
And here.

602
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,169
Wool Yan.

603
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,209
Wool Yan.

604
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:23,929
Wool Yan.

605
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,079
You got the wool everywhere.

606
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,479
Wool Yan, are you really stupid?

607
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,129
I just asked you to carry the wool.

608
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,689
Look at what you've done.

609
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,690
Ms. Chai, I...

610
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,279
Look at your hair.

611
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,999
Oh my.

612
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Seriously.

613
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Look at you.

614
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,849
This fool knows nothing.

615
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,319
How can she live like this?

616
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Right.

617
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,969
Thank you!

618
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,689
You're my saviors.

619
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,039
Thanks to your help, I can make it through.

620
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,559
It's the first time I heard that title.

621
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,849
She is not referring to you.

622
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,239
Think about your poor salary.

623
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,559
You're not valuable at all.

624
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,759
Not valuable?

625
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,999
Our wool fabrics are for the use of the government offices.

626
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,850
They might even become the carpets in the palace.

627
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,720
You've worked so hard,

628
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,719
but they might not cherish every stitch you made.

629
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,370
Nonsense.

630
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,559
Those in the palace don't bother by food and clothes.

631
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,560
They won't know how much hard work behind.

632
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,799
The god is fair.

633
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,209
The royal family is supported by the people.

634
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,369
They'll get whatever they want.

635
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,279
So, they need to take the responsibility to protect us.

636
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,279
For us, though we're poor, it's fine if we can feed ourselves.

637
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,079
Am I right?

638
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,929
Yes, indeed.

639
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,649
We just mind our own business.

640
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,689
If we can do, just do it.

641
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,719
If we can't, then sleep.

642
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,560
For the royal members, they won't sleep if they fail.

643
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,319
All we want is the little salary every month.

644
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Indeed.

645
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,999
Mind your business.

646
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,649
Don't skip this question.

647
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,369
Ms. Chai.

648
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,169
- Right.
- Go back to work.

649
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:18,969
When was the last raise?

650
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,929
Stop. Answer me about my salary.

651
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,209
Let's talk about it?

652
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,129
No raise is fine.

653
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,369
But give us some seasame cakes.

654
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,239
She's right.

655
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,319
Stop.

656
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Stop there!

657
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,130
Stop.

658
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,240
Leyan, I'll find you!

659
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Go.

660
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Go!

661
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,999
Mimi.

662
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,079
You are a woman.

663
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,409
Don't work so hard.

664
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,609
From now on, you can ask me for help.

665
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,449
I'll help you carry the water.

666
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,889
Don't look down upon me.

667
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,890
You see.

668
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,039
Be careful.

669
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,689
My clothes.

670
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,690
Don't take...

671
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,129
What's wrong? Too heavy?

672
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,319
No...

673
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
My foot.

674
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,210
You're bleeding.

675
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,039
I'm so unlucky.

676
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Who left the nail here?

677
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,849
I'm fine.

678
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,449
Don't be frightened.

679
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,479
Go back first.

680
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,650
Let me take some break.

681
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:44,929
I'll bring you home.

682
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:45,930
Leave things here.

683
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,279
Be careful.

684
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,450
I'm fine. I mean it.

685
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Take it slow.

You just got better a bit.

688
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,690
Don't get sick again.

689
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,170
Take it easy. I'm not that weak.

690
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,649
Save it later when it gets colder.

691
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,759
You've done nothing for me so far.

692
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,130
I don't bargain with a loss.

693
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,929
Be relieved, Tegin.

694
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,320
I'll finish three promises for sure.

695
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,240
Do you have anything to demand today?

696
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,369
I just passed by after patrolling.

697
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,370
Alone?

698
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,850
Where is your slave?

699
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,450
She's washing clothes.

700
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,129
She has a good life, as she met a master like you.

701
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,999
We aren't master and slave.

702
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,640
We are friends who care about each other.

703
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,849
In a lifetime, people around will leave one by one.

704
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,759
To trust the new, and farewell to the past.

705
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,650
These are difficulties in life.

706
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,690
I feel luckier than her.

707
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,760
So lucky that I met with someone I care about.

708
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,410
Me too.

709
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,849
Tegin, go for patrolling.

710
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,320
Otherwise it'll be too late.

711
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,649
How about joining me?

712
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,209
You don't know much about this region.

713
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,559
When the night comes, I'll take you somewhere.

714
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,319
But I wonder if you have the gut.

715
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,370
Why not?

I found it when patrolling.

Do you like it?

724
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,000
It'll be my last time to see fireflies this year.

725
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,360
We can see them again next year.

726
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,450
Who knows where we are then.

727
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,720
Will we be available to see fireflies again?

728
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,920
If you want to see them next year,

Besides, like fireflies, such wonderful creatures are ephemeral.

♫ There's always solicitude ♫

751
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:28,749
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

752
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,149
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

753
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,429
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

754
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:37,989
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

755
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,749
♫ layer after layer. ♫

756
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,789
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

757
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:48,670
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

758
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:57,069
♫ There's always a moment ♫

759
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,709
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

760
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,309
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

761
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:12,629
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

762
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,189
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

763
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,549
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

764
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,029
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

765
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:24,909
♫ layer after layer. ♫

766
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,909
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

767
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:33,310
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

768
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,510
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:55,630
