♫ No bough to alight. ♫

♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,419
♫ Never give in. ♫

♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,369
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

9
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:37,239
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

10
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,239

The Long Ballad

23
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,830
Episode 16

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,650
From now on,

25
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,430
you're just a slave of Eagle Division.

26
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:52,549
What do you want to do to me?

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,859
I want you to disappear from Tang.

28
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,459
Only I can decide my life or death.

29
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,439
What you say is useless.

30
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:06,298
It depends on your ability.

31
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,258
Your keeping me beside you

32
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,338
is no different from keeping a snake in your bosom.

33
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,459
Think about it after you can survive.

34
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,738
The only law of survival here is that

35
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:20,279
the big fish eat up the small ones.

36
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,210
Behind me is Shuozhou,

37
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:05,210
which has been plundered but undamaged.

38
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:10,799
Behind it are the mountains.

39
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,840
Thousands of miles away is my hometown,

40
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,759
Chang'an.

41
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,260
I can't return anymore.

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,659
You used to win honor for our country,

43
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,079
but now you're reduced to be a slave.

44
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,798
Li Changge.

45
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:39,719
Even I feel sorry for you.

46
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,219
[Fuju Inn]

47
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,538
Upon receiving your order, I rushed over here.

48
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,139
What can I do for you?

49
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,299
Follow Ashile Tribe right now.

50
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,059
I want to know the end of Li Changge.

51
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,278
Kill her?

52
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,720
If she colludes with Ashile Tribe,

53
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,859
kill her.

54
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,638
What if not?

55
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:04,219
Then Ashile Tribe won't allow her to survive.

56
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,520
Yes.

57
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,339
Send me the information with a carrier pigeon.

58
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,420
You can leave now.

59
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,620
Yes.

60
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,978
My closest relatives are killed like dogs.

61
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,339
I'm exiled by the place where I grow up.

62
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,840
I consider life worse than death.

63
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,100
But I must finish what I should do.

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,490
It's not late for you to kill me after I finish it.

65
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,299
Li Changge.

66
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,339
Hope you can sacrifice yourself for our country.

67
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,978
In recent days, the county governments all over the country

68
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,079
are secretly looking for the whereabouts of the princess.

69
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,958
But the portraits sent to the capital have no semblance of Princess.

70
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,239
The four northern cities where she once appeared

71
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:08,480
haven't sent any information.

72
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,118
Your Highness.

73
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:13,799
Princess Yong'an is always fortunate.

74
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:18,498
Li Chunfeng has predicted that she would return safe and sound.

75
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,759
I hope so.

76
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,659
Recently,

77
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,779
I've always dreamed of Leyan and Changge in their childhood.

78
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,899
They're playing in the garden.

79
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,899
I wave to them, but they can't see me.

80
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,739
I call them, but they can't hear me.

81
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,459
And they run farther and farther.

82
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,150
You've been thinking too much

83
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,059
so you have these strange dreams.

84
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:56,818
Your Highness.

85
00:05:56,818 --> 00:06:02,639
I'll ask the imperial kitchen to stew some soothing and healthy soup.

86
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,839
Will they be farther away from me?

87
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,039
No.

88
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,780
They are your most intimate daughter and minister respectively.

89
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,999
Perhaps it's the best news that we have no news.

90
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,859
Yes.

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,599
Your Highness! Emergency!

92
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,958
Ashile Tribe suddenly attacked our northern border.

93
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,778
Sima Tu, the military governor,

94
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,439
and Gongsun Heng, the governor of Shuozhou, both died.

95
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,218
When did that happen?

96
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,919
Why hasn't anyone reported this before?

97
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,978
Ashile Tribe encircled the city.

98
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,438
So the frontier had never been able to send out war reports.

99
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:49,258
Hao Du sent a man to hurry up all the way.

100
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,860
It costs us five horses to send the letter to Chang'an.

101
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,019
Send troops right now to recover the northern border.

102
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,998
Do expel Ashile Tribe from our border!

103
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:04,058
Then, the troops should be stationed there to comfort local people.

104
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,559
Yes.

105
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,600
Mr. Du.

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,200
Mr. Du. I have something to discuss with you.

107
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,599
Mr. Fang, you're always thoughtful.

108
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,258
What do you want to discuss?

109
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,179
Mr. Du. Don't make me embarrassed.

110
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,978
Don't make me embarrassed.

111
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,498
We're both officials of court.

112
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:30,019
We should discuss the matters.

113
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,120
And I really need your help this time.

114
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,859
Just make it clear.

115
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,538
It's the biggest worry of his Highness that Princess Yong'an is gone.

116
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,778
We've sent the portraits of Princess to the governments all over the country to let them investigate in secret,

117
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,058
but in vain.

118
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:52,060
Only the northern border hasn't sent any information yet.

119
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,959
I'm worried.

120
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,378
What can I do for you?

121
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,899
People on the northern border have never seen the Princess.

122
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,859
It happens that your adopted son is also there.

123
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,319
Although Mr. Wei shoulders the whole responsibility of the missing of Princess,

124
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,019
Hao Du was also with Princess then.

125
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,339
So one more man means more help.

126
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,619
- And under your wise instruction, your adopted son...
- Fine.

127
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,978
- your adopted son...
- Fine.

128
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,579
Just tell me your business.

129
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Don't flatter me.

130
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,579
Since his Highness entrusts this matter to you,

131
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,800
it's fine that you arrange everything.

132
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:40,039
Yes.

133
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,298
Eat more.

134
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,699
Come on.

135
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,618
Why do you keep that guy?

136
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,040
You'd better kill him.

137
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,099
Here you are.

138
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,600
Put it there.

139
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,359
One more pie, please.

140
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,060
Here you are.

141
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,839
Where are you going?

142
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,140
I didn't expect to meet you here.

143
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:20,258
In fact, Eagle Division is not far from Shuozhou.

144
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,759
It is near the river with trees.

145
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,900
You'll get used to living here.

146
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,759
Have some food.

147
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:28,879
Listen.

148
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,378
If Tegin Sun doesn't care about you, I won't care about your life.

149
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,179
Stubborn!

150
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,418
Your friend seems to be quite stubborn.

151
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,418
I think you'll have no benefits from him.

152
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:47,298
He's too weak to survive in grasslands.

153
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,618
No.

154
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,239
Why?

155
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:53,040
He has the strongest desire for survival.

156
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:59,019
Such situation can't beat him down.

157
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,339
It seems that you know him very well.

158
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,340
But I think he just treats you as an enemy.

159
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,700
I don't care.

160
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,700
You've never treated me that kindly these years.

161
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,979
That guy has followed us all the way.

162
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,958
I know.

163
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,020
He comes to see Shisi.

164
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,219
Do me a favor.

165
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:45,459
What do you want to do?

166
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,879
Let me go!

167
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,298
Listen.

168
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,618
You're our slave.

169
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:51,659
You must listen to us.

170
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,679
You refuse to work?

171
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,840
I think you ask for death!

172
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:58,618
Take him away!

173
00:10:58,619 --> 00:10:59,659
Cut him off and feed dogs!

174
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,160
Yes!

175
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,018
What do you want to do?

176
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,258
Let me go!

177
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:09,459
Go!

178
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,060
Let me go!

179
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
Hurry up!

180
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:44,919
Mr. Qin.

181
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,460
I feel sorry for Yuan.

182
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,298
She's braved the wind and dew with us for a long time.

183
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,718
I don't think so.

184
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,159
She has the best dad and mom in the world.

185
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,700
What's the situation of Shuozhou?

186
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,858
I've got the news.

187
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,858
Ashile Tribe has left.

188
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:13,740
The court will send someone to take over the rest.

189
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,119
And...

190
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,418
And?

191
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,899
Do you want to tell me the news of Young Master?

192
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,699
Her assassination failed.

193
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,300
She was killed.

194
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:28,019
Got it.

195
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,599
She's so stubborn.

196
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,979
It's easy for her to suffer losses.

197
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,720
If...

198
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,378
Don't be sad.

199
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:42,738
I think she's still alive.

200
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:44,618
Still alive?

201
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:48,779
Since Ashile Sun has an agreement with the governor,

202
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,298
he won't kill her.

203
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:54,579
Perhaps he's taken her to the grassland.

204
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,058
So we don't need to wait for her. We should find her!

205
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:57,019
We should find her!

206
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,938
The grassland is full of their spies.

207
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:03,360
We can't do anything there.

208
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,958
Let's arrange for Yuan first.

209
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,378
Try to use the previous intelligence network to get information.

210
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:13,260
Then make decisions.

211
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,700
[The target has been killed by Ashile Tribe.]

212
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,618
Li Changge.

213
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,279
Perhaps it's your best end.

214
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,539
Why are you here?

215
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,599
It's a question that I should ask you.

216
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:03,979
It's strange that his Highness doesn't blame you for losing Princess.

217
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,119
I'll find Leyan for sure.

218
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,260
I'll wait.

219
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,499
You haven't been back to Chang'an for a long time.

220
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,619
Are you looking for Changge?

221
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:17,938
What's wrong with her?

222
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:19,639
She died.

223
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,480
How did she die?

224
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,260
You killed her?

225
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,839
Tell me!

226
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,019
Wei Shuyu.

227
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,738
Are you going to revenge for your loved girl,

228
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,758
regardless of the safety of your family?

229
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:49,039
After I kill you,

230
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,879
I'll commit suicide.

231
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,759
Do you think his Highness will kill my family for you?

232
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,880
Why haven't you taken any action?

233
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,699
When Li Changge was alive, you could do nothing.

234
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,839
But you have the courage to revenge after her death.

235
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,359
I think you know that once Li Changge dies,

236
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:12,480
your family's glory won't be affected.

237
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,000
If you want to revenge, you get the wrong person.

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,059
I didn't kill Li Changge.

239
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,058
She was killed by Ashile Tribe.

240
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:29,579
Ashile Tribe?

241
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,198
After Ashile Tribe occupied Shuozhou, Li Changge was captured.

242
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,739
Considering her stubbornness,

243
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,900
do you think she can survive?

244
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,979
I never expect that you're the man that ran after me with him.

245
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,579
From now on, you and I have nothing to do with each other.

246
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,880
From now on,

247
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,299
I'll lead my own life.

248
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,079
The amulet given by Leyan is of no use.

249
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:16,959
In the end,

250
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,099
I fail to protect neither of them.

251
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,378
Come on.

252
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,258
Li Changge has died.

253
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:25,058
Don't let Princess be in trouble.

254
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,779
And I receive a letter from Chang'an.

255
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,779
They ask me to stay in the north to look for Princess.

256
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,900
Obviously, they don't trust you.

257
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,298
I'll find Leyan earlier than you.

258
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,699
I don't care.

259
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,600
I disdain to compete with you.

260
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,159
But I can give you a hint.

261
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,699
Li Changge is a well-known commandant in Shuozhou.

262
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,258
If Princess Yong'an is in Shuozhou, there must be some traces.

263
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:59,590
So you shouldn't come to Shuozhou.

264
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:25,038
What happened last night?

265
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,399
Why did you knock me out after putting the headgear on my head?

266
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:29,299
Why didn't you kill me?

267
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,259
Last night, a slave died for you.

268
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,299
Take him away!

269
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,218
Cut off him and feed dogs!

270
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:35,919
Yes!

271
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,838
- Let me go!
- Go!

272
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:41,559
Let me go!

273
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,319
Go!

274
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,819
Hurry up!

275
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,519
Don't resist!

276
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,400
Hurry up!

277
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,218
What does Ashile Sun want to do?

278
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:12,818
I don't understand it, too.

279
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:15,939
If I were him, I would have been impatient!

280
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:19,399
You've been challenging the bottom line of Eagle Division.

281
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,979
You'll never realize our power without any suffering.

282
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,659
How delicate you are!

283
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,940
I don't know why he brought you back.

284
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,500
[Yunzhou County Government]

285
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,320
Sir, this way.

286
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,898
Sir.

287
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:02,940
Are you the magistrate?

288
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,938
Where are you from?

289
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:06,838
You even don't know our magistrate!

290
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:08,918
Magistrate. Please do me a favor.

291
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:09,898
How dare you!

292
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,219
Don't you know the rules?

293
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,298
Magistrate is busy with official business.

294
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,799
Go away!

295
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,040
Magistrate!

296
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,159
You're the local magistrate of Yunzhou.

297
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,298
If I didn't ask for something urgent,

298
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,758
I wouldn't have been so presumptuous.

299
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:25,579
Go away!

300
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,460
If you want to redress the injustice, beat the drum.

301
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,898
What do you want to say?

302
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,979
Listen.

303
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:38,018
It's inconvenient to tell you my identity.

304
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:41,998
But could you send a letter to Chang'an or Luoyang

305
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:44,000
if it is convenient for you?

306
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,058
What's your identity?

307
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,219
I'm Princess Yong'an.

308
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,979
I lost touch with my valet by accident.

309
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,739
After the city was occupied, I ran all the away and arrived here.

310
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,739
Magistrate.

311
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,298
If you can help me return to the capital,

312
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,879
his Highness will give you a big reward.

313
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,599
Do you have any keepsake?

314
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,200
Keepsake?

315
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,100
I kept no keepsake when lost.

316
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,259
But I'm really a princess.

317
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,699
My dad gave me the title in person.

318
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,138
Do you have any things made by the palace?

319
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:22,019
I can recognize it immediately.

320
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,318
All the keepsakes were robbed.

321
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:27,459
Where did you get the news?

322
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,778
You're well-informed.

323
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:32,699
The court gave us a secret order to find a princess in secret.

324
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,400
But I can't identify you based on what you say.

325
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,720
I know dad must have sent people to look for me.

326
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,979
Magistrate.

327
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,338
I'm really a princess. Believe me.

328
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:43,798
Really. Magistrate.

329
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:46,118
I beg you. Send a letter to Luoyang!

330
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:48,179
- You impersonate Princess. Flog to death.
- I'm not cheating you!

331
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,258
Come on! Catch her!

332
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,038
Yes!

333
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:52,538
Magistrate! Magistrate...

334
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,619
Why not trust me?

335
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,459
Don't be stunned! Catch her!

336
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,979
Catch her!

337
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,818
Come on.

338
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,138
Let her go.

339
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,879
What a poor girl!

340
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,739
Now the situation is very chaotic.

341
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,339
The new governor will arrive in days.

342
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,000
I have no time to deal with the refugee.

343
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:14,399
Be careful.

344
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,940
Dad.

345
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,500
Why haven't you taken me home?

346
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,459
Have you abandoned me?

If you think you have endless strength, run a few laps outside.

349
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,499
I'm really confused.

350
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,879
How will you treat Shisi?

351
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,099
You made great efforts to rescue Shisi.

352
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,440
But now you don't care about him, leaving him bullied.

353
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,459
You're becoming more and more strange.

354
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,859
The more I care about her, the more painful she will be.

355
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,620
Instead of letting her hate herself,

356
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,898
I'd better let her hate me.

357
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,699
You're really strange!

358
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,579
Are you bewitched by him?

359
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,619
Shall I ask a witch doctor to diagnose you?

360
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,499
I think you want to clean up horse dung.

361
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,520
Clean horse dung?

362
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,699
I'm the military counsellor of Eagle Division.

363
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,219
Don't make me embarrassed.

364
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:08,339
She has to get a foothold here on her own.

365
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,879
I can't see all of her actions.

366
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:13,619
He's just a clever man from Central Plains.

367
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,159
Is she worth your deeds?

368
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,160
I don't think she's grateful at all.

369
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,778
I don't need her gratitude.

370
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:24,120
I just hope she can survive.

371
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:27,699
Tegin.

372
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,538
Counsellor.

373
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,039
The slave you asked me to keep an eye on fainted.

374
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,139
You have been burnt out for Shuozhou

375
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:00,680
and refused to eat and drink all the way.

376
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,759
Do you try to seek death?

377
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you think I'll do anything on you?

378
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,159
I'm not interested in women like you.

379
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,259
When did you...

380
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,060
I knew you're a girl when I saved you beside the river.

381
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:20,718
I found that you want to conceal it.

382
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:22,599
I'm not interested in exposing you.

383
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,399
You've always been kidding me?

384
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,520
I don't care what you think.

385
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,899
Tegin! Here's your medicine you want and...

386
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,678
The doctor said you become ill due to worries and are deficient in qi and blood.

387
00:24:46,678 --> 00:24:50,719
If you don't want to die, take the medicine.

388
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,679
Take it!

389
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,879
Li Shisi!

390
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:07,118
I didn't expect that you're so sheepish! People in Shuozhou are safe and sound.

391
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:10,758
I've met my commitment. Now it's your turn.

392
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,859
Don't forget that you're at the mercy of me.

393
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,159
Ridiculous.

394
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,759
You want a person from Central Plain to work for you?

395
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,500
You'd better kill me so that you won't regret later.

396
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,159
I tell you the last time. Take the medicine.

397
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,658
Can you only solve the problems in this way?

398
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,438
That's better than living in disgrace.

399
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:55,239
Now that I'm at the mercy of you, why do you humiliate me?

400
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,879
Humiliate you?

401
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:59,859
I just don't want you to die so easily.

402
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:03,638
Li Shisi. You'd better try to survive.

403
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:09,119
Even if you want to kill me or revenge for Gongsun Heng one day.

404
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,179
Revenge?

405
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:15,799
Yes. Revenge!

406
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,939
Have you forgotten the hatred of Gongsun Heng and the people and army of Shuozhou?

407
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:30,860
It's ridiculous that Gongsun Heng entrusted everything to you.

408
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,759
If I were you, I would try every means to get a firm foothold here

409
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,038
and win others' trust at any cost so as to find the chance to kill them.

410
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,639
If you want to live up to his expectation, struggle to survive.

411
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:56,239
If I can entrust Shuozhou people's lives to the princess of Tang,

412
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,890
I will die without regret.

413
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,678
I can't let the families in the city down

414
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:13,560
but I am doomed to fail my wife and daughter.

415
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,779
A' Dou!

416
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:33,099
Not only the hatred of Gongsun and Shuozhou.

417
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,198
Yes.

418
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:37,838
I can't just die.

419
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:40,459
I can't die here.

420
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,859
It's easy to die.

421
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:45,460
It has always been the hardest to live on.

422
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:10,879
Go!

423
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,980
Go!

424
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:18,799
Stop!

425
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:22,279
Stop!

426
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:53,499
- Go.
- Don't go there.

427
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:57,418
We just came from there. Yan is not there.

428
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,360
Turn left. To Yunzhou.

429
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,899
Go!

430
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,479
Go!

431
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:15,399
It's magistrate's office! You are not allowed to break in!

432
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:17,160
Magistrate.

433
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:29,038
I come to look for Princess under his Highness' order. We need your people for help.

434
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,400
I am at your service.

435
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,859
Immediately arrange people to go to all refugee settlements to find the woman in the picture.

436
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,439
Yes.

437
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,459
Well... Well...

438
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:52,158
Did you see her? Where's she?

439
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:57,300
She had no keepsake to prove her identity.

440
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,138
I mistook her as a refugee. So I drove her away.

441
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:04,579
Find her at all costs!

442
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,080
Yes.

443
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,429
- Ms. Chai. Where are you going?
- Just hang around.

444
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:10,759
Bye.

445
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,819
Your embroidery is terrible. You should work harder to earn money.

446
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,918
Got it.

447
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:19,818
Mrs. Xiang. How is your incense business?

448
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,918
Good.

449
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,579
You need to burn more incense.

450
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,459
Fragrant and crisp sesame cake!

451
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,519
- Open for business today?
- Yes.

452
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,018
Give me three.

453
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:31,119
You have many workers. Three is not enough.

454
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,339
Nonsense.

455
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,418
It's already hard for them to have meals, let alone sesame cakes.

456
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,370
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

457
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,130
Ok. Wait a minute.

458
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,019
So many things here! Look at it!

459
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:50,118
It's not a charity. Beg for food elsewhere.

460
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:52,260
I have money.

461
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,178
I want to buy cakes.

462
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,018
You frightened her.

463
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:58,299
Three coppers each. Don't consider it expensive.

464
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:02,079
It's a time of chaos. Food is expensive everywhere.

465
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,840
Here you are.

466
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:10,378
Miss. In bright daylight, will you do anything to...

467
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:12,418
Miss. I've got married.

468
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,579
I've got married.

469
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,698
Three coppers each. No other alternative.

470
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:20,438
No. I was afraid of being robbed,

471
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:23,600
so I put my purse in the innermost layer of my clothes.

472
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Okay.

473
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,198
Obviously you don't know how to embroider. What's this?

474
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:40,980
An ugly purse!

475
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,220
I think it's the most beautiful purse in the world.

476
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,998
Okay. Wait a minute.

477
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:59,000
Here's your cake.

478
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,378
- Thanks.
- Okay.

479
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,859
Sorry.

480
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,678
That's alright. I had dirtier food before.

481
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,760
If you don't mind, I can share a half.

482
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,100
I can share with you.

483
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,359
I mean no harm.

484
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,658
In recent years, kind people are bullied by bad ones.

485
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:41,199
Miss, check your purse right now.

486
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:46,600
It's stupid that you want to share your cake with him!

487
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,119
Have a look!

488
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:53,699
My purse! My purse!

489
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,140
Stop!

490
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,759
Stop!

491
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,260
My purse!

492
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,040
Stop!

493
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,040
Stop!

494
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,919
Stop!

495
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:26,378
Return my purse. You can take away the money.

496
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,178
Well. Here you are.

497
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,179
Here you are.

498
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,379
So ugly! What's this?

499
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:53,898
To make it, I got my hands punctured. But you think it ugly.

500
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,178
Well, I won't give you.

501
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:58,899
Though it's ugly, I like it.

502
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,339
Changge.

503
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:09,719
Where are you?

504
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:23,879
Have you seen the woman in the portrait?

505
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,480
No.

506
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,959
- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

507
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,959
Have you seen the woman in the portrait?

508
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,560
No.

509
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,818
- Have you seen her?
- No.

510
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:38,959
- Have you?
- No.

511
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:42,020
They want to catch me.

512
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,219
You! Stop!

513
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,418
Stop!

514
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,419
Go!

515
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,278
Stop!

516
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:53,798
Stop!

517
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:55,378
Stop!

518
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:57,179
Go!

519
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,078
You lost money. But why do you follow me?

520
00:35:35,078 --> 00:35:37,959
- They want to catch me.
- What crime have you committed?

521
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:41,378
Nothing. They said I impersonate Princess.

522
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:43,758
You'd better impersonate anyone else.

523
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:46,919
Miss. Are you a fool?

524
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:50,039
I don't impersonate Princess. I'm really...

525
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,560
Open the door!

526
00:35:58,319 --> 00:35:59,919
Open the door!

527
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,139
I'm coming! Will you compensate if the door is broken?

528
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:07,799
It's daytime. Why are you in a hurry?

529
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:10,679
Do you want to buy cloth?

530
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:13,838
We're arresting a girl. We saw her walking down the street.

531
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,680
Have you seen her?

532
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
The girl in the portrait.

533
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,440
Yes.

534
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,658
The girl's purse was stolen in the street before.

535
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:32,319
She ran south after the thief.

536
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,938
Sir. What crime has she committed?

537
00:36:34,938 --> 00:36:39,959
Hope she's not an infamous robber. It's been very restless here.

538
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,219
Search!

539
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,999
Sir! Sir!

540
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:10,278
- What's the matter?
- No idea.

541
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:12,219
What is happening?

542
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:32,698
- Not here.
- Not here.

543
00:37:32,698 --> 00:37:34,640
Not there.

544
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,039
Sir, I've told you that she's not here.

545
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,399
My workshop should do business.

546
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:43,299
You search everywhere, and the impact is bad.

547
00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:47,239
Come on. Inform us if you see her next time.

548
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,300
Of course.

549
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,939
Go.

550
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,078
You're so clever that you hid in the tank.

551
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:13,359
Thank you, Miss.  I thought you don't want to save me.

552
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,178
Come on. I think you're innocent.

553
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,119
The government really makes a fuss of it.

554
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,359
It's nothing serious to impersonate Princess.

555
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:26,418
Miss. I don't impersonate Princess. I'm really Princess.

556
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:29,618
Come on. I don't care whether you're a princess or a master.

557
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:31,978
I'm busy now. You should leave now.

558
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:36,638
Miss. If I go out now, I'll be killed.

559
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:42,039
Please do me a favor. Allow me to stay here one more day. I beg you.

560
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:45,759
OK. Go in and change your clothes.

561
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:48,359
Don't get ill and stay here for a long time.

562
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,479
Thank you, Miss.

563
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,859
It's grassland.

564
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:08,579
So vast.

565
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,739
Ms. Su Yili. Do you have any cheese?

566
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:14,758
- Leave a bit more for me.
- Yes!

567
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:18,359
Come to my tent later. You'll eat as much as you can.

568
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:18,858
Tegin! Have you prepared gifts for us?

569
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,638
Yes. Everyone can get a gift.

570
00:39:23,638 --> 00:39:25,419
Yaro.

571
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,359
Tegin. The herbs are all dried. Here you are.

572
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,259
How about them?

573
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:34,860
Good.

574
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,959
- Tegin.
- Look.

575
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,279
Help yourselves.

576
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:42,059
- Gift!  - I want this!

577
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,239
This one is good.

578
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,558
- Look!
- Let me see.

579
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:49,038
Second Uncle! Where's my award?

580
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,329
- Where's my award?
- Where's my award?

581
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:53,438
Stand still! Stand still! Stand sill and close your eyes!

582
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:55,619
Close your eyes!

583
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:01,319
Where's mine, uncle? Where's mine?

584
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:04,180
I have only one little horse.

585
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,699
Try to reach it!

586
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,278
- Give me, dad!
- Give me!

587
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,960
Dad!

588
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:19,259
Second Uncle!

589
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,178
Dad, don't cheat me!

590
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:22,898
Dad!

591
00:40:22,899 --> 00:40:24,980
Second Uncle!

592
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,058
Give me, Second Uncle! You promised me!

593
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,260
Let me help you.

594
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,599
Good.

595
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,500
Interesting!

596
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,759
Since you're good at playing football, here you are.

597
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:52,959
Bro! Could you lend your ball?

598
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Here you are.

599
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,279
- Stop!
- Let's go.

600
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:04,060
Wait!

601
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:06,418
Slow down!

602
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:08,638
- Give me!
- No!

603
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,999
I'll bring the gifts to them. Be careful.

604
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:14,239
Help him carry the gifts.

605
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:30,439
The monthly salary this year is too low.

606
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:32,078
Ms. Zhang, don't be too greedy.

607
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:34,558
At least we have a job to keep from starving.

608
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,499
That's good.

609
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:39,258
Yes, you're right. Are the looms more and more difficult to use?

610
00:41:39,258 --> 00:41:41,100
Yes.

611
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,118
Ms. Chai. You've finally hired a new weaver.

612
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:55,319
I picked her in the street. She just stay here for a night.

613
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,139
Nice to meet you.

614
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,238
Stop looking around! Go on with your work!

615
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,139
What a pretty girl!

616
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:15,919
What etiquette did she show?

617
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:18,338
I don't know. It looks good.

618
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:19,639
Yes.

619
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,138
Nice to meet you.

620
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,338
No. Like this.

621
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:26,279
No. Just like her!

622
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,098
Just share this room with others.

623
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:32,718
You have to leave tomorrow. I don't raise idlers.

624
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:35,898
Thanks, Miss. I'll repay you one day.

625
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:38,300
Thank you in advance.

626
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:49,500
What should I do tomorrow?

627
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,959
Magistrate, what did you say just now?

628
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,378
I'm sorry.

629
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:08,579
We found her but failed to take her back.

630
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,759
You'd better say you failed to find her. What do you mean by that?

631
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,078
We saw a similar woman in the street.

632
00:43:16,078 --> 00:43:19,198
But... She ran away.

633
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:21,899
What similar woman? Why did she just run away?

634
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,519
Mr. Hao. I'll make further research.

635
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,879
But Princess has feet.

636
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:31,679
I'm not sure whether she's still in Yunzhou.

637
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,418
How dare you shirk responsibility!

638
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:37,739
Well. We'll keep searching her.

639
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:40,038
- I'll search her tomorrow! Get lost!
- I'll search her tomorrow! Get lost!

640
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:41,719
OK.

641
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,178
Yan.

642
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:49,979
Where are you?
