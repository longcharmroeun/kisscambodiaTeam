Hao Du sent a message,

25
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,099
saying that Princess Yongning used Li Shisi as the alias name

26
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,059
and assisted the governor Gongsun Heng in Shuozhou

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,699
to protect the city from enemies' attack.

After Shuozhou was conquered,

Princess Yongning got caught by Ashile Tribe.

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,538
Hao Du sent someone following them.

31
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:02,889

00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,280

57
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,679
Like the pouch you embroidered?

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,978
That's the ugliest pouch I've ever seen.

59
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,699
With such level of embroidery,

60
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,579

Li Leyan.

From now on, she'll work with you.

78
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,818
Yesterday, didn't you say that she'd stay for only one day?

79
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,739
I'm in a good mood today.

80
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,978
Can't I keep her?

81
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,098
Surely you can.

82
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,299
But she can't know how to work, according to her appearance.

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,859
You can employ anyone but her.

84

I want to employ her, because her salary is low.

Tegin, the list of spoils in Shuozhou has been sorted.

105
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,028
Should I send it to Khan's Tent?

106
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,909
Let several reliable men send it.

107
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,910
Yes.

108
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,509
You're not gonna send it on your own?

109
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,629
It's such an achievement.

110
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,509
And you don't show your loyalty in front of Great Khan.

111
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,669
Since he's very suspicious, he might think you wanna betray him.

112
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,308
I used to let others send it.

113
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:22,709
If I go there myself this time, he will get suspicious.

114
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,669

115
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,910

- Just go.
- I can be your military counselor.

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,389
Now you're bragging.

120
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,028
I mean. Who are you?

121
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,789
Are you making decisions in Eagle Division?

122
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,790
Stop driving a wedge between Sun and me.

123
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,309
You...

124
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:53,268
Your reason?

125
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:55,909
Since I work for you, and mainly assistant you,

126
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,470
I have to do something useful.

127
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,588
I'm good at strategies.

128
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,190
That Tegin brought me here must be out of that reason.

129
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,510
Please allow me to be your assistant.

130
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,669
My defeated opponent.

131
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,389
You can really brag.

132
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,428
Tell me, why should I use a stranger like you as my assistant.

133
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,190
Actually, I've been thinking about a question.

134
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:24,428
Great Khan let Eagle Division be the pioneer to attack Shuozhou.

135
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:28,189
However, the army that Tegin led was not for attacking a city.

136
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,629
Besides, you haven't fought against Tang before.

137
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,868
Therefore, Great Khan seemed not to care about the result.

138
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:38,390
What's worse, he might want you to lose.

139
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,390
Nonsense!

140
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,349
Go on.

141
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,548
It reminds me of what was like in Shuozhou that day.

142
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:50,069
Eagle Division and Bear Division hindered each other.

143
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,428
And you were even competing in public.

144
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,988
If Bear Division wasn't supported by someone,

145
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:57,268
it's hard for him to do that.

146
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,299
After all, you're the adopted son of Great Khan.

147
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,629
What exactly are you trying to say?

148
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,988
So I guessed it correctly.

149
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,868
Tegin's position in Ashile Tribe

150
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:06,750
is way less solid than what others think about.

151
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,909
But you're the adopted son of Great Khan.

152
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,749
And you have an army.

153
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,909
I don't believe you want to do nothing.

154
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,828
I'm loyal to Great Khan.

155
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,859
Great Khan also trusts me.

156
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,069
You don't need to incite between us two.

157
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,469
About your words, does Great Khan believe it?

158
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,350
Do Great Khan's nephews believe that?

159
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,510
How did you know these things?

160
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,550
So, do you think I'm qualified to be your assistant?

161
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,509
What's your requirement?

162
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,428
I'll be your military counselor, and can realize three wishes for you.

163
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:48,589
However, you can't do harm to Tang.

164
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,269
And you can't do ruthless things.

165
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,589
When I finish the three tasks, please let me leave here.

166
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,949
Okay.

167
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,189
Sun!

168
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,668
From now on, you're no longer a slave.

169
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,589
But I won't help you, either.

170
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,589
You need to depend on your ability to survive here in Eagle Division.

171
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,189
When you finished three wishes, I would set you free.

172
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,190
After that,

173
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,870
if you still want to take revenge on me,

174
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,270
I'd wait for you.

175
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,589
Have you decided your three wishes?

176
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,069
Not yet.

177
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,308
But it's like making wishes.

178
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:28,988
The time when I decide it, you should realize it for me.

179
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,589
Okay. I accept that.

180
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,868
But just as what I said, you can't do harm to Tang.

181
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,830
And you can't do ruthless things.

182
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,389
These days, I'll depend on my own ability

183
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,468
to get a firm foothold here in Eagle Division.

184
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:44,428
Please wait for my performance, Tegin.

185
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:45,429
OK. Deal.

186
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:48,630
Unlock her iron chain.

187
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,610
[Weaving Workshop of Western Suburb]

188
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:10,589
Let's pause and have a rest.

189
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,509
You must feel tired.

190
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,629
I bought some pastries.

191
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,788
Everyone can eat.

192
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:14,629
Pastries?

193
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,709
- Pastries!
- Pastries.

194
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,868
Come here.

195
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:17,468
Come.

196
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:17,868
Thank you.

197
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:18,908
You all can enjoy it.

198
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,949
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

199
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,908
- Thank you.
- Ms. Chai.

200
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:22,468
Why are you so generous today?

201
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:23,468
- Right.
- Yeah.

202
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,228
You didn't even buy sesame cakes in normal days.

203
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,189
Did you get any order?

204
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,788
Right.

205
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:30,949
A businessman Mr. Hu ordered a batch of goods.

206
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,428
It's enough for us to spend for several months!

207
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:34,509
Really?

208
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,389
- Great!
- That's great.

209
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,868
So you have to work hard.

210
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:39,788
After finishing the pastries, continue working.

211
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:40,908
Okay. Let's go.

212
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,428
Continue working.

213
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:43,429
That's tasty.

214
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,709
Miss Li.

215
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,269
Have some pastries also.

216
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,668
You can do it later.

217
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:52,069
You're new here.

218
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,069
I don't have any expectation for you.

219
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,149
Whether you do it well or badly, it doesn't matter.

220
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,389
Ms. Chai.

221
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,509
If I do it badly, I can start over.

222
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,428
It doesn't matter.

223
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,468
Eat some pastries first.

224
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:04,469
You can do it later.

225
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,348
Li Leyan!

226
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:12,108
What have you done?

227
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:12,829
Look!

228
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,509
Look at it!

229
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,069
Did you see?

230
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,908
I'll do it again.

231
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:15,589
I'll start over.

232
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,108
No. No. Don't do it.

233
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,189
Please stop. Please.

234
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,869
Look at the thread on your head.

235
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:22,509
I...

236
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,510
That's...

237
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,590
I...

238
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,149
Sun.

239
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,908
Great Khan is suddenly coming. And he's with Sher.

240
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,269
Great Khan never came here on his own initiative.

241
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,548
I suppose something big might happen.

242
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,428
Could it be about Shuozhou?

243
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:38,429
About Shuozhou,

244
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:42,589
it's me that made agreements secretly with Gongsun Heng.

245
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,459
You knew nothing.

246
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,069
It also has nothing to do with men in Eagle Division.

247
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,108
Understand?

248
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,899
What are you gonna do?

249
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,709
Since I accepted Gongsun Heng's offer,

250
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,670
I'd thought about things that would happen today.

251
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,269
I made the decision myself.

252
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,750
If Great Khan wants to blame us,

253
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,029
you only need to protect yourself.

254
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,589
Have you thought of a way to get yourself out of this?

255
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,389
No one can be totally sure about anything.

256
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,390
I'll do my best.

257
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:13,229
Prepare the list of spoils to welcome Great Khan.

258
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,270
Come.

259
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,149
You...

260
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,389
Li Shisi. Let me go.

261
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,868
Tell me what happened exactly.

262
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:30,868
I don't know.

263
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:32,868
Stop playing dumb.

264
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,029
What are you gonna do?

265
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,109
I wanna know the truth.

266
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,389
Pardoning Shuozhou was Sun's own decision.

267
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,029
Great Khan didn't know that.

268
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,630
If Great Khan were there, almost everyone in Shuozhou would die.

269
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,389
Though Sun looks indifferent and cold,

270
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,788
he's actually the most humane one.

271
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:55,348
He already knew it was you that led the army in Shuozhou.

272
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:58,548
About that arrow to you, he missed the target on purpose.

273
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,509
He even worried if he's too good at shooting.

274
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,868
And he kept asking me if you were fine.

275
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,668
Also, before taking you away from Shuozhou,

276
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:10,829
he posted that you tried to kill the leader of Ashile Tribe but failed

277
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,428
and have been executed and died for the people.

278
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:15,908
That was for your reputation as the Commandant of Shuozhou.

279
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:16,749
And you?

280
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,909
How did you treat him?

281
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,228
I don't wanna talk too much with you.

282
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:24,108
Great Khan comes here this time.

283
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:26,189
Sun did disobey Great Khan's order.

284
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,829
As for Sher.

285
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,749
He's Sun's sworn enemy.

286
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,630
If his plot works, Sun will be in danger.

287
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,550
I have to think of a way to save him.

288
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,509
Did Ashile Sun tell you how he would deal with that?

289
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,510
I don't know.

290
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,789
Greetings to Great Khan from Ashile Sun.

291
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,830
Stand up.

292
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,029
Father comes here on your own this time.

293
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,390
I wonder what your instruction is.

294
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:21,950
No need to be so serious.

295
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,468
Take a seat.

296
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:25,469
Yes.

297
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,228
Sun.

298
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,830
We two haven't seen each other for long.

299
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,589
I want to visit here out of whim.

300
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,868
Now Eagle Division is well trained and equipped.

301
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,108
Your people all look energetic.

302
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:44,509
That's good.

303
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,269
I feel relieved.

304
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,868
The prosperity in Ashile Tribe owes to father.

305
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:53,109
What Eagle Division depends on is also father's grace.

306
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,389
Sun, that's too modest for you to say that.

307
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,348
I dare not lie to you, father.

308
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:06,189
I've been hearing that Sun's the God of War here.

309
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,829
I thought that was boasting.

310
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,099
I didn't expect at the first battle between Eagle Division and Tang,

311
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,629
you successfully conquered Shuozhou within only ten days.

312
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,789
Sun, you're indeed the God of War.

313
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:26,749
Ashile Tribe is well known for its battle-wise soildiers.

314
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,190
It's natural that Eagle Division can conquer Shuozhou successfully.

315
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,029
Ashile Sun.

316
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,629
You're indeed good at the art of language.

317
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,710
But you seemed not to have told the truth.

318
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,949
What do you mean?

319
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,969
Shuozhou has been hard to conquer.

320
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,468
Uncle Khan has been attacking for years,

321
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:47,589
but still couldn't conquer it.

322
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,908
Why did they open the city gate for you once you were there?

323
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,630
Uncle Khan. Don't you think that's too strange?

324
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:59,429
Sher, tell me why it's strange.

325
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,069
Just be straightforward.

326
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,009
Great Khan has ordered that after conquering the city,

327
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,509
you have to eliminate all of the soldiers and supplies.

328
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,108
Shuozhou is the key place to the northern pass.

329
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:14,389
Only by so can we give Tang no chance to take a breath.

330
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,189
But I heard that after you conquered the city,

331
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,548
you not only held an elaborate funeral for Gongsun Heng,

332
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,349
but also pardoned everyone in the city.

333
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,228
Ashile Sun, is it because you're afraid of death

334
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,750
so that you want to betray us?

335
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:33,590
Sun. Is that true?

336
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:39,789
Right. I did give the order.

337
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,668
Uncle Khan, have you heard that?

338
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,989
He admitted that he betrayed you and Ashile Tribe.

339
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:50,989
Are you doubting my loyalty, father?

340
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,149
He already knew it was you that led the army in Shuozhou.

341
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,629
About that arrow to you, he missed the target on purpose.

342
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,228
He even worried if he's too good at shooting.

343
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:10,949
And he kept asking me if you were fine.

344
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,868
As for Sher, he's Sun's sworn enemy.

345
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,829
If his plot works, Sun will be in danger.

346
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,549
Though Ashile Sun didn't do exactly as what Great Khan ordered,

347
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,270
he won the battle at such a low price after all.

348
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,948
Anyway, that can't be a fault.

349
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,939
Great Khan came here on his own to inquire Sun.

350
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,660
There should be something more complicated.

351
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,869
What's that exactly?

352
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,509
Go get some water.

353
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,510
Yes.

354
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,068
If it weren't Young Khan that wanna make use of you,

355
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,868
I'd definitely beat you to death. Bastard Tang man.

356
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:55,188
You kept making the request.

357
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,188
Do you really think you're a big figure?

358
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,348
I'll kill you someday.

359
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,149
Tang man?

360
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,949
Why did Young Khan bring a Tang man here?

361
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
Something's wrong.

362
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,670
If I don't trust you,

363
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,549
I won't give you any chance to explain.

364
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,550
Thank you, father.

365
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,749
This is the letter that Gongsun Heng,

366
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,348
governor of Shuozhou, wrote to me.

367
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:43,469
Please have a check, father.

368
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,868
Gongsun Heng's been guarding the frontier for years.

369
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,188
Our tribe launched many attacks but was defeated by him.

370
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:56,228
We lost a lot.
[Tegin Sun...]

371
00:18:56,229 --> 00:19:00,229
If I attacked Shuozhou by force, many of our men would die.

372
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,348
Gongsun Heng sued for peace this time.

373
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,789
He'd like to suicide for people's lives in that city.

374
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,269
When he died, big harm to our tribe would disappear,

375
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,790
and we can also win at the lowest price.

376
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,070
That's why I accepted his offer.

377
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,509
You even pardoned Tang's soldiers.

378
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,579
How can you explain that?

379
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,789
Most of soldiers in Shuozhou died.

380
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,549
There were only old and disabled soldiers left.

381
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,068
They can't attack at all.

382
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:27,709
If not so, Gongsun Heng wouldn't have the request.

383
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,669
He killed himself as promised and opened the city gate for us.

384
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,469
As the son of Great Khan, how could I break my promise?

385
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,229
Father, please pass judgment.

386
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,389
These are Gong Sunheng's head and the list of all spoils.

387
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,790
Please have a look, Great Khan.

388

Enough. No need to check it.

390
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,988
Sun. You were right.

391
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:36,509
The descendants born in the grasslands

392
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,389
have always been upright and magnanimous.

393
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,509
Gongsun Heng is a respectable opponent.

394
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,988
Just hold the funeral on behalf of me according to our etiquette.

395
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:50,510
Yes, father.

396
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:01,708
Sun.

397
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:05,310
I have another thing to ask you this time.

398
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,859
Nuer.

399
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,549
What are you doing?

400
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,789
Though you're not a slave now,

401
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,228
you still can't order me to do anything.

402
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:25,859
Nuer. You have to help me this time.

403
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,709
You're indeed not taking yourself as a stranger.

404
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,988
Listen, if you don't help me this time,

405
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:34,150
your Tegin and the whole Eagle Division would face a disaster.

406
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,389
Ashile Sun, if you admit it yourself,

407
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,828
I can still plead for you to Uncle Khan.

408
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:45,708
I don't know what you're talking about.

409
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,910
So you refuse to admit until you face the reality.

410
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,310
Uncle Khan, Ashile Sun colluded with Tang and harmed our tribe.

411
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,629
That's venomously slander!

412
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,029
When I was in Youzhou, I could almost succeed.

413
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,859
But Ashile Sun, you colluded the envoy of Tang

414
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,269
and let him take the army to assist.

415
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,029
Then Tang won back Youzhou again.

416
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,750
And my Wolf Division's effort was in vain.

417
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:14,029
You betrayed Great Khan and colluded with Tang.

418
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,988
Stop pretending to be loyal.

419
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:19,109
Sun, is that true?

420
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,829
I swear to God of Sirius, that it never happens.

421
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,029
Uncle Khan, there's a general betraying Tang.

422
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,269
He escaped on his way being sent to Changan.

423
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,909
And he's finally under my control.

424
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,869
He used to work for King of Lujiang, called Wang Junkuo.

425
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,948
Young Khan, you ruined things in Youzhou yourself.

426
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,868
And now you want to slander Tegin Sun.

427
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:45,629
What do you mean?

428
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,189
Mu Jin. Stop.

429
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:53,389
Ashile Sun, you must be familiar with him.

430
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,310
If you haven't done anything, dare you talk with him in person?

431
00:22:58,589 --> 00:22:59,749
Uncle Khan,

432
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,709
my men of Wolf Division all died for nothing. That's unfair.

433
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:07,109
Guards.

434
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,510
- Bring the traitor here.
- Yes.

435
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,868
I might be insane that I'd follow you here.

436
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,789
You want to do it in front of Great Khan.

437
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,828
That's impossible.

438
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,669
Even Tegin Sun can't protect you.

439
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,149
I didn't say I'd do anything.

440
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,389
You won't do anything? You wanna win by just talking?

441
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,750
I indeed plan to win by talking.

442
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,029
Later I'll yell that Young Khan's horse is lost.

443
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,149
I'll keep away the guards.

444
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,789
You should finish the rest part.

445
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,429
What do you mean?

446
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,708
I'm just here helping you.

447
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:43,909
The man that Young Khan brought here was the General of Youzhou.

448
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,749
He met me before.

449
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,868
I can't go inside.

450
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:47,309
Only you can do this.

451
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,549
You...

452
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,029
Do you mean it?

453
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,108
I'll teach you how to do it.

454
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,868
Come here.

455
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,030
When you get in...

456
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,629
Will it work?

457
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,630
It's on you now.

458
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,429
Young Khan's horse's running away!

459
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,110
Young Khan's horse's running away! Get it!

460
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:21,829
Ashile Sun, have you well considered it?

461
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:26,909
If you admit your mistake now, maybe Uncle Khan would spare your life

462
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,429
considering your previous achievements.

463
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,669
When Wang Junkuo gets here and explains everything,

464
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,829
you won't feel easy by that time.

465
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,068
Even if you don't care about yourself,

466
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:39,910
you should think about Eagle Division.

467
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:49,629
Sun, as long as you can admit your mistake and explain yourself,

468
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,189
I'll forgive you.

469
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,670
I feel no shame.

470
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,150
I haven't done anything harmful to father.

471
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,150
Great Khan. The man is here.

472
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,349
Bring him in.

473
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,069
Greetings to Great Khan from Wang Junkuo.

474
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,989
Explain to me what happened in Youzhou.

475
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,988
Wang Junkuo.

476
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:36,989
Have you seen Ashile Sun in Youzhou?

477
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,469
Great Khan.

478
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,188
I don't have those things.

479
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:52,348
I gave the key to Young Khan.

480
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:56,579
Everything was done by Young Khan himself.

481
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,948
As for the loss of treasury, I think...

482
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:01,588
only Young Khan knows what happened.

483
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:03,429
Wang Junkuo.

484
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,149
What are you talking about?

485
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:10,429
Explain first what you have seen about Ashile Sun in Youzhou.

486
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,988
Please. Great Khan. It's true.

487
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,988
I want to work for you sincerely.

488
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,429
How would I dare occupy the treasury myself?

489
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,348
About those things... Young Khan must have them.

490
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,948
He has been following Tegin Sun.

491
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:22,630
I think he must want something from Sun.

492
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:35,389
Uncle Khan.

493
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,188
Ashile Sun, you conquered Shuozhou within ten days.

494
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,549
That was a great achievement.

495
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,429
You deserve a big award.

496
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,988
You can take half of the spoils of the war in Shuozhou.

497
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:47,989
Thank you, father.

498
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:55,188
Sun, you seem not to have enough people in your tent.

499
00:26:55,189 --> 00:26:59,789
When I'm back, I'll carefully select several bondwomen for you

500
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,708
and send them to your tent.

501
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:03,069
Thanks a lot, father.

502
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:09,068
Sher.

503
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,029
Uncle Khan.

504
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,389
That's quite a 'good job' this time.

505
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,789
Uncle Khan.

506
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,390
Uncle Khan, please allow me to explain.

507
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:46,869
I was so scared.

508
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,030
Well done.

509
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:54,099
How did you know about the treasury in Youzhou?

510
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,588
When Wang Junkuo heard that Young Khan

511
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:57,988
would say he secretly occupied the treasury in Youzhou,

512
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:59,309
he got panic instantly.

513
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,429
Then he didn't remember to slander Tegin Sun.

514
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,789
Actually Sher didn't occupy the treasury.

515
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,868
But Wang Junkuo knew nothing.

516
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:09,068
He had nothing, so he cherished his life very much.

517
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:11,988
He was afraid that Great Khan would think he stole the treasury,

518
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:13,909
that's why he said Sher did that.

519
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,188
Actually I just wanted to gamble.

520
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:19,868
I didn't expect that was quite a success.

521
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:23,979
It must be because Tegin is lucky, so we could win the bet.

522
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,749
Thanks to God of Sirius.

523
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,909
Military counselor. You're marvelous.

524
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,868
You saved not only Tegin, but also the whole Eagle Division.

525
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:32,630
I really admire you.

526
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,270
From now on, we're friends.

527
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:00,749
I knew you're here.

528
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,868
Every time when Great Khan did something to you due to Sher,

529
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,230
you'd stay here and say nothing.

530
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,350
What happened today,

531
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,788
wasn't solved by you, right?

532
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:16,470
What? You don't think I can do that?

533
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:20,988
Fine.

534
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:23,469
It was Li Shisi. He solved it.

535
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,628
He can think of different ideas and is good at using people's mind.

536
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:28,429
I don't know where he got the information

537
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,429
that the taboo here is secretly holding spoils.

538
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,749
That's why he could entrap Sher.

539
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,908
Thanks to my wisdom.

540
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:40,469
I told him everything about what you did in Shuozhou.

541
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,908
Otherwise he might not help you.

542
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:43,909
You...

543
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,509
Wait. What are you going?

544
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,950
Sun.

545
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,029
Roast lamb leg!

546
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,109
You asked Nuer to keep an eye on Li Shisi.

547
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,470
I think it's not gonna work.

548
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:04,389
What do you mean?

549
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,869
They live in the same tent.

550
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,589
And today they uncovered Sher's plot together.

551
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,069
Naturally their relationship would be better.

552
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,508
Look at Nuer.

553
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,669
He treats Li Shisi with food and wine.

554
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:19,189
Good wine.

555
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,268
You can really drink.

556
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:22,028
Mu Jin.

557
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,148
Arrange a single tent for Li Shisi.

558
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:24,868
OK.

559
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:26,189
I'll do it tomorrow.

560
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,190
Do it now.

561
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,429
Look at your eyes.

562
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,430
I want to arrange it tomorrow.

563
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,429
Never mind.

564
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,790
I don't care about your pettiness.

565
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,229
One more cup.

566
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,230
Cheers.

567
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,628
Really tasty.

568
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:51,748
Not bad, right?

569
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,109
Why are you here?

570
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,908
Newly roasted lamb leg. Wanna taste?

571
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:56,069
No.

572
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,390
Within only one day, you're already bribed by him.

573
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:02,909
Bribe?

574
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,949
Don't talk nonsense.

575
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,868
Well.

576
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,229
So you can't bear seeing me in harmony with your people?

577
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,430
It's not me that can't bear it, but someone else.

578
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:16,469
Pack up your things and follow me.

579
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,908
Where to?

580
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:22,148
Since you're the military counselor now, how can you live with Nuer?

581
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,868
Come.

582
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:24,669
I prepared a wide and good tent.

583
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,668
You must forget who you are,

584
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:55,710
getting drunk in such a little county government.

585
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,748
Isn't it humiliating?

586
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,508
I know.

587
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:01,669
You despise me.

588
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:06,748
You think I'm just an indecisive exalted man.

589
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:08,149
Without my father,

590
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,989
in your eyes, I might be even less than a magistrate.

591
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:16,029
Right?

592
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,070
I'm asking you. Yes or no?

593
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,070
You're drunk.

594
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:28,748
Let me tell you one more thing.

595
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:31,589
Actually Changge despises me as well.

596
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,629
Otherwise,

597
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:38,149
in all these years, can't she understand my feelings for her?

598
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,469
You're still thinking about Li Changge.

599
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,589
I thought you're worrying about Noble Princess.

600
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,989
I am worried.

601
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,868
I'm worried. I'm afraid.

602
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,789
I feel guilty for that.

603
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:53,909
Leyan is lost.

604
00:32:55,149 --> 00:32:56,909
We haven't found her until now.

605
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,109
Changge is dead.

606
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,509
I didn't see her before she died.

607
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:06,430
I even despise myself.

608
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,788
Come. Sit here.

609
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:12,909
Drink with me.

610
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,470
So you don't wanna drink.

611
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,988
You always look so indifferent about everything.

612
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:24,748
Isn't it boring?

613
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:25,950
Have you been drunk before?

614
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,749
Have you felt heart-broken before?

615
00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:33,709
Hao Du.

616
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,909
I feel sorry for you.

617
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:42,830
You're like a doll, a doll of... your adoptive father.

618
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,908
Wei Shuyu, if you dare talk any rubbish again, you won't be fine.

619
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:54,909
Hit me.

620
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,749
I wish you can beat me to death.

621
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:06,430
If I can't find Leyan, I feel ashamed to return to Changan,

622
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:12,190
and even more ashamed to meet my father.

623
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,330
[County Government in Yunzhou]

624
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,228
Mr. Wei. Good morning.

625
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,309
Have you found Noble Princess?

626
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,508
Not yet. But... Commander Hao has left.

627
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:06,829
What?

628
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,428
- He left?
- Right.

629
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:10,389
He said it's a waste of time to search together.

630
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,428
Better separately.

631
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:13,028
He left early in the morning.

632
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:14,748
Where did he go?

633
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:17,949
About that... I don't know.

634
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,829
Mr. Wei.

635
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,830
Mr. Wei!

636
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,229
Where are you going?

637
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,229
To look for Noble Princess, of course.

638
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,110
That's...

639
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,590
Greetings to your Majesty.

640
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:15,229
Wei. Get up.

641
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,389
We've known each other for long.

642
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,748
No need for that.

643
00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:23,509
I dare not accept that kindness.

644
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:28,988
I need your assistance.

645
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:34,070
Your Majesty, I'll do whatever I can.

646
00:36:35,949 --> 00:36:36,949
Come.

647
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:58,669
Your Majesty, I've already known what happened in Jingzhou.

648
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,188
Luo Yi has been good friends with Jiancheng.

649
00:37:01,189 --> 00:37:03,028
The Tianjie Army he leads

650
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:07,150
has indeed contributed a lot to Tang all these years.

651
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:10,189
I knew that.

652
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:14,869
Wei, you don't want the royal court

653
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,349
to punish these meritorious officials, but now...

654
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,268
Your Majesty misunderstood me.

655
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:22,988
I'm not a stupid man caring only about personal feelings

656
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:25,389
but unaware of loyalty.

657
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,709
No. I just think

658
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,670
that you wouldn't want to see me

659
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,708
being ruthless to Luo Yi.

660
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,988
Quite the contrary.

661
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,788
After your Majesty was enthroned, everyone has been pardoned.

662
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:41,708
But Luo Yi ignored your Majesty's kindness and wanted to revolt.

663
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:46,228
Jingzhou is a key place to defend Ashile Tribe.

664
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:49,309
If your Majesty doesn't make a quick move

665
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,948
and eliminate Luo Yi and his Tianjie Army,

666
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:56,708
I'm afraid the turmoil happened in the late Sui Dynasty

667
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,830
would start again.

668
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:03,149
Besides, I've got some news

669
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,188
that the traitor Wang Junkuo flew to Ashile Tribe.

670
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:09,789
But he was killed by Ashile people for some reason.

671
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:14,709
Your Majesty can't hesitate now.

672
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:18,830
Wang Junkuo.

673
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,829
He was asking for an insult.

674
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,428
No one would feel sorry for his death.

675
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:28,110
After talking with you, I feel relieved now.

676
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:32,629
But... if Tianjie Army got defeated,

677
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,268
Ashile Tribe would definitely swoop in.

678
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:40,468
Could Tang be safe if your Majesty doesn't deal with Jingzhou?

679
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:45,670
Would Ashile Tribe stop attacking Tang if it's fine with Jingzhou?

680
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,389
Your Majesty, whether showing weakness or toughness

681
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:56,670
wouldn't let Ashile give up coveting Tang's territory.

682
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,150
I understand.

683
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:04,219
I'll ask General Yuchi to meet me now.

684
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,629
Please be assured, your Majesty.

685
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:11,749
Whatever it is, we'd stand behind your Majesty.

686
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,188
By the way, Mr. Wei Junior has been looking for Yan for days.

687
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:22,829
I think he must have suffered a lot.

688
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,589
I'll arrange more people to search for her.

689
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,948
Let him come back now.

690
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,988
I have another arrangement for him.

691
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:32,549
I also haven't heard from him for days.

692
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,220
I think he must feel embarrassed for not having found Noble Princess.

693
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,788
You were too strict with Shuyu.

694
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:46,988
Shuyu focuses only on searching for Yan,

695
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:50,309
which must be harmful to his health both mentally and physically.

696
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,988
Fang still needs a Supervisory Censor.

697
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:55,349
I've thought about it.

698
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,349
Shuyu is perfect for that.

699
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,909
Your Majesty. He's not proper to do it.

700
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,829
Shuyu often makes big mistakes.

701
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,870
It's already decided.

702
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,549
Your Majesty.

703
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,670
Thanks to your Majesty on behalf of Shuyu.

704
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:24,549
Li Leyan.

705
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,228
Do you have too much free time?

706
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:27,229
What are you doing?

707
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,028
I'm just doing it for fun.

708
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,629
You even have the time to do that?

709
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,110
Why didn't you put more strength in working?

710
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:38,468
I'll learn how to do it soon.

711
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,549
Just give me some more time.

712
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,748
When I was in the Palace, I didn't take charge of such things.

713
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:45,589
Palace?

714
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,589
Really? Palace?

715
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,309
She dreams of being a princess again.

716
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,509
Dear 'Princess', in the Palace, are they using gold shuttles to weave?

717
00:40:57,189 --> 00:41:00,309
Miss, did your head get hit?

718
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,228
Or were you seriously ill?

719
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:03,829
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

720
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,708
Does she need to see a doctor?

721
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:08,829
We should ask Ms. Chai not to beat her head.

722
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,949
She's already so dumb.

723
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,428
I'll hand these bondwomen to you now.

724
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:23,389
As for the rest part, you should take care of it.

725
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,708
What's going on?

726
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:29,468
Bondwomen from Khan's Tent.

727
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:31,150
It's said to be the award for Tegin.

728
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:36,268
Tegin never keeps bondwoman in his tent.

729
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:37,269
Take them away.

730
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:43,708
How Great Khan treats Tegin is like giving sweets after slapping you.

731
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,268
That's a pity.

732
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,268
You can't tell if those are poisonous or not.

733
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:51,089
Things from Khan have always been difficult to deal with.

734
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,149
Keep an eye on them.

735
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,069
Don't let them wander.

736
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,070
Okay.

737
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,830
Mother.

738
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,590
Please turn back and look at me.

739
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:23,229
Mother.

740
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,910
Please turn back... Please... Turn back and look at me.

741
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,508
Let me go!

742
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,788
Come.

743
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:35,949
Let go!

744
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,349
Let go of me!

745
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,708
Don't hide from us, beauty.

746
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,428
Drink with us two.

747
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:43,429
- Come.
- Let me go!

748
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:46,589
Good.

749
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,590
Stop.
