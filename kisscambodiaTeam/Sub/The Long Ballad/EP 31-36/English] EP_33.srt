archers are all here and waiting for your order.

26
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,999
As for that, I can do it.

We're specialized in different aspects.

30
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,398
Mr. Du, about what you're not good at,

31
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,600
please let me do it.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,599
What are you staring at me, Mr. Du?

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,478
I've been in your place many times to ask for you help,

34
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,279
but I even couldn't meet you.

35
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,319
However, what happened in Liuyun Taoist Temple

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,838
could bring you here.

37
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,519
I found a good apprentice,

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,038
but I haven't got a chance to teach.

39
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,079
If he dies there,

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,360
that would be a huge loss to me.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Today,

42
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,119
you two can die together with me.

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,758
That's worthwhile to me.

44
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,118

45
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,039
how dare you betray Khan and secretly help her?

Big circle defeats small one.

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
It's him.

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720

Don't let her get away.

Ashile Sun,

63
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,879
Don't you think you let down Great Khan

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,440
who brought you up since so many years?

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
No, he didn't let Khan down.

66
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,920
He's also helping Ashile Tribe.

67
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,071
It's not easy that the tension

68
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,672
between Tang and Ashile Tribe got eased.

69
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,959
But you're stirring up again.

70
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,440
Do you really think the lives of soldiers on both sides are nothing?

71
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,160
The achievement of a general cost many lives.

72
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm doing a great thing.

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,959
I can't care about all the minor details.

74
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,839
If you move aside now,

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,679
I can still hide it from Great Khan for you.

76
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,759
Otherwise,

77
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,200
your Eagle Division and you

78
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,463
will definitely get punished by heaven.

79
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:24,464
Shut up!

80
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,839
Ashile Sun,

81
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,160
are you really gonna help Du Ruhui's side?

82
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,279
Are you really gonna betray Ashile Tribe?

83
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,399
Stop talking nonsense.

84
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm only saving a person I care about.

85
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,160
I didn't betray Ashile Tribe.

86
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,720
Contrarily, looking at what you did,

87
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,199
you're trying to get Ashile Tribe and Tang in a war.

88
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,519
And that is putting our Tribe in misery.

89
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,079
Do you think you can hide what you did from Great Khan?

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,079
Ashile Sun,

91
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:12,880
Tang's soldiers won't let you go.

92

93
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,639
Take her away.

94
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Yes.

95

We haven't done head counting.

96
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,239
No need to be scared now, Princess.

97
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,519
Where's he?

98
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,798
Who?

99
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,798
The one who cooperated with me, of course.

100
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:29,559
It was me that cooperated with you just now.

101
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,159
Well.

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Don't you believe?

103
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,320
Do you two know each other?

104
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:38,798
We've mentally known each other for long.

105
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:39,959
Right, Li?

106
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,999
Yes. We've mentally known for long.

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,078
About such kind of fate,

108
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,799
you won't understand, Mr. Du.

There's no one in the backyard.

112
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,199
It's always been only Master and me here.

113
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,119
Who are you looking for, Minister Du?

114
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Never mind.

115
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,759
I'm sorry for what I did before.

116
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,320
Please forgive me, Master.

117
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,079
To save you,

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,280
she almost died.

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,280
You should also take care.

120
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,400
Don't get too obsessed.

121
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,079
Master, you should have a good rest since you're injured.

122
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,358
As for the chores here,

123
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll send people to handle.

124
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,400
Thanks for your kindness, Minister Du.

125
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,199
Please wait a second, Mr. Du.

126
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,798
Your behavior now

127
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,599
is getting more and more confusing.

128
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,320
Who are you exactly looking for?

129
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,799
And you just let that person go like that.

130
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,789
I'm working for the imperial court.

131
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,879
It has nothing to do with you.

132
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,639
However, about your odd behaviors,

133
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,639
I can't understand.

134
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,639
Fine.

135
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,319
I just helped you eliminate the enemies.

136
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,478
And now you're so mean.

137
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,798
You're only an ordinary person now.

138
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,320
Surely you're not qualified to question that,

139
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,918
unless you can become an officer again

140
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,280
and work for the imperial court.

141
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,320
You're prodding me again.

142
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,439
Well. It's fine that you don't tell me.

143
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,839
I don't really care about it.

144
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,358
Anyway, the things about the imperial court

145
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,879
are too ambiguous and it's hard to make them clear.

146
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,047
You're the one who wanted to catch.

147
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,439
And now you just let that person go.

148
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,759
You can't even decide it yourself.

149
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,799
Stop talking nonsense.

150
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,440
How officious you are.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,199
Now what matters more is to find Crown Prince,

152
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,399
and the rest of our enemies here in the city.

153
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,879
They should know where Crown Prince is.

154
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,598
Father.

155
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,439
I'll let them lock the city gate

156
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,600
and search in the whole city.

157
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,599
Wait.

158
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,959
Though I'm only an ordinary person,

159
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,358
I can't help saying something.

160
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:47,158
You make it so obvious.

161
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,159
Don't you worry that you'll wake the rest enemies?

162
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
What do you mean?

163
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,038
Despair gives courage to a coward.

164
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,359
If they kidnapped Crown Prince,

165
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
what will happen?

166
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,519
You've created such a disturbance.

167
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,200
I think they won't stay here for long.

168
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,358
It won't be wrong that you guard the city gate.

169
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,999
There are so many people.

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,280
We can't check them one by one.

171
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,879
What's more, you've seen it.

172
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,158
They are all disguised as ordinary people and refugees.

173
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,159
How can you check them?

174
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,039
Mr. Du,

175
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,080
I have an idea free from waking the enemies.

176
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,558
Please tell us, Princess.

177
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,039
I can find the spies disguised as refugees.

178
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,599
But...

179
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,559
I need your token.

180
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,158
Line up!

181
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,639
Thanks.

182
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,639
- You all can have it. 
 - Thanks.

183
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Thank you.

184
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,558
Here.

185
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,799
Thank you.

186
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,279
It's provided by the officer.

187
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,199
Those who want to go out,

188
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,079
get the porridge before leaving.

189
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Next one.

190
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,280
- Thanks. 
 - Next one.

191
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,799
Thanks a lot.

192
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,319
Thank you.

193
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,919
Next one.

194
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,999
Thank you.

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Thanks.

196
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,559
Wait.

197
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,839
Next one.

199
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,119
Even if Changge is fine,

200
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,719
I won't forgive you.

201
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Line up, please.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,718
Next one.

203
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:50,840
Follow that father.

204
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Yes.

205
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Stop eating.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,759
Since we're out of the city,

207
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
you're useless.

208
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,919
Don't move!

209
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,558
Take him back.

210
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,559
Yes.

211
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Move!

212
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,238
How is it going?

213
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,239
I've arrested him.

214
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,718
You're wise, Princess.

215
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,239
You figured out such a brilliant idea.

216
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,559
For the people who're really starving,

217
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,479
such little dirt means nothing.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,119
Did you get hurt?

219
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm hungry.

220
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,960
I'll get you some food, OK?

221
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,358
I've sent people guarding around here.

222
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,880
Everything goes well as your plan.

223
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,640
It's not safe outside now.

224
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,320
Let me send you home.

225
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,639
Since the business has been settled,

226
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,280
Commander Hao doesn't need to do so.

227
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,519
Go.

228
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,240
Let this big brother get some food for you.

229
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,558
Mr. Wei.

230
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,759
How is it going?

231
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,959
When we counted the dead bodies,

232
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,358
it seemed that something went wrong.

233
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,959
But it also seemed... nothing went wrong.

234
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,319
Did anything go wrong or not exactly?

235
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,798
I heard that a soldier found a corpse moving.

236
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,558
Then Commander Hao checked on his own.

237
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,279
When he went back,

238
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,760
he seriously criticized that soldier,

239
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,718
saying that he had giddiness.

240
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,589
But...

241
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,478
it didn't look like what Commander Hao would do.

242
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,439
He used to would rather wrong a thousand suspects

243
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,319
than let one go.

244
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,918
Commander Hao did everything carefully.

245
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,238
Stop your gossip.

246
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,239
I dare not do that.

247
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Get up.

248
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,558
It's over now.

249
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,399
Keep your mouth shut.

250
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,598
Don't ever mention it again.

251
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,399
Yes.

252
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
You can leave now.

253
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,239
Changge.

254
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,719
Good that you can escape safely.

255
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,880
Your companion is indeed capable.

256
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Open the door.

257
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Minister Du.

258
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,880
This evil woman...

259
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's OK.

260
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Yes.

261
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,520
It seems that you're in the mood, Lady.

262
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,679
I wonder if you'd like to talk with me.

263
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,599
You know,

264
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,919
I was in Luoyang once

265
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,110
with my grandfather when I was little.

266
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,440
And my favorite is the peonies here.

267
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,200
You can found them easily among various kinds of flowers.

268
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,160
At that time, I was thinking

269
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,560
that I also want to be like a peony.

270
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,479
I want to be the outstanding one

271
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,280
among a group of people.

272
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,319
Your wish has come true.

273
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,438
Now everyone in Luoyang knows that

274
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,679
an evil woman ruined Liuyun Taoist Temple

275
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,239
and cruelly killed people.

276
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,359
Tell me,

277
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,920
who are you?

278
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,359
What do you want?

279
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,520
I forgot to introduce myself.

280
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,439
I'm from Family Yang in Hongnong.

281
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,359
Lord Jingwu, Yang Su, is my grandfather.

282
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,519
So you're the leftover villains of Sui.

283
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,920
And you still have evil intentions.

284
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,280
Sui will control Central Plains again one day.

285
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,958
Your Sui is fatuous and cruel.

286
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,399
It's already gone.

287
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,559
You can stop working in vain.

288
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,479
Whether it's gone already,

289
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,838
you can wait and see, Minister Du.

290
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,598
You still have other companions?

291
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,880
Or...

292
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:33,239
you're just following someone's order?

293
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,520
Since it's a game,

294
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:41,399
it won't be interesting if I tell you.

295
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,159
Your companions in this city have all been eliminated.

296
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,399
You'd better give in.

297
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,879
If you tell us everything,

298
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,598
you can make amends for your faults.

299
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,160
Then I can still keep you alive.

300
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,000
If I was afraid of death,

301
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,680
I wouldn't have come here.

302
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Good.

303
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,078
Then I'll lock you here

304
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,800
and you'd wish you were dead.

305
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,860
[Dapu Inn]

306
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Don't move.

307
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,199
You finally wake up.

308
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,199
How do you feel?

309
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,719
Much better.

310
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,599
Where are we?

311
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,999
You're in the inn we live in.

312
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,639
Don't worry.

313
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
It's very safe here.

314
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,800
The man who ran after us

315
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,160
let us go deliberately.

316
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,479
If Commander Hao insisted arresting me,

317
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,880
we couldn't have run away whatever we did.

318
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,760
Will he continue going after you?

319
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,479
It doesn't matter.

320
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,079
Medicine is ready.

321
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:43,379
Taoist Sun gave the prescription.

322
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,500
Take it before it gets cold.

323
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,639
Changge is injured,

324
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,840
so it might not be convenient.

325
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
I can do it.

326
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,839
The medicine was just...

327
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,199
just boiled.

328
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I can take it myself.

329
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Are you OK?

330
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,879
Are you good?

331
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Yeah, I'm fine.

332
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,598
Let me do it.

333
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,599
Just leave us here.

334
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,039
Shiba.

335
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,215
You often hurt people unintentionally.

336
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:15,879
Let's leave here.

337
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Let him deal with it.

338
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,319
- I can do it myself. 
 - Don't move.

339
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Anything funny?

340
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,590
Take the medicine.

341
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
That's horrible.

342
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,199
Little by little, when can I finish it?

343
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,920
Slowly. Easy.

344
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
So bitter.

345
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,199
Looking at you,

346
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,799
it's still not bitter enough.

347
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,359
Your word is not a comfort at all.

348
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,360
What kind of comfort do you want?

349
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Sun.

350
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,198
Have we forgotten anything?

351
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,199
What's wrong?

352
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,720
- Li Chengqian. 
 - Li Chengqian.

353
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,719
Where's exactly my little brother?

354
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
That's worrisome.

355
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,439
God bless the good man.

356
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,160
His Highness will be fine.

357
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,119
Princess. Mr. Wei.

358
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,718
Someone sent a letter.

359
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,719
Give it to me.

360
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,100
[Open it immediately]

361
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,879
Tell Minister Du, that I took the letter.

362
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Yes.

363
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,280
That's Changge's handwriting.

364
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,700
[Crown Prince is in Sumo Hall of Dongshi.]

365
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,839
Sumo Hall of Eastern Market.

366
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,950
Let's go to find my brother.

367
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:16,719
Wait.

368
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,438
Luoyang is in turmoil now.

369
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,198
It might be a trap.

370
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,799
I can't ignore your safety.

371
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,239
But... Ask Hao Du to come with us.

372
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,599
When did you begin trusting Hao Du so much?

373
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,560
At least you'll be safer.

374
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,680
I can yield,

375
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,920
but I can't put you in danger.

376
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520

Li Changge.

381
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,399
How dare she lock me at such kind of place?

383
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,079
Let me check.

What happened?

Hao Du!

Take people to shut up this place!

Are you deaf?

Your Highness,

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,159
since you're fine,

393
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,560
let's not attract the attention.

394
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,759
No way!

395
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,238
I have to revenge.

396
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,478
Now! Immediately!

397
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,959
Shut it up!

Please go back with Princess at first, your Highness.

Good.

415

She stopped me from having fun

416
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,640
and kept me in such kind a place.

417
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,880
I'll tell Minister Du

418

and let him arrest the bitch Li Changge!

00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,198
Changge was right.

Why are you yelling?

Traveling merchants were here.

538

I wanted to take you to pick some good things,

539

but you were not there.

540
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,680
So I went there myself.

00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,680

542
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,439

Are you blaming me for going there alone without you?

No.

549
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,799
I was afraid if I went there late,

550
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,639
Su Yishe and others would snatch them all.

551
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,840
I said that I don't blame you.

00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Go.

00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,799
Well.

565
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
Don't you like here?

566
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,599
Yes, I do like it very much.

567
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:35,439
By the way,

568
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,599
you said that you had something for me.

569
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,279
What's this?

570
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,400
Open it and have a look.

571
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,999
It's a candy.

572
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,469
Where did you get it?

573
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,078
I traded it with traveling merchants.

574
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,079
Do you like it?

575
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Have a taste.

576
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
That's so sweet.

577
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:19,679
Why do you stop eating?

578
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,078
It's quite a good stuff. How can I eat it?

579
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,718
I should keep it as a treasure.

580
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:24,959
It's enough only by licking it.

581
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Mu Jin.

582
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Thank you.

583
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,958
No need to say thanks.

584
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,399
As long as you like it,

585
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,199
I'll always buy it for you from now on.

586
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Mimi.

587
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
I love you.

588
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:07,640
Do you know why I brought you here?

589
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,280
Because I heard that

590
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,199
as long as I come here with the one I love,

591
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,320
we'll be together forever.

592
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,360
I want to be with you forever.

593
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,958
What are you talking about?

594
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,520
I mean it.

595
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,479
I really like you very much.

596
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Mu Jin.

597
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:36,959
You're a good man.

598
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,800
I don't deserve you.

599
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,440
You don't need to belittle yourself.

600
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,719
It's me that don't deserve you.

601
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,360
I'm sorry.

602
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:54,040
Sister. It hurts.

603
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,958
I'm sorry.

604
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,320
I made you hurt.

605
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:15,879
Master ordered you to keep me here.

606
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:21,399
Mu Jin.

607
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,080
I really don't deserve your love.

608
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,319
Hurry.

609
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
Come.

610
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,399
Follow us.

611
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Come.

612
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,360
Quickly. Come.

613
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,159
Wait for me.

614
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,600
I always have the feeling

615
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,760
that Sun has been away for long.

616
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,879
When Sun was still little,

617
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,199
though he was afraid of me,

618
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,800
he always begged me to teach him the martial arts.

619
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
But now...

620
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,800
Great Khan doesn't feel well these days.

621
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,669
Please don't drink too much wine.

622
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,750
Who asked you to come here?

623
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,159
Leave here.

624
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,959
Please remember to have your medicine, Great Khan.

625
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:08,438
I haven't been in Eagle Division for long.

626
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:11,959
And I also haven't seen Sun for a long time.

627
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,560
If I knew what would be like today,

628
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,719
we two shouldn't have doubted each other.

629
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,360
If he'd like to come back now,

630
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:30,040
I'll definitely award him greatly.

631
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:53,800
♫ The wicker is broken and the flowers fly away.

632
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:03,879
♫ I ask the passengers whether he'll come home.

633
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,199
♫ I ask the passengers whether he'll come home.

634
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,159
Jinse.

635
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,399
Princess.

636
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,760
Well done.

637
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,080
I want you exactly to torture me in front of Yanli.

638
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,398
When you humiliate me more,

639
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:24,560
people here would all feel more sorry for me.

640
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,479
When everyone here doesn't think I'm dangerous,

641
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,679
it would be the best time for me to take an action.

642
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,398
Do you understand?

643
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,399
Yes.

644
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,679
Stand up.

645
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Princess.

646
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,079
I'm sorry that you suffered.

647
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,199
That's not a big deal.

648
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,439
You're my capable assistant.

649
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,000
Don't let me down.

650
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Princess.

651
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,600
I'll do whatever I can,

652
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,000
even if I might die for that.

653
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
It's...

654
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,239
me that's not capable.

655
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,760
I'm so incapable.

656
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:41,719
Princess.

657
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,439
Has that child arrived at Eagle Division?

658
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:12,158
Yes, Princess.

659
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,159
He's arrived.

660
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,678
But...

661
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,919
I underestimated Yanli's feelings towards Ashile Sun.

662
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,320
I didn't expect that he still cares about his son.

663
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,198
When I encouraged Li Changge to save Luo Yi,

664
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,000
and asked Alir to help her,

665
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:30,320
I was trying to find a chance to kill Ashile Sun.

666
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,079
But Sher was too softhearted.

667
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,999
He kept this bane alive.

668
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,438
You took a risky move, Princess.

669
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,478
Thankfully Alir is dead and can't prove anything.

670
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:41,559
Otherwise...

671
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,600
Otherwise what?

672
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,918
Luo Yi betrayed Sui.

673
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:46,279
Of course I'd have an excuse

674
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,800
to get myself free from being doubted.

675
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,800
By the way, is there any news from Luoyang?

676
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:52,439
No.

677
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,079
No news.

678
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,919
I'm afraid that would be the worst news.

679
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,719
Jinse probably didn't finish her task.

680
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,638
We should move faster.

681
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:02,238
While Ashile Sun isn't back,

682
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,879
begin whatever we can.

683
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,440
Please be assured, Princess.

684
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,359
For these two months,

685
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,519
I have been arranging our men around Yanli

686
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
according to your order.

687
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,199
He won't be Great Khan for long.

688
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,009
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

689
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,489

690
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,400

The Long Ballad
