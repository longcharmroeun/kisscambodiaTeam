 - Under orders to cheat me.

I used to fear you for your cold-bloodedness,

38
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,669

Isn't enough for her

54
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,580

You first.

188
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Li Changge,

189
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,060
I don't want us to be quits.

190
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,740
Take back what you said.

191
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,500
Now both of us are alive.

192
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,860
We can't be quits.

193
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,620
How can I take back what I said?

194
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,939
It's a deal between the two of us.

195
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,500
I've never agreed to be quits,

196
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,380
so what you said doesn't count.

197
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,939
Why're you so shameless?

198
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,010
You're unreasonable.

199
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,260
Whatever.

200
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
All in all,

201
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,890
I remember what you owe me,

202
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,740
and will never forget it.

203
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,090
So... we can't be quits.

204
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Okay,

205
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,530
I promise you.

206
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,820
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

207
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,130
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

208
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,530
Then can you let go of me?

209
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,299
Where're you going?

210
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,419
Liuyun Taoist Temple.

211
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,939
To say goodbye to Master.

212
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,419
With plenty of things to do,

213
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,769
I can't leave until I finish what should be done

214
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,770
and the handover.

215
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,349
I'll accompany you.

216
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,449
It's inconvenient for you

217
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,039
to go to a Taoist temple for nuns.

218
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,980
I just wanna say goodbye, and come back soon.

219
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,009
Let me accompany you to the gate.

220
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,010
I won't get in.

221
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,620
Since when have you become a hanger-on?

222
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,979
♫Who can say that one has never been shy♫

223
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,260
♫or missed anything for a while on the way?♫

224
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,899
♫Looking at the color of the blue sky♫

225
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:24,459
♫Dyeing your eyebrows corner, I'm dazzled♫

226
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,625
I don't want to lose you again.

227
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,929
That feeling.

228
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,210
♫My hair is a mess♫

229
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,024
♫A twinkle in your eyes♫

230
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,930
♫That's the warmness♫

231
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,010
At dusk,

232
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,960
I'll pick you up at the gate.

233
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,980
I'm not a three-year-old kid.

234
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,269
♫I wish you were a lasting song for me♫

235
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,500
Remember, I'll pick you up.

236
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,330
Okay.

237
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,019
♫So I'll hold your hands♫

238
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,179
♫All unknown lights♫

239
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,580
♫Light up the boundless blue sky♫

240
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,019
Master,

241
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,540
- I saw at the gate...
- Take your time.

242
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,409
I saw a group of people.

243
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,689
I didn't know what they are coming for.

244
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,169
It seems they didn't come for a doctor.

245
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,620
It's Minister Du...

246
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,170
Is A'Li back?

247
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,930
It seems A'Li has no chance to be here at our temple again.

248
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,049
Anyway.

249
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,860
I hope she has gone away long ago,

250
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,139
and won't bite the hook here.

251
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,500
What does it have to do with A'Li?

252
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,170
Excuse myself.

253
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,210
Taoist Master blesses you.

254
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,779
Minister Du,

255
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,449
have you fully recovered?

256
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,689
Thanks for your concern.

257
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,929
It's not easy for me to recover.

258
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,899
Today I come to

259
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,540
bother Taoist Sun with a check of my body.

260
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,139
Unfortunately, he went out

261
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,019
with Situ Langlang to see patients at dawn.

262
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,570
I don't know when they'll come back.

263
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,740
So Taoist Jingdan, can you give me a check?

264
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,930
It's my duty as a doctor.

265
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,810
- Minister Du, please. 
 - Please.

266
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,170
- Await me outside. 
 - Yes.

267
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,410
- Minister Du, please. 
 - Please.

268
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,660
- Your pulse condition... 
 - What?

269
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,690
It seems hard and tight with Qi depression.

270
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,539
You might have been furious and worried a lot

271
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,409
these days.

272
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,049
How can I not be worried about natural and man-made

273
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,449
calamities in Luoyang?

274
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,169
There're natural calamities indeed,

275
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,689
but man-made ones...

276
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,739
Have you heard of

277
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,050
the fire accident in Ziwei Palace?

278
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,169
Yes, I've.

279
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,739
The Palace caught fire and Crown Prince was missing.

280
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,810
You know how serious it is?

281
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,259
You mean it's related to

282
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,290
our Liuyun Taoist Temple?

283
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,570
You know it clearly.

284
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,539
Liuyun Taoist Temple's alienated from

285
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,499
the secular world and royal court,

286
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,379
only engaging in helping others.

287
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,900
Minister Du, you'd better have evidence.

288
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,329
Don't move.

289
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,330
Stop.

290
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,379
Behave yourself.

291
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,049
Don't move.

292
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,050
Evidence?

293
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,499
Minister Du's right.

294
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,900
The arsonist is here indeed.

295
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
Behave yourself.

296
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,450
- You're... 
 - Aren't you looking for me?

297
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:55,930
[Liuyun Taoist Temple]

298
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,540
Why is it so quiet today?

299
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,540
Brother Li, did you get it right?

300
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,380
I don't remember

301
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,660
you placed these two pieces.

302
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,540
You really leave no loopholes for me.

303
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,500
You're so cunning.

304
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,329
If we don't play fair,

305
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,570
I don't know when can we finish the game.

306
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,380
I'm playing chess.

307
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,050
Don't distract me.

308
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
Then...

309
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,740
Be careful.

310
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,689
You're like a spent arrow.

311
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,020
Don't struggle anymore.

312
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:08,620
You seem upright but crafty indeed.

313
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,570
But it's too early for you to be so excited.

314
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,570
It's unknown who'll win at last.

315
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,579
Don't move.

316
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,580
Behave yourself.

317
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,170
Don't move.

318
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,980
You'd better not fight with us,

319
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,050
or these pathetic beggars will kick the bucket.

320
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,500
Did you set the fire in the Ziwei Palace?

321
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,739
Who're you?

322
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,210
You don't have to know.

323
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,139
In short,

324
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,329
I'm here to kill you.

325
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,619
Did you kidnap the Crown Prince?

326
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,980
He's dead.

327
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,659
She's lying.

328
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,860
What does she want?

329
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,740
How dare you murder Crown Prince?

330
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,809
I'm the enemy of your master.

331
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,090
If it's not him,

332
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,740
who shall I kill?

333
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,740
Do you work for Ashile Tribe?

334
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,330
Now Crown Prince's dead.

335
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,380
You failed to protect him.

336
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,780
How can you report it to Li Shimin?

337
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,779
You'd better kill yourself

338
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,740
with dignity than be thrown into prison.

339
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,410
Full of nonsense,

340
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,660
not enough to sway your mind.

341
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,810
Thank you.

342
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,090
If you succeeded in killing him,

343
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,859
you'd have spread the news

344
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,660
and caused chaos all over Luoyang.

345
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,140
How can you wait till today?

346
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,570
How can you a Taoist

347
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,140
be such a busybody?

348
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,379
Ms. Quan!

349
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:14,859
Ms. Quan!

350
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,169
Ms. Quan!

351
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,049
Ms. Quan, are you okay?

352
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,050
Ms. Quan!

353
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,980
Mind your own business,

354
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,450
or I'll stab her heart.

355
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,410
I'm the one you wanna kill.

356
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,450
Don't hurt innocent people.

357
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,739
Yeah.

358
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,170
You can't leave alive today.

359
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,499
It's known by all that

360
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,859
quick-witted Mr. Fang and Mr. Du

361
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,810
are Li Shimin's capable assistants.

362
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,090
It's not fruitless for me to kill one of them today.

363
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,450
You're brave enough,

364
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,860
but how do you feel now?

365
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,210
What about this?

366
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,449
You look handsome,

367
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,810
but can't move now.

368
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,569
What a pity!

369
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,500
Quickly, cut the crap.

370
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,659
If you ask for death,

371
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,690
I'll show my mercy, and satisfy you.

372
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,380
Wait!

373
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,139
This female slave looks quite familiar to me.

374
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,410
You're...

375
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,780
Sher's slave?

376
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,259
Lady Jinse, you get a good memory.

377
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,569
Why're you here?

378
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,780
I'm here to take revenge.

379
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,260
What revenge?

380
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,740
I've to take revenge on Du Ruhui.

381
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,260
Lady Jinse, what about leaving him to me?

382
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,690
Don't let his blood stain your clothes.

383
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,569
Unexpectedly,

384
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,980
I'm not the only one who is eager to kill Minister Du.

385
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,659
Did he make you be exiled to the grasslands?

386
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,049
Lady Jinse,

387
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,500
can you do me a favor?

388
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,090
Du Ruhui,

389
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,810
you can't die so easily.

390
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,740
Interesting.

391
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,739
Take aim.

392
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,450
Don't ruin my plan.

393
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,570
You cornered me in a dilemma for an evildoer.

394
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,689
Have you thought about today?

395
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,660
I've a clear conscience.

396
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,290
What a blood debt!

397
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,659
How dare you say so?

398
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,139
I don't know your relationship,

399
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,089
but I advise you not to assist another evildoer.

400
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,739
You're doomed. Cut the crap.

401
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,659
You deserve this!

402
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,859
A'Li,

403
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,169
think twice.

404
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,570
Don't make a great blunder.

405
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,929
If I don't kill Du Ruhui,

406
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,050
I can't feel at ease.

407
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,380
I thought you didn't split hairs,

408
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,139
but you're still unrepentant.

409
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,170
I'm wrong.

410
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,500
I aspire to save all,

411
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,779
but can't save you at last.

412
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,020
I don't need it.

413
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,449
Master, no more words.

414
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,450
Go ahead.

415
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,050
A'Li!

416
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,780
- A'Bi, take them away. 
 - Yes.

417
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,449
Why don't you cherish your life

418
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,809
after running away from grasslands?

419
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,979
In this case,

420
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,500
die with them!

421
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,739
I've just been out for hours,

422
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,300
but you're having such a fierce battle.

423
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,499
Thank you.

424
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,329
Never mind.

425
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,259
If Mr. Sun hadn't asked me to fetch medicine,

426
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,090
I'd not encounter such an interesting thing.

427
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,980
Master, hurry to help me.

428
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,340
Did I... Did I hear it right?

429
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,330
You called me Master.

430
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,290
Go.

431
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,210
It seems I've to rise to the occasion.

432
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,499
A'Li, take Minister Du and the others away.

433
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,140
Situ and I will cover you.

434
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,410
Hurry to go!

435
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,810
Minister Du.

436
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,690
Hurry.

437
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,380
Hurry.

438
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,410
Hurry.

439
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,330
Ms. Quan, take care. I'll open the gate.

440
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,050
Why can't I open it?

441
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,410
It can't be opened.

442
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,379
It's open. Let's go.

443
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,900
- Hurry. 
 - Go.

444
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,929
Li Changge!

445
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,380
Hurry.

446
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Hurry!

447
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,780
What do you want at all?

448
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,260
Don't flatter yourself.

449
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,020
The reason why I saved you

450
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,930
is that you're inseparable from the country.

451
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Take Minister Du away!

452
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,930
Minister Du, let's go.

453
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,139
Li Changge,

454
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
get out.

455
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,449
A'Bi, take care of them.

456
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,500
I'll save Master.

457
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,900
Minister, let's go.

458
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,140
Father,

459
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,090
I'm sorry.

460
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,089
Hao Du,

461
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,170
you've improved a lot.

462
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,410
Thanks, Father.

463
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:50,539
Remember, don't be conceited at any time.

464
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,499
You're obliged to guard Hongyi Palace,

465
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,259
and serve Prince Qin.

466
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,739
At the critical moment,

467
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,170
you even have to sacrifice your life.

468
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
Are you afraid?

469
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,449
No, I'm not.

470
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,620
I'll serve Prince Qin and Father forever.

471
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,379
Hurry.

472
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,659
Ms. Quan, take care.

473
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Come on.

474
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,570
Minister Du!

475
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,090
It's a signal from Father.

476
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,930
Go.

477
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,690
Go.

478
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
Go.

479
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,449
Bad news from Liuyun Taoist Temple, right?

480
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,129
I wanna go as well.

481
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,169
Now Liuyun Taoist Temple's situation is unknown.

482
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,369
For your safety, you'd better stay at home.

483
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,409
How can I?

484
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,170
I don't know whether Changge's in danger.

485
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,370
- Let me go with you. 
 - Okay.

486
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,979
Leyan,

487
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,170
- follow me closely. 
 - Okay.

488
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,099
I have a nice book.

489
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Wanna have a look?

490
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,130
No, thanks.

491
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,920
Just have a look.

492
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,090
[Warcraft of Lord Wei]

493
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,689
Brother Li, what do you mean?

494
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,209
Aren't you gonna leave?

495
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,579
It's a gift.

496
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,930
Don't forget me in the future.

497
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,370
It's not an ordinary thing.

498
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,299
Where did you get it?

499
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,299
Just family heritage.

500
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,500
It's Warcraft of Lord Wei...

501
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,890
Brother Li, are you...

502
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,129
Are you Li Jing, the Lord Wei?

503
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,450
Don't I look like him?

504
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,579
- Nice to meet... 
 - Sit down.

505
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,610
If you stand up, how can I talk to you?

506
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,650
Do you want, or dare you accept this book?

507
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,580
Why not?

508
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:55,929
Wait.

509
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,059
You must finish this game with me,

510
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,690
and then I'll give you this book.

511
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,849
Drums.

512
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,850
It's...

513
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,100
The sound of drums is a signal for assembling reinforcements

514
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,890
from the southwest.

515
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,209
It's at Liuyun Taoist Temple.

516
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,210
Liuyun Taoist Temple?

517
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,650
Changge!

518
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,019
It hasn't been finished yet.

519
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,299
I'll keep my words.

520
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,100
If you go now, you'll never get this book.

521
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
I have to go.

522
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,410
The book is so precious.

523
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,690
Thanks, Brother Li.

524
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,689
Thanks, General Li.

525
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,690
See you.

526
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,929
Listen,

527
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,299
if you go on like this,

528
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,849
I'll blow your brains out.

529
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,210
Hypocritical.

530
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,890
Go ahead.

531
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,550
Please spare me!

532
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,950
Please spare me!

533
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,450
Master!

534
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,129
Master.

535
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,609
Why're you back?

536
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,889
You don't have to.

537
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,650
All this happened because of me.

538
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,259
You shouldn't account for it.

539
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,929
Master, take her away.

540
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,930
I'm on it.

541
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,339
Master, sit.

542
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
Wait a second.

543
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,130
Today I won't let you make it.

544
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,210
Don't overestimate yourself.

545
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:47,930
Attack!

546
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
You're awake.

547
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,890
Minister, our men are gathering.

548
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,689
Minister Du, please hold on.

549
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,579
I've asked a man to find Taoist Sun.

550
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,889
You'll be okay.

551
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,890
I'm okay now.

552
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,019
What's going on inside?

553
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,340
Master, A'Li and Mr. Situ are all inside.

554
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,739
Don't worry.

555
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,890
Master and Mr. Situ are skilled in martial arts.

556
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,450
- Father. 
 - Hao Du.

557
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,930
Sorry I'm late.

558
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,169
Hurry to save Li Changge out.

559
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,299
Sneak in the back.

560
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,409
There are many skilled killers from Ashile Tribe inside.

561
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,849
Kill them all and spare no one.

562
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,850
Yes.

563
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Go.

564
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,610
Go.

565
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
- Minister. 
 - Mr. Du.

566
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,929
Princess, why're you here?

567
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,739
I... Wei Shuyu, take Princess back.

568
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,449
There are many skilled killers from Ashile Tribe inside.

569
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,339
It's dangerous.

570
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,340
But...

571
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,609
Where's A'Li?

572
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,339
In order to save us, she's injured,

573
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,780
and she is still inside.

574
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,100
Who the heck are you?

575
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,580
The one who will take your life.

576
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,340
Lady, kill her.

577
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,210
It's not the time.

578
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,130
Whoever you're,

579
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,210
I'll smash you to pieces when I'm out.

580
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,259
Ashile Sun, why're you here?

581
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,170
Jinse, it's you.

582
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,450
You are against me for a woman.

583
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,979
Do you forget your origin?

584
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,820
How dare you betray Khan for Tang Dynasty?

585
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,259
Kill him.

586
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,300
Kill them.

587
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,740
None shall survive.

588
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,130
Can you still move?

589
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,650
Yes, I can.

590
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,749
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

591
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,229
♫ gradually revives, ♫

592
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,140
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

593
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,700
♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫

594
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,030
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

595
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,509
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

596
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,940
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

597
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,940
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

598
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,829
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

599
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,659
♫ the longing flows. ♫

600
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,029
♫ There's always a moment ♫

601
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,420
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

602
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:27,269
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

603
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:33,989
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

604
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,379
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

605
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,659
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

606
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,229
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

607
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,590
♫ layer after layer. ♫

608
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,029
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

609
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:53,900
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

610
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,309
♫ There's always a moment ♫

611
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:07,939
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

612
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,549

♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

620
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,720
♫ It is sleepless. ♫
