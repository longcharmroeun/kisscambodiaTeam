00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,919
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,789

The Long Ballad Episode 31

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,119
Keep guard.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,518
Okay.

23
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,239
- Report me if anything's wrong. 
 - Yes, sir.

24
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,359
Who're you?

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,679
Who're those people?

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,719
How dare you!

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,238
People with no duty can't enter the Ziwei Palace.

28
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,239
So...

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,638
they are the people with duty?

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,639
You asked for it!

31
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,198
Say it!

32
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,999
Who're you?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,200
Why are you pretending to be the guard in Ziwei Palace?

34
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,278
There're so many men of sacrifice in Luoyang.

35
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,720
Since you're not afraid of death,

36
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,080
who're you working for?

37
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,439
Since you want to commit suicide,

38
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,079
it means you know

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,639
you'll suffer under our torture.

40
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,719
Think about it.

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,360
Just tell us who you're working for.

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,199
They've put out the fire.

43
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,879
It seems we don't need to be here anymore.

44
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,919
Take this guy away.

45
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,838
As for your old friend,

46
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:58,440
it's a bad choice to look for your friend now.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,038
Madam!

48
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,159
Bad news, madam!

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,959
Something's wrong!

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Madam!

51
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,079
Why're you so anxious?

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,118
Bad news, madam.

53
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,758
It's reported that there's something wrong in the Ziwei Palace.

54
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,679
I heard someone saw our master.

55
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,440
What happened in Ziwei Palace?

56
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,960
I heard there was a fire.

57
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,479
I shall leave now, madam.

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,640
[Luoyang Office]

59
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:48,879
Princess.

60
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,838
Father.

61
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:52,038
Someone poured kerosene outside the Ziwei Palace.

62
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm afraid someone did it on purpose.

63
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,960
Who wants to kill my brother?

64
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,800
Who is the last one to see his Highness?

65
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,999
You only need to tell us

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,599
the situation when you last saw his Highness.

67
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,599
As long as you can tell us clearly,

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,559
you'll atone your fault.

69
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,959
Princess.

70
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,278
Minister.

71
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,639
Although I didn't see his Highness,

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,518
I saw a group of people dressed like refugees break into his room.

73
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,599
Some assassins have broken into the Ziwei Palace?

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,559
Did you see their faces clearly?

75
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,959
Minister.

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,599
There was smoke everywhere.

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,039
And I stood far from them.

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
So I didn't see clearly.

79
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,958
Minister.

80
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,078
I saw a girl dressed like a Taoist nun.

81
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,720
She ran out of your Highness's room.

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm not familiar with her, so I remember her face.

83
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,879
Will she be the accomplice of those assassins?

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,558
Did you see the girl's face clearly?

85
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,958
She's pretty.

86
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,600
There's a nevus under her eye.

87
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,040
Will it be her?

88
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,519
God damn it.

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Minister Du!

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,798
Minister Du, listen to me.

91
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,799
Minster Du!

92
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,159
Father!

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,759
Father!

94
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,269
Minister!

95
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,179
Why are you still standing by?

96
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,798
Prepare a carriage to Liuyun Temple!

97
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,799
Yes, sir!

98
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,558
Now we haven't found my brother.

99
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,719
I hope nothing will happen to Changge.

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,838
I'll inform Changge.

101
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,199
No.

102
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,320
If you meet Hao Du, you...

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,319
Brother Shuyu.

104
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,558
I didn't mean that.

105
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,479
I mean, if you meet Hao Du and Du Ruhui,

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,999
they won't listen to you.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,439
You can stay here.

108
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,678
If they have a confrontation with Changge in Liuyun Temple,

109
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,078
they won't suspect you and you can continue to support her.

110
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,319
Okay.

111
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,838
I'll prepare food and a token to leave the city.

112
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,678
Be careful.

113
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay.

114
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,558
Help!

115
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,199
A'Li!

116
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,439
Ms. Quan, help!

117
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,199
A'Li, help!

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,599
Taoist!

119
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Taoist, help!

120
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,279
Be careful.

121
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,678
Help Minister Du get in.

122
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,759
Taoist Sun is in the room.

123
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Okay.

124
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,600
Catch her.

125
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,799
Sir!

127
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,179
If you want to see a doctor,

128
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,279
I'm afraid you head towards the wrong direction.

129
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,880
I heard Liuyun Temple harbors refugees and does good deeds.

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,159
Since I'm here now,

131
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,799
of course I need to walk around,

132
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,599
so that I'll praise your kindness in the future.

133
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Thank you.

134
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,559
But we have both external and internal beauty.

135
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:50,079
These good things mean nothing to us.

136
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
What?

137
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,839
It seems you don't want to just walk around.

138
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,358
You want to fight with me?

139
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,839
I have an important business.

140
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,040
Please do me a favor.

141
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll do you a favor.

142
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,799
Do you a favor, it means do myself a favor.

143
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,839
Now it's late at night,

144
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,359
I don't want to fight with you.

145
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,480
Please step aside.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've stepped aside,

147
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,559
Whether you can pass here,

148
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,960
it depends on whether you have the ability.

149
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,719
What?

150
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,880
You don't want to walk around now?

151
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,080
Where are you going?

152
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
You tried to stop me,

153
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,039
so I should behave well.

154
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,760
Or to say,

155
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,159
you want to stop me

156
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,239
after I leave Liuyun Temple?

157
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,640
Where did I get this apprentice from?

158
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,478
Someone in the martial world is looking for her,

159
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,959
while someone from the imperial court is also looking for her.

160
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,719
She's really somebody.

161
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,119
Princess?

162
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,919
Why are you here alone?

163
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,598
I worried about Minister Du,

164
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,118
so I came here to see him.

165
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,479
But I got lost somehow.

166
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,519
How's Minister Du now?

167
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,840
Take me to see him.

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,599
Did you see anyone suspicious?

169
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
Suspicious?

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No.

171
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,239
I'm here alone.

172
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Hao Du.

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,798
It's getting dark.

174
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,639
I'm a little afraid.

175
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,559
Let's go back now.

176
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,559
Okay.

177
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll send you to Liuyun Temple first.

178
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,159
This way, Princess.

179
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,879
Father.

180
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,319
Minister Du.

181
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Don't bother us.

182
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,759
You two,

183
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,799
check around to see if there's anyone suspicious.

184
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,919
Changge.

185
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,359
Leyan?

186
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,519
Why are you here?

187
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,279
Changge,

188
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,558
Minister Du found you have appeared in Ziwei Palace.

189
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,358
He doubted if you're related to this.

190
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,879
But now he has an acute disease and was sent to Liuyun Temple.

191
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,678
I'm afraid you'll meet, so I'm here to find you.

192
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,038
Leave here.

193
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,279
If I leave now,

194
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,879
I'll never have a chance to explain.

195
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,238
Where's the crown prince?

196
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:05,038
We haven't found him yet.

197
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,639
But you must be safe now.

198
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,558
Changge, if you're still alive,

199
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,320
I'm sure you have the chance to explain.

200
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,479
Someone is chasing you?

201
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
It's Hao Du.

202
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,759
I'll stop him.

203
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,358
Just leave.

204
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,199
What about you?

205
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,199
Relax.

206
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,840
Minister Du won't harm me.

207
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,919
Trust me.

208
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,719
Be careful.

209
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,678
Go.

210
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,679
Yes, sir.

211
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,719
You...

212
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,559
Why are you back?

213
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,559
How did you know it?

214
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,918
My Prentice.

215
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,839
I've settled many troubles for you.

216
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,439
But they're from the imperial court.

217
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,839
I don't want to piss them off.

218
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,159
So I can only wait here.

219
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,799
But if they go out of here,

220
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,000
I have no reason to stop them.

221
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Thanks.

222
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,119
Who are you?

223
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,520
How do you... Did Du Ruhui leave?

224
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,399
I think he's gone.

225
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,238
But I heard, because that guard didn't catch you,

226
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,079
he spitted out more blood.

227
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,799
Taoist Sun was so anxious that he almost fainted.

228
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,799
Prentice.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
What if those soldiers come to catch you again?

230
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,598
They won't.

231
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,359
They won't expect I'll come back again.

232
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:12,200
My Prentice is so interesting.

233
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,158
Be careful, madam.

234
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,678
I've settled him.

235
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,679
Here, be careful.

236
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,159
This way.

237
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,478
Have a seat.

238
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,799
Did he confess?

239
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,358
Yes, he did.

240
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,799
He is a soldier of Sui.

241
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,358
He canceled his registration.

242
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:48,799
He created a new identity and sneaked into Ziwei Palace.

243
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,678
Who did they work for?

244
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,439
And where did they take the crown prince to?

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,520
He is an abandoned soldier.

246
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,359
He didn't even know who his leader is.

247
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,479
But it must be related to Sui.

248
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,919
People of Sui?

249
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,400
You mean...

250
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,320
They work for Dingxiang.

251
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,239
Dingxiang.

252
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,359
Madam, you helped us a lot.

253
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,519
I really admire you.

254
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,598
Where's he?

255
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:23,679
Take me to see him.

256
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Mr. Qin.

257
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:29,839
We'd better not engage in the thing my madam settled.

258
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,118
We've been working all night.

259
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,919
What about having breakfast together?

260
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
This way.

261
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Father.

262
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,200
Taoist Sun said you need to have medicine according to time.

263
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,999
You're still thinking about Li Changge?

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,719
Li Changge didn't die.

265
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,799
I saw her with my own eyes.

266
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,999
I don't know whether it's good or not.

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,119
She is living in Liuyun Temple now.

268
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:34,598
If Master and Taoist Sun want to protect her,

269
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:37,158
we can't just take her away.

270
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:42,918
But we don't know whether Li Changge took the crown prince away.

271
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,159
What if...

272
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,719
In my opinion,

273
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,719
if Li Changge really took him away,

274
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,599
we don't need to worry about him now.

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,999
Even if we went through so many things,

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,279
Li Changge still remains a good relationship with Princess.

277
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,559
She won't harm the crown princess

278
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,399
and let Princess experience the same pain she had before.

279
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,440
You're right.

280
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,318
But we can't let Li Changge use him as the hostage.

281
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,118
We can't block the news that the crown prince disappeared for long.

282
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,520
We should catch Li Changge and find his Highness.

283
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,078
There're many people in Luoyang.

284
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,078
It's hard to catch Li Changge, and...

285
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:31,039
And Princess Yongan is trying to stop you and protect her.

286
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,119
Right?

287
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Princess.

288
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,078
Now his Highness is missing.

289
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,560
There'll be a chaos in Luoyang.

290
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,479
Please don't wander outside, Princess,

291
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,800
in case you disappear as well.

292
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,800
Don't worry.

293
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,639
Now my brother is missing.

294
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,399
I won't cause you any trouble.

295
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,358
Now the rumors have turned into reality.

296
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,319
No one knows what will happen.

297
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,119
I'll deploy forces now.

298
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,319
I can't take care of you.

299
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,719
Please don't seek troubles for yourself.

300
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,959
Didn't you ask all the guards to look for my brother?

301
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,040
Why do you still deploy forces?

302
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,400
Are you looking for someone,

303
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,880
or are you catching someone?

304
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,839
Hao Du.

305
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,839
The most important thing is to find my brother.

306
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,920
As for catching someone,

307
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,800
I think you can put it off.

308
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,120
How do you know the disappearance of his Highness is none of her business?

309
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,359
Someone did this on purpose in Luoyang.

310
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,358
Who will benefit most from this?

311
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,520
It must be those who want to cause troubles in Tang.

312
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,879
Okay.

313
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,079
Then let's be straightforward.

314
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,879
What are you doubting?

315
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,119
Li Changge is in Luoyang.

316
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,359
Yes.

317
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,520
Thank you for not lying to me.

318
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,598
My father saw her.

319
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,159
But I can prove she's innocent.

320
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,118
It is none of her business, because...

321
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,319
I don't care what she said and did in front of you.

322
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,560
It may be part of her plan.

323
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:00,760
So please stay here, Princess.

324
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,520
Don't get involved in it.

325
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,198
Young man.

326
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,280
What are you thinking?

327
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,159
I've made this move for a long time.

328
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
It's your turn now.

329
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,589
I thought you got message from that man,

330
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,950
and wanted to investigate the fire in Ziwei Palace with me.

331
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,760
What are you thinking?

332
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,589
I don't even know where you come from.

333
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,679
How could I investigate a serious matter with you?

334
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,560
Then why do you take me to play chess here?

335
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,239
This place is good.

336
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,839
It's bustling.

337
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,438
We need to be calm and focus when playing chess.

338
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,559
Only in busy places can we exercise ourselves.

339
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,680
I have something to do now.

340
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,160
Goodbye.

341
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,040
You've come home with me.

342
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,478
Now you want to leave?

343
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,519
I think it's not suitable.

344
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,159
Besides, by following me,

345
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,280
you just want to know my relationship with people in Ziwei Palace, right?

346
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,800
You want to look for your old friend, right?

347
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,799
Come back.

348
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,198
Have a game of chess.

349
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,399
As an old saying goes,

350
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,118
watching chess is like watching people.

351
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,118
After you've played chess with me,

352
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,880
I can nearly know your characteristic.

353
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,759
Maybe at that time,

354
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,839
I can do a serious business with you.

355
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,719
I don't know how to play chess.

356
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,238
You have much callus on your hands.

357
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,719
It means you have fought in wars for many years.

358
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,159
Playing chess is like leading a troop.

359
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,000
I've told you the rules.

360
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,999
Since you know how to battle,

361
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,520
you must know how to play chess.

362
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,358
Come on.

363
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,318
This doesn't count.

364
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,560
Let's start again.

365
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,039
Okay.

366
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,159
Princess, I'm still afraid.

367
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,358
Don't be afraid.

368
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,438
Just do as I said.

369
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,719
They daren't harm you.

370
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,039
If they want to break in,

371
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,478
just scold them.

372
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,559
You can say,

373
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,159
you've been worried and caught a cold.

374
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,838
Now you're sweaty and only wearing underwear.

375
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,039
They won't come in.

376
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,239
But do remember, cover your face.

377
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,999
Just keep pretending until I'm back.

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Understand?

379
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,160
Princess.

380
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,759
Ms. Quan.

381
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,519
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,438
Liuyun Temple is closed and won't receive guests today.

383
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,679
Ms. Quan.

384
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,519
Princess.

385
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,679
Chang...

386
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,039
Where's A'Li?

387
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,919
Why are you looking for A'Li?

388
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,639
I have a serious matter to talk with her.

389
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,760
Where's A'Li now?

390
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
A'Li... She's not in the temple now.

391
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:15,296
[Hao Du is deploying forces.]

392
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:19,240
[Meet me in the tea house.]

393
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,639
Ms. Quan.

394
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,999
If A'Li comes back,

395
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,318
please give this letter to her in person.

396
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,838
Tell her I'll wait for her until dawn.

397
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,839
Please.

398
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,319
Okay.

399
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,479
Leave.

400
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,199
Any news?

401
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,640
Just as you predicted,

402
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:59,680
Princess Yongan fell in the trap.

403
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,479
You don't need to look after me.

404
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,039
Just go.

405
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,280
Find the crown prince.

406
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,119
Yes, sir.

407
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,119
Playing chess is like leading a troop.

408
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,478
Among the generals I know,

409
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,760
only one person will deploy troops like this.

410
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,359
Governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng.

411
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,438
But it's a pity.

412
00:24:56,439 --> 00:25:01,160
I heard Gongsun Heng committed suicide to protect people in Shuozhou.

413
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,839
He's a real hero.

414
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,318
But I heard there's an able man working for him.

415
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,238
His surname is Qin.

416
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,239
He's still living.

417
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:14,838
What's your relationship with him, Mr. Qin?

418
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,839
You got involved in the chaos in Luoyang.

419
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,000
What do you want to do?

420
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,599
You've been dealing with me in the manner of Gongsun Heng.

421
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,479
But you won't expose the manner that you're familiar with.

422
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:35,919
So you have already lost.

423
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,439
I invite you to the trap, but I won't unmask you so soon.

424
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,238
I just want to see

425
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,640
to what extent you can deploy in Gongsun Heng's manner.

426
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,160
If you use your familiar manner,

427
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,160
maybe I can't defeat you.

428
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,239
However, you're not honest enough.

429
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,318
In record, I'm Senior Qin's nephew.

430
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,598
The truth is...

431
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,640
his partner.

432
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,719
At the seventh line outside,

433
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:04,399
you're hesitating whether you'll put a chessman.

434
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,318
It's because you're afraid you'll expose your manner.

435
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,999
But a general shouldn't hesitate.

436
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,479
People will see through you.

437
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,760
Actually, you want to put it here.

438
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,799
But it's the manner of the people on the prairie.

439
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,560
No, I'm from the Central Plains.

440
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Interesting.

441
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,598
A'Li.

442
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,999
The princess came here just now.

443
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,238
I said you weren't here.

444
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,760
So she left this.

445
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,319
Thank you, Ms. Quan.

446
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:48,632
[Hao Du is deploying forces. You need to leave. Meet me in the tea house.]

447
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,838
Ms. Quan.

448
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,318
I need to meet the princess.

449
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,198
Relax.

450
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,199
I'll be careful.

451
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,160
It doesn't matter who I am.

452
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,280
I came to Luoyang to find my old friend.

453
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,919
So, now can you tell me

454
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,879
the old friend from the noble family?

455
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
No, I can't.

456
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,439
It's not important.

457
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,039
The reason why I look for her,

458
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,040
it's not because of her identity.

459
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,639
People say you're afraid of your wife.

460
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,078
Actually, you regard your wife as your partner.

461
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,119
So you respect her.

462
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,999
If your wife is gone,

463
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,958
I guess you'll look for her no matter how difficult it will be.

464
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,040
Am I right?

465
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,680
I thought you are looking for a man.

466
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,118
But you're looking for a girl!

467
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,198
I like it.

468
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,078
Okay.

469
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:02,039
I'm willing to find your beloved one.

470
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,039
Beloved one?

471
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Isn't she?

472
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,359
I guess she must be very pretty.

473
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,119
And she is very adorable.

474
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,919
Yes.

475
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,519
See? I'm right.

476
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,318
You care about her very much,

477
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,159
and you don't want to leave her behind, right?

478
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,679
You don't like other girls.

479
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,598
If you're forced to stay with someone,

480
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,598
and you can't leave each other until you're dead,

481
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,239
do you hope this girl to be her?

482
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,160
Even if many beautiful girls in the world like you,

483
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,560
you still like this overbearing and bad-tempered girl.

484
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,838
She's not a girl.

485
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,438
Is she an old lady?

486
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,838
I really admire your taste.

487
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,760
She's a capable woman.

488
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,958
No matter who she is, in all,

489
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,560
she's your beloved one.

490
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,919
I won't play with you.

491
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,799
I've used up all my strategies of playing chess.

492
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,078
I won't play now.

493
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,079
Mr. Li.

494
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,720
You want to betray your words?

495
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:28,958
Don't say so.

496
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:29,959
It's not like that.

497
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,439
It's him?

498
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,799
Mr. Qin.

499
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,479
With your unclear identity,

500
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,198
I suggest you to stay away from these.

501
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:49,279
It's early now.

502
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,238
Come on, have a seat. Let's have another game.

503
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,039
Come on.

504
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,358
Mr. Li.

505
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,399
I have something urgent.

506
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
I'll visit you some day later.

507
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,559
I still want to play!

508
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,680
You're leaving suddenly?

509
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Brother Shuyu.

510
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,599
Did you get it?

511
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,358
It's in the bag.

512
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,519
But, Leyan,

513
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,679
it's strange.

514
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,159
How could things go so well?

515
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,598
According to Hao Du's habit,

516
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,800
he must have noticed it.

517
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,559
Well, take it and wait for me at the gate.

518
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,919
I'll wait for Changge secretly and inform her to meet you.

519
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,040
But...

520
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,959
Mr. Wei.

521
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,280
You underestimated me.

522
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,879
Hao Du.

523
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,118
Why are you here?

524
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,318
Now the crown prince is missing.

525
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,959
The criminal is in Luoyang.

526
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,358
You took Princess out secretly.

527
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,079
If there's... How do you know I'm here?

528
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,919
If I don't know this, how would I protect you?

529
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
You...

530
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,256
[Token of Luoyang]

531
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,118
Where did you get this token

532
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,439
and who do you want to give it?

533
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,359
I stole the token.

534
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,239
Do you want to catch me?

535
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Damn it!

536
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Chase her!

537
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Let him go.

538
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,880
I said, let him go.

539
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Changge.

540
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,039
He is?

541
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
He...

542
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,319
He saved Changge in Youzhou.

543
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,358
He is Changge's friend.

544
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,838
He saved Changge?

545
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:30,679
Yes.

546
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,879
He kidnapped me and saved Changge from Hao Du.

547
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,118
No matter who he is,

548
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,598
he saved Changge for so many times,

549
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,079
he is trustworthy.

550
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:56,089
♫ The heart gradually responds, gradually revives, ♫

551
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,179
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

552
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:05,888
♫ Before bidding farewell, we expect an encounter. ♫

553
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,279
- Changge. 
 - Sun?

554
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,478
It's a trap.

555
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,840
Your friends were caught.

00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,339
♫ There's always a moment ♫

742
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,969
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

743
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,579
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

744
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:56,889
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

745
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,449
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

746
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,819
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

747
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,299
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

748
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,169
♫ layer after layer. ♫

749
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,169
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

750
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:17,580
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

751
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,750
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

752
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,880
The Long Ballad
