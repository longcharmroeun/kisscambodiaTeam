00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,999
♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,950
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,919
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,789
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,789

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,839

The Long Ballad Episode 35

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,919
You met Changge in Luoyang?

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Relax.

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,239
I don't want to blame her.

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,318
You're willing to pardon Changge?

25
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,639
It isn't my willingness to pardon her,

26
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:02,919
it's Changge's willingness to be pardoned by me.

27
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,319
Maybe,

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,279
she'll undo the knot in her mind some day.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,399
Forget about it.

30
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,478
Have a look.

31
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,678
These are the dishes you like most.

32
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:20,679
Eat more.

33
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,440
Look how thin you've become now.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,279
Why don't you eat?

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,639
Forgive me, father.

36
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,520
I just...

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,479
When I see these delicious dishes,

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,080
I think of a friend of mine.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,240
His biggest wish is to feast on white rice.

40
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,839
But he never realized his wish until he died.

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,039
Because at that time,

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,479
the only food I can give him is hard and dry pancake.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,119
You've been starving?

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Yes.

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,080
And I saw many people starve.

46
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,678
I needed to use my hard work

47
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,799
to gain food outside the palace.

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,880
Food doesn't come easy.

49
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,600
When I suddenly saw so many delicious dishes on the table,

50
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,600
I don't get used to it now.

51
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,959
Father.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,398
If I hadn't been stranded this time,

53
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,999
I wouldn't have known so many difficulties in the world.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,759
It's more difficult than what is written on the official notices.

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,800
You suffered a lot.

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,039
I thought you would cry bitterly according to your original personality.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,919
I didn't imagine what you remembered was others' difficulties.

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,159
Leyan.

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,478
Tell me what you need.

60
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,360
I'll compensate you.

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,720
I hope people in Tang won't starve in the future.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,319
Okay.

63
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,759
I promise you.

64
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,720
I'll definitely realize my promise.

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,279
Thank you, father.

66
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,079
Okay, okay.

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,118
Let's not talk about this.

68
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,159
Here.

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
Let's have a meal now.

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,079
This handkerchief is so old.

71
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,000
Why are you still using it?

72
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,118
If it's in the past,

73
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:30,200
I would change it into a brand new handkerchief without your reminding.

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,119
Because in the past,

75
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,279
I had nothing to worry about and didn't know how to treasure.

76
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,519
But now I know

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,760
the wealth of royal family depends on the support of people.

78
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,160
Whether it's dishes on the table,

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,879
or the handkerchief in my hand,

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,440
everything we enjoy comes from people's expectations and hard work.

81
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,279
We can't let them down.

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,959
Leyan, you have grown up.

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,678
Although I didn't see it in person,

84
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,480
from what you said and thought,

85
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,880
I can feel you went through a lot on the way.

86
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,919
Father,

87
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,679
I met many good people on the way.

88
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,558
When I was in Yunzhou,

89
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:16,919
Ms. Chai from weaving workshop saved me

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,238
and taught me the way of living.

91
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:22,959
If she hadn't taken me in and taught me some skills,

92
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,719
I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to come back.

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,719
Father.

94
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,518
I want to ask for an award for Ms. Chai.

95
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,519
What is it?

96
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,959
Father, have a look.

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,118
This is the cloth weaved by ladies in weaving workshop.

98
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,078
Whether the skill or the pattern,

99
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,839
it's not worse than the cloth in palace.

100
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,838
They just live in remote areas and lack of base.

101
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,238
And they don't have a chance to be famous.

102
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:47,399
So, father, can you help them?

103
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,440
It's good, indeed.

104
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,640
Just do as you said.

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,398
I didn't imagine the girl who was shy and didn't dare to talk aloud

106
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,639
can recommend talents to me now.

107
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,558
I also sold cloth on the street.

108
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,838
And I did a good job.

109
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,600
Ms. Chai praised me a lot.

110
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,399
Leyan, you really suffered a lot.

111
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,839
Ms. Chai taught me on independence.

112
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:23,279
Even life is hard, we can't give up.

113
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,600
I earned a living with my own hands.

114
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,000
I didn't feel like it's suffering.

115
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,678
I want to ask for another award.

116
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,679
Just say it.

117
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,719
Please let me leave the palace,

118
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,600
go into the field and get close to people.

119
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,079
Okay.

120
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,359
But you need to pick some trustworthy guards.

121
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,760
Don't let them lose you again.

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Relax, father.

123
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,279
I won't get lost this time.

124
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,600
I underestimated you before.

125
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,839
Go!

126
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Go!

127
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,519
Stop.

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,958
Uncle Lei.

129
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,358
Tegin Sun asked me to meet Khan.

130
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,678
What do you want to do?

131
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,679
Well...

132
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,118
Tegin asked me to meet Khan in person.

133
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,919
Please don't embarrass me.

134
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,118
Of course I'll let you in.

135
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,600
But Khan is not here now.

136
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,480
He's with Khatun.

137
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,079
Please follow me.

138
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,479
Uncle Lei.

139
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,639
Please tell Khan I'm here.

140
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
No need.

141
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,879
Great Khan is in the tent.

142
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,519
Just go in yourself.

143
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,160
Okay.

144
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,399
What's wrong?

145
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Nothing.

146
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,480
Eagle Division wants to meet Khan.

147
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Great Khan.

148
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,239
Can Ashile Sun read mind?

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,520
He knows Khan has been talking about him recently.

150
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,678
So he sent someone to resume their bond as father and son.

151
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,199
Our spy said there's plague in Eagle Division.

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,358
So he was required to ask for medicine here.

153
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,359
He asked for death himself.

154
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,599
Bury him.

155
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,159
Yes, madam.

156
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,159
Wait.

157
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,200
There's something in his pocket.

158
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,040
[Lady Jinse asked Dingxiang to spread rumors in Luoyang.]

159
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,679
Ashile Sun is suspecting Dingxiang now.

160
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,199
How many people of Chini are still in Luoyang?

161
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,520
Du Ruhui killed them all.

162
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
Jinse also died.

163
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,440
Jinse...

164
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,679
What a pity.

165
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
It seems

166
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,919
it's hard to deal with people around Li Shimin.

167
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,759
If you trust me,

168
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,399
I'm willing to lead Chini.

169
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll do anything I can to realize your goal.

170
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,840
Can I still trust your loyalty?

171
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,719
You saved my life.

172
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,000
Please relax, princess.

173
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I won't disappoint you.

174
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Okay.

175
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,080
Don't let me down.

176
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,559
Yes, madam.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,678
We can't depend on Yanli now.

178
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,359
Chini suffered a heavy loss.

179
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,760
Eagle Division will find it out soon.

180
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,478
We can't delay our plan anymore.

181
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,039
You mean?

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,280
We've been lying low for half of our lives.

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,440
Success or failure hinges on this one action.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,319
Keep guard.

185
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,959
Don't let people with no duty come in.

186
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Yes, madam.

187
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,879
Khan.

188
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,039
Why are you here again?

189
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,320
I heard you have a headache again.

190
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm here to help you relieve it.

191
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,960
Useless idiots.

192
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,640
Any message from Sun?

193
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,119
I asked about it for you.

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,678
No message from him.

195
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,239
Well,

196
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,559
Sun didn't come to see me for long.

197
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,640
It seems he doesn't regard me as his father now.

198
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,520
I'm sorry to say so,

199
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,520
but Tegin Sun left Khan's tent.

200
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,319
He's like a wild horse without rein.

201
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,558
I'm afraid he won't come back.

202
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,559
Shut up!

203
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,679
You have no right to criticize my son!

204
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,399
Khan.

205
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,519
I know some traditional medical skills.

206
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,199
So I made this herb soup.

207
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,479
Drink it while it's still warm.

208
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,199
You'll feel better.

209
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Take it away.

210
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,520
While you're ill, I take care of you.

211
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,238
I look through medical books day and night.

212
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,759
Finally, I found this prescription.

213
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,880
It requires the blood of your closest relative as guiding drug.

214
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,599
I'm willing to have a try.

215
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,960
Luckily,

216
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,400
you're willing to cure me.

217
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Khan.

218
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,359
Please drink the medicine.

219
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,879
After you had the medicine,

220
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,359
lie down and have some rest.

221
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Lei Meng.

222
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Princess.

223
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,359
Tell Eagle Division,

224
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,478
Yaro looked down upon the imperial court and Khan.

225
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,879
Now we've arrested him as a warning.

226
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Princess,

227
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,238
why don't we just send Yaro's head to Ashile Sun,

228
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,760
so that we can take the edge off him?

229
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,439
No, we can't.

230
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,199
The reason why Ashile Sun would be the leader of Eagle Division

231
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,718
is not only his ability and courage.

232
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:04,559
The most important reason is his brotherhood to his soldiers.

233
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,359
So he won their hearts.

234
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,960
We can't let Ashile Sun know Yaro's death now.

235
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,959
Otherwise, he'll rush to Khan's tent.

236
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,080
Then all our previous work will have been wasted.

237
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,880
I still need some time to realize my goal.

238
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,519
Is Ashile Sun that horrible?

239
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,918
All divisions in Ashile Tribe can't wipe out Eagle Division?

240
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,719
It's not your turn to teach me how to deal with business!

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,159
Why did I lie low for half of my life?

242
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,079
You did it for Young Khan.

243
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,760
If it's not because I want Sher to be the king of the tribe,

244
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,039
why would I suffer such humiliation?

245
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,239
Ashile Sun is the biggest barrier for Sher to become the king.

246
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,280
I want him to die everyday.

247
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,039
I'm waiting for a chance everyday.

248
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,679
But I know

249
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,238
he is important in Yanli's mind.

250
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,558
Who the hell is he?

251
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,959
How dare he contend with my son!

252
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Yes, madam.

253
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,320
I understand now.

254
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,478
If Young Khan knows what you have done for him,

255
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,519
he must feel moved.

256
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,280
He doesn't need to understand me.

257
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:27,679
I only want my son to become the king smoothly.

258
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,239
I hope he won't suffer the pain as I did.

259
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,479
Khatun.

260
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
General Lei.

261
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,119
I'm here to report business to Great Khan.

262
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Khatun.

263
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,759
Great Khan's headache is becoming more and more serious.

264
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,158
Grand witch in Khan's tent didn't know what to do now.

265
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,039
Do you have any solution, Khatun?

266
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,598
I made herb soup with traditional prescription for Khan.

267
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,840
He drank it and fell asleep.

268
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,478
Don't bother him now.

269
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,718
That's great.

270
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,159
Thank you, Khatun.

271
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,238
Relax, Khatun.

272
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,439
I'll stay here and no one shall bother.

273
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,760
Shixin Sili will be a trouble for us in the future.

274
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,519
I understand.

275
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,598
Besides,

276
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,838
from now on,

277
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,959
change all guards around Khan's tent to our soldiers.

278
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,359
Yes, madam.

279
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,960
I didn't expect father would send you to protect me.

280
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:27,959
Why are you standing there?

281
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Hao Du!

282
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,840
Why are you standing so far away?

283
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,160
I'm afraid you don't want to see me.

284
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,560
Then why do you come?

285
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,490
I can't violate his Majesty's order.

286
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,160
If I'm not happy, will you leave?

287
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,959
Hao Du!

288
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,040
When did you become so obedient?

289
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,239
Hao Du, I said stop!

290
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,679
I'm afraid you'll be angry.

291
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,879
But I don't know what to do.

292
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,679
All I did was wrong.

293
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,279
All I did can't make you happy.

294
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,799
I can only watch you from a distance.

295
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,839
As long as you're safe,

296
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,760
I have nothing to worry about.

297
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Wait.

298
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,599
I have something to tell you.

299
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Turn around.

300
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,239
I won't eat you.

301
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,599
In Liuyun Temple,

302
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,520
did you let Changge go on purpose?

303
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,198
I don't know.

304
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,439
You don't know whether you let Changge go or not?

305
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,079
In all, I've killed all the rebels.

306
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,760
So the people you didn't kill are not rebels?

307
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,400
People who harm Tang are the rebels.

308
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,599
Thank you.

309
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,478
It's my duty to protect Tang.

310
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,560
You don't need to thank me.

311
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,239
Okay.

312
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,400
I've known the answer.

313
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Then...

314
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,400
do I have to keep distance with you?

315
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,839
Of course.

316
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,838
I'm a princess.

317
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,479
You must protect me well.

318
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Okay.

319
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,479
Tegin!

320
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,879
Any news from Yaro?

321
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,599
It's not Yaro, it's Uncle Lei.

322
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
What are you doing here?

323
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,560
You chose to leave Khan's tent.

324
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,959
Why are you asking for medicine from Khan's tent now?

325
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,280
Great Khan's order,

326
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,160
Eagle Division is cursed.

327
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,240
You shall not implicate Khan's tent.

328
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,519
Your soldier acted aggressively in Khan's tent.

329
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Ashile Sun,

330
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,160
do you still regard Great Khan as the king?

331
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,759
Where's Yaro?

332
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
He was arrested.

333
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,680
Not killing him is the last mercy Great Khan has for you.

334
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,478
And there's not much gromwell in Khan's tent.

335
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,000
Stop trying to ask for that.

336
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,560
Just run your course.

337
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,478
Tegin,

338
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:14,920
let me lead a troop into Khan's tent and save Yaro.

339
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,280
Yaro is the brother we grew up with.

340
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,399
You know the prison in Khan's tent.

341
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,559
People will suffer a lot once they are put in there.

342
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,759
Besides, Yaro is weak now.

343
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,799
He can't take it.

344
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,160
I'm afraid soon he'll... No.

345
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,598
If we go into Khan's tent now,

346
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,349
I'm afraid we'll fall into their trap.

347
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,759
At the time, Eagle Division will be at a more difficult situation.

348
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,478
Then what about Yaro's life?

349
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,479
Su Yishe.

350
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Changge is right.

351
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,598
If we break into Khan's tent and save him now,

352
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,239
what about Mu Jin and other brothers?

353
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,039
The gromwell in Khan's tent can't be inadequate.

354
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,160
If we really go to Khan's tent,

355
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,839
they'll know our weakness.

356
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,160
Then... I'll save Yaro.

357
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,279
But now, letting him stay in prison is the best choice.

358
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,679
What do we do now?

359
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Of course you should find gromwell and get rid of plague.

360
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,920
Have you all been kicked in the brain by donkeys?

361
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,679
No matter what happened in Khan's tent,

362
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,358
no matter what conflicts you have in Ashile Tribe,

363
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,919
time is limited now.

364
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,880
Nothing is more important than finding the gromwell to save people.

365
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,118
You're right.

366
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,399
It's urgent to find gromwell now.

367
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,959
Let's put off all the other things.

368
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,520
Everything has to be prioritized.

369
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:29,958
Okay.

370
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,880
Gather all our forces to find gromwell.

371
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,919
As for Yaro,

372
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,079
I believe Father won't kill him due to our relationship as father and son.

373
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:39,800
Yes, sir.

374
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,118
I'll listen to your order.

375
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,718
Good.

376
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:43,919
Follow me.

377
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,479
Take some herb to Mu Jin.

378
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,120
Gromwell was originated in Mobei.

379
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,078
I'll lead brothers of Yanxing Sect to set out at night.

380
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,519
We'll arrive in Mobei in three days.

381
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,279
Mobei is remote.

382
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,359
Even I haven't been there.

383
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
How could you go there?

384
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,958
Senior Qin has led Yanxing Sect to many places.

385
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,598
I think he is experienced.

386
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,519
I'll let Situ Langlang take care of Yuan.

387
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,880
Yanxing Sect will follow me.

388
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,519
But...

389
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
You don't trust me?

390
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,319
Mu Jin has fallen ill,

391
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,239
I can't put you in danger now.

392
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,760
I chose to come here.

393
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,039
Eagle Division is also my home.

394
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,478
To risk my life for you,

395
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,599
I'm willing to do so.

396
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,439
And now,

397
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,000
we have no other solution.

398
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Changge!

399
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,699
Mimi?

400
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,198
I remember you are taking care of Mu Jin.

401
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,438
Why are you here?

402
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,919
I've told you

403
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,000
I come from Mobei.

404
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
You heard it?

405
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,359
Take me there.

406
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,639
I grew up in Mobei when I was young.

407
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,159
I know the way to Mobei and I know gromwell.

408
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,760
I have a bigger chance to find gromwell than you.

409
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,399
And only if we can find it as soon as possible,

410
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,239
Mu Jin and the rest of them won't die.

411
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:06,559
Tegin.

412
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,319
Because of me, Eagle Division had this plague.

413
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,599
Please give me a chance to atone, Tegin.

414
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,959
Sun,

415
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,920
let Mimi go with me.

416
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,119
Okay.

417
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,399
Hao Du.

418
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,280
Thank you for walking with me all day.

419
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,959
It's my duty.

420
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,520
Eat slowly.

421
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,079
Hao Du.

422
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,719
Yes.

423
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,439
Forget it.

424
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,359
Nothing.

425
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,559
His Majesty asked me to protect you.

426
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,720
If you have anything in mind,

427
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,199
just tell me.

428
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,839
If...

429
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,160
you like someone for a long time,

430
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,959
and you know he likes someone else,

431
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,199
will you ask him in person?

432
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,119
I think I'll ask her in person.

433
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,520
But... It's okay if she refuses me.

434
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,920
I know what I'm thinking.

435
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,680
If I don't ask her in person,

436
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,880
I won't give up easily.

437
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,839
You're right.

438
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,880
If I don't ask him in person,

439
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,079
it means I betray my heart.

440
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,238
Princess.

441
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,239
But...

442
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,879
I think I've become brave enough.

443
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,958
But when I think of telling him in person,

444
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,199
I don't have the courage to ask him out,

445
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,239
not to mention telling him.

446
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,118
Hao Du.

447
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,520
What did you want to say just now?

448
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Nothing.

449
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Let's go back, princess.

450
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,560
Here, have some water.

451
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Okay.

452
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Mu Jin.

453
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,400
I'll leave for a few days.

454
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,079
Promise me.

455
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,919
You'll stay alive.

456
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,079
I promise you

457
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,280
I'll take gromwell back.

458
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
So...

459
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
So...

460
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,759
You must stay alive until I'm back.

461
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Understand?

462
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,680
You must stay alive,

463
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,239
otherwise...

464
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:42,598
Senior Qin.

465
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,318
Young Master.

466
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,879
I've told Xu Feng and Shiba that

467
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,718
we're going to Mobei.

468
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:50,519
They're waiting to gather with us in front.

469
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,760
As for Yuan,

470
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,478
Sun, Mr. Situ and brothers in Yanxing Sect will take care of her.

471
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,280
Relax, Young Master.

472
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
Okay.

473
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,718
Let's go now.

474
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:02,719
Okay.

475
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,999
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

476
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,880
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

477
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,519
♫ Before the daybreak, through the obsession of love, ♫

478
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,479
♫ the longing flows. ♫

479
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,799
♫ There's always a moment ♫

480
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,520
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

481
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,599
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

482
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,839
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

483
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,679
♫ Layer after layer. ♫

484
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,839
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

485
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,000
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

486
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:12,487
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

487
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,079
Brother Shuyu,

488
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,799
why are you here?

489
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,039
Hao Du told me about it.

490
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,959
You got tired after you went into fields and talked with people recently.

491
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,838
What can I do to help you?

492
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,239
Just tell me.

493
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,478
Great.

494
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,279
Let's go together.

495
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Let's go.

496
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,159
I wonder when the rain stops.

497
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,919
It's okay.

498
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,119
I believe it'll be sunny since you're with me.

499
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
Stop there!

500
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,599
Brother Shuyu.

501
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,680
Thank you for your company today.

502
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,399
Leyan.

503
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,800
I think you've changed a little.

504
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,959
Tell me what's changed about me, Brother Shuyu.

505
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,958
I'm not sure.

506
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,880
I think you become braver.

507
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,880
Actually, I'm not brave at all.

508
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,800
But today,

509
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,760
I want to be brave this time.

510
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,080
Brother Shuyu.

511
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:19,439
Since the day we met in Luoyang,

512
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,800
I wanted to ask you a question.

513
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,959
But I didn't know how to ask.

514
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,239
It's okay, just ask.

515
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,600
Do you still like Changge?

516
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:43,039
Changge and I have separated long before.

517
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,280
We're not friends anymore.

518
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,399
I should have understood it

519
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,840
when she left Chang'an.

520
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,638
I like you.

521
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,238
I like you.

522
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,878
I like you.

523
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,879
I like you.

524
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,399
Like you.

525
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,918
Like you.

526
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,910
♫ I gave all I had. ♫

527
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,120
♫ But I'm heart-broken now. ♫

528
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,759
♫ How liberal do I have to be ♫

529
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,158
♫ to proceed without hesitation? ♫

530
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,399
Brother Shuyu,

531
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:26,336
can I be your companion from now on?

532
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:29,039
♫ I love her at the first sight, ♫

533
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,320
♫ and I love her for the rest of my life. ♫

534
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,880
♫ What is love? People can't avoid it. ♫

535
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,919
You didn't refuse me.

536
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,719
Well, I...

537
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:56,000
♫ As long as you're happy. ♫

538
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,239
Taoist.

539
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,360
Staying up late will harm the liver.

540
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:40,958
You're right.

541
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,320
What are you thinking?

542
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,320
I'm calculating the time.

543
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,719
Changge...

544
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,159
Changge should arrive in Mobei tomorrow.

545
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,678
Bad news.

546
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,320
I'm afraid you have an illness now.

547
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,198
What's that?

548
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,320
Of course it's lovesickness.

549
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
It's interesting.

550
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:25,158
Changge.

551
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,280
Your idea is good.

552
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,119
We went into the town in batches,

553
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,560
so guards won't find it out.

554
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,198
Actually, I thought there are so many of us.

555
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,039
And most of us are from Central Plains.

556
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,559
I was afraid guards will stop us.

557
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,878
It'll be strict when we enter the town.

558
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,959
After we entered the town, there won't be a problem.

559
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,039
Besides, we're acting separately.

560
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,360
It'll be quicker.

561
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,918
Nice bottles!

562
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:47,919
Here, take it.

563
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Mimi.

564
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,918
Is Mobei always this crowded?

565
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,159
Why is it like a holiday?

566
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,958
It's Qihan Festival.

567
00:37:55,959 --> 00:38:00,238
People in Mobei will use gromwell to drive god of plague and illness away.

568
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,959
So there must be gromwell in medicine shop in Mobei now.

569
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,120
Hurry up!

570
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,639
Come on!

571
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,839
What happened?

572
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,119
Come here.

573
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,478
Come on!

574
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,678
Hurry up!

575
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,159
Go!

576
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Come here!

577
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,438
Come on!

578
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:19,559
Hurry up!

579
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,958
Honey!

580
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:21,878
What are you doing?

581
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:22,879
Honey!

582
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,599
Don't look at us!

583
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,359
Go!

584
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,398
Honey!

585
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:26,799
Go!

586
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,360
Why are they conscripting soldiers now?

587
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,438
And they're from Ashile Tribe.

588
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:30,959
Go!

589
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,079
Come on!

590
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Just go!

591
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,719
Mimi,

592
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,878
you haven't been back for ten years.

593
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:43,439
Is the city the same as what it was in your memory?

594
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,839
When I left here,

595
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,120
there weren't so many people.

596
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,280
I didn't imagine it becomes so prosperous now.

597
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
It's just...

598
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,439
I heard that the King of Mobei is a talented person.

599
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,519
Within ten years,

600
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,839
he turned Mobei into a business fortress.

601
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,958
Now I see it with my own eyes.

602
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:02,959
He is really capable.

603
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,359
With a king like him,

604
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Mobei won't be bullied again, right?

605
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:09,959
I hope so.

606
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,719
Have a look.

607
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,439
Let's go and buy gromwell.

608
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,878
Come on!

609
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:17,678
Have a look, everyone!

610
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,599
Look carefully!

611
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,718
An empty bottle.

612
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,638
Excuse me.

613
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,080
Have a look, it's empty.

614
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:27,520
Three, two, one.

615
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,359
Good!

616
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,158
Brilliant!

617
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,158
It's beautiful.

618
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,718
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

619
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,158
Good!

620
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,198
Give it to me?

621
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,878
Then you don't have one now.

622
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:39,879
It's easy.

623
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:44,438
Good!

624
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:45,359
Bravo!

625
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,238
Brilliant!

626
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,198
Here.

627
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:47,918
Thank you.

628
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:48,919
Thanks.

629
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:50,479
Thanks.

630
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,839
Come on!

631
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,159
Senior Qin, how's it?

632
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,918
I've asked about it.

633
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,979
People said Mobei Imperial Court

634
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,039
prohibited the transaction of gromwell a few days ago.

635
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,439
There is no gromwell in every medicine shop now.

636
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,919
It seems it's impossible to get all gromwell that Eagle Division needs.

637
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,438
If we ask for it in people's residence,

638
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:18,839
it will be more difficult.

639
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,759
And we'll alert them.

640
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,560
It'll be bad if we let King of Mobei know we're here.

641
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
It's a trap.

642
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,719
They must do it on purpose.

643
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,719
Khan's tent.

644
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,950
Khan's tent asked them to do it.

645
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,159
Senior Qin, do we have other solutions?

646
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,478
I think,

647
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:48,158
even in the clearest place,

648
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,319
there'll be a dirty corner.

649
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,158
As long as we're willing to offer a high price,

650
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,280
someone will risk their lives to get gromwell for us.

651
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,438
Senior Qin.

652
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,479
Please ask about it.

653
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:59,478
No matter what they want, I'll agree.

654
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:01,439
Okay, I'll do it right now.

655
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,238
Wait, Senior Qin.

656
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,280
There's another thing.

657
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,119
I just saw people from Ashile Tribe are conscripting new soldiers here.

658
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,479
Maybe we should let his Majesty know about it.

659
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,759
Relax, Young Master.

660
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,879
I'll tell them about it.

661
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,679
Thank you, Senior Qin.

662
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,638
Follow me, all of you.

663
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,639
Yes, sir.

664
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,159
Changge...

665
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,678
Relax.

666
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:29,519
Senior Qin and people of Yanxing Sect are here.

667
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,199
It's easy to ask about some messages.

668
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,320
Let's have a rest nearby.

669
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,199
Let's go.

670
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,239
Thank you.

671
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,718
Young Master,

672
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,678
why did you let Shiba look for a place to rest alone?

673
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:47,918
Why can't I go?

674
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,159
Shiba is low-key.

675
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,399
You mean I often swank?

676
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,479
That's what you said.

677
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,238
Boss!

678
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:03,958
Roast more pancakes for me and pack them up.

679
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:04,959
Please wait.

680
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,918
There're more, isn't it enough for you?

681
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:07,478
Roast pancakes.

682
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:09,839
Well, Shiba didn't eat much just now.

683
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,800
I wan to pack some for her, in case she's hungry.

684
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
Check the bill!

685
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,679
Coming.

686
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:31,519
Young girl,

687
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,600
you had a lot.

688
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,799
Will you repudiate the bill?

689
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,199
Of course I won't.

690
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,319
But I was in a hurry.

691
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,398
So I don't have enough money.

692
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:41,280
Well, I can leave you a writing pledge.

693
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:44,079
I'll pay the rest of money a few days later.

694
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,238
What do you think?

695
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:47,398
Young girl, are you kidding me?

696
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,319
I'm doing a small business. You can't eat on credit.

697
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,438
I think you should pay me the bill now.

698
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,319
I said I would pay you later.

699
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,718
I won't repudiate the bill.

700
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:58,279
I can give you twice as much, three times is also okay.

701
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,238
Young girl,

702
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,878
if you don't pay me the bill,

703
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:03,239
I'll take you to our king now.

704
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:07,000
Do you really think I have no money to pay you?

705
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,878
This is a handkerchief from the royal family of Central Plains.

706
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,438
Its silk and embroidering skills are perfect.

707
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:16,839
This piece is at least worthy of five pearls.

708
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
Five pearls.

709
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,679
What about using it to pay my bill?

710
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
This?

711
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,200
This is from the royal family in Central Plains?

712
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,080
Why would I lie to you?

713
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,039
If it were not for I really don't have money to pay you,

714
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,760
I won't give you this.

715
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,718
I even didn't ask you to give me some money back.

716
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:36,759
Well,

717
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,600
I need to find a person who knows about it.

718
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,999
Sorry to interrupt,

719
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,439
are you from the Central Plains?

720
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:49,399
Please check this handkerchief for me, lady.

738
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,350
♫ layer after layer. ♫

739
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,789
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

740
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:16,660
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

741
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:25,069
♫ There's always a moment ♫

742
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:30,699
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

743
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,309
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

744
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:40,619
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

745
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,179
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

746
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,549
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

747
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:50,029
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

748
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,899
♫ layer after layer. ♫

749
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,899
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

750
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:01,310
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

751
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,480
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

752
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:23,610
