00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,999
♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,980
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,900
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,919
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,789
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,789
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,839
♫ To the distance. ♫

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,909
♫ The miserable past is like a dagger. ♫

00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,719
♫ Though my wings are broken, ♫

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,780

♫ I'll forget you. ♫

♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night, ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad. ♫

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,269
♫ The river of life is under my feet. ♫

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,700

The Long Ballad Episode 36

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,354
Excuse me.

22
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:41,900
Are you from the Central Plains?

23
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,043
Could you help me check

24
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:47,980
whether it's from the Royal Family there?

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,859
Layman! Don't talk rot!

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,887
Have you ever seen anything from the royal family of Central Plains?

27
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,020
Let me see!

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,643
Such a cheap handkerchief.

29
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:09,843
Not only the royal family

30
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:11,821
but also I will refuse to use it! It's so rough!

31
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:14,599
You... How dare you!

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,819
You did deceive me!

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,621
Let the head judge it! Follow me!

34
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:19,799
- Go! 
 - Help me!

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,020
How dare you ask us to do so?

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,700
Young Master, shall we help her?

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,843
According to her behaviors and apparels,

38
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:28,954
she must be rich or noble.

39
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:31,700
Someone will go to help her even if we don't.

40
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:41,940
Young Master.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,439
It feels wrong.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,932
They've even taken over gromwells in black markets.

43
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,754
They're the most covert!

44
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:52,580
Seems that Khan's Tent wants to destroy us all.

45
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:56,420
What should we do now?

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,976
Where can we find the gromwell?

47
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:00,799
Let's lodge in the hotel and keep on searching it.

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,221
We must find and bring it back!

49
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:04,300
Okay.

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,149
- Follow up! 
 - Let me off!

51
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,865
- Go! 
 - I didn't repudiate!

52
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,478
- I just need a few whiles to pay! 
 - Go!

53
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,838
Why are you so brutal?

54
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,359
- Go! 
 - I didn't cheat you!

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,999
You know to cheat at such a tender age!

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,519
Full of tricks! I won't trust you!

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,580
- I'm not! 
 - Go!

58
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,540
Ask him to pay! He's rich!

59
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:27,340
No! No pain, no leaving!

60
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:36,380
Take it!

61
00:03:39,377 --> 00:03:40,900
Thank you...

62
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,340
I've got bellyache...

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,954
Stand up.

64
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:52,354
Uncle...

65
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,558
Are you going to leave me in the lurch?

66
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:57,260
You tricked me and escaped last time.

67
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:59,576
I have a headache.

68
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:01,221
Ouch, it hurts!

69
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:03,260
The same old trick.

70
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,377
Well, you didn't mention bellyache last time.

71
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:08,954
Uncle.

72
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:11,020
Your joke isn't funny.

73
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,340
Enough? Can we leave now?

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,460
I can go with you

75
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,500
but I'm hungry and I want to eat noodles.

76
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,487
Haven't you just finished your meal?

77
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:22,500
Does it matter?

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,754
Here you are.

79
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:28,755
Please enjoy it.

80
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,919
Well, how can I eat...

81
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,160
while you're all staring at me?

82
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,620
Yummy! It's so delicious!

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,754
I've got bellyache!

84
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:05,843
What's wrong?

85
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:08,509
Something wrong with the noodles!

86
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,769
Boss!

87
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,176
Yes, Sir?

88
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,265
I'm here.

89
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,599
Something wrong with the noodles!

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,349
It's impossible... Wait!

91
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,679
- What's going on? 
 - We've operated for decades!

92
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,079
- We've never met it before! 
 - I...

93
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,599
- Any mistake? 
 - Namtso.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,799
Go to check the kitchen!

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,354
In case I'm poisoned, you may find the toxic!

96
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,789
Do it! At once!

97
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,599
- You guys, go to check the kitchen! 
 - Yes.

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,900
This way, please.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,820
Uncle, go with them!

100
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,710
I've got a tummy ache...

101
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,660
I have to go to the toilet!

102
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,020
It aches...

103
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,154
She escaped again!

104
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:17,180
Let's chase!

105
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,980
It's you...

106
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,300
Enemies here!

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,687
You played a trick but why did you blame on us?

108
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:48,954
It's enough. Leave her alone.

109
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,540
- Wait! She's... 
 - Let's leave.

110
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,740
Step aside!

111
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:56,700
Get out of the way!

112
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,199
How can they find me so quickly?

113
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,440
- Step aside! 
 - Soldiers here...

114
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,310
Are they the soldiers of Mobei?

115
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:05,421
You fear soldiers?

116
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:06,422
Don't move!

117
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:09,780
Help me!

118
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,035
- What to do? 
 - Stun her at once!

119
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,549
Stop it!

120
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,660
Let's leave!

121
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,421
- Find them! 
 - Yes!

122
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:26,500
Take care.

123
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,465
Shall we have a meal?

124
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,980
- This way, please. 
 - Fine.

125
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,643
Who are you?

126
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:51,980
Why did you tie me up?

127
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,900
So who are you?

128
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,340
Why did you make trouble with us?

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,580
Why do I have to answer you?

130
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,509
By the way,

131
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,354
you're quite weird and fear soldiers.

132
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:07,620
I think you're not normal peddlers!

133
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,300
As you've found it,

134
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,620
then it's time to silence you.

135
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:18,420
Do you know the result of bringing us trouble?

136
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,540
Do you want to kill me?

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,319
Here's the inn, right?

138
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,554
Many people here.

139
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:31,580
It's not a good place to murder.

140
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,199
Clever girl.

141
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,287
Tell me.

142
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:40,768
Why are they? Why did they chase you?

143
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,154
My enemies.

144
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,820
I think it's good for me to be tied.

145
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,020
It's better than to be arrested by them!

146
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,220
Little girl! Pack of lies!

147
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,500
I dare not let you leave and bring us trouble.

148
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,460
Stay here quietly.

149
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,799
If you refuse,

150
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,580
I'll leave you in the field to serve as the food of wolves!

151
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:21,540
Changge, what's up? Who's she?

152
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:24,620
Still tells me nothing.

153
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:27,180
Then what should we do to her?

154
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,599
Though her background is unknown,

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,621
I don't think she's a hoodlum.

156
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:33,369
As she's smart,

157
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,577
she's found that we don't want to cope with soldiers.

158
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,132
If we let her off so easily,

159
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:39,540
she might bring us more trouble.

160
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,799
Guard her first.

161
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,260
Then we'll try to find a solution.

162
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,465
Sounds reasonable.

163
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,940
Then let's do it.

164
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,620
Want to trap me?

165
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:34,860
Come on... She's here for me?

166
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:51,940
Mimi, what's wrong?

167
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,639
What are you thinking here?

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,660
I'm thinking of my father, mother

169
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,540
and young brother.

170
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,710
My whole family lived in Mobei

171
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,140
when I was young.

172
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,460
Though we were not rich,

173
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:11,020
we were very happy.

174
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:15,020
Until Ashile Tribe came.

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,180
They brought us battles

176
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,780
and ruined my family.

177
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,100
Many clansmen were homeless.

178
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:27,820
Fortunately, King of Mobei appeared.

179
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,780
Though Mobei wasn't conquered,

180
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,820
it's still pinned by Ashile Tribe.

181
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,220
Whoever brings others wars

182
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,140
will be punished.

183
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,300
My father said so.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,420
In my childhood,

185
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:49,100
he taught me to tell right from wrong.

186
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:50,780
Well, Changge.

187
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,180
I really cannot distinguish

188
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,180
between right and wrong now.

189
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:01,420
It seems that I should hate Ashile Tribe

190
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,021
but Eagle Division is also a part of it.

191
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,980
I love the guys there.

192
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:09,140
Am I wrong?

193
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,260
They're not the same.

194
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,780
Shouldn't you be tied?

195
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,154
I... Why didn't you escape?

196
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:29,820
I didn't want to leave.

197
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,129
I think you're quite right.

198
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,510
Ashile Tribe and its Great Khan

199
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,020
must be punished in the future.

200
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,865
So who are you?

201
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,580
My name is Zhenzhu. I'm from Monan.

202
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,687
But we're in Mobei.

203
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:46,243
I'm here for Qihan Festival.

204
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:48,620
Mobei has the liveliest celebration.

205
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,580
So you come here yourself?

206
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,710
Guys who're chasing you...

207
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:58,140
Fine... It's because my father made me angry.

208
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,860
He asked them to capture me back.

209
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,039
Well, I don't want to be back now.

210
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,843
Oh, come on.

211
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,460
Just a kid who ran away from home.

212
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,729
I'm not a kid!

213
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,279
I'm now 14 years old and can get married.

214
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,940
I think you only enjoy larks.

215
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,798
I can let you leave

216
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,919
but you need to remember it.

217
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,639
If you dare come to bring us trouble,

218
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,443
I'll capture and kill you.

219
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:23,754
You won't kill me!

220
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:24,910
Why?

221
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:25,980
My intuition.

222
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,554
By the way, anything to eat?

223
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:31,700
I'm hungry.

224
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,540
Don't eat too much...

225
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,020
I'm full!

226
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,799
Then answer my question.

227
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,554
How far is Monan from here?

228
00:13:58,555 --> 00:13:59,860
Are there any gromwells there?

229
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:02,180
Gromwell?

230
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,029
It's not a rarity.

231
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,460
As there are many in Mobei, why do you ask Monan?

232
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,260
Because we can buy none of it in Mobei.

233
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,519
Though its trade has been banned,

234
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,100
we still can banish God of Plague.

235
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,021
Every Qihan Festival,

236
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:24,639
everyone will take out gromwells to banish God of Plague.

237
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,180
Banish God of Plague?

238
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,820
Mimi.

239
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,700
Is it as same as what you've told me today?

240
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,038
Its main part is to banish God of Plague...

241
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,140
People will build up a stage in the town

242
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:43,776
and someone will take the stage and perform.

243
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:45,940
Then people will throw all their gromwells

244
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,180
to God of Plague.

245
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,620
How couldn't I find such an idea?

246
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,310
Which part of the performance should be fastidious?

247
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:00,540
Fastidious?

248
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,020
Anyone's here?

249
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,700
Soldiers!

250
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,820
Are you all dead?

251
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,954
Where's Shixin Sili?

252
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:33,399
He isn't in Khan's Tent now.

253
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,754
Then where's Sher?

254
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:36,487
Ask him to come!

255
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:39,238
Young Khan led Wolf Division to inspect.

256
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,420
No one is here...

257
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,980
They're all out!

258
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,540
Why are they not here?

259
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:50,420
You're sick and should stay in bed.

260
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,700
I'll report to you as they're back.

261
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:04,340
Sun...

262
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,700
Sun...

263
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:15,620
Princess.

264
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,700
Khan is still concerned about Eagle Division.

265
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,580
Can he dispatch them?

266
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:23,799
Please be at ease.

267
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,376
We have soldiers guarding there

268
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:26,817
and they cannot fetch any gromwells.

269
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,180
Thanks, Taoist Sun.

270
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,776
He's out of danger temporarily

271
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,100
but the change of his condition

272
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:58,354
is faster than my imagination.

273
00:16:58,355 --> 00:16:59,580
You mean...

274
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:02,043
he cannot wait till ten days later?

275
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:03,620
Since I've told you ten days,

276
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,660
I will let him hold out until that time.

277
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:12,020
But if they cannot get the gromwells on time,

278
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,700
I'm afraid he'll be in danger.

279
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,759
Are you ready?

280
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,287
Yes. Please be at ease, Senior Qin.

281
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:33,380
Let's wait and see.

282
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:07,020
Nice!

283
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,349
Banish God of Plague!

284
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,759
- Banish God of Plague! 
 - Good job!

285
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,919
- Nice! 
 - Banish God of Plague!

286
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,420
Good!

287
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,620
Look at that!

288
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:23,580
Let's go to have a look.

289
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,300
Nice dance!

290
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:07,865
Awesome!

291
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:10,118
Small tricks.

292
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,380
It's our turn!

293
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,380
Hit below the belt...

294
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,999
Nice!

295
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,865
Good job!

296
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,132
Awesome!

297
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,376
Perfect!

298
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:30,554
Amazing!

299
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:31,687
So nice!

300
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,860
Banish God of Plague!

301
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:34,910
Good!

302
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:36,519
Banish God of Plague!

303
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,887
Throw the gromwells!

304
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:41,954
Banish God of Plague!

305
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,420
Awesome!

306
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:51,340
Banish God of Plague!

307
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,020
Banish God of Plague!

308
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,140
Nice!

309
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,199
Go to investigate their background.

310
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,380
Yes.

311
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:09,220
Put it here. Be cautious.

312
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,621
- Be careful! 
 - Senior Qin, is it enough?

313
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:14,220
I've counted. Enough for Eagle Division.

314
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:16,262
Leave some here and wait for their check.

315
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,180
I see.

316
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:20,332
Wait!

317
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,910
Are you going to leave?

318
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:24,100
What about me? What should I do?

319
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:27,265
As you've had enough fun, go back to your home.

320
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:28,900
Don't let your Father worry about you.

321
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,980
Sir.

322
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:41,110
What's going on?

323
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,465
Our leader wants to see you.

324
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:43,860
Your leader?

325
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,060
King of Mobei?

326
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,999
Sir, we're just commoners with no crimes.

327
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,243
Could you tell me why he wants to see us?

328
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:56,740
Does it need a reason?

329
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,354
Fine.

330
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:00,355
Well...

331
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,532
I'll go with you.

332
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,740
Please let them set out.

333
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:05,940
Who are you?

334
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:08,300
Our leader wants to see you all!

335
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,100
Sir, please take it easy

336
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,060
and let us have a discussion first.

337
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,279
Changge, what should we do now?

338
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,887
It's a crucial juncture for us.

339
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:22,349
We cannot make any mistakes.

340
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,287
If we conflict with them,

341
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:26,380
neither gromwells nor we can leave here.

342
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,780
That's it.

343
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:31,687
But if we follow them, won't we waste time?

344
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:32,900
Just play it by ear.

345
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,709
If things go wrong... Please be at ease.

346
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,576
I know the map of Mobei well.

347
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:40,954
If we want to break out of here,

348
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:43,060
Yanxing Sect can come to our aid at any time.

349
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,710
Okay.

350
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:50,110
Sir. We'll follow you.

351
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:51,140
This way.

352
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:04,843
No shoo-in. Retreat first.

353
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:06,140
Report to the leader at once.

354
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,540
Is your Highness King of Mobei, Yaoluoge Pusa?

355
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,599
I lead my trade caravan, passing your territory.

356
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,100
Please forgive our offence.

357
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,540
We do beg your pardon.

358
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,380
Forego formalities.

359
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,443
I've never thought you're a pretty lady

360
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:25,260
after you remove the attire of God of Plague.

361
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,340
King of Mobei lost to a young lady.

362
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,843
Well, you're the other God of Plague.

363
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:39,900
Shut up.

364
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:42,700
Who allows you to see my face?

365
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,969
Oh, come on!

366
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,887
It's only because you lost to us.

367
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:50,519
You're as old as my uncle

368
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,176
and why are you still aggressive?

369
00:24:52,177 --> 00:24:54,887
You not only hate to face your failure but also want to play tricks.

370
00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:56,065
Shame on you!

371
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,421
Who is old?

372
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:59,078
You!

373
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,900
You're at least 20 years older than me!

374
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,260
I won't argue with you.

375
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,380
My soldiers find plenty of gromwells on your carriages.

376
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:12,020
Tell me.

377
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:18,354
Who are you?

378
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:20,820
And why do you embezzle gromwells at all cost?

379
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,999
Please calm down.

380
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,354
We're non-native businessmen,

381
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,740
knowing nothing about rules here.

382
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,176
As we cannot purchase gromwells,

383
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:34,687
there's no other way for us.

384
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,300
Why do you want gromwells?

385
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,500
Because trades of gromwells are banned in all tribes here.

386
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,443
Sounds interesting.

387
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:42,665
Go ahead.

388
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,910
We want profits

389
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,749
so we care nothing about the risk.

390
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,599
Since Ashile Tribe bans the trades,

391
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,019
there must be guys who need it.

392
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,487
As you're subject to Ashile Tribe,

393
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:54,780
you dare not allow people to sell.

394
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,709
As long as we can get it,

395
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,887
we can find buyers and double to send it.

396
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:01,060
Huge profits.

397
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,599
By the way, I'm curious about one thing.

398
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,754
Go ahead.

399
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:11,700
As you've noticed it very early,

400
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,799
why didn't you inquire us when we won?

401
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,420
Why do you ask us now?

402
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,140
What are you waiting for?

403
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,820
You're smart

404
00:26:21,822 --> 00:26:24,340
but you have no chance to know it.

405
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:25,865
Soldiers.

406
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,580
Put these reckless guys in jail.

407
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:30,380
- Yes! 
 - Hold on!

408
00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:32,821
Do it at once!

409
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:34,020
Don't waste my time!

410
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,279
- Put them in jail! 
 - Go!

411
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,843
- We can't leave now. 
 - Loose us!

412
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:38,910
- Wait a second! 
 - Yaoluoge Pusa!

413
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:39,954
King!

414
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:41,265
- You. 
 - King!

415
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,380
Come here.

416
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,419
Have you let the soldiers of Monan leave?

417
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,243
Seeing their lord be arrested,

418
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:52,140
they hurried to leave and report.

419
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,500
It's a smart young lady.

420
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,300
I see. You can leave.

421
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,887
Report to me as King of Monan comes.

422
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:01,940
Yes.

423
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,554
Anyone's here?

424
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,900
We want to leave!

425
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:23,021
Anyone's here?

426
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,621
We want to see King of Mobei!

427
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:26,459
We need to see your King!

428
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,660
Come on!

429
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,479
Changge, what should we do?

430
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,354
We've stayed in Mobei for a few days

431
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:38,100
and we need eight or nine days to rush back without rest

432
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,659
while we're now detained here,

433
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,910
knowing nothing about the time to leave.

434
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,340
Let's try to find a way to leave!

435
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,576
What my father has told me is right.

436
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:48,860
Here's a bad place!

437
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,740
Why do you say so?

438
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,969
Mobei and Monan were good neighbors.

439
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,019
A hundred years ago,

440
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,549
Mobei conquered Monan's ancestral territory.

441
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,154
After that, they've had battles for long because of it.

442
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:06,300
Afterwards, Ashile Tribe came.

443
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,043
Though they had no fights,

444
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,999
both of them led a hard life

445
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,239
and my Father forbade me from going out to play.

446
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,500
So they're bitter enemies.

447
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,559
Though King of Mobei is the leader,

448
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,380
he's controlled by Ashile Tribe.

449
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,929
According to his expressions,

450
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,549
it seems that he's ashamed of it.

451
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,643
All the people here are ashamed of it!

452
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:29,065
No one wants to be a slave.

453
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:30,687
And no one wants to be controlled.

454
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:32,688
Our trades of herbs even need to obey their rules!

455
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,349
Anyone's here?

456
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,220
- Why are you crying? 
 - Come over here!

457
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,399
Go to tell your King

458
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,860
that I want to make a deal with him!

459
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,710
- Come back! 
 - You'll regret!

460
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:52,087
COME BACK!

461
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:53,369
Take it easy.

462
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,929
My Father will come to save us.

463
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,776
He's the bravest man in the world.

464
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,110
How can I take it easy?

465
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,820
We need the herbs to save people's lives!

466
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,820
Hang in there, Mu Jin!

467
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:08,799
Mu Jin...

468
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,732
I need to go out... Come back! Let us leave!

469
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,180
I want to see your King!

470
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,340
Release us!

471
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,140
Hurry!

472
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,300
Anyone's here?

473
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,459
Come on!

474
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,140
Let us go to see your King!

475
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,599
Thanks to you,

476
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,259
there has been no new patients recently.

477
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,220
All the patients we have are in stable condition.

478
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,900
Tegin! Mu Jin seems in a bad condition.

479
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,060
Taoist. How is he?

480
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,900
The plague is always changing.

481
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,660
A mutation will suddenly come during the treatment.

482
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,519
I'm afraid

483
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,399
he's unlucky.

484
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,919
He's suddenly

485
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,260
in the most dangerous condition.

486
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,919
Could you help him?

487
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,576
It's all up to his fate.

488
00:30:15,577 --> 00:30:16,879
What do you mean?

489
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,900
Cold and heat struggles in his body.

490
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,300
We must cool down his heat first.

491
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,860
But all my ways are in vain.

492
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,709
I'm afraid...

493
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,220
he cannot hold out until the appointed time.

494
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:40,820
Mimi...

495
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,420
Mimi...

496
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,340
Noble Princess.

497
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:12,180
Do you think I'm old?

498
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,220
No.

499
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,340
You're still as brilliant as my first glimpse of you.

500
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:26,020
Only you and Alir are sincere to me.

501
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,621
As for Alir...

502
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:32,100
No one can serve me better than her.

503
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,576
Unfortunately...

504
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:36,980
she's Ashile Sun's mother.

505
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,180
She has to be killed by me in the end.

506
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,100
Being served by her for years,

507
00:31:45,622 --> 00:31:47,740
I really don't want to do so.

508
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,700
Forget it...

509
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,399
I don't need to make feints before her anymore.

510
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,140
What about finding you some new female slaves?

511
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:01,820
No thanks.

512
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,932
Do you want to report to me anything?

513
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:06,980
Report to Your Highness.

514
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,159
I have some news from the Desert.

515
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,532
Ashile Sun didn't go there himself.

516
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,660
He appointed his female slave to go there.

517
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,710
Mimi Guli went with her as well.

518
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,710
And someone from the Central Plains

519
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,820
accompanied them.

520
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,620
Female Slave...

521
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:23,500
Central Plains...

522
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,976
She's Li Changge.

523
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,100
I think so.

524
00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:29,220
I've never thought

525
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,376
he would let Li Changge

526
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:33,020
go to complete such a crucial task.

527
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,780
It seems their relationship is unusual.

528
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,554
Li Changge is not a common lady.

529
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:40,843
Glue to her.

530
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:41,940
Please be at ease.

531
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,019
They have been arrested by King of Mobei.

532
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,599
Because of the prohibition of gromwells?

533
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,740
Yes. Mobei fears Khan's Tent and dares not to violate it.

534
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,820
Sensible boys.

535
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,109
But don't let down guard.

536
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,109
Ask someone to warn Mimi Guli secretly

537
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,976
not to forget her task.

538
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,421
At your command.

539
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:03,510
Besides,

540
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:05,887
call up 10 thousand infantries each from Mobei and Monan.

541
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:07,865
Step up the practice.

542
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:08,999
I will.

543
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,140
By the way,

544
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,354
you've told me

545
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,460
to find me some new female slaves?

546
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,140
Then bring me their wives and daughters.

547
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:20,065
I see.

548
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:23,065
In addition, ask a new emissary to go to Mobei,

549
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,820
showing him Li Changge's image.

550
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,243
I want to know all the Eagle Division's movements in Mobei.

551
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:29,340
Yes.

552
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,909
King.

553
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,910
They're clamoring for seeing you again.

554
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:41,087
Who?

555
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:42,688
The one who dressed up as God of Plague.

556
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:46,189
They call her "Changge".

557
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,879
Can she come to see me as she wants?

558
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,220
- Let them alone. 
 - Yes.

559
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,980
King, King of Monan comes.

560
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,100
He comes quickly this time.

561
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,500
- Bring him in. 
 - Yes.

562
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,621
You.

563
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,354
Go to the jail and bring his daughter here.

564
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:05,355
Yes!

565
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,399
We must protect our Young Master.

566
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,376
Play it by ear.

567
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:31,100
Come on! We waste an entire night!

568
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,580
How is Eagle Division?

569
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:36,189
Why hasn't no one come yet?

570
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,940
If we can't make a deal with them, then let's break out.

571
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:41,540
Probability of success?

572
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,132
About 60%.

573
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,380
We can have a try.

574
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,189
Fine.

575
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,499
Let's prepare for it first

576
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,776
and then take action in 30 minutes.

577
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:50,844
Okay.

578
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:00,065
Is he willing to see me?

579
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,265
You?

580
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,599
Impossible.

581
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,580
Our King wants to see Princess Tujia.

582
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:07,110
Princess Tujia?

583
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:08,700
Is there anyone called that?

584
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,540
Princess Tujia.

585
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,820
Princess Tujia.

586
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,043
Don't bother me!

587
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:24,940
Tell my father I'll get up later.

588
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,140
Time to get up, Princess Tujia.

589
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,620
You're Princess Tujia?

590
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,443
Our King asked Princess Tujia to go to see him.

591
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:39,509
Where is she?

592
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,443
Father... My father must come to save me!

593
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:42,780
I am!

594
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:45,740
This way, please.

595
00:35:47,155 --> 00:35:48,287
Don't worry!

596
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:50,820
As I see my father, I'll beg him to save you out!

597
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,740
I thought you would come in the afternoon.

598
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,180
But you come early in the morning.

599
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,660
You're really impatient.

600
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:15,300
Pusa.

601
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,332
I don't want to argue with you.

602
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,821
Tell me where my daughter is!

603
00:36:19,822 --> 00:36:21,132
Yinan.

604
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:23,140
Can you be polite?

605
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,776
Your words are ugly.

606
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:28,221
Your daughter carried soldiers of Monan,

607
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:29,509
crossing my territory,

608
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,843
and stole gromwells with unidentified spies,

609
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:32,999
trying to carry them away.

610
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,199
I haven't blamed you for all these things,

611
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,532
yet you're now quarreling with me?

612
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:37,821
Spies?

613
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,620
What spies?

614
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,620
I thought you ordered them to do that.

615
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,360
After thinking for a while,

616
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:48,460
you might have known Ashile Tribe's order

617
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:50,340
about banning trades of gromwells.

618
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:55,154
I think you dare not violate its order.

619
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:56,487
Pusa!

620
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:58,199
How dare you!

621
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,976
I can fight with you

622
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:01,420
but let my daughter off first!

623
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,060
- Tujia! 
 - Father!

624
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:10,821
Pusa!

625
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:12,329
If you hurt her,

626
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,500
then my troops will be ready to fight!

627
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:17,620
Yinan.

628
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:21,300
Haven't we got enough battles already?

629
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,887
If Ashile Tribe knows

630
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:25,799
she carried gromwells away secretly,

631
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,279
I'm afraid... What do you want?

632
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,887
Do you know that they called up soldiers from us quite often?

633
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:34,465
Come to the point!

634
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:35,710
The day before yesterday,

635
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,580
they came to call up again.

636
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,999
I've promised them I'll give them in ten days.

637
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,376
I've heard

638
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:43,643
you carried a battalion of cavalry elites

639
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:46,287
to find your daughter.

640
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:48,932
What about leaving them here

641
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,199
and carrying her back?

642
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,399
How do you think?

643
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,221
You've gone too far.

644
00:37:53,222 --> 00:37:54,500
Think of it.

645
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,460
Father...

646
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,060
Fine. I agree.

647
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,154
Let her go.

648
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,180
Loose her.

649
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,443
- Tujia! 
 - Father!

650
00:38:09,444 --> 00:38:10,687
Tujia!

651
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,799
My daughter!

652
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,065
Did you get hurt?

653
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,709
Did I make trouble with you again?

654
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,799
My daughter.

655
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,199
Don't be willful later on.

656
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,043
- Let's go back home. 
 - Father!

657
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:21,910
I wish you can do me a favor.

658
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:23,419
I had some new friends

659
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,999
and they've been arrested too.

660
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,860
Could you help them?

661
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:28,900
What friends?

662
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,665
I know you're not interested in gromwells.

663
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,859
Did they abet you to do so?

664
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,119
No! They're good people.

665
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,265
Your daughter is really simple.

666
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:38,900
She believes in all others' words.

667
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,580
Beware of deceptions.

668
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,100
Father, don't listen to him!

669
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,354
If you only know them by chance,

670
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:46,769
then don't raise new issues.

671
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,399
Father, please meet them.

672
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,776
Then you'll know they're all good!

673
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,599
Changge told me they needed gromwells to save people!

674
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,780
Save people?

675
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,687
Pusa.

676
00:38:58,688 --> 00:38:59,820
Bring her here.

677
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,532
More people, more cost.

678
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:05,700
Can you afford?

679
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,660
It's my business.

680
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:10,340
Just bring her here.

681
00:39:11,511 --> 00:39:12,549
You.

682
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,887
Go to bring her here.

683
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:15,900
Yes.

684
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:53,279
Noble emissary from Khan's Tent is here.

685
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,100
How dare you not go out to welcome me?

686
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,380
Well, can pigs fly now?

687
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,420
You guys stay together?

688
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,376
Fine.

689
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:06,740
Then I don't need to go to Monan in the hot sun.

690
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:09,380
The emissary from Khan's Tent?

691
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,443
What's the matter again?

692
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:12,887
Two things.

693
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:16,819
First, Great Khan orders Mobei and Monan

694
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,332
to deliver 10 thousand infantries separately.

695
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,700
Set out in 10 days.

696
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,710
Where to go?

697
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:28,620
Go to enlist in the troop of Dingxiang.

698
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,580
Khan's Tent is forcing them to deliver.

699
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:36,999
Dingxiang... Second,

700
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,639
Thanks to all you tribes for serving King's Tent.

701
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,599
Khan asked Khatun to invite all your female families

702
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,420
to Khan's Tent and live for a few days.

703
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,643
What female families?

704
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:50,540
Wife and daughter.

705
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,710
I have no wife and daughter.

706
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:57,643
I'm afraid you've made a futile run.

707
00:40:57,644 --> 00:41:00,140
I hear your mother is still alive...

708
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,021
I hear there's a cute young princess in Monan.

709
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:10,540
I won't go!

710
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,660
Well, here you're.

711
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,821
That's all.

712
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:19,500
I've told you all.

713
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,060
No one can violate Khan's orders.

714
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,020
Behave yourselves.

715
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,443
Do you remember?

716
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:52,510
Yes.

717
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:53,780
Don't alert them.

718
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:56,260
Report to me about her things at any time!

719
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,079
I've never seen him before...

720
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,460
while it seems

721
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,660
he knows me?

722
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,310
That man!

723
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:13,740
We can't let him leave!

724
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,776
Who are you?

725
00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:18,940
Changge!

726
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:21,620
She's the one you want.

727
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,900
I won't hold back.

728
00:42:25,533 --> 00:42:27,199
I'm the military counsellor of Eagle Division,

729
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,687
Ashile Sun's trusted follower.

730
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:29,976
Capture that man at once.

731
00:42:29,977 --> 00:42:31,857
I'll be solely responsible for the consequence!

732
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:35,369
How to be responsible for it?

733
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,421
If you offend Khan's Tent, no one here can be free!

734
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,176
You cannot be free now!

735
00:42:39,177 --> 00:42:40,576
Stop him at once!

736
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:41,900
We have no time!

737
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,465
I'm here to find gromwells

738
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,219
for a pestilence is raging in Eagle Division,

739
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,932
but Khan's Tent blockades all purchasing channels.

740
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:54,140
What does it mean?

741
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,310
It means they have abandoned Eagle Division.

742
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,420
Now, we have to form an alliance!

743
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,979
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

744
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,060
♫ gradually revives, ♫

745
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,340
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

746
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,900
♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫

747
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,220
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

748
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,739
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

749
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,140
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

750
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,140
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

751
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,059
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

752
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,899
♫ the longing flows. ♫

753
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,259
♫ There's always a moment ♫

754
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,620
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

755
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,499
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

756
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:07,219
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

757
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,619
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

758
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,899
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

759
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,459
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

760
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,780
♫ layer after layer. ♫

761
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,259
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

762
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:27,100
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

763
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,539
♫ There's always a moment ♫

764
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:41,179
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

765
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,779
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

766
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:51,099
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

767
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,659
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

768
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,019
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

769
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,499
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

770
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,379
♫ layer after layer. ♫

771
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,379
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

772
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:11,740
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

773
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,940
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

774
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:34,060
