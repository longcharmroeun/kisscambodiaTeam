♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,950
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,919
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,789
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,789

♫ The river of life is under my feet. ♫

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,760

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,480
The Long Ballad

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,260
Episode 34

22
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,238
The notice wrote that the court will distribute the unclaimed fields to refugees.

23
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,918
And those refugees will be free from rent and forced labor.

24
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,759
Build water conservancy projects and local public welfare barns.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,079
Help disaster areas by creating jobs.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
That's all.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,919
The water can float a boat, but also overturn it.

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,280
Do you think that he would be a good emperor?

29
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,199
If he dares to keep a slack hand,

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,360
I could kill him then.

31
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,399
It is not a bad choice to let him go.

32
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,599
Maybe.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
Although I'm not resigned to it,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
but I'm clear that he is the best choice for Tang dynasty now.

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,759
What's your next plan?

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,960
Now they are know I am staying here,

37
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,359
so staying in Luoyang is not a good choice.

38
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,520
The border invasion of Tang dynasty has finished.

39
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,639
I plan to go to the desert.

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,960
Then come with me.

41
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,479
It's been a while for me to stay here.

42
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,519
I have no idea how Eagle Division is now.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
It's time to go back.

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,999
I heard from Senior Qin that we could leave today.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So fast!

46
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:02,000
The passport I got from the officials is a literati family from the north.

47
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,720
Please call each other brother and sister later,

48
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,119
don't make any mistakes.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,920
Thanks for your arrangement, Senior Qin.

50
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,159
Brother,

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,199
let's go!

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,479
You are so beautiful, my sister.

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,039
Put this on,

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,720
don't make bad men covet at you.

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Disciple!

56
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,239
Master!

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Taoist Sun.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,399
Taoist Sun!

59
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,959
Luoyang is such a small place.

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,558
I never thought I would meet you here.

61
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,719
It seems that the destiny brings us together.

62
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,159
Where are you going?

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,239
Why not stay here for some more time?

64
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,799
No, no!

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,558
I heard that the emperor was asking to see me.

66
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,799
If his Majesty keeps me at the Imperial Medical Academy,

67
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,678
that will be too bad for me.

68
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:55,278
No!

69
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,839
I...I have to run!

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,320
This experience is both a disaster and a blessing for me.

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,760
I lost something but also gained a lot.

72
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,880
I finally understand my father's saying,

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,240
People's still living a hard life,

74
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,159
how could I look on with folded arms?

75
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,919
As my father's daughter,

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,799
how could I fall behind with no progress?

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,678
Sister!

78
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's go faster!

79
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,200
I'll never come to this hell again!

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Changge,

81
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,079
hope you all the best!

82
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Brother Li,

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,320
what are you doing here?

84
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,040
I'm here to see you off.

85
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,199
General Li.

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,359
Just call me brother Li.

87
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Brother Qin,

88
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
you are so bad!

89
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,839
You didn't even tell me that you are leaving.

90
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,040
Your girl is the princess.

91
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
What a good taste!

92
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,278
What are you talking about?

93
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,118
So mysterious!

94
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,278
Nothing.

95
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,959
How do you do, princess?

96
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,600
How do you do, Lord Wei?

97
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,679
Hope that you are well, princess.

98
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,200
I never thought that Lord Wei is also a free and unfettered man.

99
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,720
I have no more time to be free.

100
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,518
Several days later,

101
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,959
I will head to Chang'an with Minister Du.

102
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,118
Lord Wei endows with the talent to govern and to serve.

103
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,720
It's a pity to keep you in this countryside.

104
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:58,079
I envy you, princess.

105
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,759
The vast grassland abundant with rivers and vegetables,

106
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,159
and flocks and herds.

107
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,640
I really want to see it once I have a chance.

108
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,559
Brother Li,

109
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,479
how did you know that?

110
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,599
Don't be nervous.

111
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,799
I am here alone.

112
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,519
I have some words to say to you here.

113
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,839
Please, go ahead.

114
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,799
Actually, no Warcraft of Lord Wei exists.

115
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,320
That book was a lie.

116
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,119
I just wanted to see if you would give up your original aspiration for that warcraft.

117
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,279
But although there is no warcraft in this world,

118
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,119
strategists are.

119
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,760
Strategists can be generals and also swordsmen.

120
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:55,479
But a real strategist will never be defined by military accomplishments,

121
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,760
but his mind.

122
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,679
A benevolent heart is invincible.

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,398
Think about it.

124
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,559
Don't be anxious.

125
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:13,399
Someone can't figure it out in his whole life,

126
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,600
but I believe you can.

127
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:24,279
If one day we meet on the battlefield,

128
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,440
I will remember this.

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,799
A benevolent heart is invincible.

130
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,119
You are worth teaching.

131
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,519
Fine, it's time for me to go back,

132
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,320
or my wife would be angry.

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Goodbye!

134
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,799
Take care.

135
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,719
Lord Wei passed his lifetime experience on you,

136
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,039
No one could ever compare to his generosity!

137
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,239
Come on!

138
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,798
Just a few days passed,

139
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,000
this is the thirteenth one!

140
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,359
Grand Witch, what is happening now?

141
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,959
I've tried all my methods,

142
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,359
but I couldn't help it.

143
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,439
More and more people have been laid up these days.

144
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
That couldn't be possible.

145
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,639
The water and food here are all clean.

146
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,358
How could it be?

147
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,679
I made a divination today.

148
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:05,039
I'm afraid that...this is a curse from the god.

149
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,519
A curse?

150
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,839
No,

151
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,119
we have to notice Sun about it.

152
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,320
This disease is infectious,

153
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,880
I've put them in danger.

154
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,919
No!

155
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,080
It couldn't be like this anymore.

156
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
No...

157
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,799
we can't stay here any longer.

158
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
We must go!

159
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,760
Sister... Go!

160
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,320
Where are we going?

161
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,059
Master said that if you didn't listen to her,

162
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,719
you should know the consequence.

163
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Buzhen...

164
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,239
Where are we going?

165
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,840
Buzhen, Buzhen...

166
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,919
Help me!

167
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,679
Help!

168
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,119
Help!

169
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,239
Your Majesty.

170
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Mr. Du.

171
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,158
You're back.

172
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,719
Your Majesty.

173
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,679
I saw Li Changge in Luoyang.

174
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,640
You saw Changge?

175
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,479
The god blesses me!

176
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,718
It'd be good if she is safe.

177
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:07,558
After she killed the leftover villains of Chini at Liuyun Taoist Temple,

178
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,559
she escaped with a man from Ashile Tribe.

179
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,079
I failed to catch her.

180
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,000
Please forgive me, your Majesty!

181
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:18,479
You are saying that she was with a man from Ashile Tribe?

182
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,158
Before she escaped, she saved me at Liuyun Taoist Temple,

183
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,358
as well as people there.

184
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,359
Please stand up, Mr. Du.

185
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Yes...

186
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,159
Her adamant temper would never change no matter where she is,

187
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,679
or with whom she is getting along.

188
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,280
Thanks to that she is still alive,

189
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,919
or I would be guilty all my life.

190
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,840
No worries, your Majesty!

191
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,158
Li Changge not only lives a powerful life,

192
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,880
but also is killing people fiercely.

193
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,639
Mr. Du.

194
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,320
You've been a cautious man,

195
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,599
why did you let her go this time?

196
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,960
It's my fault.

197
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,000
But Li Changge is so cunning.

198
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,780
[Nan'an Courier Hostel]

199
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,119
I'm so tired!

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,118
I have to take a good shower first and then have a big meal!

201
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:54,798
Go!

202
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,799
Yes.

203
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,319
Princess.

204
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
It's time for dinner.

205
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,239
Princess.

206
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,880
This is princess's dinner.

207
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,599
Yes.

208
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,719
Come on, give it to me.

209
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,559
Go out, I don't want to eat.

210
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,239
Brother Shuyu.

211
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,879
Why is it you?

212
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,598
I heard Haodu's voice just now.

213
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,119
Still angry with Haodu?

214
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,279
He lied to me and took advantage of me,

215
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,479
I'd never forgive him.

216
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,440
But you should eat.

217
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Come on.

218
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,598
I'm also a bit hungry.

219
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,640
Let's have it together.

220
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,359
These are all from Haodu.

221
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,559
Then put it away.

222
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,760
I won't eat his food.

223
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:07,799
Do you feel that Haodu has changed?

224
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,478
I admit,

225
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:20,880
Haodu is much more kinder and softer than before.

226
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,718
But he lied to me,

227
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,320
and almost harmed Changge.

228
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,718
Whenever I thought this, I feel...

229
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,320
What if Haodu saved Changge?

230
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,479
What do you mean?

231
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,359
I have to tell you something.

232
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,558
That day when we were fighting with Chini at Liuyun Taoist Temple,

233
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,678
Changge was there too.

234
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,760
You know that.

235
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,239
But do you know how she escaped?

236
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,238
Changge is such a clever girl.

237
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,199
There were so many ways for her to escape.

238
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,478
Even if she is the cleverest man in the world,

239
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:54,598
she was encircled by soldiers at Liuyun Taoist Temple.

240
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,039
How could she escape without being noticed?

241
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:04,879
Are you saying that it was Haodu who secretly let her go?

242
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,439
I sent someone to ask about it.

243
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,438
When a soldier was counting bodies,

244
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,119
he found that a body was moving.

245
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,079
But Haodu scolded him, and said he was dimmed.

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,439
It seemed that it might be Changge.

247
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,920
But hasn't he been catching Changge all the time?

248
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Who knows?

249
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,118
Maybe Changge changed him,

250
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,640
or you might wake him up by slapping.

251
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,679
Brother Shuyu.

252
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,400
Why are you telling me these?

253
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,759
You changed your view on him?

254
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Change?

255
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,400
I still hate him.

256
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,438
But it's the fact.

257
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,598
You have the right to know.

258
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,039
I'm telling you these,

259
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,199
because I want you to accept his protection.

260
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,000
After all, he is quite a good bodyguard.

261
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,160
Thanks, Brother Shuyu.

262
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
Have your dinner, or it would be cold.

263
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:23,079
The grassland is ahead of us.

264
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,519
Young Master.

265
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,479
No matter where you are, I would always be with you.

266
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,479
Senior Qin,

267
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,819
for these years in Shuozhou,

268
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,280
you should hate and fear Ashile Tribe the most.

269
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,838
Senior Qin.

270
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,839
Why not...

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,639
I'll only follow masters with wisdom this whole life.

272
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,040
Others never matter to me.

273
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,599
Senior Qin.

274
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,560
I promise you safe when you are at Eagle Division.

275
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,438
A'Zhun.

276
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:56,039
You underestimated me.

277
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,519
I'm such an old man, what do I fear?

278
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,880
I didn't mean that.

279
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,159
It's quite late now.

280
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,478
Have a rest.

281
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,039
We have to continue our journey tomorrow.

282
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,078
Young Master, you too.

283
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,958
I'll let Xu Feng stay here.

284
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,198
Xu Feng might lull Yuan to sleep.

285
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,478
Don't wake him up.

286
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,478
Senior Qin, go to have rest now.

287
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,479
Okay.

288
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Go.

289
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Stop.

290
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Tegin.

291
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,879
I never thought that you really found our young counsellor back.

292
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
Yaro, why are you here?

293
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,078
Mu Jin asked me to look for you in Tang,

294
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,718
but I find you here.

295
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,159
Tegin, come back quickly!

296
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,519
Eagle Division is in trouble.

297
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,838
What?

298
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,159
Grant Witch said that we were cursed.

299
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,400
Cursed?

300
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,118
I...I don't know it.

301
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,238
But many people in Eagle Division got a disease.

302
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,318
Ragged plaque appeared on their body,

303
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,879
and many people died.

304
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,598
Grant Witch had no way to solve it.

305
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,760
Go back and have a look!

306
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,279
Ragged plaque?

307
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,318
A disease?

308
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,319
Yes.

309
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,118
But Taoist Sun just left.

310
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,039
Senior Qin, can I ask you for help?

311
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,318
Go ahead, master.

312
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,598
Could you send people to find Taoist Sun back?

313
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,718
Because they are going on a donkey carriage,

314
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,519
they can't go too far.

315
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,478
No worries.

316
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,279
I'll send someone to find Taoist Sun back.

317
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Thanks, Senior Qin.

318
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,838
Yaro, have some rest now.

319
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,759
We will go back to Eagle Division tomorrow morning.

320
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Yes.

321
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,159
Changge.

322
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Sun.

323
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,439
You can't shake me off.

324
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:41,760
We've been through so many scary things together.

325
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,478
We agreed to go through all the hardships together.

326
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,760
The same this time.

327
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay.

328
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,239
Together.

329
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,719
Buzhen.

330
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Brother,

331
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,078
you're awake.

332
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,199
Sorry...

333
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,079
It's okay.

334
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,358
I'm here.

335
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,800
You'll be okay.

336
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:23,399
Sister, I'm dying... Don't say that.

337
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,039
You are still young.

338
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,958
You will live to one hundred.

339
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,160
So good.

340
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,880
I can have a sister with me at last...

341
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,719
You'll be okay.

342
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,000
They sent me to transfer message to you.

343
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,959
But I accidentally got infected on my way here.

344
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,479
You'll be okay.

345
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:12,680
They said that as long as you saw my face, you would bring me back.

346
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,359
It's okay.

347
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,078
It's okay.

348
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,079
You'll be okay.

349
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,160
Buzhen.

350
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Buzhen.

351
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,160
Is his name Buzhen?

352
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,119
He's so lucky to have you as his sister.

353
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
It's okay.

354
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll be with you.

355
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,719
There's no slave in heaven.

356
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,400
I'll get a basin of water for you,

357
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,000
and send you away with a clean body.

358
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,759
Mimi Guli,

359
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,958
are you there?

360
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,159
Mu Jin is with the Grand Witch now.

361
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,639
He asked me to take some spice for you to ward off evil.

362
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,599
You can burn it on the fire.

363
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Are you in there?

364
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:29,719
I'm coming in.

365
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,280
This boy is the curse.

366
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,679
And she, is the one who brought the curse here.

367
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,639
It's her!

368
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,919
It's her!

369
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,160
Fine, Mimi Guli.

370
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,838
We Eagle Division kept you here,

371
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,400
but you dared to curse us!

372
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,039
You harmed my son.

373
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,879
He is dying now.

374
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,439
Give him back to me!

375
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,159
Sorry.

376
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,198
Excuse me... What can a sorry do?

377
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,679
- Give my son back! 
 - Leave her alone!

378
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,599
Make this clear first!

379
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,598
Mimi.

380
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,279
Where did he come from?

381
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,800
You had nothing to do with him, right?

382
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,520
I saved him.

383
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,680
I secretly hid him here in my tent.

384
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,719
I...

385
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,280
I didn't think that he would be...

386
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
He...

387
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,119
She was bewitched.

388
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,439
So she could curse everybody!

389
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,779
Or why did she stay with the curse all the time

390
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,400
without getting infected?

391
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,639
Yes... Mu Jin.

392
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,958
You heard what Grand Witch said?

393
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,999
It was all her who made us harmed.

394
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,919
She is already bewitched.

395
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
We can't keep her here.

396
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,159
Kill her!

397
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,799
Kill her!

398
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,238
Yes!

399
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:00,799
Kill her!

400
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Kill her!

401
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,319
Mu Jin.

402
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:07,959
Mimi Guli can't stay here any longer.

403
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,999
Kill her! Kill her!

404
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,198
Kill her! Kill her!

405
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:18,159
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

406
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,919
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

407
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,279
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

408
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,159
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

409
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,560
You still want to protect her.

410
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,198
Mu Jin.

411
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:30,079
You are obsessed with this demon, aren't you?

412
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,639
Mimi Guli is also a member of Eagle Division.

413
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,879
I can't see you burning her to death without doing anything!

414
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,718
Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!

415
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,879
She can't stay.

416
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,838
Burn her! Burn her!

417
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,400
Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!

418
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,400
You hear that?

419
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Stay away.

420
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,119
Get out of the way!

421
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,879
Do you want all the people to die with her?

422
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,520
If you want to burn her, burn me first!

423
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,799
Burn her! Burn her!

424
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,958
Mu Jin!

425
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:02,958
Burn her! Burn her!

426
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:03,958
Mu Jin!

427
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,958
Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!

428
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,198
Burn her!

429
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,359
Stay away!

430
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,919
Stop!

431
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,759
Tegin! Tegin!

432
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Tegin!

433
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,800
Sun!

434
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,078
Tegin!

435
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,159
You came back just in time!

436
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,760
Mimi Guli brought a curse to us.

437
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,559
We have had so many people ill.

438
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
They are dying.

439
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,318
Tegin,

440
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,959
you have to uphold justice for us.

441
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,519
Yes, yes!

442
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,039
Uphold justice for us!

443
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,359
Uphold justice for us! Yes!

444
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,919
We Eagle Division never kill each other!

445
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,079
Nothing will be a reason for us to kill each other!

446
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Yes, he's right!

447
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,760
But Tegin... I will take charge of it.

448
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,119
I'll give everybody an answer.

449
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,118
Everybody,

450
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,239
go back now.

451
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:07,958
Go, let's go.

452
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,679
Go, go.

453
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,198
Go back.

454
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,399
Let's go.

455
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Forget it.

456
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,119
Untie her.

457
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,639
Mimi...

458
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
- Mimi! 
 - Changge...

459
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,958
You finally come back!

460
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,399
You finally come back!

461
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Are you frightened?

462
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,239
It's okay now, it's okay.

463
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:37,560
Don't be afraid.

464
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,118
I'm back.

465
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,198
Everything would be okay.

466
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,239
Don't cry.

467
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,598
I just checked on those clansmen who got cursed.

468
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,598
How are they?

469
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,198
It may not be a curse.

470
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,199
It's plague.

471
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,599
Plague?

472
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,479
Follow me.

473
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
Go, follow me.

474
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,199
Mimi.

475
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,359
Where did you save him?

476
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,040
I herd sheep every morning.

477
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,680
He fainted outside the sheepfold.

478
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,839
I...

479
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,599
Do you know where he came from?

480
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,438
Since he got infected,

481
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,719
he couldn't have gone far.

482
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,040
Maybe he's from a tribe nearby.

483
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,400
It's okay, don't be afraid.

484
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,358
I know you wanted to save him.

485
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,000
But I think it's a little abnormal.

486
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,879
Did he say anything to you before he died?

487
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,079
No, Buzhen...

488
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,078
Buzhen?

489
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,198
Is his name Buzhen?

490
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,239
No...

491
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,560
I don't know his name.

492
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,438
I just call him this.

493
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,279
But if I hadn't taken him back,

494
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,680
he would have died.

495
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:25,439
I know, I know.

496
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,560
Calm down.

497
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,519
We will be with you all the time.

498
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,039
Stay here.

499
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,118
I'll go find Sun.

500
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,119
I'll be back soon.

501
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,839
I...

502
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,039
Plague is an incurable disease on grasslands.

503
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,318
What's the difference between it and curse?

504
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,319
If we call it a curse,

505
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,078
people would have a glimmer of hope.

506
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,359
The plague can't have no source.

507
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:13,000
It must be related to the boy brought back by Mimi.

508
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,238
Any information?

509
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,520
She calls him Buzhen.

510
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,160
I feel quite acquainted with this name.

511
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,599
Buzhen...

512
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,839
Did he know Mimi?

513
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,959
Maybe in some other relationship.

514
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,719
I'll go and ask her.

515
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,559
Wait.

516
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,239
Mimi won't say anything she doesn't want to say.

517
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,598
Okay.

518
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,958
I won't ask.

519
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,759
I will accompany her for a while later.

520
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,999
Leave Mimi alone first.

521
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,078
Sun.

522
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,118
What are you going to do about the plague?

523
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,438
Tonight, new tents should be built outside the campsite..

524
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:53,958
The patients will be treated in new tents.

525
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,279
This should be done as soon as possible.

526
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,399
Mu Jin,

527
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,039
arrange people and horses.

528
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,879
Help them transfer,

529
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,679
and move goods and materials.

530
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,478
Relatives can apply for going together.

531
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,040
We will cure them at any costs.

532
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,079
Yes.

533
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,079
Is this your routine?

534
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:14,719
Changge.

535
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,159
You know in our grassland,

536
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,359
if we encounter snowstorm during the migration,

537
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,319
what would we do?

538
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,719
Unite in a concerted effort to protect women and children?

539
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,599
No.

540
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,280
The old, weak, sick and disabled would stand outside,

541
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:36,119
to fend against snowstorm for those strong warriors and women.

542
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,280
And then they would die.

543
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,680
But I don't want this sacrifice.

544
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,480
There's also a convention in our central plains.

545
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,759
Do one's best and leave the rest to God.

546
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,838
But if you didn't exert all energies,

547
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,438
and try your best,

548
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,040
you can't leave it to god.

549
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Maybe...

550
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:57,359
Maybe we missed some other ways.

551
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,198
What way?

552
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:01,399
It's been such a long time for Mimi to look after this boy.

553
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,920
And he was the source of plague.

554
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,079
Why didn't Mimi get infected?

555
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,799
You evil!

556
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,280
Give my son back!

557
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,759
Wait!

558
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,039
I'll kill you!

559
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,478
Only you are killed, can we be saved!

560
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:39,119
And my son would be saved!

561
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,479
Don't run!

562
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,479
How could you be so silly?

563
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,239
Why...

564
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,399
Why were you protecting me?

565
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Why?

566
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,079
It's good that you are okay.

567
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Mu Jin...

568
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,680
Sorry!

569
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,560
These red spots...

570
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,599
It's all my fault.

571
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,239
Mu Jin is infected now.

572
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,078
All these spots are the same with those on the dead.

573
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,079
We can't wait anymore.

574
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,318
I'll stay with Mu Jin outside our campsite.

575
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,078
No.

576
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,239
We have no other choice now.

577
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,880
Mu Jin can't be left behind.

578
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,198
I will treat Mu Jin.

579
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,319
But if you got infected too,

580
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:52,879
what could Eagle Division do?

581
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,280
Send him to my place,

582
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
I'll look after him.

583
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
No.

584
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,160
I'll look after him.

585
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,800
All this was because of me.

586
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:13,479
And Mu Jin became like this due to my fault.

587
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,519
No, Mimi.

588
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,759
You would die if you go out now.

589
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,479
Even if I die,

590
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,320
I deserve that.

591
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Don't worry.

592
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,479
I'll take good care of him.

593
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,080
Taoist Sun! Master!

594
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,279
Senior Qin was so fast to take you here.

595
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,040
You are clever to ask Senior Qin to find me.

596
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,438
What curse?

597
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,639
Nonsense!

598
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,559
I have seen this situation so many times.

599
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,599
It must be a serious plague.

600
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,839
If I was not here,

601
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,119
how could you two deal with it?

602
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,958
Yes.

603
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,119
Thanks, Taoist Sun!

604
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,799
But you have to be cautious!

605
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,478
Because many people have been infected.

606
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:10,759
If not,

607
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,080
why would I come?

608
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,599
Taoist Sun, let me lead you.

609
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,678
Please follow me.

610
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,799
Please, Taoist.

611
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
You lead the way.

612
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,999
Senior Qin.

613
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,398
How are Shiba and Xu Feng?

614
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:25,958
Yuan is still too young,

615
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:26,999
I was afraid of her getting infected.

616
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,219
I asked Shiba and Xu Feng

617
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,039
to wait outside the tent of Eagle Division with Yuan.

618
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,918
That would be good.

619
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:33,438
Then Senior Qin,

620
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:34,519
you don't have to come inside either.

621
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,638
Wait for our message.

622
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,639
Okay.

623
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,320
Greetings, father.

624
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,560
Father.

625
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,639
Yan.

626
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,639
It's good for you to come back!

627
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,159
Greetings, father.

628
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Come on.

629
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,399
Yan,

630
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,800
you... you are thinner than before.

631
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,239
It's my fault to worry you, father.

632
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,958
Father, I am thinner too,

633
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,759
I nearly couldn't make my way back.

634
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,840
In Luoyang...I...

635
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,238
Father.

636
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,679
My life was so hard in Luoyang.

637
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,199
Why did I hear that you had a good time in Luoyang?

638
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,239
Even Minister Du couldn't control you.

639
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,238
I know I was not right and made a big trouble.

640
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,999
I regret to do it too.

641
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,239
Sister has already scolded me for father.

642
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,760
Right, sister?

643
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,600
You're welcome, brother.

644
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,520
I didn't scold you.

645
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,239
You asked for it.

646
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,599
Father.

647
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,678
Sister beat me many times for this.

648
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,120
She held a stick like this to beat me.

649
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,840
I offended crown prince.

650
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,959
I accept my punishment.

651
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yan.

652
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,560
I think you are more and more like Changge now.

653
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Father.

654
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:00,959
Although I am not Changge,

655
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,800
I got improved a lot after this disaster.

656
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,599
Sorry, father.

657
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,199
I was wrong.

658
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:21,279
Father, please forgive me for my sister's sake.

659
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,040
Go back to your Eastern Palace and ponder upon your faults!

660
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,559
Okay.

661
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,399
I will not disturb father's conversation with sister.

662
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,719
Yan,

663
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:54,718
it's been a hard way for you.

664
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,719
Father.

665
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,479
I don't think it's hard for me.

666
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:04,079
And this experience is worthy of volumes of books,

667
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,640
and I'm so lucky to have it in my life.

668
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,600
My Yan is much different from the one in the past.

669
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,319
Are you hungry?

670
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,878
Have dinner with me,

671
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,679
and chat while eating, okay?

672
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,199
I'll listen to father.

673
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,238
Taoist Sun.

674
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,239
How is it?

675
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,399
What curse?

676
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:26,959
Nonsense!

677
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,600
Just plague.

678
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:35,238
Then could it be treated?

679
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,359
Only invalid herb exists in this world,

680
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,159
but no incurable disease.

681
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,478
So you already have had a method to cure them?

682
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,399
Although this is serious,

683
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,199
we still have time.

684
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Give me a pen and paper.

685
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,158
[Gromwell,stemmed, five qian; cicada slough; Angelica sinensis]

686
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,958
These herbs are quite common.

687
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,119
Eagle Division has these,

688
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,198
but we don't have one of them.

689
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,279
What?

690
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Gromwell.

691
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,878
Could it be substituted by others?

692
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:19,958
No.

693
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,080
Adjuvant could be substitute,

694
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,919
but this could not be changed.

695
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,759
There's something that you don't know.

696
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,759
Plague came from the desert,

697
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,199
but it never came to the grassland.

698
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,479
That's because that the local usually eat and wear lithospermum.

699
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:44,919
That's it!

700
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,478
No wonder I didn't get infected.

701
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:48,878
Every time I got fever when I was young,

702
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,319
my father treated me with gromwell.

703
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,019
As far as I know, once you get this plague,

704
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,800
you won't get infected again.

705
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,479
So she was not just lucky,

706
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,679
but have immunity against it.

707
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,958
We can find this gromwell.

708
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:14,080
But how can we control his state of illness now?

709
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,760
Don't worry,

710
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,999
I can give you a prescription,

711
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,199
and let them drink it.

712
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,119
It can relieve their illness a little,

713
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,240
and save them out of danger.

714
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:29,678
But they have to have gromwell in ten days,

715
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,159
or even immortals could not save them.

716
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,119
Gromwell is from the north of the desert,

717
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,800
I thought that you would have it.

718
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,800
Khan's Tent must have it.

719
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,478
I'll go and ask for it.

720
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:46,479
Wait.

721
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,878
Eagle Division is quite unstable now,

722
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:50,279
if you go now,

723
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,040
I'm afraid that they would find ways to harm Mimi.

724
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,320
It would be a mess again.

725
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,238
Tegin,

726
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,319
I can go.

727
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,359
I'm fast.

728
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,718
Besides, I am just a nobody.

729
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,360
Great Khan won't bewilder me.

730
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:09,519
Don't worry, Tegin.

731
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,199
I promise that I'll be back with the herb safely.

732
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Okay.

733
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,040
I've written down the moves of Dingxiang in Central Plains.

734
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,279
Give this to Great Khan,

735
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,280
he will understand as soon as he finishes reading.

736
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,638
Yes.

737
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,639
Go.

738
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,700
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

739
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,020
♫ gradually revives, ♫

740
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,939
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

741
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,100
♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫

742
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,420
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

743
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,859
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

744
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:11,500
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

745
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,220
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

746
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,139
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

747
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,939
♫ the longing flows. ♫

748
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,819
♫ There's always a moment ♫

749
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:29,500
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

750
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,380
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

751
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:40,299
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

752
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,940
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

753
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,259
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

754
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,020
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

755
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,820
♫ layer after layer. ♫

756
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,419
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

757
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,980
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

758
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,659
♫ There's always a moment ♫

759
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:14,459
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

760
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,460
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

761
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:24,379
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

762
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,300
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

763
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,860
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

764
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,540
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

765
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,100
♫ layer after layer. ♫

766
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,100
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

767
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,220
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

768
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,700
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

769
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,060
The Long Ballad
