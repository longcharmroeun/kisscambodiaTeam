00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,480
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,260
Episode 46

3
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,870
I didn’t expect you to do it for me

4
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,550
By hitting the Crown Prince

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,510
Thanks a lot

6
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,230
Why are you here

7
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,190
You asked Emperor Tang to lock us together

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,350
I’m here to take you out

9
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,830
You can leave soon

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,830
I

11
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,550
What about you

12
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,430
You

13
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,830
What’s the price for you to go back

14
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,310
She’er

15
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,550
Before going back

16
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,070
I still decide to tell you something

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,710
I didn’t kill your wolf

18
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,230
All these years

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,950
This is the only thing

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,190
I can’t forgive Father Khan

21
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,750
He didn’t want to

22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,150
See us two brothers care for one another

23
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,950
Only by restricting each other

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,790
Is best for his throne

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,550
He killed your little wolf

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,030
Made wolf skin into a quiver

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,870
Gave it to me

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,150
Why did you tell me now?

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,590
Just say what you want

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,270
What?

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,870
Afraid you won’t have a chance after I go out

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,110
Afraid I can’t accept it

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,230
The truth

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,790
Can you accept it

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,870
Even if you can accept it

36
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,670
Do you dare to resist

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,950
She’er

38
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,030
For the grassland

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,270
There must be someone between us

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,630
Stand up and do it

41
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,110
That person is me

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,350
Sun

43
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,590
What are you going to do

44
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,790
This is Mu Jin of the Eagle Division

45
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,990
You all know each other

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,510
Hiding in Dingxiang for many days

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,550
Plot a rebellion

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,110
Now Ashile Tribe

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,230
Relocated to Dingxiang

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,550
Hope you know the current affairs

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,190
Focus on Dingxiang

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,110
Anyone who has two minds

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,710
All ends like this

54
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,150
Rest assured

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,790
Your master didn’t come

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,670
I won’t kill you

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,950
Kill or not

58
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,190
Listen well

59
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,270
Mother

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,390
I thought you wouldn’t come to greet your mother

61
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,630
I will always be your son

62
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,790
Even if it doesn’t connect with me

63
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,150
Our mother and son

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,510
It’s just a perfect match

65
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,510
Mother

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,030
I have been in prison these few days

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,510
I often think of my childhood

68
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,990
Every day at that time

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,270
Fell asleep in Mother’s arms

70
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,830
With Mother

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,950
No need to fight, no need to grab

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,470
No worries nor fear

73
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,390
Is the most pleasant time

74
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,830
But in your heart

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,550
So-called cozy time

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,790
All fragile

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,150
Just a word from your Uncle Khan

78
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,990
Can easily break

79
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,550
Everything Mother does now

80
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,270
Just for the future

81
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,190
No one will tear us apart again

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,510
Only our mother and son

83
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,510
Really strong

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,830
In order to be stable

85
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,190
Understand?

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,110
Let’s go

87
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,390
Go home with Mother

88
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,590
Tang Emperor

89
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,030
A princess of Great Tang

90
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,550
Pretending to be the envoy of Mobei

91
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,950
I don’t know if it’s your arrangement

92
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,470
I hope it’s my arrangement

93
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,230
It’s a pity that the princess

94
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,230
Would rather be the Mobei Princess

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,070
And not willing to go back to Chang’an

96
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,550
Envoys

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,430
The grievances between me and Great Tang

98
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,710
It’s my personal business

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,950
Many reasons for this

100
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,630
I don’t need to say more

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,470
But since I can

102
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,790
On behalf as the Envoy of Mobei

103
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,790
That was instructed by the King of Mobei

104
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,150
I don’t need to say much

105
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,670
I can prove

106
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,710
King of Mobei and my father

107
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,590
Reach a consensus

108
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,270
Unanimously to form an alliance with Great Tang

109
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,870
In addition

110
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,910
How do I deal with the princess

111
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,350
I don’t need to explain to you guys

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,190
Is the identity of this princess

113
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,590
Between the ministries and Great Tang

114
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,790
Is the key to peace?

115
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,550
This is not

116
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,070
This indeed

117
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,670
It’s Great Tang’s own family affair

118
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,990
Has nothing to do with me

119
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,230
I just want to ask Tang Emperor

120
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,670
Your Majesty wants to release Young Khan

121
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,030
Dealing with Ashile Tribe

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,310
Why

123
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,670
Lied to be allies with the desert

124
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,750
Is this the tribes

125
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,870
That Ashley Tribe

126
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,270
The list of the abducted hundred names

127
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,630
There is still a list

128
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,910
The beginning of the alliance

129
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,870
Great Tang wanted to serve the various ministries of the Great Desert

130
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,830
Return the captives

131
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,030
Everyone, this is Ashile Tribe

132
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,670
Honorary roster of prisoners

133
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,830
Nothing missing

134
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,790
Therefore, Tang Emperor

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,030
Did you release Young Khan?

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,830
Young Khan intends to assassinate the East Palace

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,230
Sent someone to assassinate

138
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,950
As a personal servant of the prince

139
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,470
Except for this reason

140
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,630
Why do I still release

141
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,310
A criminal who committed such a felony

142
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,950
This covenant is always valid

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,270
If you don’t want to

144
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,470
Sign with Great Tang

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,270
I will never force

146
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,110
Tribes that don’t want to be allies

147
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,070
Don’t worry

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,390
I will still treat your people

149
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,190
Sent you home safe and sound

150
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,390
If you don’t sign

151
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,630
We can still leave

152
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,510
Yeah

153
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,630
You can go as you like

154
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,390
Not only will Great Tang not stop

155
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,950
Will send troops to escort

156
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,750
A long way

157
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,870
It will take time for you to return to your hometown

158
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,110
Presumably when you arrive home

159
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,510
Great Tang has put your people

160
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,270
They were all sent back safely

161
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,430
Have been sent back

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,070
Great Tang today promises

163
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,830
No matter whether it is an alliance or not

164
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,070
No worries about each tribes

165
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,110
And Great Tang’s ally

166
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,110
If you have something to ask for help in the future

167
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,590
Great Tang will support to the end

168
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,630
Good now

169
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,390
You can rest assured now

170
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,110
Yeah this is great

171
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,270
I just got my life back in Zhixi

172
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,590
Speaking of

173
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,990
I really owe Great Tang a kindness

174
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,830
What else can’t be trusted

175
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,270
My Tiele Tribe

176
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,310
Willing to form an alliance with Great Tang

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,270
We Monan will also signed

178
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,630
If the princess is afraid of pain

179
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,630
The red mud on the side can be used to stamped

180
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,030
Everyone, we came to Great Tang

181
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,230
Just to form an alliance

182
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,310
Are you going back empty-handed?

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,990
Just form an alliance

184
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,390
Yes yes yes

185
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,350
This this

186
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,630
Great Tang and various ministries

187
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,510
Today’s blood is an alliance

188
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,630
Regardless of disasters and wars in the future

189
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,950
Great Tang and other ministries advance and retreat together

190
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,790
No regrets

191
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,990
Mimi

192
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,110
If you wanna leave

193
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,110
I will find a way

194
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,550
Transfer you away from Mother

195
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,750
No need

196
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,110
Why

197
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,270
I want to stay with Khatun

198
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,150
I still have someone I want to meet

199
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,830
Arrived in Dingxiang

200
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,910
I will protect you

201
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,470
Changge

202
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,350
I know you hate me

203
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,830
But I’m still your second uncle

204
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,790
If you are willing

205
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,470
I will keep you in the name of the queen

206
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,110
Share the honor of Princess with Leyan

207
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,390
You can live happily in Chang’an

208
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,550
No one will force you to marry

209
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,590
Or do any

210
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,070
Things you don’t want to do

211
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,470
So you let A’Sun

212
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,550
Go to Dingxiang alone

213
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,310
Facing the unknown

214
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,270
Just for 

215
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,790
Me have a stable life

216
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,470
That’s Tegin Sun’s own choice

217
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,830
You should understand his intentions

218
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,510
What I don’t want

219
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,910
Chang’an’s wealth and prosperity

220
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,870
I don’t want

221
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,030
The name of the princess

222
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,830
Where is A’Sun

223
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,590
I will be there

224
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,750
Dingxiang storm is approaching

225
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,790
Perilous

226
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,830
I can’t let you take risks anymore

227
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,270
Changge, you have to come home

228
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,590
Second Uncle won’t let you go again

229
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,870
Come home

230
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,190
For today’s court

231
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,990
My existence

232
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,550
It’s just a hidden danger

233
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,870
Why do you force me to stay

234
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,590
Let’s just say

235
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,110
You want to compensate

236
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,110
Come to calm your heart

237
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,270
Compensation

238
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,310
Because of your mother’s

239
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,750
Final hope

240
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,750
She hope you will be safe

241
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,870
This is your mother’s

242
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,990
Only wish

243
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,950
Mother

244
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,950
I know this day

245
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,550
Will come sooner or later

246
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,390
I will send you mother and daughter away

247
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,470
After that

248
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,070
What kind of life do you want to live

249
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,150
I will arrange for you

250
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,990
Until now

251
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,430
You treat me and Changge

252
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,750
As thoughtful as before

253
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,750
But

254
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,230
I’m not blessed anymore to enjoy

255
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,390
Madam, don’t be too persistent

256
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,990
No one can control the affairs of the temple

257
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,390
Even if there is no Madam

258
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,190
Maybe it will be today

259
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,910
Such a result

260
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,350
Not

261
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,030
I can’t pass this level of myself

262
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,430
That day

263
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,750
It’s the letter I wrote to you

264
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,910
I know

265
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,910
I can never go back

266
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,950
Although the Crown Prince never touched me

267
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,190
Never treated me harshly

268
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,950
But I betrayed him

269
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,790
I didn’t want to kill him

270
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,470
If Your Highness doesn’t kill

271
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,230
You will be killed

272
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,030
Country’s royal power

273
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,190
I am a woman

274
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,230
What can I say

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,870
That year

276
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,990
You saved my life

277
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,910
And treat Changge as your own

278
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,150
Teach her how to behave

279
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,270
Changge also regards you as a father

280
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,630
I can see all of these

281
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,510
Now I use this way

282
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,950
I’m still paying back what I owe you

283
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,310
Crown Prince

284
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,550
Crown Prince, what can I use to repay him?

285
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,790
But

286
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,670
I still have to thank you

287
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,950
Don’t be impulsive

288
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,910
Don’t come over

289
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,190
Promise me

290
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,550
You have to protect Changge

291
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,070
Her safety forever

292
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,670
Make her happy

293
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,710
Happy

294
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,070
Do whatever she wants

295
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,790
Don’t let her marry

296
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,390
Someone she doesn’t want to marry

297
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,990
Don’t let her suffer any wrongdoing

298
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,350
You promise me

299
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,950
I promise I promise

300
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,790
Don’t be impulsive

301
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,750
This time

302
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,950
I owe no one

303
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,670
A’Jin!

304
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,110
One is my father

305
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,750
One is you

306
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,910
No matter which one of you die

307
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,830
Mother can’t live, right?

308
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,550
Where’s Mother’s letter

309
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,550
Where

310
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,870
I want to see

311
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,230
Naturally burned

312
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,470
How can I leave evidence

313
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,430
Your Mother repaid me

314
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,390
Between dilemmas

315
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,030
She finally chose to kill herself

316
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,470
Come to seek relief

317
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,390
Second Uncle deserves no shame in this life

318
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,230
Only when I think of her

319
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,030
My heart always hurts badly

320
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,550
Changge, whether you believe it or not

321
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,630
Second Uncle never

322
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,870
Want your life

323
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,510
I want to protect you

324
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,550
But I don’t know where you are

325
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,150
Eventful autumn here

326
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,470
To be up to one’s ears in work

327
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,630
I don’t know many things

328
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,710
Later learned

329
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,030
Your exile

330
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,390
I learned that because of Great Tang

331
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,710
The sacrifice made

332
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,870
Second Uncle feels distressed

333
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,750
Changge stay

334
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,390
Let me take good care of you

335
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,230
If you give me another chance

336
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,110
I will still make

337
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,190
Same choice

338
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,830
I am willing to serve the people of Great Tang

339
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,750
Sacrifice oneself

340
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,710
But I definitely can’t

341
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,510
Let those who love me sacrifice for me

342
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,870
Dingxiang

343
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,150
I must go

344
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,310
I should have been pleased with your remarks

345
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,670
But now

346
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,630
The war with Ashile Tribe

347
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,870
On the verge of

348
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,830
This Dingxiang

349
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,670
If you have to go

350
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,110
Then your mother’s request

351
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,830
I’m afraid I will fail

352
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,430
You go

353
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,350
Maybe you and me from now on

354
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,470
Forget it

355
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,430
You and I are not

356
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,990
Ordinary people of a household

357
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,670
Can’t just seek

358
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,110
The simplest ordinary joy

359
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,750
Changge has grown up now

360
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,750
Have your own path to choose

361
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,750
I say no more

362
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,750
Child take care

363
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,830
Second Uncle waits for you to come back

364
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,910
This will always be your home

365
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,870
It’s true you killed my father

366
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,310
It’s true that you are my second uncle

367
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,910
If one day

368
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,990
You are not good to the people

369
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,950
I will come back to you to settle the account

370
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,270
Okay

371
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,750
A’Jin

372
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,270
Your daughter looks like you

373
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,630
Your Majesty

374
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,790
This is from Princess Yongning

375
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,630
She asked someone to submit it when I was leaving the palace

376
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,590
Mother

377
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,710
It turns out all this

378
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,390
It’s your choice

379
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,350
Regretting that Mother

380
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,910
Bear all this alone

381
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,150
Only blame Changge for understanding too late

382
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,350
I came today

383
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,470
I want to say goodbye to Mother

384
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,150
I am going to save

385
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,470
The one I love

386
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,190
Mother will support me, right

387
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,750
Madam Jin

388
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,830
I am Ashile Sun

389
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,870
I want to be with your daughter in this life

390
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,230
Marry Li Changge

391
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,950
Spend a lifetime together

392
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,470
I pledge my life

393
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,110
Protect Changge in this life

394
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,830
Love her forever

395
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,230
Give her freedom

396
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,710
Give her happiness

397
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,910
Never leave

398
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,990
Sincerely, Ashile Sun

399
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,270
So he has already visited you

400
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,070
Mother

401
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,150
This cup

402
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,510
Is from your daughter who is going to get married

403
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,230
Second cup

404
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,710
On behalf of A’Sun, toast you

405
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,710
Third cup

406
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,670
Mother

407
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,550
In the future, Ashile Sun

408
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,950
Will be my husband

409
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,350
Hope Mother knows about it

410
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,790
And keep A’Sun safe

411
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,430
Young Khan

412
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,430
What do you mean

413
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,630
Commander Lei ordered

414
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,630
Great Khan is severely ill

415
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,070
No one can enter to disturb

416
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,510
Who is Lei’s master?

417
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,830
It is me

418
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,110
Young Khan, please

419
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,990
Hurry up and report to Commander Lei

420
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,550
Yes

421
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,830
Uncle Khan

422
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,550
It’s me She’er

423
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,470
Uncle Khan

424
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,670
What’s wrong with you

425
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,510
Uncle Khan

426
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,310
It’s me, She’er

427
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,510
You don’t recognize me

428
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,030
Alright, I will leave

429
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,070
You may leave

430
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,270
Yes

431
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,670
What you look like now

432
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,470
It’s better than before

433
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,110
Looks much pleasing to the eye

434
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,270
Mimi, thank you Master

435
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,430
As long as you are obedient

436
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,510
I will let

437
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,230
Your sister and brother met

438
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,710
Thank you Master

439
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,710
But you have to remember

440
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,790
Back to Dingxiang

441
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,110
You won’t have a chance to make mistakes again

442
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,710
If you don’t obey

443
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,550
Don’t think about

444
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,190
Seeing your brother again

445
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,990
I won’t

446
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,590
I will be obedient

447
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,390
Princess, when Young Khan came back

448
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,070
He went to the Great Khan’s bedroom

449
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,110
No one can stop him

450
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,790
Let him go

451
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,750
Just do things later

452
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,790
Be more careful

453
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,030
Don’t give

454
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,310
Unnecessary misunderstanding

455
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,270
Yes

456
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,710
Your Majesty

457
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,910
How free it flies

458
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,750
Your Majesty

459
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,790
What are you doing?

460
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,750
Your Majesty

461
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,310
You just stay there

462
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,870
Buzhen

463
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,030
Your Majesty follow me

464
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,710
Let me go

465
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,070
You

466
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,670
Buzhen

467
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,470
Sister

468
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,510
Buzhen

469
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,430
Buzhen, let me look at you

470
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,590
Sister

471
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,070
Yes

472
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,670
Hands

473
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,630
I don’t know why

474
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,150
They want to chop my finger

475
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,350
His Highness Sui saved me

476
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,510
I’m fine

477
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,230
It’s fine

478
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,350
It’s fine

479
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,110
Commander Lei, new from the west

480
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,470
It’s okay Sister

481
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,230
I don’t hurt anymore

482
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,630
Sister doesn’t cry

483
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,470
Take a step back

484
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,310
Yes

485
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,630
Buzhen

486
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,310
Sister

487
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,590
Buzhen

488
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,390
Sister

489
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,150
- Buzhen
- Sister

490
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,230
Let’s go

491
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,990
You let me go

492
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,750
- Buzhen
- Sister

493
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,550
You come back with me

494
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,950
Young Khan, why are you here?

495
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,510
Open the door I want to go in

496
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,310
This

497
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,630
This this

498
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,910
This can be explained

499
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,670
What

500
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,870
My words won’t work in Dingxiang

501
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,590
Young Khan, don’t be angry

502
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,070
I’ll explain it later

503
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,350
What I’ve been to today

504
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,630
No need to report to Khatun

505
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,950
I understand

506
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,790
I won’t let the anyone say

507
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,470
Any nonsense

508
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,110
Take me to Ashile Sun

509
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,630
Yes

510
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,830
Open the door

511
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,750
Yes

512
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,150
Young Khan please

513
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,710
Went to the dungeon

514
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,790
I’m going to see Ashile Sun

515
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,310
I can go by myself

516
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,190
Yes

517
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,550
When did you like

518
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,990
To come to the dungeon to drink

519
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,230
I like to see you

520
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,870
The unlucky in prison

521
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,470
This Dingxiang is better

522
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,670
Better appetizers?

523
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,350
Too lazy to talk nonsense with you

524
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,910
Hurry and leave after drinking

525
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,550
Don’t want to be found by your mother

526
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,910
If she comes, she comes

527
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,230
Is there anything I can’t let her know

528
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,750
The expression on your face

529
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,670
That’s not what I said

530
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,510
Shut up

531
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,030
I saw the Great Khan

532
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,150
How is he

533
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,150
Sick

534
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,790
Same as Mother said

535
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,110
So sick that people can’t recognize him

536
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,190
He also drove me away

537
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,350
You really believe

538
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,470
Overnight, Great Khan would be

539
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,230
Seriously ill?

540
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,510
Why can’t I believe it

541
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,390
You don’t have to provoke anymore

542
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,670
I’m so eager to see Uncle Khan like this

543
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,550
See Mother not have to live tremblingly

544
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,510
Can see me anytime

545
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,350
What’s wrong with this

546
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,950
Stop lie to yourself She’er

547
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,830
If you really believe

548
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,630
Why would you come to me for a drink

549
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,990
Young Khan

550
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,150
Young Khan

551
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,310
Khatun is here

552
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,510
You should go

553
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,870
Yes, Young Khan

554
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,670
I let you in secretly

555
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,990
If this is known by Khatun

556
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,510
Even if I have ten heads...

557
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,390
What are you panicking

558
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,510
Just walk from the back door

559
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,990
I will take you out

560
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,070
Keep your mouth shut

561
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,150
You won’t lose your head

562
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,630
I got it

563
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,870
Please

564
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,390
Young Khan, let’s hurry up

565
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,190
Hurry

566
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,310
Young Khan

567
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,110
I know the way, so go back first

568
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,190
Lest you be suspicious

569
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,630
Thank you, Young Khan

570
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,670
Greetings, Khatun.

571
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,870
Why are you here

572
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,750
I...

573
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,510
I called him

574
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,030
I want to drink

575
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,110
Bring some more wine

576
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,030
You think

577
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,270
Is this still your Eagle Division?

578
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,150
Leave

579
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,030
Yes

580
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,790
On the grassland

581
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,830
The majestic God of War

582
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,230
Now locked up here

583
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,110
A place where the sun doesn’t see the sun

584
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,790
Tell the truth

585
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,070
I am also a little bit reluctant

586
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,710
But just say what you want to say

587
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,190
No need to obscure

588
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,430
Ashile Sun is smart

589
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,470
No wonder your Father Khan likes you

590
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,350
Father Khan also likes She’er

591
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,990
Even without his mother

592
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,870
Calculate everywhere

593
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,710
She’er can do it sooner or later

594
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,670
Rely on his own strength

595
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,150
Recognized by the grassland

596
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,230
How do I pave the way for my son

597
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,190
No need for you to comment

598
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,750
Your beloved son is eager

599
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,870
After all, I went the wrong way

600
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,990
I won’t argue with you today

601
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,030
Only negotiate terms with you

602
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,190
Condition

603
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,110
Tang Dynasty has alliance with various ministries

604
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,070
Soon the army will be overwhelmed

605
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,310
Yicheng

606
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,150
What qualifications do you have

607
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,350
To talk to me about terms

608
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,990
Since you guessed it

609
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,550
Then I won’t lie to you

610
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,190
You are a smart person

611
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,350
A wise man submits to circumstances.

612
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,670
If you can make your Eagle Division

613
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,150
Fight for the grasslands

614
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,270
I can forgive you

615
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,110
If I gather Eagle Division

616
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,230
I’m afraid it’s not fighting for the grassland

617
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,910
But for Khatun

618
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,910
Fight for the so-called former Sui Dynasty

619
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,790
If I guessed right

620
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,230
Since the Khan’s Tent refused

621
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,390
Give the Eagle Division gromwell to begin with

622
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,990
No

623
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,870
Maybe earlier

624
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,390
The owner of Khan’ Tent

625
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,470
Is not Father Khan anymore

626
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,990
It’s just you

627
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,550
The Eagle Division’s plague

628
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,550
Bear Division wanted to attack and kill Eagle Division in Mobei

629
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,830
And my father’s illness

630
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,230
It’s all your arrangement

631
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,150
It’s all because of you

632
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,990
Is it?

633
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,750
Without you

634
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,390
She’er on the grassland

635
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,750
Will not be threatened

636
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,350
Ashile Sun

637
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,310
Aren’t you very loyal?

638
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,390
It’s you now

639
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,870
Time to help your brother

640
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,670
I won’t help him

641
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,710
Won’t help you

642
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,190
Good

643
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,470
Bring Mu Jin

644
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,430
Mu Jin

645
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,790
Mu Jin

646
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,630
Yicheng!

647
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,270
Mu Jin concealed the battle

648
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,430
Privately sneaked into Dingxiang with intent to be unruly

649
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,830
This is a capital crime

650
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,110
The reason why I spared his life

651
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,710
It’s also for your face

652
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,790
Take him down

653
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,670
Yes

654
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,670
Mu Jin

655
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,470
I promise you

656
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,150
But I have two conditions

657
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,550
Speak

658
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,590
One, cure Mu Jin

659
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,750
Two, cure my father’s illness

660
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,350
Your appetite is not small

661
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,310
I can promise you the first one

662
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,550
Of curing Mu Jin

663
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,830
As for your Father Khan

664
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,990
Then wait for the Eagle Division

665
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,510
To win the battle for me

666
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,030
I will naturally let

667
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,630
You father and son are reunited

668
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,310
You finally admitted

669
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,270
Father Khan’s illness is caused by you
