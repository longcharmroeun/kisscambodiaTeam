00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,480
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,260
Episode 45

3
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,959
If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,279
Heard

5
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,599
I don’t believe in all of this either

6
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,479
The reason why I keep hiding

7
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,199
Did not show up

8
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,679
Just want to see

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,399
What other unseen things will Ashile Tribe do?

10
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,239
Did not expect

11
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,679
They even faked it

12
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,999
News of the dispatch of troops

13
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,279
I can’t bear it

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,039
Only then came forward to prove

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,439
Zhixi died

16
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,959
Chihe jumped out

17
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,359
Preventing the peace alliance

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,399
Everyone may wish to recall memories

19
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,038
Who was the first in Sifang Pavilion?

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,478
Spread Ashile Tribe

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,159
News about the attack on the desert

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,759
Who would it be

23
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,679
Tiele Tribe

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,319
That’s right

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,279
It was Tiele Tribe

26
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,519
Hurry and eat

27
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,999
Even if you go on a hunger strike

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,559
Father Khan won’t let you

29
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,119
Come back to your mother

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,479
If your mother find out

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,319
She will be sad

32
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,159
I won’t see Mother from now on

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,799
Only you will be by my side

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,799
No one can separate us

35
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,679
You are surprisingly quiet today

36
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,719
I thought you would be like

37
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,399
The same as when I was young

38
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,999
Keep grumbling with me

39
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,279
Don’t be too self-righteous

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,399
Did you argue with Yicheng?

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,319
That’s my mother

42
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,159
Don’t call her by her first name

43
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,319
Finally get together with your mother

44
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,159
But mother and son are at odds

45
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,518
This is...

46
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,799
You pretend like you understand

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,359
You use Mimi to get information

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,439
Here again now

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,599
Fake appearance

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,679
I really look down on you

51
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,599
I’m willing to do anything for Changge

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,959
This Li Changge

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,599
What kind of woman is she

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,479
You and Mimi for her

55
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,079
Don’t even want your life

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,279
You don’t need to understand

57
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,999
I’m just curious about her

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,799
Even a bit

59
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,039
Jealous

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,999
Ashile Sun

61
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,679
For Li Changge

62
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,399
Even the Ashile Tribe

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,399
Don’t you want it?

64
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,839
You voluntarily go to jail today

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,799
Didn’t you also put the Ashile Tribe aside

66
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,079
I don’t know if Mother will hate me

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,239
Enduring for so long

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,239
Finally waited for this day

69
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,279
At the moment

70
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,479
I will never give up

71
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,999
She’er

72
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,119
Someday

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,119
You will come back to me

74
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,959
So enjoyable

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,519
Zhixi’s fake death

76
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,039
Simply superb

77
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,079
Changge

78
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,559
How did you think of it

79
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,439
I thought about it

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,199
Use this to grab the hand behind someone’s back

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,839
But even so

82
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,359
I can’t hold Yixheng’s weak spot

83
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,399
It might hurt

84
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,759
Chihe family

85
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,239
What does this mean

86
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,799
Threatened by family

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,999
This is Yicheng

88
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,959
The tactics used in other tribes

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,319
Yicheng

90
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,919
Is an evil person

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,639
So we can’t

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,719
Take her lightly

93
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,399
Maybe she has other

94
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,439
Backup plan

95
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,959
It’s possible in this Chang’an city

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,559
There are still more Chijing Tribe

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,559
Hao Du, I need your help

98
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,239
Don’t move

99
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,439
Thanks to you guys today

100
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,799
Guarding Great Tang

101
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,959
It’s my responsbility

102
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,359
Not right

103
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,839
There’s one less person

104
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,519
You mean the person next to Yicheng

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,319
Yes

106
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,679
That person’s name is Yang Cheng

107
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,799
Just today

108
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,919
It’s a private transfer of troops

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,279
Can’t ask Yicheng directly

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,119
What to do then

111
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,759
Although Chihe was part of the Chijing Tribe

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,119
But the main evil has not been eliminated

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,639
It’s not a success

114
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,439
Take these people back first

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,959
We have to let Leyan

116
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,119
Enter the palace before the court

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,079
State of affairs

118
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,399
Okay

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,479
Go

120
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,119
Be honest

121
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,039
Leyan

122
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,599
Outside teahouse

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,399
Go

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,559
Leyan

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,079
Don’t act rashly

126
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,839
Hand over the fish token to me

127
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,919
Hao Du

128
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,199
He just wants to take away Chijing Tribe

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,519
Won’t do anything to Leyan

130
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,359
Princess

131
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,119
You are really smart

132
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,319
We can exchange with you

133
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,399
Hao Du

134
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,639
Don’t exchange

135
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,519
I will count three times

136
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,639
What to do

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,039
You decide for yourself

138
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,999
Li Changge

139
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,239
Give me the fish token

140
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,439
We exchange with him

141
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,599
Hao Du

142
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,239
Li Changge

143
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,479
Ok I will release them

144
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,959
Changge

145
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,679
I will personally take you there

146
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,039
Then they will obey orders

147
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,079
And let people out

148
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,879
But what you have

149
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,039
Is Tang Emperor’s beloved daughter

150
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,599
If you dare to hurt her

151
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,519
You will never leave alive

152
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,159
Stop talking nonsense with me

153
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,799
Throw me the fish token

154
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,599
The Sui Dynasty

155
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,159
It’s just self-defeating

156
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,319
Less nonsense

157
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,719
Since I has fallen into your hands

158
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,999
Want to kill

159
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,279
Not important

160
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,479
Listen well

161
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,079
Ready soon

162
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,239
How about it

163
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,519
Have the people been accounted for it?

164
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,679
All confessed

165
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,159
Tomorrow morning

166
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,839
I will report the truth to the ministers

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,959
Then you will follow the plan

168
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,719
I will be

169
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,159
In front of the envoys

170
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,239
Uncover the true face of Yicheng

171
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,159
Facilitate the alliance

172
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,279
Let me

173
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,999
Does it hurt?

174
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,919
You can cry if it hurts

175
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,439
Don’t bear it

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,159
I’m still here

177
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,799
Can you restrain a bit

178
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,119
Also

179
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,479
Hao Du made a great contribution this time

180
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,359
That one will definitely give you a marriage

181
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,479
Then I

182
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,839
Right

183
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,959
She wasn’t hurt deeply

184
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,839
Won’t delay your major event

185
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,399
I’m leaving now

186
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,239
A’Sun

187
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,519
Are you okay in jail

188
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,599
Young Master, you are back

189
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,999
Master waited for you all night

190
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,959
Father

191
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,039
You are the one who transferred the troops without authorization

192
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,679
Father

193
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,999
It was an emergency

194
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,759
I didn’t explain to you

195
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,359
To make a decision when it’s time to decide

196
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,359
Really worthy of being

197
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,919
my son

198
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,639
The remnants of the former Sui Dynasty

199
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,039
Had no choice but to remove them

200
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,119
Yes

201
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,079
Come with me

202
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,399
Kneel down

203
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,639
Kneel here

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,039
Kneel here

205
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,079
Kowtow

206
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,919
Pour the wine

207
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,519
Father

208
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,759
This is not the custom

209
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,759
From today

210
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,239
You are from our Du family

211
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,119
Your name will be on the family tree

212
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,199
You are my son

213
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,319
Father

214
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,919
I know you are always confidant

215
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,599
I want to you to rely on your own ability

216
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,919
Climb to a high place

217
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,319
But

218
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,719
Since you want to be the Prince Consort

219
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,799
I as a father

220
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,959
I have to pave the road for you

221
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,759
Father

222
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,239
You said it wrong

223
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,039
You are already my son

224
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,199
Understand?

225
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,519
Father

226
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,359
Good

227
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,999
Child

228
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,119
Accompany me into the palace

229
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,159
Report to His Majesty

230
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,559
Good

231
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,959
Your Majesty

232
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,559
Yang Cheng was the right-hand support of Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty

233
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,839
After the Sui Dynasty

234
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,159
He assembled all

235
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,039
The surviving soldiers of the former Sui Dynasty

236
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,439
Advisor Du is having trouble

237
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,759
Let Hao Du speak

238
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,439
Your Majesty

239
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,159
All this group of people have their household registrations cancelled

240
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,119
Now like a ghost

241
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,199
Survive in the world

242
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,799
They call themselves Chijing Tribe

243
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,199
Loyal to Princess Yicheng

244
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,159
Although this time they admitted

245
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,479
The crime of spreading rumors

246
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,679
But it’s a pity

247
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,879
Yang Cheng alone

248
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,159
Contact Yicheng

249
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,159
Yang Cheng would not talk

250
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,679
And also tried to commit suicide

251
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,079
So this time

252
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,719
I’m afraid I can’t execute Yi Cheng

253
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,559
No hurry

254
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,679
The man with all wings

255
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,919
How far can we struggle

256
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,639
Yes

257
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,159
Everybody

258
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,318
Yang Cheng is with Yicheng

259
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,999
Envoy Chihe

260
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,639
Are from the former Sui

261
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,159
Chihe thinks

262
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,159
Yang Cheng wants to restore the Sui Dynasty

263
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,239
The Sui Dynasty and the Great Deserts peace alliance

264
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,319
Tiele Tribe will naturally rise

265
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,239
When the time comes

266
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,399
Join Ashile Tribe

267
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,639
Don’t be surprised

268
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,799
Yi Cheng has been married to the grassland for many years

269
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,559
Secretly

270
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,559
Chijing Tribe remains

271
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,199
All under Yang Cheng

272
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,959
Naturally no one has seen her

273
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,159
Yang Cheng is one of the few who obey her

274
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,959
And someone who can identify her

275
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,239
It was all arranged by Yicheng

276
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,159
Mobei Princess is really good at talking

277
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,239
Just a few words

278
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,999
Will bring disaster to the east

279
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,879
Intended to point to me

280
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,559
I’m married and weak woman

281
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,959
How could he be the master behind the scenes?

282
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,439
You said this by yourself

283
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,759
None of us said that

284
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,639
Don’t worry

285
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,239
Yang Cheng went to court without uttering a word

286
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,519
Just begging to die

287
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,479
I wait to save his life

288
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,599
I haven’t gotten a hand to ask him

289
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,959
Not to mention that Yang Cheng is so loyal

290
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,759
How can he betray Khatun

291
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,519
Khatun, look

292
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,279
Everyone dare not speak

293
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,199
How dare I pour dirty water

294
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,999
Since you know it’s slander

295
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,679
Everyone should leave, right?

296
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,159
What are you doing here?

297
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,319
Special Envoy is here!

298
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,239
Everybody

299
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,079
This is my Great Tang

300
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,919
Edict written to you by hand

301
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,359
In short

302
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,479
If the various ministries are at war

303
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,359
Great Tang must advance and retreat together

304
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,279
Great Tang and its various ministries depend on blessings and disasters

305
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,879
Civilized

306
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,119
Food and drink

307
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,799
Reclaiming wasteland and planting

308
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,959
Business relations

309
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,079
If needed

310
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,359
Great Tang never excuses

311
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,399
If Great Tang has slavery

312
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,839
Self-defeating covenant

313
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,559
Good

314
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,519
I’ll take my father’s place

315
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,559
My Monan

316
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,279
Will sign first

317
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,239
Then we

318
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,959
Will also sign

319
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,119
Then should we sign or not

320
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,559
Let’s form an alliance with Great Tang

321
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,439
Let’s sign too

322
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,039
Still ok

323
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,639
It’s still fair

324
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,959
Good for everyone

325
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,159
Wait a minute

326
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,679
Hao Du

327
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,999
You clean up the rest of the Chijing Tribe

328
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,159
Make great contributions

329
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,919
But you transferred your troops privately

330
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,519
But committed an offense

331
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,879
I am guilty

332
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,319
Father, this matter was my idea

333
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,479
It has nothing to do with Hao Du

334
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,679
So

335
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,799
I want to punish your Prince Consort

336
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,639
Leyan didn’t mean to purposely hide it from Father

337
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,439
I just don’t want to startled the enemy

338
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,559
This matter

339
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,679
Princess

340
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,319
Prince Consort

341
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,959
Father

342
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,839
My Yan’er has really grown up

343
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,919
Hao Du

344
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,759
No, Young Master Du

345
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,679
I hand Yan’er to you

346
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,719
You have to treat her well

347
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,839
If you dislike my daughter in the future,

348
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,119
Delayed your future

349
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,759
Or fading and relaxing over time

350
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,239
I don’t blame you

351
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,079
But you must keep her intact

352
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,719
Sent back to me

353
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,399
Thank you, Your Majesty

354
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,719
Your Majesty, please rest assured

355
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,399
I must take good care of the princess

356
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,279
Not because she is a princess

357
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,199
Because

358
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,279
She is Leyan

359
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,079
Good

360
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,919
Let’s wait for Young Master Wei

361
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,519
To return from the peace alliance

362
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,759
We’ll just pick a day to get married

363
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,999
Thank you, Your Majesty

364
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,119
You can’t sign this alliance agreement

365
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,079
I can’t just stand by

366
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,079
Watching everyone

367
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,879
By this fake princess

368
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,919
Push into the fire pit

369
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,439
Mimi

370
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,439
Fake

371
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,319
She is nothing at all

372
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,559
Mobei Princess

373
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,759
Her true identity is

374
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,399
The one who was wiped out

375
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,439
Daughter of the former Prince of the Tang Dynasty

376
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,239
Li Changge

377
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,719
Turned out to be her

378
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,359
She is a fake princess

379
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,519
What’s going on

380
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,439
Really unexpected

381
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,039
Daughter of the former prince

382
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,319
How could there be such a thing

383
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,039
Mimi Guli

384
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,319
I will never allow you

385
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,119
Destroy the princess’s plan

386
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,359
This this

387
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,279
This is simply

388
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,879
Acted on the order of Li Changge

389
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,159
It’s just that she wants to put each tribe

390
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:42,959
Involved in the war

391
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,279
Just an excuse

392
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,559
What she wants

393
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,799
Just one

394
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,439
A battle draped personally by the Emperor Tang

395
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,839
This can make the Tang Army

396
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,999
Exhausted in the battle

397
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,159
Like this

398
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,399
She can kill the emperor for revenge

399
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,719
If Li Changge

400
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,959
Take any more action

401
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,719
You are in front of everyone

402
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,359
Expose her identity

403
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,759
Otherwise

404
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,199
Your brother Buzhen and also Mu Jin

405
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,239
Mu Jin

406
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,959
You think I don’t know

407
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,639
Mu Jin has

408
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,679
Sneak into Dingxiang?

409
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,479
Maybe at this moment

410
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,159
In the hands of Lei Meng

411
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,559
Receiving Qianao

412
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,079
But I will do whatever you say

413
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,079
Khatun

414
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,999
I beg you

415
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,999
I beg you to forgive Bu Zhen

416
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,639
Don’t die with Mu Jin, okay?

417
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,879
I do everything

418
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,399
I listen to you everything

419
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,519
Then it depends on you

420
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,239
Your performance

421
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,359
For hatred

422
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,919
She is a member of Great Tang

423
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,239
But can be with the remnants of the former Sui Dynasty

424
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,319
Cooperate with Chijing

425
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,199
What Three Armies

426
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,919
People dejected

427
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,919
She doesn’t care at all

428
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,239
So this time the peace alliance

429
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,039
Simply

430
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,639
It’s just a conspiracy of Li Changge

431
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,279
Turned out to be her conspiracy

432
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,119
Hidden deep enough

433
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,999
Yeah yeah

434
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,799
Don’t be too sloppy

435
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,519
We still have to consider the long-term plan

436
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,599
Yes yes yes

437
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,839
Take Li Changge away temporarily

438
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,479
I will present to His Majesty

439
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,599
To be decided by His Majesty

440
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,159
Changge

441
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,559
Did not expect

442
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,079
Something like this will happen

443
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,839
Father

444
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,999
Changge

445
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,519
When did Yicheng know

446
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,599
The identity of Changge

447
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,079
I don’t know

448
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,359
Now the envoys of various ministries in the desert

449
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,999
I’m afraid can’t wait

450
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,719
To see how I punish Changge

451
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,319
To show sincerity

452
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,039
Your Majesty

453
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,319
Various ministries of the desert

454
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,719
I’m the one who is afraid

455
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,399
Not Li Changge

456
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,879
So Young Master Wei said

457
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,159
They can’t believe me

458
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,959
I dare not

459
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,439
I think

460
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,279
Even if Li Changge is executed

461
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,999
It doesn’t help

462
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,879
Then what do you say should be done

463
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,079
The minister dare not say anything

464
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,479
Father

465
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,919
You have said

466
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,999
To forgive Li Jiancheng

467
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,279
With Li Yuanji relatives

468
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,159
Now built the identity of the widow

469
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,559
Made public

470
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,799
Proper placement

471
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,239
If the emperor

472
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,279
The minister will die to the end

473
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,679
Father

474
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,519
Young Master Wei

475
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,359
Go see Yicheng tomorrow

476
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,839
She made this move

477
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,599
It’s nothing more than to ask me

478
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,919
To release the Young Khan

479
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,879
No matter what she wants tomorrow

480
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,839
You tell her

481
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,759
I only need all the ministries in the desert

482
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,839
Captives in the hands of the Ashile

483
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,519
I understand

484
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,119
Father

485
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,679
No one will hurt Changge

486
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,759
Yan’er

487
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,879
Get up

488
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,039
Yan’er, remember

489
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,879
Stop the war by killing

490
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,879
Never the right way

491
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,839
Strong country and strong soldiers

492
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,559
Conspiracy

493
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,999
Come as you like

494
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,559
Great Tang

495
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,759
Will never give in

496
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,599
Time to eat

497
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,079
You don’t have anything

498
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,439
Looks like your mother doesn’t spend less money

499
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,679
I am not hungry

500
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,319
Eat it, I’ll take it to you

501
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,559
No need

502
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,719
You eat

503
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,919
To avoid seeing Sirius

504
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,359
As a starving ghost

505
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,239
I don’t believe we can’t get out

506
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,159
You have faith in Emperor Tang

507
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,919
Still have faith in your mother

508
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,039
I am right, your Li Changge

509
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,239
Is confident

510
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,399
If she is a loyal person

511
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,399
Will never let you

512
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,439
Just die here

513
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,039
I hope she doesn’t

514
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,279
Jump into this muddy water again

515
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,719
She’er

516
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,559
If we this time

517
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,799
Can get out alive

518
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,399
I will continue

519
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,639
To be enemies with your mother

520
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,519
To the death

521
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,599
Ashile Tribe

522
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,839
Great Tang

523
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,719
Former Sui Dynasty

524
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,959
Are these really that important?

525
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,879
Why must it be mixed together?

526
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,679
You can’t talk to your Li Changge

527
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,639
Find a peaceful place

528
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,679
Do you live a happy life?

529
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,879
Is that better?

530
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,679
Natural good

531
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,999
Only the world is really peaceful

532
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,399
The people can be at ease

533
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,999
Khatun

534
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,559
His Majesty of Great Tang

535
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,959
Only want Ambassador Wei to come

536
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,879
Eagle Division intended to murder the East Palace

537
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,999
Refers to the recognition of Khatun and Young Khan

538
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,119
Is the master behind it

539
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,679
Such an important case is unfinished

540
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,959
Your Majesty will try

541
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,639
Can’t get away

542
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,639
Ambassador Wei is so straightforward

543
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,479
I will get to the point

544
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,159
Let my son go

545
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,759
I promise

546
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,919
Within five years

547
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,799
Ashile Tribe and Great Tang will not

548
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,319
Meet on the battlefield

549
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,319
The covenant is meant to be signed

550
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,359
Just because of the leader of peace alliance

551
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,919
Is the daughter of Li Jiancheng

552
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,599
So the ministries gave up the peace alliance

553
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,159
To join is still so

554
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,359
So-called promise

555
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,439
I’m afraid it’s just a sentence

556
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,759
It’s just light and flirty

557
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,959
What does Tang Emperor want

558
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,879
I heard that in Ashile Tribe’s hands

559
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,559
Are many prisoners from various parts of the desert

560
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,159
Great Tang’s appetite

561
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,879
Isn’t it too big?

562
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,279
Khatun

563
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,639
People are uneasy now

564
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,639
Want to stabilize

565
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,359
Envoys of the various ministries of the desert

566
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,719
Severely punishing Young Khan

567
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,159
Is best to show

568
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,879
The Great Tang’s way

569
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,559
Khatun would like to see me

570
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,679
I’m afraid I don’t know

571
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,039
This makes sense

572
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,039
Sorry

573
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,559
I really can’t help you this time

574
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,639
Peace alliance is lost

575
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,839
90% of those who don’t want to sign up

576
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,239
That means

577
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,799
Working hard for the remaining 10%

578
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,999
The remaining 10%

579
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,759
Is tidying up

580
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,919
Prepare to return to the desert tomorrow

581
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,599
Where is A’Sun

582
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,199
Ashile Sun and Ashile She’er

583
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,519
Have special status

584
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,199
Separately in prison

585
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,759
No visits

586
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,439
But they have one room

587
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,119
Not to fight

588
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,159
Changge

589
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,079
Ashile Sun does not hesitate to reveal his identity

590
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,319
To drag himself into the water

591
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,439
Dead fish

592
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,519
He did

593
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,999
Probably with you this time

594
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,559
Almost killed

595
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,159
He saved me more than once or twice

596
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,759
If not for him

597
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,279
Maybe from the cliff

598
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,519
I died the day I fell

599
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,999
You guys have known each other a long time ago

600
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,119
So he was the one who saved you

601
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,879
If this time Ashile Sun

602
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,959
Be able to survive

603
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,119
As your brother

604
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,999
I can trust you to him

605
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,359
Before meeting him

606
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,119
I never thought

607
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,079
I can live and die with someone

608
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,599
After meeting him

609
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,599
I never thought about being with someone else

610
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,199
Spend the rest of your life together

611
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,439
Your Majesty

612
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,919
Yicheng agreed

613
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,119
Yes

614
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,679
Ashile Tribe will return to Dingxiang tomorrow

615
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,279
She asked for Young  Khan

616
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,959
In front of all the people in the desert

617
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,599
Leave with her

618
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,799
But she can think of it

619
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,639
Follow her

620
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,959
Your Majesty

621
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,319
She also wants Ashile Sun

622
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,999
Four days

623
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,479
As Young Master, it’s still the first time

624
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,638
Been detained for so long

625
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,719
It seems that the situation is not very optimistic

626
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,559
What

627
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,399
Afraid of death

628
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,799
When does the warriors of the grassland be afraid of death

629
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,039
If you were wronged here this time

630
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,799
I can’t help you

631
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,519
I heard it right

632
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,399
Ashile Sun would actually apologize

633
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,719
This is the death of man

634
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,279
Is the word good?

635
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,919
Some things are not clear at the moment

636
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,239
There will be no chance again

637
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,439
She’er

638
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,919
Blame it on you

639
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,639
Young Khan from Ashile Tribe

640
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,479
No chance

641
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,479
I don’t think so

642
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,759
I, Ashile She’er, insisted

643
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,479
This prison of the Tang Dynasty

644
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,799
I must be sleepy

645
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,239
Bastard child

646
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,919
If we really can get out

647
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,719
Apologize to me

648
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,119
Have a drink with me

649
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,319
Maybe I can forgive you

650
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,359
Forgive

651
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,279
As long as you are Yicheng’s son

652
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,799
I’m still Khan’s adopted son

653
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,039
The word is between you and me

654
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,239
It’s impossible

655
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,959
She’er

656
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,599
Forgiveness

657
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,799
Next life

658
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,599
You really think you are dead

659
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,799
You never said before

660
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,079
Such frustrating words

661
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,319
I ask you

662
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,519
If you live again

663
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,239
What do you want to do

664
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,719
I don’t know

665
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,239
But I will never leave the grassland

666
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,079
How nice the grassland is

667
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,039
Vast and beautiful

668
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,119
Don’t need too many soldiers

669
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,319
No need for subordinates

670
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,639
Just with the person you like

671
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,359
Together

672
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,279
Horseback hunting

673
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,359
Cattle and sheep

674
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,879
At this point you are with me

675
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,919
Thought of it together

676
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,039
Who rarely talk to you

677
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,559
Think of it together

678
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,199
What’re you guys up to?

679
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,359
Ashile Sun

680
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,799
You must not go with them

681
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,479
Don’t forget the key

682
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,119
Thanks for your help

683
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,039
You’re welcome

684
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,639
Take him away

685
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,839
If you want to kill him

686
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,999
I’m not opposed to it actually

687
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,719
As long as you don’t move me

688
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,759
But

689
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,479
Great Tang’s Crown Prince?

690
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,959
How dare you

691
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,799
actually hit me alone

692
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,119
I don’t believe you’ll be able to do it

693
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,879
You’ve actually don’t want to go overboard right?

694
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,039
I...

695
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,559
I thought I wouldn’t do it in jail

696
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,919
I was afraid of leaving trails

697
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,799
But since Young Khan doesn’t want

698
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,999
to lose face

699
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,879
That simply

700
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,159
Do nothing but never stop

701
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,039
I can finally be a good friend

702
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,839
And get revenge

703
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,399
You...

704
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,599
You dare to stop me

705
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,879
Greetings Crown Prince

706
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,959
Why do you want to kill Ashile Sun?

707
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,039
It simply because he killed Shengxin

708
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,079
Everyone in the world despises him

709
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,319
All despise Sheng Xin

710
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,119
Because of his life, it’s not worth pursuing

711
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,359
If I...

712
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,199
I’m not going to be a good friend

713
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,559
and yet he already died

714
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,879
But Sheng Xin is a ghost

715
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,679
the villain next to Your Highness

716
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,559
You’re speaking nonsense

717
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,879
Hao Du already swept clean of the rest of remaining enemies

718
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,239
They have confessed that they had

719
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,639
planted Shen Xinan as their spy earlier in Luoyang

720
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,719
Was placed by Your Highness’s side

721
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,359
To confuse Your Highness’s mind

722
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,079
He took the advantage of the convenience provided by Your highness

723
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,399
and waited for the right opportunity

724
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,039
If you don’t believe the bigger picture in front of you

725
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,279
then Your Highness must ask in person

726
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,199
If you don’t believe

727
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,919
His Majesty would like to seek an audience with Tegin

728
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,279
You are the famous Tegin of Eagle Division

729
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,839
who’s unwillingly to salute to the Emperor of the Tang Dynasty

730
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,359
Simply

731
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,439
let’s just say

732
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,079
Li Changge’s followers

733
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,999
are naturally reluctant to bow down to her second uncle

734
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,639
Take a look around

735
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,879
For my niece

736
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,039
What kind of things can you even offer?

737
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,479
In here I will offer you two choices

738
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,119
You have probably seen this box before

739
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,519
It’s Changge’s household registration

740
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,319
I added a copy of yours

741
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,879
From here

742
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,479
You can change your surname into Wan

743
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,519
Stay with Changge in Chang’an

744
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,759
In here there can’t be an Ashile Sun

745
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,639
but I promise you no worries forever

746
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,279
This choice

747
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,039
Changge has already refused

748
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,959
So I put this thing

749
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,999
So that’s why I prepared to give this to you

750
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,519
You’re also unwillingly to leave her side

751
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,719
until the day when the knife will lick the blood (until the end of the bloodshed)

752
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,039
I only want her to do what she wants to do

753
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,799
Furthermore

754
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,279
I also won’t

755
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,359
Abandon my surname as Ashile

756
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,839
Then this second choice

757
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,879
Like I said earlier

758
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,519
I’m guessing Sun has a clear understanding

759
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,279
Understood

760
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,439
For Changge

761
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,759
You’re willingly to fight with your fate

762
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,919
With no hesitation

763
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,839
Before leaving Changan

764
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,599
You’ll need to see someone

765
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,479
I thought

766
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,199
He was my friend

767
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,759
Why did he lie to me

768
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,639
Is it because I’m so stupid?

769
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,919
Of course not

770
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,559
Your Highness is just kind

771
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,239
Too credulous

772
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,919
You don’t need to comfort me

773
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,479
I know in my heart

774
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,919
Actually Father can’t look down on me

775
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,279
This is my first time

776
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,879
Want to work hard for one person

777
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,639
Want to avenge him

778
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,359
Avenge him

779
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,759
But in the end

780
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,159
It’s all a joke

781
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,079
Your Highness was alone and courageous

782
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,639
For friends

783
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,679
Now you find that the sentiment is fake

784
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,999
Your Highness is regretting

785
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,599
Regret

786
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,279
After that

787
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,239
Will Your Highness still

788
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,079
Believe in a person without reservation

789
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,719
Will

790
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,839
But not

791
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,319
So blind

792
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,599
Isn’t that great

793
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,999
Your Highness has also grown

794
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,919
How about you

795
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,199
What did you try to save?

796
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,039
Do you regret something?

797
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,519
Your Highness

798
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,519
The past cannot be traced

799
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,999
People want to look forward
