1
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,480
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,260
Episode 44

3
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,039
I tell you

4
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,479
Lucky for you this time

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,759
Next time

6
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,039
But no such luck

7
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,039
This pastry

8
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,319
Is for your princess

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,159
Such an exquisite dim sum

10
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,999
What a pity

11
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,639
What do you mean

12
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,119
Nothing interesting

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,719
I just want to tell you

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,399
Don’t think there is a Young Khan

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,679
Support you

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,399
I forgot who I am

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,399
Things to do for the princess

18
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,239
No one can stop

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,839
Changge

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,159
Did you see Changge?

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,879
She went to Xiu Niang to learn embroidery

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,319
Said it was for the princess

23
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,079
Haven’t come back yet

24
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,639
What happened

25
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,159
Nothing

26
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,359
It’s time for dinner

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,719
Otherwise

28
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,359
Let’s go find her

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,799
The store said Changge

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,719
Already left

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,079
Then where else would she go

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,439
Mimi

33
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,159
Do you know something

34
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,359
Shouldn’t the prince

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,079
be in Tai Chi Palace?

36
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,199
Why come

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,319
Such a remote place

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,519
The prince said there are many people in the palace

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,959
In case someone recognizes you

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,679
It’s not good

41
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,719
So he choose

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,159
In this country house

43
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,319
Also for your cousin’s sake

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,319
When did you follow the prince

45
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,839
A long time

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,759
When is

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,999
Too long

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,199
I can’t remember it

49
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,679
We’ve arrived

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,799
If it’s too long you don’t remember

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,679
How should it be

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,599
Before changing the yuan

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,639
What am i doing to you

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,879
No impression at all

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,479
The princess is too worried

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,319
The prince is inside

57
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,119
Let’s go in and say

58
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,199
Say

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,519
Who on earth sent you?

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,039
What’s your purpose around the prince

61
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,799
Let’s go in and talk to the prince

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,119
The princess is indeed the princess

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,239
No wonder the master ordered me to be careful

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,039
It’s a pity

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,359
Brother Sun

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,599
Where did you all go

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,199
I haven’t seen anyone for a whole day

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,439
Where’s Changge?

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,079
You didn’t see Changge today?

70
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,119
No

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,959
I thought

72
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,399
You guys are out to play

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,479
Curfew is coming soon

74
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,759
If Changge hasn’t come back

75
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,839
That must be an accident

76
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,719
Let’s go back to the house first

77
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,919
I suspected to be Princess Yicheng

78
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,839
She poisoned Zhixi

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,159
Frame Changge unsuccessful

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,479
So I think she use force

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,519
I’m going to find her

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,319
Wait a minute

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,879
It’s useless to use force

84
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,959
Maybe

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,439
I can still ask She’er for help

86
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,999
They won’t believe you

87
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,519
Unless you kill me

88
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,239
You will pretend to assassinate me in a while

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,639
Only this way

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,599
It is possible to win

91
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,759
Yicheng’s trust

92
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,239
Get close to She’er

93
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,559
Not right.

94
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,679
To save Changge

95
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,679
This is crazy too

96
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,919
Late at night

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,559
The one who barged into my mother’s room is you?

98
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,279
Who’s making a ruckus this night?

99
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,839
Where is Changge?

100
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,839
What a joke

101
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,239
Your person isn’t here

102
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,639
But came to ask me

103
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,759
The whole city of Chang’an

104
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,919
You’re the only person who would play tricks

105
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,319
Ashile Sun

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,879
The reason why I didn’t expose your identity in front of the tribes

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,279
is to save your face

108
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,479
Now

109
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,519
You actually disrespect me just for the Li Tang Princess?

110
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,679
If this spreads out

111
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,799
you’re lose your reputation in the Grasslands

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,319
Ashile Sun you’re insane

113
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,399
Ashile Sun

114
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,679
She saved your reputation

115
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,199
You still want to kill her

116
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,959
Brother Sun

117
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,439
Are you alright

118
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,839
I said I’m going to find someone

119
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,759
Let’s juggle with a fake knife

120
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,239
Look at you now

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,199
How painful it must be

122
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,959
How smart is Yi Cheng

123
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,719
Even if it is really thorn

124
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,079
It may not be trusted

125
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,319
Not to mention fake knives

126
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,039
Mimi has been merciful

127
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,239
Minor injuries

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,999
Now just hope

129
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,039
She can go well

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,599
Detect the news of Changge

131
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,319
You still wait for the medicine

132
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,399
Discuss again

133
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,439
Don’t use this

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,759
This is our Monan

135
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,639
Best medicine

136
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,759
Very effective

137
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,559
What are you doing?

138
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,799
I’ll help you

139
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,279
I’ll help you

140
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,759
I got it

141
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,999
Brother Sun must be shy

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,599
Right

143
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,759
I do it myself

144
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,599
Then I will

145
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,239
Put it here

146
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,199
Call me if you need help

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,319
I’m at the door

148
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,359
Tell me

149
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,839
Tell you what?

150
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,679
You stood up to my mother for?

151
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,279
Today you’re one of my mother’s people

152
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,599
So you’re also my person

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,599
Tonight, you’ll have to serve me

154
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,919
Come

155
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,999
Why?

156
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,839
Why do you use yourself to save Changge?

157
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,479
You think I can’t see through you?

158
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,919
You just want to get close to me to know where she’s at

159
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,559
Say it

160
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,999
What is your plan

161
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,039
She’er

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,279
I won’t tell Mother

163
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,119
She’er

164
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,479
Changge was taken away by your mother

165
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,479
I beg you

166
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,759
I beg you to help Changge

167
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,959
Why are you framing my mother

168
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,839
No

169
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,439
Poisoning of Zhixi

170
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,559
Your mother gave it to me

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,159
Her purpose

172
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
Is to blame Changge

173
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,959
She’er

174
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,399
I know

175
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,559
You waited a long, long time

176
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,119
To be reunited with your mother

177
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,919
Now I let you do it for me

178
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,079
It’s hard to go against your mother’s wishes

179
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,799
But I really don’t

180
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,079
Have another way

181
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,279
Now only you can help me

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,079
Save Changge, ok?

183
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,919
I beg you

184
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,799
I am willing to come back to you

185
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,999
Serve you

186
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,839
To save Li Changge

187
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,999
You are willing to sacrifice yourself

188
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,119
If there is no Changge

189
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,759
I would be dead on the grassland a long time ago

190
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,559
I’m not helping you

191
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,799
I also want to know the answer

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,639
I know it’s Mother

193
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,879
Behind the scenes

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,439
I just don’t want to face it

195
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,639
Maybe it’s time to reveal the answer tonight

196
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,919
This in my eyes

197
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,559
Such a weak woman

198
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,279
Why step by step

199
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,439
Take control of the royal court

200
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,079
Princess

201
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,759
Sheng Xin has succeeded

202
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,439
Good

203
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,519
It’s not in vain that I love him so much

204
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,159
Li Changge can’t die yet

205
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,159
I want to use her

206
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,039
To blackmail Li Shimin

207
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,559
She is the key to tearing up peace alliance

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,039
Don’t let her run

209
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,079
Yes

210
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,399
Also

211
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,439
Sheng Xin

212
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,359
No need to go back

213
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,599
Li Chengqian is by my side

214
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,199
What

215
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,279
What?

216
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,279
Don’t understand me

217
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,959
Yes

218
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,479
Subordinates understand

219
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,759
The subordinates will go to the western suburbs wooden house

220
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,839
Wait

221
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,199
Let Shengxin and Li Chengqian

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,919
Make a formal farewell

223
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,799
It’s never too late for you to deal with

224
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,959
So as not to trouble yourself

225
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,679
The subordinates knows, Princess

226
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,359
Changge is at the wooden house in the western suburbs

227
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,599
You really found the information

228
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,239
Go to Wei Manor to tell Wei Shuyu to save people

229
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,839
This

230
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,319
What about you

231
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,599
You go first

232
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,839
I am here waiting for you

233
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,919
Go

234
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,959
No longer have to struggle, Princess

235
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,239
You can’t escape

236
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,599
Your life must of cost a lot of money

237
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,999
You still want to use me to blackmail Great Tang

238
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,439
You people think too highly of me

239
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,679
Take her away

240
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,799
Go

241
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,559
Don’t be afraid

242
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,119
I’m here

243
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,839
You can’t kill me

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,959
I’m the Crown Prince’s person

245
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,759
Li Changge’s identity once the cover is blown, it’ll create chaos

246
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,159
Do you guys not want to live anymore?

247
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,119
You can’t kill him

248
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,519
He’s a registered person at the East Palace

249
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,559
If you kill him none of us will be clean

250
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,479
With Mobei here

251
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,839
We can’t create trouble with Great Tang

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,639
Are you guys going to stop or not?

253
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,439
Let’s leave

254
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,359
Someone

255
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,599
Someone

256
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,759
Mobei’s people is trying to rebel against the Crown Prince

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,279
They want to kill

258
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,959
Someone

259
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,319
Someone

260
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,479
A’Sun

261
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,679
Go

262
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,839
Stop chasing

263
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,439
Can’t catch up

264
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,879
Check to see if anyone is alive

265
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,079
Yes

266
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,679
A’Sun

267
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,679
You shouldn’t kill Shengxin

268
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,479
We should not provoke them

269
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,239
If I can’t find you tonight

270
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,479
I even kill Yicheng

271
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,559
Stop acting recklessly

272
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,719
Oh my goodness

273
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,599
I’m going to see a doctor

274
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,879
No way

275
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,439
Today’s matter

276
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,079
You didn’t see it

277
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,039
Brother Sun, I’m a girl

278
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,159
Give me the medicine

279
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,879
Okay

280
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,639
Here

281
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,919
Bear with it

282
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,159
Go get the medicine

283
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,479
Oh okay

284
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,199
I shouldn’t let you hurt again

285
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,799
I’m fine

286
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,159
Just this matter

287
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,559
I’m afraid It’s not all that good

288
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,519
Tang still needs you if the alliance isn’t sucessful

289
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,439
He won’t give up easily

290
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,679
its just that it requires the edge of a blade

291
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,719
it’s the same as the grasslands

292
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,439
Check and balance each other

293
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,359
I won’t kill Yicheng now

294
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,439
but I won’t make it any better for her

295
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,639
Changge

296
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,839
Do you trust me?

297
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,239
Your medicine

298
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,559
Thank you

299
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,799
What’s dead

300
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,079
Who’s dead

301
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,719
Your Highness

302
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,199
It’s your attendant Shengxin

303
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,879
What

304
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,119
Fast

305
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,119
Open the white cloth

306
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,439
Show me

307
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,839
Who

308
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,279
Who killed him

309
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,319
I will find out

310
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,119
Give an explanation to His Royal Highness

311
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,479
Catch him for me

312
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,039
Within an hour

313
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,239
If you still can’t catch

314
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,399
The murderer who killed Shengxin

315
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,879
You

316
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,119
You all sit together

317
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,359
Princess

318
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,199
Princess, not good

319
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,759
Shengxin is dead

320
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,360
Li Changge has escaped

321
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,919
Who leaked the whereabouts

322
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,039
Subordinate incompetence

323
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,199
Haven’t found out yet

324
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,159
No need to check

325
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,559
It’s me

326
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,759
Mother

327
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,239
Who is he

328
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,639
One of my guards

329
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,079
No matter when

330
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,199
You can go in and out at will

331
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,879
Discuss with Mother

332
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,399
How to kill the guard

333
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,759
What do you want to say

334
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,879
I heard you talk last night

335
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,639
Mother

336
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,079
I just want to know

337
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,359
Everything you do

338
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,079
It’s for our Ashile Tribe

339
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,039
Or for the former Sui

340
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,839
In your heart

341
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,479
I’m Ashile Tribe’s Khatun

342
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,639
Or the princess of the former Sui

343
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,439
Or your mother

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,719
No matter what status I am

345
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,119
I will always be your mother

346
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,879
Our mother and son are connected by blood

347
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,639
The king of the grassland and the former emperor of the Sui Dynasty

348
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,399
For me

349
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,839
All have the same purpose

350
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,079
That’s my son

351
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,279
Must dominate everything

352
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,719
Have you asked me if I am willing?

353
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,199
You are my son

354
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,599
This is your birthright

355
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,559
Your responsibility

356
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,679
Mother

357
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,399
I used to think you were vulnerable

358
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,399
Now feel you are so strange

359
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,839
If the guard of Mobei Princess is available

360
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,079
Please come out

361
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,199
Search

362
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,399
I didn’t expect you to have the courage

363
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,799
Is a man who dares to be a dare to be

364
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,999
But since it came out

365
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,839
Please come with me

366
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,279
Good

367
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,079
But I have a word

368
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,279
Need to declare

369
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,559
You say

370
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,319
I was the murderer last night

371
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,399
Tegin of Eagle Division from Ashile Tribe

372
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,359
Ashile Sun

373
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,439
He is Ashile Sun

374
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,279
He killed someone

375
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,759
I came here with Ashile Tribe’s Khatun

376
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,039
and Young Khan.

377
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,079
Placed t the side of Mobei Princess

378
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,759
Waiting for an opportunity to kill

379
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,079
Intent to assassinate the East Palace

380
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,159
My son who I think about day and night

381
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,959
Thought I was strange

382
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,199
Mother

383
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,079
Sorry

384
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,999
You say

385
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,919
Should I hate your Uncle Khan

386
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,999
Why do he want to separate our mother and child

387
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:34,959
Why

388
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,039
Want my son to rebel against me

389
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,359
I dare not

390
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,599
Dare not

391
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,759
You ruined my plan

392
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,759
Are you going to take me

393
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,319
Give to Great Tang

394
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,759
Mother

395
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,439
I just feels uncomfortable

396
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,879
Don’t want to hide

397
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,239
Khatun, not good

398
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,439
Great Tang brought troops here

399
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,479
Said to capture Young Khan

400
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,839
What

401
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,639
Khatun

402
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,159
Ashile Sun assassinating the Eastern Palace

403
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,159
Has already been explained

404
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,719
Say you and Young Khan

405
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,799
Behind the scenes

406
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,559
What a joke

407
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,439
Just by his one-sided words

408
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,839
Great Tang

409
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,679
Want to be an enemy of Ashile Tribe

410
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,279
But don’t panic

411
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,519
Wait for me to find out the truth

412
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,199
Naturally, you can be innocent

413
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,399
But now I need to bring Young Khan

414
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,279
Go back for questioning

415
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,519
Otherwise

416
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,519
It’s not easy to explain to the Crown Prince

417
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,559
Dare you

418
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,999
Mother

419
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,439
Our Ashile Tribe

420
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,919
Is always upright

421
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,959
Since Great Tang wants a truth

422
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,359
I am not afraid of the shadow

423
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,159
She’er

424
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,239
Princess

425
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,639
Young Khan is...

426
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,999
He is punishing me

427
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,159
A’Sun

428
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,639
Changge

429
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,599
Changge

430
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,319
You are hurt

431
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,799
What are you doing

432
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,799
It was you last night

433
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,799
Gave me a tranquilizer

434
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,799
Do you know what A’Sun is going to do

435
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:08,999
Brother Sun didn’t

436
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,199
Tell me the plan

437
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,039
He just begged me for help

438
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,879
I should have thought of it

439
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,159
He likes you so much

440
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,359
He can do anything for you

441
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,199
He wants

442
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,639
Help you pull down Ashile’s subordinates

443
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,879
I

444
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,479
Can you help me

445
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,079
Go and beg His Majesty Tang Emperor

446
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,639
Let him save their lives

447
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,759
In fact, killing Young Khan to death

448
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,599
It’s not good for him

449
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,399
I don’t care about Yicheng

450
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,639
What do you want

451
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,319
I can’t do it

452
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,679
Changge

453
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,519
You are now

454
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,999
Are the only one who can do it

455
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,839
And the only one who can ask His Majesty Tang Emperor

456
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,359
A man with a high hand

457
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,759
I know better than any of you

458
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,719
The saint

459
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,959
The so-called saint

460
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,479
For the prosperity of Great Tang

461
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,239
I don’t even care about my own life

462
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,319
Not to mention being an Ashile

463
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,079
Now Sun takes She’er as a hostage

464
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,759
Sent to Great Tang

465
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,799
He lost his life

466
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,119
Won a bargaining chip for the peace alliance

467
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,079
No matter how difficult the road is

468
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,359
The harder I am, the more I will go

469
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,519
There must be a way

470
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,799
National Affairs in the Six Secret Teachings

471
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,999
Back

472
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,359
I only wants one

473
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,799
Know the constraint equilibrium

474
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,039
Let go of the murderous prince

475
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,439
Father picked the wrong person

476
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,399
I only remember the laws of martial arts

477
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,959
Good good

478
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,839
Advisor Fang

479
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,439
Since today

480
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,759
Guilty

481
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,039
Ji Ling Zhong Shu Men

482
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,079
4 or more

483
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,519
And Shang Shu Jiuqing Yizhi

484
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,639
So

485
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,719
Injustice

486
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,439
The death of the Prince’s playmate

487
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,239
You must be innocent.

488
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,239
Can’t get a life in vain

489
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,159
Nowhere to go

490
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,159
All three are close ministers

491
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,759
I don’t shy away

492
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,519
Your Majesty

493
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,719
In a humble opinion

494
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,999
It’s better to take advantage of the momentum and pursue the victory

495
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,799
Although the dead is the prince’s attendant

496
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,159
But Ashile Tribe

497
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,759
Has assassinate one of the East Palace

498
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,679
That Ashile Tribe

499
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,359
Deserved to be put to death

500
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,919
After all sorts of smooth sailing

501
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,199
To

502
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,679
The alliance of the various ministries of the desert can be achieved

503
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,199
Unexpected

504
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,319
Someday

505
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,239
Will identify with Duke Du

506
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,879
Ashile’s Khatun

507
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,559
In the Sifang Pavilion

508
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,959
Now her only child is detained

509
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,119
She didn’t respond

510
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,519
This is not normal

511
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,799
It seems that

512
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,039
Not like Duke Du

513
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,439
As expected

514
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,879
Your Majesty

515
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,279
Rumors spread in the city

516
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,359
It is said that Ashile Tribe’s troops stationed in the western border

517
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,119
Various ministries in the desert are threatened

518
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,599
Shouldn’t have come back then

519
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,079
The patriarch has no news

520
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,799
Yeah

521
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,759
It seems

522
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,679
We really shouldn’t have come to Chang’an

523
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,479
Originally wanted

524
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,999
Find a backing for your own people

525
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,879
But now Nijia is gone

526
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,359
This is what caused trouble to the upper body

527
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,239
What about Monan?

528
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,439
Can’t be spared

529
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,239
Ashile Tribe

530
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,639
Is going to our hometown

531
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,839
It’s hard to ride a tiger now

532
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,559
Where is Father?

533
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,719
How is Father?

534
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,879
Can you cope

535
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,959
Princess

536
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,799
The leader makes the princess

537
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,199
Just stay in Chang’an

538
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,479
Can’t go back temporarily

539
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,039
Father said so

540
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,839
It must be me

541
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,079
You you

542
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,719
You guys

543
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,679
How did I tell you

544
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,039
Don’t provoke the Ashile Tribe

545
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,439
The current scourge

546
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,479
That’s you

547
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,199
Provoked

548
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,399
Fortunately

549
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,319
Our Tiele Tribe is spared

550
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,559
You see

551
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,999
What are the benefits with Great Tang’s peace alliance

552
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,119
I advise you

553
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,239
Hurry up and go tomorrow

554
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,879
If they really fight

555
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,079
Datang can save you

556
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,799
Makes sense

557
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,719
What can I do

558
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,639
Yes, you have to protect yourself

559
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,359
Can’t and union

560
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,879
Leave tomorrow

561
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,639
Can’t and union

562
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,559
Then let’s go tomorrow

563
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,999
Go

564
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,399
Leave tomorrow

565
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,679
Just go

566
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,719
Yes

567
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,959
That’s right

568
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,159
As long as people are gone

569
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,559
That person must have withdrawn their troops

570
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,759
I want Ashile Tribe

571
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,039
There are plenty of adults

572
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,759
Shouldn’t be embarrassing for you

573
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,959
Yes yes yes

574
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,879
Will forgive us for sure

575
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,759
Yes yes yes

576
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,119
Hurry up

577
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,479
Then we

578
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,159
Start tomorrow

579
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,279
Leave tomorrow

580
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,399
Princess wants to see you

581
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,119
I know, Changge

582
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,239
I heard you got hurt

583
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,439
Are you okay?

584
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,639
You

585
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,079
Do you know the news about A’Sun

586
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,679
Chengqian went crazy

587
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,759
Have to kill him

588
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,879
But don’t worry

589
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,199
On this knotty eye

590
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,559
He will be fine

591
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,839
You in the end

592
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,039
I’m fine, Leyan

593
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,399
You don’t have to worry about me

594
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,279
Right

595
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,359
Ashile Tribe is going to send troops

596
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,319
What’s the answer to Tai Chi Palace

597
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,839
This time

598
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,759
The news of the troops was too sudden

599
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,479
Father hasn’t received the military report

600
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,079
Military newspaper came from the border

601
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:11,959
Takes time

602
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,159
But this journey

603
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,639
Faster than the scout’s footsteps

604
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,839
Such a short time

605
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,839
Spread all over Chang’an

606
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,959
This disturbing method

607
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,159
Leyan

608
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,319
Dare you stay with me again

609
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,439
Take a risk

610
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,879
Thank you everyone

611
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,399
No envoys were suspicious

612
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,639
Thought these

613
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,439
Is the head of the family

614
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,919
Autograph

615
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,079
Even Princess Monan

616
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,239
Thought she received the letter

617
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,199
Is written by Yi Nan

618
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,399
They have confirmed

619
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,239
Chen Bing, Western Region of Ashile Tribe

620
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,559
Should be these two days

621
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,439
Will leave Chang’an

622
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,799
I think it’s Commander Yang

623
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,799
Ghost

624
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,879
Ghost

625
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,198
I beat you to death

626
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,959
You traitor

627
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,079
It’s pretty hard

628
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,439
Such a vicious traitor

629
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,519
Even united with the Ashile Tribe

630
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,399
Murder me

631
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,639
Use me to destroy the peace alliance

632
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,879
I’m taking him away today

633
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,879
Right

634
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,279
The table of letters inside

635
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,399
All forged

636
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,999
You take it

637
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,879
Sure enough, it was Yi Chengshi’s trick

638
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,279
Look at her now

639
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,159
What else to say

640
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,319
She’er

641
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,079
You will understand

642
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,159
Mother’s painstaking efforts

643
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,359
Princess

644
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:08,959
Princess

645
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,039
Not good

646
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,119
Chihe seems to have something wrong

647
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,399
My subordinate just saw

648
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,079
Li Changge

649
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,919
With Princess of Tang’s guard

650
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,119
Leave the hall

651
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,159
So I went to the Tiele Tribe’s residence to check

652
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,799
No one was there

653
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,999
Mess on the ground

654
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,199
Subordinate

655
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,679
Also found this

656
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,599
This is the ornament of a key member of the Tiele Tribe

657
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,239
Doesn’t belong to Chihe

658
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,759
In Great Tang

659
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,239
Can wear this kind of ornament

660
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,479
Zhixi

661
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,959
Zhixi is still alive

662
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,279
Mimi Guli

663
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,879
She didn’t even use poison

664
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,839
I want Mimi Guli

665
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,839
Watching Buzhen and Mu Jin with her own eyes

666
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,119
How did they die

667
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,519
In addition

668
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,599
Li Shimin wants to touch my son

669
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,759
I want his daughter

670
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,959
And the whole Great Tang will be buried with me

671
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,239
Yes Princess

672
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,119
People

673
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,999
Why are you saying this

674
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,079
What exactly is Great Tang going to do?

675
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,079
Just call us over

676
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,199
Ashile Tribe wants to be true

677
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,599
What to do if you send troops to attack

678
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,399
Yeah

679
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,759
What’s the use of keeping us closed?

680
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,239
If you really let Ashile Tribe

681
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,879
End our tribe

682
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,879
Home broken

683
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,319
What are we allied with?

684
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,079
All messengers can rest assured

685
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,319
News from Ashile Tribe’s soldiers

686
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,799
Is false news

687
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,759
This fake news

688
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,719
Princess

689
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,839
False news you told

690
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,919
What does it mean

691
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,119
Ashile Tribe did not send troops

692
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,319
Does not at all

693
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,879
Plan to attack the desert

694
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,759
Bring them in

695
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,919
He is Zhixi from the Tiele Tribe

696
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,119
He’s not dead

697
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,799
He’s not dead

698
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,439
He is still alive

699
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,319
What the hell is going on

700
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,239
Why is he still alive

701
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,799
I obviously saw him

702
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,719
Already dead

703
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,199
See it with my own eyes

704
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,759
I’m Zhixi

705
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,039
I’m not dead

706
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,639
This Chihe

707
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,319
He was long ago bribed by the people of Ashile Tribe

708
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,319
Bribe

709
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,479
After the ambassador to the Tang Dynasty

710
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,999
He kept instigating me

711
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,079
Let me oppose the alliance

712
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,719
In order to break the alliance

713
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,279
He still wants my life

714
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,799
If it’s not for the envoy of Mobei

715
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,399
I’m afraid

716
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,839
I really have become an injustice

717
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,959
Mobei Princess

718
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,599
You have something so late

719
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,559
Come in and talk

720
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,999
I’m going to make a long story short

721
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,679
Ashile Tribe wants to use poison

722
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,319
Take your life and blame me

723
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,199
Thus tore up all parts of the desert

724
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,439
Harmony with Great Tang

725
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,519
What

726
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,439
Nonsense

727
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,679
The messenger does not have to make a judgment first

728
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,239
Am I talking nonsense

729
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,599
You will know tomorrow

730
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,719
This medicine

731
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,759
Bleeding in the nose and mouth after eating

732
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,879
And the symptoms of poisoning death

733
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,879
Yes-kind

734
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,879
But it won’t kill you

735
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,319
What are you trying to say

736
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,039
What am i talking about now

737
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,399
You won’t believe it

738
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,479
As long as tomorrow

739
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,559
When someone takes your life

740
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,519
You will understand

741
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,479
Do you want to change

742
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,359
You figure it out

743
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,359
Even if what you said is true

744
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,199
Then why do you want to help me

745
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,519
I’m not helping you

746
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,639
I’m helping the whole desert

747
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,639
If there is no backing of Great Tang,

748
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,839
We will always only

749
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,919
Was led by the nose by Ashile Tribe

750
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,199
I really don’t understand

751
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,319
Actually at the beginning

752
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,519
I don’t believe in the words of Mobei Princess either

753
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,279
But who knows the next day

754
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,559
Actually as the princess said

755
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,519
Envoy Zhixi

756
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,079
Your maid is unwell today

757
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,399
Let me come over and help send off early

758
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,039
Good

759
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,239
But

760
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,519
Why would Mobei Princess

761
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,919
Know all this

762
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,479
Also prepared in advance

763
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,719
The pill of Zhixi’s suspended animation

764
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,759
Yeah

765
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,639
To

766
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,959
Want to plant it on me

767
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,599
Threatening my maid

768
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,519
It’s a pity they underestimated

769
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,359
The relationship between me and the maid

770
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,999
That day

771
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,719
The princess saw my strangeness

772
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,159
It’s time to play for the princess

773
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,439
Put the poison on

774
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,679
Zhixi’s food

775
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,159
Blame it on Li Changge afterwards

776
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,119
Otherwise

777
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,639
Think about your brother

778
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,319
Mimi

779
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,839
What’s wrong with you

780
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,999
You look flustered

781
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,159
I am fine

782
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,199
Is Yicheng threatening you?

783
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,719
Changge

784
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,959
She wants me

785
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,119
To poison Zhixi

786
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,359
Blame you

787
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,199
Destroy the alliance

788
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,959
Too vicious

789
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,479
To destroy the alliance

790
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,999
She actually killed him

791
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,599
Since she threatened you

792
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,479
Then you just follow it

793
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,759
Avoid her making things difficult for you in the future

794
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,279
But

795
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,519
It doesn’t matter

796
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,799
I have a way to fake it

797
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,239
Don’t worry, I will protect you

798
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,879
I won’t let you have an accident

799
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,159
Just let Zhixi die in a fake death

800
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,759
Clarify afterwards

801
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,959
Will Zhixi be willing to fake his death?

802
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,399
Can only bet

803
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,639
But

804
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,319
I bet he will

805
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,759
If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes

806
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,079
Heard it

807
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,399
I don’t believe in all of this either

808
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,839
The reason why I keep hiding

809
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,919
Did not show up

810
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,239
Just want to see

811
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,839
What other unseen things will Ashile Tribe do?
