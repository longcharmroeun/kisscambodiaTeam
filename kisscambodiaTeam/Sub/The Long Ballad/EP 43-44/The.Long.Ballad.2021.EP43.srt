00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,480
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,260
Episode 43

3
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,999
Why is she seeing Zhixi early?

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,319
Zhixi.

5
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,919
Why didn’t you answer when I call you for a long time?

6
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,239
Zhixi.

7
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,599
Zhixi.

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,799
Someone!

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,359
There is the trouble!

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,919
Someone, come!

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,279
Someone!

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,279
Take a look.

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,079
Zhixi died terribly.

14
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,599
He was fine yesterday.

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,599
How could this happen?

16
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,319
Wait.

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,239
It’s poison.

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,999
Take him away.

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,759
Mobei Princess.

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,119
Even if Zhixi didn’t want

21
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,199
to form an alliance,

22
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,479
you didn’t have to be cruel.

23
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,039
What?

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,359
It was Mobei Princess?

25
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,719
It was under the hands of the Mobei Princess?

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,319
What nonsense are you talking about?

27
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,319
I’m talking nonsense?

28
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,919
I’m not talking nonsense.

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,479
I saw it with my own eyes.

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,279
The maid of Mobei Princess

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,639
went to see Zhixi early morning.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,559
Zhixi is dead.

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,719
Among all of us,

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,359
only Chi Xi does not recognize the alliance.

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,359
You kill him.

36
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,679
This is too vicious.

37
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,759
If it is the tribes of the Great Desert

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,719
don’t recognize it,

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,719
it’s impossible

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,719
you will one by one

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,759
kill us all here?

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,719
If we don’t sign,

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,719
we get killed?

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,399
Yeah.

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,399
Everyone quit down first.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,159
This case happened in my Great Tang,

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,199
naturally by me

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,759
Great Tang officials are responsible for the investigation.

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,039
You came just right on time.

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,199
The perpetrator,

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,439
it was

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,079
the maid of Mobei Princess.

53
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,439
She gave it to Zhixi.

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,639
She saw him early this morning.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,159
After I went in to see him,

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,039
he was already dead.

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,759
Who else can it be?

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,119
Envoy is less restful.

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,439
Since I’m here

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,279
I will definitely check it out

61
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,319
Give an explanation to the envoys.

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,639
What did you find

63
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,919
There is no comment on an important case

64
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,039
Farewell

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,679
Young Master Wei

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,999
What are you hesitating

67
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,519
Now that we have found physical evidence

68
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,959
Just report it directly

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,399
Even if you are afraid of implicating Mobei Princess

70
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,479
You can’t hide it and not report it

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,319
Yeah

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,599
Mobei Princess

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,479
Is the one who contributed to the peace alliance

74
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,919
If she is suspected

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,519
The covenant will be affected

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,439
But you can’t hide it without reporting it

77
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,399
If Great Tang is covering up the suspicion

78
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,599
Only really affected

79
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,759
The foundation of the peace alliance

80
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,359
Important place for case handling

81
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,039
Idle people are not allowed to enter

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,959
A maid

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,559
Dare to poison people in this place

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,199
Say

85
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,719
The culprit behind you

86
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,839
Was it her?

87
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,199
There is no evidence and basis.

88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,159
Vicious words slander others

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,079
You all killed someone

90
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,319
Can’t others tell me?

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,159
Since you want your maid

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,479
Be your substitute

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,759
I fulfill your wish

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,999
Young Khan

95
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,359
Young Khan

96
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,679
In the public

97
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,119
Pointed a knife at a woman

98
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,839
The great desert’s face

99
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,999
I’ve lost all of you

100
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,799
Everyone is the warrior of every tribe

101
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,559
Battlefield kills

102
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,439
When to bully a woman

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,159
Interested

104
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,039
No rest, everyone

105
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,039
From this maid’s room

106
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,439
Found a bottle of poison

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,839
After inspection

108
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,759
The envoy indeed died of this poison

109
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,079
Personal evidence and physical evidence

110
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,439
What else to say

111
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,439
I said

112
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,199
Don’t bully women

113
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,239
Young Khan

114
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,079
Are you going to protect the real murderer?

115
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,399
I haven’t finished talking just now

116
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,759
Although the medicine bottle is from

117
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,399
Found in the maid’s room

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,239
But doesn’t belong to this maid

119
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,959
This medicine bottle

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,439
It’s from Young Khan of Ashile Tribe

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,839
That’s right

122
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,719
This residence in Central Plains

123
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,159
Mostly built with wood

124
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,999
Recruiting rats and insects

125
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,519
I prepared this bottle of poison

126
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,479
The medicine is indeed mine

127
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,599
I did give it to Zhixi

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,279
Young Khan this

129
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,119
This medicine is really yours

130
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,759
But I saw this maid with my own eyes

131
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,719
Walk out of Zhixi’s room

132
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,839
Now medicine bottle

133
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,839
Searched her room again

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,559
This

135
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,119
How does this explain

136
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,479
You mean

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,839
I instructed this maid from Mobei

138
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,159
to assassinate Zhixi

139
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,519
Then I planted and blamed her

140
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,319
I just elaborated

141
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,599
The facts you have seen with your own eyes

142
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,319
Everyone has many doubts in this case

143
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,839
We will check them one by one

144
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,359
Give everyone an innocence

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,479
Everyone is a great guest of Great Tang

146
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,559
We Great Tang

147
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,159
Will be polite

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,479
Before the case is cleared

149
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,719
Young Khan must not leave

150
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,799
His room half a step

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,039
Guarded by Tang officials

152
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,679
Cooperate with the trial at any time

153
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,239
The maid

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,799
And don’t leave the Sifang Pavilion

155
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,719
If you flee without authorization

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,439
The murderer

157
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,639
Young Khan, please

158
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,359
This matter is getting more and more complicated

159
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,319
Who did it?

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,359
It could be great

161
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,079
if such peace can exist and last forever

162
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,479
May every citizen of Great Tang

163
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,479
Have food and clothing

164
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,359
They’ll definitely will

165
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,759
His Majesty governs the country and loves the people

166
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,719
Great Tang will once again become peaceful

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,239
Old man

168
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,199
Let me help you

169
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,999
Old man, are you okay?

170
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,919
I’m fine

171
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,959
My grandson is still waiting for me to cook

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,519
Old man

173
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,399
Let me help you

174
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,559
It’s not convenient,

175
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,279
you have to accompany your wife

176
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,399
No no no

177
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,479
Old man

178
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,199
My wife would agree, let me help you

179
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,279
I’ll help you

180
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,639
Thank you

181
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,159
What a great man

182
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,679
I always thought

183
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,359
We were connected as mother and son

184
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,479
I just understood today

185
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,799
It turned out not to be like this

186
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,679
She’er

187
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,199
Left me for too long

188
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,479
He never knew what I did

189
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,319
What I mean to do

190
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,599
He stood up today

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,279
Took the blame for Mimi Guli

192
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,759
Just ignore me as a mother

193
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,439
Should I should punish him

194
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,439
Or punish myself

195
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,679
Princess

196
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,039
Rest assured

197
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,119
I will take care of this matter

198
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,759
Make sure Young Khan is unharmed

199
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,719
Right

200
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,599
To

201
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,719
If the night is too long, there will be more dreams

202
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,719
We want to speed up

203
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,519
Subordinates understand

204
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,839
Changge

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,079
I want to see She’er

206
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,919
Can you help me

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,959
Beg Young Master Wei

208
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,439
To let me see She’er

209
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,279
What do you want to see him?

210
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,519
I did not expect

211
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,879
He will stand up for me

212
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,319
I was his playmate when I was young

213
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,879
Also a slave

214
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,799
But he really treats me as a friend

215
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,039
In fact, he is quite pitiful

216
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,239
OK then I will help you

217
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,279
But come back soon after you see him

218
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,719
Don’t be known

219
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,639
Stand still

220
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,319
Why are you here

221
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,599
I’m afraid you can’t get used to

222
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,719
Great Tang’s food

223
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,879
So I made you lamb noodles

224
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,559
Eat while it’s hot

225
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,599
Delicious

226
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,559
Why did you take the blame for me

227
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,839
You being like this

228
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,799
Katun will be upset

229
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,359
You are not afraid of damaging

230
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,799
Ashile Tribe’s reputation

231
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,759
She’er

232
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,359
Mimi

233
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,759
You made your own food

234
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,999
Have you been

235
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,599
Listening to me

236
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,999
Why should you admit

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,239
That poison is yours

238
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,039
How do you know it’s not mine

239
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,839
Is it really your poison

240
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,839
The Mimi I know

241
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,319
Is a kind and enthusiastic

242
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,079
Love to help weak women

243
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,199
How could she kill someone?

244
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,319
Ever since youth

245
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,359
Everyone treats me on the surface

246
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,439
Respectful

247
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,719
Just because I’m Young Khan

248
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,559
Only you

249
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,199
You really treat me like a friend

250
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,679
That was the time I missed so much

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,359
Since you left

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,839
I haven’t paid my sincerity anymore

253
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,119
Today’s matter

254
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,799
I just want to protect for the first time

255
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,439
I just want to protect someone

256
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,319
She’er

257
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,719
Thank you

258
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,239
But we can’t

259
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,319
This is my business

260
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,519
I’m leaving

261
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,759
She’er

262
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,959
Actually in this world

263
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,239
Many people are not

264
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,879
As you see on the surface

265
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,679
Such as

266
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,279
Just like me

267
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,559
Maybe

268
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,319
Maybe I am not

269
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,479
So kind as you imagined

270
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,639
I hope

271
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,399
You don’t care

272
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,839
Encounter anything

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,239
All judge by their own hearts

274
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,999
Because

275
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,519
You are different from other grassland people

276
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,279
What are you doing being clumsy?

277
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,079
Wipe it clean

278
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,959
Good good good

279
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,359
Khan

280
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,239
Khan

281
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,879
Khan

282
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,639
Khan

283
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,598
I am Mu Jin

284
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,359
Khan, I want to ask you

285
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,639
If yes

286
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,359
You blink

287
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,919
It’s Yicheng who hurt you

288
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,959
Right now Ashile Tribe

289
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,679
Is controlled by Yicheng

290
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,799
Commander Lei

291
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,799
Has Khan awake?

292
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,559
Commander Lei

293
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,839
Still asleep

294
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,839
Khan

295
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,719
This is Dingxiang

296
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,479
Prince Sui of the former Sui Dynasty

297
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,279
Is it also here

298
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,319
Khan

299
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,759
I am alone now

300
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,359
There is no way to save you

301
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,559
But I will find a way

302
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,199
Notify A’Sun

303
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,719
Yes

304
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,719
A’Sun is not dead

305
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,599
If he knew

306
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,839
Where you are now

307
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,159
He will definitely come to save you

308
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,479
Lending you the fish token

309
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,599
Private allowing Mimi Guli to see Sheer

310
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,959
Already violated

311
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,799
This time, Uncle Kobu took the initiative to confess

312
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,639
Just leave it alone

313
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,639
Since you know

314
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,919
I came to commit a drug case

315
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,919
Then you must know

316
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,399
It’s not that simple

317
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,839
Changge

318
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,519
Banye Kobe has already admitted by himself

319
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,239
He took it

320
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,759
The medicine of Ashile Tribe’s Young Khan

321
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,519
Then put it in

322
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,079
In your maid’s room

323
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,919
Things have reached this point

324
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,399
The real culprit can only be him

325
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,239
I don’t believe you really would

326
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,039
Take Ashile Sheer for this

327
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,159
Since you must

328
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,079
Bring out the real murderer

329
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,039
Then this thing can’t

330
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,919
Take it so hard

331
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,759
But the man has committed suicide

332
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,879
Wei Shuyu

333
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,559
Sometimes something

334
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,599
It’s not that you see

335
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,279
What the ear hears

336
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,879
It must be the truth

337
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,719
The truth

338
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,279
Changge

339
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,079
Not all the truth

340
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,479
Have to get to the bottom

341
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,599
Sometimes the truth

342
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,199
Will only cause more trouble

343
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,839
What are you afraid of

344
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,959
Nothing right now

345
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,519
More important than the peace alliance

346
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,959
It’s better to stop here

347
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,279
Also

348
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,959
Your maid

349
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,759
It’s really not that simple

350
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,599
Her hands and feet are not clean

351
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,759
You have to be careful

352
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,239
Best not to stay by your side

353
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,559
I have my own measures

354
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,799
I advise you not to trust others

355
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,119
The most life-threatening

356
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,999
Often around

357
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,719
Betrayal by someone close

358
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,919
I’m just worried about you as a friend

359
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,599
And now by your side

360
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,839
Protect you

361
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,519
Inseparable person

362
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,799
It’s not a friend of Great Tang

363
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,119
I trust them

364
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,279
They trust me too

365
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,679
This is the same as that of Great Tang or the grasslands

366
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,119
It doesn’t matter

367
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,599
Changge

368
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,199
I’m just worried about you

369
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,679
I really didn’t mean anything

370
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,279
You worry wrong

371
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,279
If you just said A’Sun

372
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,079
I can too

373
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,319
Tell you plainly

374
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,439
Whether it’s him

375
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,479
Or my maidservant Mimi

376
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,279
Life and death friends

377
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,919
Is worth me

378
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,239
Friends you’ll make in your life

379
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,799
This time

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,519
I have experienced too many things

381
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,079
I understand this world

382
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,839
It’s not all black and white

383
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,799
Some people have their difficulties

384
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,399
If we must let this trust

385
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,799
If there is a price

386
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,679
I’ll recognize it too

387
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,279
Crown Prince

388
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,159
Few of you

389
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,919
Why are you so inconspicuous?

390
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,439
Crown Prince

391
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,919
If you are curious

392
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,159
What is the curator of Sifang?

393
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,319
Just tell me

394
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,639
To bring you here alone

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,239
Have to walk so much

396
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,839
My lone foot hurts

397
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,759
Why does the prince follow me

398
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,159
Orphans and relatives are here

399
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,679
Just come over and take a look

400
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,159
Relatives

401
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,559
For a peace alliance

402
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,799
These desert ministries

403
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,279
I’ll be a family from now on

404
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,679
Go

405
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,759
Your Highness

406
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,039
I want to go to the restroom

407
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,079
It hurts

408
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,199
Go there

409
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,359
Li Changge

410
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,519
So boring

411
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,999
You always do this

412
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,039
If I scare Sister

413
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,999
She will cry

414
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,719
You should try to scare your father

415
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,039
Then cry for you

416
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,199
You are really boring

417
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,239
Always talk to me about my father

418
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,319
I didn’t even tell my father

419
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,159
You are here

420
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,799
Very loyal

421
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,239
Still stern

422
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,719
Yeah what don’t you know

423
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,159
Need you to tell him

424
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,159
Your sister’s marriage

425
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,239
To be set soon

426
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,319
If you are idle

427
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,239
You go back and help

428
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,239
I have something else here

429
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,439
Don’t hinder me

430
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,759
A sister is going to marry

431
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,999
The adopted son of Minister Du

432
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,519
I’m not a hundred

433
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,679
I hope this world

434
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,839
The best man comes to marry my sister

435
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,879
Why are you looking at me like this

436
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,719
I can understand now

437
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,679
Why your father

438
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,519
I’m going to make you a reserve

439
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,359
That’s naturally because of loneliness

440
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,599
Wencheng Wude

441
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,479
Tian Zong Talent

442
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,399
Is a rare man in the world

443
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,439
Don’t go

444
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,839
That

445
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,239
Tell me

446
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,759
Why did Father set me up

447
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,199
You are not good

448
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,199
Shut up

449
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,239
Not smart and can’t do it

450
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,519
But you will always see

451
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,119
Others’ good

452
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,119
The so-called Junji

453
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,919
Is to treat the people around you

454
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,479
Love and care

455
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,239
Only those who love close

456
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,999
To love the children of the Quartet

457
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,319
Presumably he doesn’t want to

458
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,079
Let some things happen again

459
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,399
If we say

460
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,719
In other words, it’s you

461
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,959
I should save the people around me

462
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,119
Praise me, praise me

463
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,359
To

464
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,199
Best compliment

465
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,519
Talk more about me

466
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,639
Tell you

467
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,279
I can do a great job

468
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,799
To

469
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,279
If you are a man

470
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,039
It’s worthy of my sister

471
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,079
If I was a man

472
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,679
I can’t marry your sister either

473
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,759
Because my surname is Li

474
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,199
Also right

475
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,079
So

476
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,599
Li Changge’s surname Li

477
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,159
It’s the Li from Tang Dynasty

478
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,199
Yang Cheng

479
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,239
You try to check

480
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,519
Genealogy of Li Jiancheng

481
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,199
I don’t want to go empty this time

482
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,759
God helps me revive the Sui Dynasty

483
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,319
Turned her into

484
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,399
Delivered to me

485
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,719
Congratulations to the princess

486
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,359
Sheng Xin

487
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,039
Yang Cheng will try

488
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,479
Send the letter to the East Palace

489
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,199
You just have to act according to plan

490
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,199
If we recovery

491
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,799
You are the head

492
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,439
Worship the king

493
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,439
Li Tang can’t give you everything

494
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,879
I can give you

495
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,439
Thank you Princess

496
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,199
Go

497
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,159
Yes

498
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,599
The defeat of the owner of Mobei

499
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,759
It’s true that I miscalculated Khan

500
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,399
Mimi Guli’s thoughts

501
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,959
Since this chess piece

502
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,999
Failed to play the role it should have

503
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,319
May also disrupt

504
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,679
Young Khan’s mind

505
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,559
Not as good as

506
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,879
Let’s abandon her

507
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,759
After all it’s me

508
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,639
Elaborately educated those who came

509
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,599
What a pity to abandon it

510
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,719
Forget it

511
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,319
As long as Buzhen is still in our hands

512
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,479
Mimi Guli

513
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,839
How can I be afraid

514
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,919
This person

515
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,719
As long as there is desire and fear

516
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,399
Just weak

517
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,199
Will be led away

518
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,399
Li Changge is like this

519
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,759
Ashile Sun is like this

520
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,799
It’s a pity

521
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,879
She’er is the same

522
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,959
Princess

523
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,639
It’s time for Young Khan

524
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,319
To understand something

525
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,519
Since She’er is free

526
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,359
I should go visit

527
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,999
Katun

528
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,879
Young Khan would like to see you

529
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,279
Sure enough, mother and child are connected

530
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,559
Subordinates retire first

531
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,319
I have caused trouble to Mother

532
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,959
Please Mother punish me

533
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,159
Sit down

534
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,679
Our mother and son finally get together

535
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,639
How can I bear it

536
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,439
Seeing you being imprisoned

537
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,359
Never tell me

538
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,799
You’ve caused me trouble

539
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,439
I know

540
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,479
I suddenly commit the crime

541
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,519
It must be Mother’s painstaking efforts

542
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,919
These

543
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,839
Does not count for anything

544
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,519
Come

545
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,039
Eat

546
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,119
Your favorite pastries

547
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,319
Mother

548
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,799
Do you know who poisoned him?

549
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,839
Are these important?

550
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,159
If the truth is not important

551
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,439
What is important

552
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,119
Recovery of the Sui?

553
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,399
Sorry

554
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,759
These I shouldn’t ask

555
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,999
No

556
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,079
It’s not that you shouldn’t ask

557
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,119
But you should have understood

558
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,039
Since your Uncle Khan

559
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,919
Separate us mother and child

560
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,639
You are always outside

561
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,199
Savage growth

562
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,279
You have your way of doing things

563
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,959
Mother doesn’t blame you

564
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,279
It’s just that the world is cold

565
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,959
Unpredictable

566
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,559
Mother has no chance

567
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,319
Teach you well

568
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,839
Just let you go further and further away from me

569
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,279
Mother

570
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,599
I just want to guard Mother

571
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,159
Filial piety

572
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,919
I also want to do what I think

573
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,239
That’s why

574
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,479
You grow up

575
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,239
Mother is getting old

576
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,759
Many times

577
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,799
I have more than my heart but I don’t have enough energy

578
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,239
Don’t figure you can understand

579
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,079
But Mother hopes

580
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,039
Can you understand one thing

581
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,679
That is no matter what Mother does

582
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,079
All for you

583
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,319
My child

584
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,719
Buzhen

585
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,159
Buzhen

586
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,999
Buzhen

587
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,559
What are you doing when you wake up

588
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,519
I’ll play with you later

589
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,759
Buzhen

590
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,839
You are Buzhen

591
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,319
You know me

592
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,359
I am your sister’s friend

593
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,959
You’re my sister’s friend

594
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,319
Commander Lei

595
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,439
Get up

596
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,879
Take good care of Hi Majesty

597
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,839
Naturally nothing will happen

598
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,079
Buzhen

599
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,039
I’m leaving

600
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,559
Don’t tell anyone

601
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,439
You saw me

602
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,519
Sister is alright?

603
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,839
Very good

604
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,599
Lied to the military and sneaked into Dingxiang

605
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,079
This time

606
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,919
I want to see how Ashile Sun can save you.

607
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,959
Changge.

608
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,359
What are you doing?

609
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,279
Why are you so careless?

610
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,559
Buy instead if you can’t embroider.

611
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:04,959
Leyan’s marriage

612
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,439
is going to be settled soon.

613
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,319
I can’t appear in front of the civil and military officials as the envoy of Mobei.

614
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,399
Since I can’t attend her wedding

615
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,799
I have to embroider her something.

616
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,439
Better fan

617
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,239
But you see

618
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,599
it’s so hideous.

619
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,399
What are you laughing?

620
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,158
It looks great.

621
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,999
I think it looks the best.

622
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,559
I must find the best embroider in Chang’an.

623
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,999
I can’t even embroider good-looking ones.

624
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,999
When

625
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,879
can I fan it for you?
(A’Sun is waiting to be Changge’s husband)

626
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,239
Who said I’m giving it to you?

627
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,559
Here in Great Tang

628
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,439
I also need three books and six rituals from my parents.

629
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,479
But both of my parents aren’t here anymore.

630
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,959
I don’t know if my mother would like it.

631
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,519
She will.

632
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,519
The heavens can also be your parents

633
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,479
They will recognize their daughter’s husband

634
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,599
I swear to Sirius

635
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,239
I will treat you good for eternity

636
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,599
and forever.

637
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,279
Your words,

638
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,559
it’s not that I don’t believe it.

639
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,519
It’s just a pity

640
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,439
That my mother can’t see you in person.

641
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,199
Alright, enough talking

642
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,639
I’m going to head out,

643
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,759
to look for the best embroider pieces

644
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,839
I’ll go visit your mother for the marriage.

645
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,799
Tian Yuan’s scenery is so nice

646
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,359
Let’s go again next time

647
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,119
Will we be blamed for not returning to the palace the for the past few days?

648
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,239
Rest assured

649
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,039
I’ve already let His Majesty know

650
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,159
Really

651
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,999
When

652
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,079
Why don’t I know

653
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,999
Then you’re saying that

654
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,639
If in the future

655
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,199
you’re going to listen to me

656
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,919
Or listen to Father

657
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,639
I...

658
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,799
Buy some candy

659
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,159
Look

660
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,519
They’re selling sweet candies

661
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,239
I remember the first time I ate them were at Luoyang

662
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,279
Do you recall?

663
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,159
I remember

664
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,759
You also gave me it as a gift

665
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,399
I still have the one you gave to me

666
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,199
You still kept it?

667
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,399
Stop

668
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,439
Then wait for me, I’ll buy it for you

669
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,719
How much is this

670
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,999
2 coins

671
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,159
Thank you

672
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,919
Leyan

673
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,119
Leyan

674
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,639
Leyan

675
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,199
I thought I lost you again

676
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,679
Why would I

677
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,679
I know you must

678
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,719
I know you’ll be able to find me

679
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,639
Why are you sitting here

680
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,079
I accidentally twisted my foot just now

681
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,119
You hurt sprained your ankle?

682
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,119
Wait

683
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,479
Earlier I saw this chain

684
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,759
this sword

685
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,639
is particularly in line with your temperament

686
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,999
Do you like it

687
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,279
I...

688
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,879
I like it

689
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,119
Leyan

690
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,839
From now on

691
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,039
I won’t ever let you leave my side

692
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,919
I’m not worried at all now

693
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,959
Because of you now

694
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,679
Are your feet okay

695
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,399
Come

696
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,439
Madam.

697
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,439
I am Ashile Sun.

698
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,119
Long time so no see

699
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,119
Today I came to

700
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,839
ask for your permission

701
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,359
and I hope Madam

702
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,839
will give me permission to marry Changge as my wife.

703
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,199
There are three reasons for Sun to marry Changge.

704
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,470
First

705
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,799
Since you’ve left Changge for a long time

706
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,439
Changge no longer have anyone

707
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,519
If no one

708
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,879
worries about heart warm feelings

709
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,879
but loneliness will accompany.

710
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,159
If she doesn’t have anyone to lean on,

711
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,639
I, Sun

712
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,119
is willingly to accompany Changge.

713
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,400
Second

714
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,679
I, Sun have practiced martial arts since childhood

715
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,199
I believe

716
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,199
I have some achievements.

717
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,119
Although Eagle Division is no longer an active group

718
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,319
But I believe that

719
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,679
I can protect Changge

720
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,599
Won’t let her starve

721
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,039
Won’t let anyone

722
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,959
Hurt Changge a tiny bit

723
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,479
In my heart

724
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,159
Changge is more important than life

725
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,880
Third

726
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,479
If a person asks what to pursues in his life

727
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,079
I’m afraid it’s illusory

728
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,399
Through twists and turns

729
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,799
You’ll have to try your best

730
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,359
until the end

731
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,319
All I want is

732
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,199
for there to be peace

733
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,999
This is Changge’s wish

734
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,919
I hope

735
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,319
this is also your wish.

736
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,639
Until the end of the peace alliance

737
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,759
Sun wants to take Changge back

738
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,119
and stay away from endless wars

739
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,599
and have a happy life from now on.

740
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,079
Right now

741
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,119
I can’t get any decent dowry.

742
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,319
But Madam don’t you worry,

743
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,999
Sun swears to Sirius.

744
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,119
Whether it’s money

745
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,679
or the heart

746
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,999
Sun will be bound to Changge

747
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,919
and commit to everything.

748
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,399
Sugar candies, but sugar candies

749
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,559
Finally found the princess

750
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,879
You are?

751
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,999
I am the Crown Prince’s subordinate, Sheng Xin.

752
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,839
Your Highness said he asked me to pass on a message

753
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,119
He wants to see his cousin

754
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,039
The princess does not need to be nervous

755
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,959
Your Highness dared to keep such a private matter

756
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,799
And told me

757
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,239
It shows the trust in me

758
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,319
I never dare to say anything

759
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,799
Otherwise, the princess and your highness

760
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,719
You can take the head of this servant at any time

761
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,639
Long story short

762
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,639
Your Highness can’t appear

763
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,839
Just me

764
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,039
Find the princess now

765
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,159
Said he found some

766
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,439
Important things

767
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,239
Hand it over to his cousin

768
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,119
I am afraid that he won’t be able to win the trust of the princess

769
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,759
Your Highness is a bit difficult

770
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,319
I still wants me to just say

771
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,519
He wants to find his cousin

772
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,599
The princess will believe me

773
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,519
If the princess is suspicious

774
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,999
Not as good as a person

775
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,759
Walk with me

776
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,879
Not really

777
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,799
Crown Prince said

778
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,919
This matter must not be delay

779
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,279
I also ask the princess to go to the meeting place immediately
