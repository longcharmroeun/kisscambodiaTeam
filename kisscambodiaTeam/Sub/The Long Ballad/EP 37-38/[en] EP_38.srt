00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,999
♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,950
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,919
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,789
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,789
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,839
♫ To the distance. ♫

10

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,840

20

The Long Ballad

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,720
Episode 38

22
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,590
What happened?

23
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,310
We are afraid of you now.

24
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,510
So we are here to give you some presents, and make peace.

25
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,549
My captain pays his respect to you, Tegin Sun.

26
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,748
Is this from Pusa?

27
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:09,669
Yes.

28
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,949
Mobei was obtrusive and ignorant, which led to public wrath.

29
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,468
My captain was really sorry for that.

30
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,789
So he is asking for forgiveness from Ashile Tribe.

31
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,590
These are our gifts.

32
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,629
Please say some good words for Mobei to Great Khan.

33
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,430
As long as it is done, more valuable gifts would be here.

34
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:25,989
Of course.

35
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,149
It's priceless.

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,029
Please cherish it, Tegin Sun.

37
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,948
Let me have a look.

38
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,029
What so priceless?

39
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,909
No worries, Tegin.

40
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,470
Our captain would never make a fish of one and flesh of another.

41
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,790
Why mine is so small?

42
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,909
This is good!

43
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,990
So big!

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,509
I never saw such a big one before.

45
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,589
Who wants your stone?

46
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,869
Send these to my place later.

47
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,108
Okay.

48
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:01,909
I will divide.

49
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,230
I am the most impartial one here.

50
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,109
Go.

51
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,010
[Meet at Wild Wolf Hill at midnight]

52
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,510
So you are just going to have a date after all these?

53
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,308
She must have something important to tell me.

54
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:46,550
I will go to see her tonight, you guard here for me.

55
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,530
[Copy that...]

56
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,490
[Copy that, be there or be square.]

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,188
What?

58
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:03,188
Just this?

59
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:03,989
Any problem?

60
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,869
She is asking for a date.

61
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,228
Sun!

62
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:11,070
Did you ever hear a phrase, "Express your love through words"?

63
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,948
We know each other, so we don't need this.

64
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:17,389
So you don't have to write something more?

65
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,070
Then what should I write?

66
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,828
What?

67
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,508
Should I teach you this?

68
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:27,030
You can write anything you want to say to her.

69
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,269
Fine, I won't look.

70
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,789
Just write it down.

71
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:55,509
Don't peep!

72
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,908
Fine, fine.

73
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,908
Keep writing.

74
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,709
I won't peep.

75
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,109
So fast!

76
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,669
Don't you need to write more?

77
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,190
It's not necessary.

78
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,030
Don't peep!

79
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:24,430
Okay, fine, I know.

80
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,789
Tegin Sun said that he would be there on time tonight.

81
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,828
This is?

82
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:37,628
I have no idea.

83
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,309
He just asked me to send this back to you.

84
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,390
Thanks.

85
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,350
Captain.

86
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:02,508
Already checked the box?

87
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:03,550
Anything private?

88
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,788
What a surprise!

89
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,789
This famous Ashile Sun is such a tender man!

90
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:33,450
[I miss you.]

91
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,149
♫ Along this way ♫

92
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,450
♫ who can say she has never been shy and missed anything? ♫

93
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:56,399
♫ Look at the color of the sky ♫

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,774
♫ It's so beautiful on your eyebrow ♫

95
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:04,499
♫ Look at you in my eyes ♫

96
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,924
♫ You make my heart rate rock ♫

97
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:11,124
♫ which puts my hair in a mess ♫

98
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,649
♫ When I look at you ♫

99
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,999
♫  I can feel that ♫

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,675
♫ it's a kind of warmth that I have hoped for so long ♫

101
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,369
♫ I hope so much that you were me ♫

102
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,049
♫ The eternal song ♫

103
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,899
♫ would be sung loudly when I feel lonely ♫

104
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,624
♫ So I hold your hands tight ♫

105
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,674
♫  All the lights ♫

106
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:43,650
♫ would light up the immense sky ♫

107
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,788
Senior Qin told me that you decided to stay at Mobei.

108
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,229
If I was not for treating my people,

109
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,669
I would have caught you back earlier.

110
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:16,709
What?

111
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,789
You used face powder today?

112
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,310
It's from Zhenzhu.

113
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,389
Maybe I touched it accidentally.

114
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:28,470
Smells good?

115
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,990
It seems her taste is not so good.

116
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,829
Then I would not let her use it later.

117
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,509
Back to our business.

118
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,028
Why is Eagle Division here?

119
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,510
Because of military orders.

120
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,189
Asking those who just recovered from the plague to fight...

121
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,229
It seems that Khan's Tent just wants to wipe out Eagle Division.

122
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,029
Changge.

123
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:55,069
You know that I never want to think bad of him.

124
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,870
But that's the fact!

125
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,150
If you are asking me to betray Ashile Tribe,

126
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:00,789
and Great Khan,

127
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,350
then I can't.

128
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,550
I owe him for bringing me up.

129
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:10,070
I can't break faith with him.

130
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:12,028
What about Eagle Division?

131
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:12,909
What can it do?

132
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:15,390
I have no choice.

133
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,310
You do.

134
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,789
I ask you to meet here tonight, just want to tell you,

135
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,589
you have a third choice apart from betrayal and hibernation.

136
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,469
He agreed?

137
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,070
He would reply in two days.

138
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,069
I warn you.

139
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,588
If I didn't get the reply I want in two days,

140
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,750
you would not live to the third day.

141
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,870
Sun.

142
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,949
Bear Division is asking for us,

143
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,908
they have something important to discuss.

144
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:00,709
Go.

145
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,148
Why do you look so terrible?

146
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,669
Did you stay up late?

147
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,749
Let me in!

148
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,468
I have to see Mu Jin and Tegin Sun.

149
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:16,028
Let me in, I'm here for important business!

150
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,268
Mimi?

151
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:18,190
Let her in.

152
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,469
You can't trust Bear Division.

153
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:25,950
You would die!

154
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:42,469
Sun.

155
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,790
I've checked.

156
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,459
Just like Mimi said,

157
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,499
the bolts and slings should have been aimed at the desert,

158
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,098
but the angle is lowered now.

159
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,700
It can't be such a big mistake.

160
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,020
Obviously they are aiming at us.

161
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,658
It's an urgent situation.

162
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,339
Say something!

163
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,418
Let me think about it.

164
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,939
What to think about?

165
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,379
In past days, dare Tu Kashe to do that?

166
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,899
He must be instigated by someone else.

167
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,700
Shut up!

168
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,580
Even if we win this time,

169
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,260
we survive the war,

170
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,658
and he lets us go, what about the next time?

171
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:19,940
And in the future?

172
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,340
Only if Eagle Division vanishes, could they stop their attack to us.

173
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,620
You guys leave for a moment.

174
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,060
I need to be alone now.

175
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:39,940
Let's go, Mimi.

176
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:42,738
Mimi, I have a question.

177
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,298
I know your question.

178
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:45,699
I have something to tell you later.

179
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,480
The reason why I know this

180
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,539
is that I am a spy sent by Khan's Tent.

181
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,259
And?

182
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,060
And...

183
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:12,999
the boy which infected Eagle Division

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,419
looks so much like my brother Buzhen,

185
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:18,298
so she knew that I would definitely save him.

186
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,140
So... you have a brother?

187
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,020
He is still in their hand as a hostage.

188
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,020
They even asked me to destroy the gromwell,

189
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,020
or they would kill him.

190
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,419
You saved Eagle Division,

191
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,900
and you are our benefactor.

192
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:45,779
I promise,

193
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,020
I would find ways to help your brother out.

194
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:56,580
I don't even know if he is still alive.

195
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:02,979
No matter he is alive or dead,

196
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,940
I would do it for you.

197
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,700
Sun and I will go to see Tu Kashe first.

198
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:11,659
Don't worry.

199
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,340
You will always be our family,

200
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:17,500
you will always be my Mimi.

201
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,700
Mu Jin!

202
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:30,339
Follow me.

203
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,859
I have to leave now.

204
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,299
You're here.

205
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,058
Just these food?

206
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:55,379
I'm afraid that these are just enough for three days.

207
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,219
Just for those weak soldiers in Mobei,

208
00:13:58,219 --> 00:13:59,500
isn't it enough?

209
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,620
Mobei asked for peace and gave us gifts.

210
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:03,259
What do you think of it?

211
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,419
We will accept the gifts,

212
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,179
and also fight against them.

213
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,739
Tegin is quite a trustworthy man.

214
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,580
I will start the fight tomorrow.

215
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,978
I will use my 10,000 men to wipe out 5000 cavalrymen of Mobei.

216
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:21,140
And then take the chance to besiege Mobei.

217
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:25,179
How do you think of it, Tegin Sun?

218
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:28,779
Okay.

219
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,899
But that's not enough.

220
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,538
So your opinion?

221
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,140
You start the fight tomorrow,

222
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,660
and they will have a whole night for preparation.

223
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,940
If they store up energy and strength,

224
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:41,779
and get into fight tomorrow,

225
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,819
your odds to win would not be high.

226
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:48,780
So your plan is... We can tell them the battle is tomorrow,

227
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:52,978
but we will secretly start the battle tonight.

228
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:53,859
Sneak attack?

229
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,820
Taking advantage of their slackness,

230
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:59,460
and unpreparedness, we will make a surprise attack on them.

231
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,979
Okay. As you say.

232
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:16,539
Young Khan.

233
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:17,939
Let me in.

234
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,940
I have to see Uncle Khan.

235
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:21,179
Forgive me please, Young Khan.

236
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,579
Great Khan is having rest now.

237
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,459
He ordered no one should disturb him.

238
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,259
I'm here to pay for a visit, can't I?

239
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,020
Don't put me in a pickle please, Young Khan.

240
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,019
Sher.

241
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,180
Mom.

242
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:41,899
Wait.

243
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,260
Mom.

244
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,580
Uncle Khan said we shouldn't meet privately.

245
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,459
Now this order is invalid.

246
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,738
What?

247
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:55,939
When?

248
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,379
Why did no one tell me about it?

249
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,299
Great Khan just told me in person.

250
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:06,979
What happened?

251
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:08,779
No.

252
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,580
I...

253
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,140
I just can't accept it at once.

254
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,580
You will get used to it.

255
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,298
You are my son.

256
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:20,579
We should not be separated actually.

257
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,260
But why... why did Uncle Khan permit it?

258
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,699
Maybe...

259
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,459
Your Uncle Khan didn't feel the importance of kinship until he fell ill.

260
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,298
Then it's been a long time since I've left him,

261
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,939
I should visit him now.

262
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,858
Besides, I have something to ask him.

263
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,658
Your Uncle Khan just drank medicine, he is asleep now.

264
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:44,099
You can ask me anything, it's the same.

265
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,340
Go ahead.

266
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,738
Uncle Khan dispatched Eagle and Bear Division to fight Mobei.

267
00:16:57,739 --> 00:16:58,859
What about my Wolf Division?

268
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
So what?

269
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,779
This chance should be my Wolf Division.

270
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
In the battle in Weishui,

271
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,098
Wolf Division had no distribution.

272
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,579
This has been a joke in the other two tribes.

273
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,540
Now we need a battle to prove ourselves.

274
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,338
This time, I will ask for a fight to Uncle Khan.

275
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,260
I will successively attack Mobei for Uncle Khan.

276
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,818
Sher, do you remember what I told you when you were young?

277
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,300
Lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans.

278
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:32,098
The most important thing for you is to save power.

279
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,419
As long as you have strength, and hold up to the last second,

280
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,659
you will have a chance to win.

281
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,180
Uncle Khan sent me out immediately this time,

282
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:42,379
to go on an expedition at the border.

283
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,738
As soon as I come back, I have to prepare for the move of the court.

284
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:46,099
And I have to clear up the desert.

285
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,698
These are all too fast!

286
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,339
It's not like the style of Uncle Khan.

287
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,859
Let me show you something.

288
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:09,339
The Great Seal!

289
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,420
Khan is badly ill,

290
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:15,819
he has asked me to keep this.

291
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:21,979
From now on, the whole Khan's Tent will be under my control.

292
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,860
What?

293
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:31,059
You think your mother isn't competent to do it?

294
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,860
No.

295
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,019
Just...

296
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,299
Sher.

297
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,180
You should feel happy for me.

298
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,539
From now on, I don't need to endure the humiliation.

299
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,419
You can see me whenever you want.

300
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,698
You can go anywhere you want.

301
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:46,939
Isn't it great?

302
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,380
Your Uncle Khan is seriously ill,

303
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:57,739
so he can't be at labor anymore.

304
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,380
From now on,

305
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,540
maybe this Great Seal,

306
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,499
the whole Khan's tent,

307
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,420
and this grassland would all be controlled by you.

308
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,060
You have to be prepared.

309
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,300
Okay, go back to have a rest.

310
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,380
Don't think too much.

311
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:03,859
Are you ready?

312
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,180
Tegin Sun, yes we are!

313
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,259
Tonight would be a hard time for Eagle Division,

314
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,458
we will cooperate well with you.

315
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,539
I will lead Eagle Division to attack from the north,

316
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,738
and Bear Division from the south.

317
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,979
We will attack from both sides.

318
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:21,499
Wonderful.

319
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,940
Great!

320
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:27,779
Eagle Division!

321
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,578
Yes!

322
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:29,738
Follow me!

323
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:30,539
Yes!

324
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,579
Will Tu Kashe fall into the trap?

325
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,899
Will we succeed?

326
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,700
No worries.

327
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,219
Everything is under control.

328
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:07,219
Today is coming to an end.

329
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,500
Do you think you can be alive tomorrow?

330
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,260
The sunset is so beautiful.

331
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,140
Don't wet my blanket please, captain.

332
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,499
Report!

333
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,618
Captain! The man from Eagle Division is here.

334
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,379
Bring him in.

335
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,180
Yes!

336
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,899
Mimi?

337
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,700
Changge.

338
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:30,499
Mimi.

339
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,019
Why is it you?

340
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,338
Long story.

341
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:34,899
I just saw Tegin Sun.

342
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,099
He asked you to pass some word to two kings.

343
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,140
Go ahead, what is it?

344
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,140
Help Eagle Division fake death.

345
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,540
He would like to give a chance of success to the desert tonight.

346
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:51,738
What are you talking about?

347
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:53,299
Ask Yinan here.

348
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,619
Or would I do it myself?

349
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,698
Tegin.

350
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:00,939
When shall we start?

351
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:03,459
Just wait.

352
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:09,979
The more they are consumed, the easier for us to clear them up.

353
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,218
Bear Division!

354
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:28,019
Yes!

355
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:30,818
Follow me!

356
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:31,818
Go!

357
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:32,859
Go!

358
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,280
Stop.

359
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:41,260
Where is Eagle Division?

360
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,540
Where is Eagle Division?

361
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,059
Ambush!

362
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,099
We are trapped!

363
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,818
Why are they the armies of Monan and Mobei?

364
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:55,300
So bad, we are trapped!

365
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:58,180
Retreat!

366
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,460
Retreat!

367
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:01,939
Report!

368
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:06,139
Come on in!

369
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,299
How is it?

370
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,059
Ashile Bear Division has already been trapped.

371
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,338
Two kings from Monan and Mobei led the armies to attack from both sides,

372
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,179
Bear Division has been defeated.

373
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,059
What about Eagle Division?

374
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,299
Eagle Division has faked to fight on the battlefield according to the plan,

375
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,740
they have all retreated, with no one got injured.

376
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,020
They could draw such an elaborate layout in just three to four hours,

377
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,978
the desert is so talented!

378
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,939
This is a kind of strategy in the Central Plains.

379
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,539
Pusa and Yinan have no idea about it.

380
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,979
Her idea again?

381
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,779
So scary!

382
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,618
Sun!

383
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,578
Don't you need to think twice of it?

384
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,618
This woman is so awful.

385
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:56,379
I'm afraid that you would be cheated by her.

386
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,180
Boring...

387
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,259
Tegin, urgency!

388
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,738
Tu Kashe was covered by soldiers of Bear Division,

389
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:03,859
he rushed out of the circle.

390
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,819
He can't go.

391
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:34,859
Who is it?

392
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:52,759
Sun!

393
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
What do you mean?

394
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,838
Are you going to betray Great Khan?

395
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,120
I just want to live.

396
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,879
I also hope Eagle Division can survive too.

397
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,839
Do you deserve it?

398
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,198
You are just a low-priced nobody!

399
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,838
You are just a slave.

400
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,279
If it was not Great Khan, could you have lived till today?

401
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,719
I would never forget his grace of bringing me up.

402
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,760
But in the future,

403
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,379
I will return to him in my way.

404
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,180
Bah!

405
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,999
Just in this way?

406
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,879
You Eagle Division are all bad men!

407
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
And you, Mu Jin!

408
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,119
You are shameless!

409
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,879
You guys won't live till tomorrow!

410
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,119
I will report everything to Great Khan.

411
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,119
You have no chance to live till tomorrow!

412
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,000
Don't talk big.

413
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,400
It doesn't matter.

414
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,520
Tu Kashe, you can't leave tonight.

415
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:32,078
His Highness asked me to report to you that we succeeded.

416
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,799
Just wait for Eagle Division coming back.

417
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:35,719
Thanks.

418
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,079
Since our plan has succeeded,

419
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,558
it's time for me to go back.

420
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,919
Back to where?

421
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,679
Eagle Division or Khan's tent?

422
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,519
Mimi.

423
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:05,939
Actually, I wanted to ask you why you knew

424
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,100
that Bear Division was going to attack Eagle Division.

425
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,799
You are a kind girl.

426
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,600
Or you wouldn't have said that.

427
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,639
If you have any problem, you can tell me.

428
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,360
We can find ways together to solve it.

429
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,959
I told you.

430
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,438
I have a brother.

431
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:30,280
Yes, you told me that it was Ashile Tribe who killed your families.

432
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:32,400
Your brother is dead.

433
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,120
He is alive?

434
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,120
You mean... he is at Khan's tent now?

435
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,520
No, in Dingxiang.

436
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,799
It's Yi Cheng...

437
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:50,400
She threatened me by my brother's life.

438
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,959
And forced me to stay in Eagle Division.

439
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,079
Changge.

440
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,839
I had no choice.

441
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,759
I prefer to die.

442
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,918
Mimi.

443
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,039
You never harmed Eagle Division, but helped it.

444
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,279
Now it no longer exists, you are free too.

445
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,558
How could I be free?

446
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,038
If my brother is still alive, he must be waiting for me to save him.

447
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,198
Mimi.

448
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:21,599
We will discuss together about your brother when they come back.

449
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Just remember,

450
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,798
Eagle Division are annihilated, you are dead too.

451
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,240
Nothing could threaten you now.

452
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,400
Forget all the things in the past.

453
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,079
From now on,

454
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,360
let's start a new life.

455
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,839
A new life...

456
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,760
Can I start a new life?

457
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,600
Mimi in the past has been dead,

458
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,919
you will be a brand new Mimi in the future.

459
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,679
You can do anything you want freely.

460
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,558
Wait for them to be back,

461
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,120
and we will find a way together to help your brother out.

462
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,599
Sun.

463
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:14,999
Wait.

464
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,280
Hand me your helmet.

465
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,318
Eagle and Bear Division are both annihilated here.

466
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,958
I need a physical evidence.

467
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:24,759
Mu Jin,

468
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,318
it's not necessary.

469
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,479
Sun.

470
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,919
Someone has to go back to report.

471
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,678
We have never been separated from each other.

472
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,838
Only if I go back alone, and tell them you are dead,

473
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,039
can they believe it.

474
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,439
You have to be safe.

475
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,359
No worries.

476
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,078
Even the plague didn't take my life, I can't be dead easily.

477
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,039
In this way,

478
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,880
you can't see Mimi for long time.

479
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,639
It's okay.

480
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,559
I also have some selfish motives this time to go back.

481
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
Take care.

482
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,019
Go!

483
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,820
Go!

484
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,680
Mimi!

485
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:46,959
Where are you going?

486
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,200
You see?

487
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,639
When I go back,

488
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,399
I will cheat those in Khan's tent.

489
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,838
You can't go!

490
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,559
They won't let you go this time!

491
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:01,479
Mimi.

492
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:03,718
Believe me.

493
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,839
I will come back.

494
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,520
I promised you that I would find a way to help your brother out.

495
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,799
But Dingxiang is strictly guarded,

496
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,799
you are alone.

497
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,120
How could you do that?

498
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,639
Take me with you, okay?

499
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,839
Mimi.

500
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,440
I am a man.

501
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,240
A man should do his job.

502
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:41,879
You promise me,

503
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,160
be safe.

504
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,760
And wait for me.

505
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,099
♫ Those years ♫

506
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,749
♫ we made our wish together ♫

507
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,099
♫ Forget it.  Did you forget it? ♫

508
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,625
♫ Only I was left ♫

509
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,880
You are my man,

510
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,319
you have to be responsible for me.

511
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,199
So you have to be alive and come back!

512
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,499
♫ And condense to sand ♫

513
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,149
♫ Your shadow cannot be left ♫

514
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,219
♫ I hope to continue our destiny in our next life ♫

515
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,549
♫ Even if it's just a handful of sand ♫

516
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,300
♫ We have a moment for us ♫

517
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:40,074
♫ For the rest of the road ♫

518
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:43,180
♫ Let's go down together with a smile ♫

519
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,999
♫ You drop down in my eyes ♫

520
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,038
♫ and condense to sand ♫

521
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,520
After getting back, I will never leave you again!

522
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,224
♫ I hope to continue our destiny in our next life ♫

523
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,025
Go!

524
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,838
♫ Even if it's just a handful of sand ♫

525
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,600
I will wait for you coming back!

526
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,740
♫ We have a moment for us ♫

527
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,125
♫ A moment for us ♫

528
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:55,520
Everything comes to an end.

529
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,880
I'm here to take you back.

530
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,759
I've been worried last night.

531
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,798
I was afraid if the plan would be changed.

532
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,198
I was afraid if Tu Kashe would find your trick.

533
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,759
I was afraid if you would be in danger.

534
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:10,799
But, thanks, Sun.

535
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,198
You are back safely with a great victory.

536
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,999
I'm back.

537
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,479
Later,

538
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,400
Eagle Division would never exist.

539
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,880
Neither does the Tegin of Eagle Division.

540
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Do you regret?

541
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,519
This is the best result.

542
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,159
Eagle Division would never be disturbed by those interests or disputes,

543
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,279
nor would it be manipulated by others as a slayer.

544
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,799
Although Eagle Division doesn't exist now, you can't repudiate a debt.

545
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,120
What debt?

546
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,758
When you recommended yourself as my military counselor,

547
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:50,600
you promised me three things.

548
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:54,039
Are you going to deny it?

549
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,839
I thought that you had forgotten it.

550
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,599
I'm Li Changge.

551
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,160
I never break my promises.

552
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,640
Since you have put it forward, you already have your idea, go ahead.

553
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,758
I am not sure yet.

554
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:09,879
But the first, I have thought of it for a while.

555
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:16,079
Could you be more girlish in the future?

556
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,960
You mean...

557
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,038
I lack femininity?

558
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,038
No, no.

559
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,239
How could it be? I...

560
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:27,960
I am worried about you.

561
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,119
I am worried that you always fight regardless of your own life,

562
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,278
and plan it effortlessly.

563
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:34,079
Little counsellor,

564
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:35,999
give me a chance,

565
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,200
and let me be your man.

566
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,360
I will protect you in the future.

567
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:45,640
But I know you are like a wild horse.

568
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,399
You have your own world.

569
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,359
I respect you.

570
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,478
I would never stop you from anything you want to do.

571
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,440
But no matter in what situation,

572
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,920
you can't risk your life,

573
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,359
nor can you leave without telling me.

574
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,120
No matter what happens, we will face it together.

575
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,079
No matter if it's wind or storm, or swords or arrows,

576
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,799
Me, Ashile Sun would fend against it.

577
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:08,680
Clear?

578
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:11,759
This...

579
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
I'll go and see.

580
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:26,599
Sun!

581
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,400
Sun!

582
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,838
Sun!

583
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,038
Sun!

584
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,639
Sun! Don't scare me!

585
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,879
Sun!

586
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,119
Help!

587
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,160
Please! Help!

588
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,159
Sun!

589
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,279
Sun!

590
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,440
Who are you?

591
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,400
Eagle Division and Bear Division are completely annihilated.

592
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,039
Why are they dismantling tents?

593
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,079
Are they going to remove?

594
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:14,839
What happened?

595
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,399
Two main forces!

596
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,960
How could they be annihilated?

597
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,679
Ashile Sun! What is he planning?

598
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,519
What can a dead man plan?

599
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,519
Sun is dead,

600
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:34,920
I have no reason to live.

601
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,720
You can kill me whenever you want.

602
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,880
Sun is the god of war on grasslands.

603
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:49,640
No one can kill him!

604
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,880
What can valiancy do?

605
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,120
He can't escape from a back stab!

606
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,759
So many people here want him to die!

607
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,640
Even so,

608
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,200
Sun asked me to go back with his last breath,

609
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:08,999
he asked me to notice Khan that the desert tribes have united.

610
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:12,039
Ashile Tribe must pay attention to this.

611
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:18,559
The desert...

612
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,440
Good!

613
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:26,400
I will make them pay for Ashile Sun's death!

614
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,599
Khatun.

615
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,839
Stand up.

616
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,360
What a pity for what happened on Eagle and Bear Division!

617
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,278
I'm afraid if Khan can't accept his son's death,

618
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:59,239
his situation would become worse.

619
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,798
So after he is better, I will tell him about it.

620
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:05,279
Great Khan is ill?

621
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,360
For a few days.

622
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,998
Now he even can't talk.

623
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:13,999
What disease?

624
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,318
I don't know what he is suffering from.

625
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:19,479
Grand Witches are helping him effortlessly.

626
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:20,999
What a pity!

627
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,360
I haven't told Tegin Sun about it,

628
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,799
they have been separated in two worlds.

629
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,359
By the way,

630
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:40,279
you just said that there's a secret in Tegin Sun's death?

631
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,720
Don't be afraid.

632
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:46,359
If there's really a secret in it,

633
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,400
Great Khan will be on Tegin Sun and Eagle Division's side.

634
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,079
Khatun.

635
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,680
There is a traitor in Eagle Division.

636
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,440
All the people are dead because of her.

637
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,599
I am to blame.

638
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,159
I was obsessed with her.

639
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,238
I shouldn't have taken her to the battlefield.

640
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,759
She attacked Sun in his back.

641
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,720
Who is she?

642
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,440
I have no idea.

643
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,999
When I decided to ask her, she killed herself with her sword.

644
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:20,759
Till now, no one knows who sent her there.

645
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,559
I'll tell this to the women and children of Eagle Division.

646
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,999
Please pass this on to Great Khan.

647
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,440
The desert tribes rebelled,

648
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,759
Khan sent Eagle and Bear Division to encircle and suppress them.

649
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:14,479
But unfortunately, they fell into an ambush.

650
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:18,720
What a pity!

651
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,999
Isn't it familiar to you, Khan?

652
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:30,920
Would you want to look at it carefully?

653
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:42,319
It seems that you are not seriously ill.

654
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,239
You still can see that it's Ashile Sun's helmet.

655
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,039
I've been thinking about him day and night.

656
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,559
Now he can stay beside you now.

00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:43,340
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

677
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,749
♫ There's always a moment ♫

678
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:57,379
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

679
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,989
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

680
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:07,299
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

681
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,859
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

682
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,229
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

683
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:16,709
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

684
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,579
♫ layer after layer. ♫

685
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,579
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

686
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:27,990
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

687
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,160
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

688
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:50,290
