The Long Ballad

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Episode 37

22
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:44,719
I came to Mobei to find gromwell.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,639
Because the plague has hit Eagle Division.

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,319
But meanwhile, Khan's Tent has blocked all the access to gromwell.

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,159
What does this mean?

26
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,518
It means that Khan's Tent has abandoned Eagle Division.

27
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,520
What we should do now is to form an alliance.

28
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,960
Whether Eagle Division'll live or die

29
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,799
is none of our business.

30
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,198
The man saw me, apparently.

31
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:06,118
He also recognized me.

32
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,439
But why did he seem so calm?

33
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,878
That was because he saw the leaders of Monan and Mobei

34
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,918
with the military counsellor of Eagle Division.

35
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,239
He must've seen that as a sign of

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,679
political collusion beween you and Eagle Division.

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,960
If we let him go back, I'm afraid you'll be facing your doom.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
No.

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,559
As long as we tie you up

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,638
and let the messenger hand you over to Khan's Tent,

41
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,119
we'll be able to prove our innocence.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,518
Fine.

43
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,599
You can tie me up.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,360
Together with your mother and your daughter.

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,158
Father.

46
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:38,679
What are you going to do?

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,479
I'm gonna kill him.

48
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,280
Stop there.

49
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,159
What? You want to stop me?

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,639
This is Mobei.

51
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:51,040
You, King of Monan, are in no place to give orders here.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Yes.

53
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:01,799
Go!

54
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:04,159
Get out of the way!

55
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,959
Stop!

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,879
Stop! Stop!

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,718
King, we've brought back his body.

58
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,238
Get rid of it.

59
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,119
I don't want to see him ever again.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,920
Yes.

61
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:28,639
You've killed the messenger.

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,659
You can't hush a thing like this up.

63
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,258
That's all because of you.

64
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,259
Me?

65
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,898
You think they wouldn't conscript your people if I were not here?

66
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:40,259
That they wouldn't take Zhenzhu and your mother as hostage?

67
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,819
That Khan's Tent would show you mercy?

68
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,420
It's not just you.

69
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,059
Eagle Division has always been loyal to Khan's Tent,

70
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,178
risking their lives.

71
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:52,098
And look where we end up.

72
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,378
Enough.

73
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:54,738
We're dying anyway.

74
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:55,819
Tujia, let's go home.

75
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,338
Father! Father!

76
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,019
But it's not necessarily a dead end.

77
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,339
Didn't I just say that we could form an alliance?

78
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:04,618
That's easy for you to say.

79
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,139
You haven't even tried. Why are you so certain that we'll fail?

80
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,818
Please let my people go.

81
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,378
As long as Eagle Division has gromwell and be safe,

82
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,019
I'll persuade Ashile Sun

83
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,099
to form an alliance between you and Eagle Division.

84
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,739
What if you're just lying to us?

85
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,778
Then I'll stay here and tell you how to defend against Khan's Tent.

86
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:28,459
King, please let my people leave with gromwell.

87
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,859
Changge offered to be held hostage.

88
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,699
She can't come out.

89
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,100
So I'm here to see you off instead.

90
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,978
The gromwell you want has been loaded.

91
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:42,778
She wants you to lead the convoy

92
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,218
and carry gromwell back to Eagle Division.

93
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:45,019
Me?

94
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,739
I can't.

95
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,098
Why can't you?

96
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,258
She thinks you can.

97
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,700
Don't you believe in yourself?

98
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,700
Senior Qin will help you.

99
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,299
But Changge offered to be held hostage here.

100
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,978
It worries me.

101
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,739
She only did so to assure the King of Mobei.

102
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,778
Khan's Tent has issued the order of forced conscription in Monan and Mobei.

103
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,538
They also want to take us as hostages.

104
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,779
They've pushed us too far.

105
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,818
Father and King of Mobei intend to lead a revolt.

106
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:12,899
The top priority now

107
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,378
is to persuade Eagle Division into forming an alliance

108
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,498
against Khan's Tent.

109
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,699
That's the only way to keep Changge safe.

110
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,620
So you must take the message back immediately.

111
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,139
Ms. Mi, since Young Master has got this plan,

112
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,499
we need to go back as soon as possible.

113
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,099
Let's set off now.

114
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,020
Kid, goodbye then.

115
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,380
Let's go.

116
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,459
Don't worry.

117
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,098
I'm always as good as my word.

118
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,580
They'll leave here unchallenged.

119
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,540
Now you can tell us how to defend against Ashile Tribe.

120
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,019
No more tolerance nor infighting.

121
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,139
Monan and Mobei are the biggest tribes over the whole area.

122
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,299
As long as you unite together,

123
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,019
you won't have to fear Ashile Tribe anymore.

124
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,180
You want me to work with him?

125
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,900
Not a chance.

126
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,619
This is not a time for rash actions.

127
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,938
If you have zero intention of forming an alliance,

128
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,979
you wouldn't have dashed out to get that messenger.

129
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,099
What if Mobei is willing to give back your ancestral homeland?

130
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,339
I didn't say that.

131
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,179
It's not too late for you to say so.

132
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,459
Only if you dismiss the old grievance

133
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,140
will you fight side by side in the future.

134
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,850
Have you ever thought about

135
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,169
the consequences of failure?

136
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,329
The game is never really set.

137
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,489
I regret it now.

138
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,970
At least Monan would survive if we just give in.

139
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,410
Zhenzhu once told me that her father is the bravest men in the world.

140
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,158
My father is the invincible, undefeatble God of War.

141
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,759
He would never fear Ashile Tribe.

142
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,480
He'll lead the bravest warriors in Monan and conquer Khan's Tent.

143
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Am I right, father?

144
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,399
If you say so.

145
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,079
With all that going on, when you can't even protect your own families,

146
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,879
are you really going to keep giving in?

147
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,759
Tolerance is no way to avoid conflicts.

148
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,519
The war is threatening.

149
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,400
Are you really going to turn a blind eye to it?

150
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,159
I'll return your ancestral homeland to you.

151
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,479
Monan has an army of 20000.

152
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,678
How about you?

153
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,799
Less than 30000.

154
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
More than that.

155
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,480
We need to gain more allies.

156
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,799
If the whole desert area unite together,

157
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,520
we'll be having an army of more than 50000.

158
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,278
Princess.

159
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,319
What happened?

160
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,599
Mobei and Monan rose up against us.

161
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
Adong was killed.

162
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,998
The ones we sent to keep an eye on Li Changge

163
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:34,319
has sent the message back that Eagle Division has got gromwell.

164
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,398
Mobei sent a special convoy for it.

165
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,518
They're heading back to Eagle Division now.

166
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,359
Li Changge persuaded Mobei to unite with Monan.

167
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,278
How surprising.

168
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,279
I guess Eagle Division will also rebel against us.

169
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,240
I should've killed her at that time.

170
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,360
Oh,

171
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,838
when will Sher and Tu Kashe be back?

172
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,000
I followed your order.

173
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,838
I sent a secret order in Great Khan's name

174
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,679
to Bear Division and Wolf Division and deployed them along the border.

175
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,880
They should've been back by now.

176
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
Summon Bear Division to Khan's Tent now.

177
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:07,479
As for Sher, he doesn't have to know about it now.

178
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,280
Yes.

179
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,079
Well, that Mimi Guli might come in handy now.

180
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,159
Where are you going at this hour, Princess?

181
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm still a little worried.

182
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,319
Before Sher and Tu Kashe come back,

183
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,079
I want to make sure that Yanli can't talk.

184
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,639
Water.

185
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,680
Help.

186
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,840
Water.

187
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Why are you here?

188
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,440
Where's Jinse?

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,839
I haven't seen her for ages.

190
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,040
I'm afraid you can't see her ever again.

191
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,040
What happened to her?

192
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,800
She's dead.

193
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,800
You killed her.

194
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I'll be the only one

195
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,279
who's there for you.

196
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,560
What are you trying to do?

197
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,800
You once said that

198
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,120
you'll get justice for me and Sui Family.

199
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,120
Does that still count?

200
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,398
Because of your promise, I took the risk

201
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,639
and removed the hidden peril for you.

202
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,880
Or, how did you think you came into power?

203
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:58,519
That... That's all because you took the liberty.

204
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,719
It was you who killed my brother.

205
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,319
It had nothing to do with me.

206
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,880
No one really cares about the truth.

207
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,750
What matters is

208
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,469
it is you, Ashile Chuobi,

209
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,908
who is on the throne now.

210
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:21,070
You're trying to...

211
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,789
Now that you're seriously ill,

212
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,950
I'll do what you ought to do

213
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,228
on your behalf.

214
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,510
You want to kill me.

215
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,029
Like what you did to my brother.

216
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,669
Ashile Tribe won't... won't let you get away.

217
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,950
That's none of your concern.

218
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:53,849
Don't worry. I know what to do with Eagle Division and Bear Division.

219
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,450
What... What about Wolf Division?

220
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:00,770
You want to support Sher?

221
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,729
He... he's just a callow youth.

222
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:10,729
Ashile Tribe won't obey him.

223
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,169
And that's why

224
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,129
I won't kill you now.

225
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:16,890
I'm gonna keep you alive

226
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,530
so that you'll call the shots for me.

227
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:23,730
I... I will tell Sher.

228
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:32,410
I'll let him know that his mother is such a monster.

229
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,730
I suggest that you stop struggling.

230
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,369
The more you intake,

231
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:42,569
the more severe your poisoning will get.

232
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,210
It must be so hard for you

233
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,090
to be controlled by others

234
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,770
and not at liberty.

235
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:16,730
Help...

236
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:21,609
Don't say things that you shouldn't have.

237
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:24,410
From now on,

238
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,530
I'll be your mouth.

239
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,449
What do we do now?

240
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,008
I can't force the medicine down his throat.

241
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:51,169
If we can't bring down his fever,

242
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,169
I'm afraid he wouldn't be able to survive tonight.

243
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:58,290
And even if we save him from death, he might lose his minds.

244
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,889
So he still has a chance of surviving

245
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,168
as long as we can bring down his fever tonight, right?

246
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,169
What are you going to do?

247
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:23,650
Mu Jin! Mu Jin!

248
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:28,609
Mu Jin.

249
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,689
Finally, you're awake.

250
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:33,929
Where am I?

251
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,410
I feel so cold. So cold.

252
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:39,248
Mu Jin, we can't bring down your fever.

253
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:40,769
So I must cool you down now.

254
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,729
Just hang on.

255
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,168
Changge will be here soon.

256
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:44,409
Together with Mimi.

257
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,650
Mimi will lead the convoy back here with gromwell.

258
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,290
Mimi,

259
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:51,650
I like her so much.

260
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:53,489
Sun,

261
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:55,129
promise me

262
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,290
that you'll take care of her.

263
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,688
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:02,688
Stay alive.

265
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:03,368
Take care of her yourself.

266
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,568
You hear me?

267
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:05,450
You hear me?

268
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:12,488
Do you remember that once when we were kids, we went hunting

269
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:13,850
and got caught in a snowstorm?

270
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,769
We were so cold and thirsty.

271
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,609
We almost died in that snowy cave.

272
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,530
It was you who told me to hang in there.

273
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,450
You said someone would come rescue us.

274
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:27,248
In the end, someone did came.

275
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,049
Yes.

276
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,568
I didn't lie to you at that time.

277
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:32,729
And I won't this time, okay?

278
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,368
I'm sure you can survive this.

279
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,210
Listen to me,

280
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,089
just hang in there.

281
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,929
Don't fall asleep.

282
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,450
I lost my mother and father when I was little.

283
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,009
I was brought up in the slave camp.

284
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,890
If you hadn't saved me,

285
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,928
I'm afraid I might've been dead a long time ago.

286
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,209
Why are you saying these things?

287
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,249
If it wasn't for you, I must've died 1000 times.

288
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,489
Mu Jin, come on,

289
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:01,489
sober up. Don't fall asleep.

290
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:02,729
Mu Jin!

291
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,568
Sober up!

292
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:04,769
Mu Jin!

293
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,649
Mu Jin!

294
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,850
Don't you fall asleep, Mu Jin!

295
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,009
I know perfectly well

296
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:16,809
that I can't survive this time.

297
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:19,489
Mu Jin!

298
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,210
Mu Jin!

299
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,729
Mu Jin! Come on!

300
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,729
Mu Jin!

301
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,488
Mu Jin!

302
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:27,569
Don't sleep, Mu Jin!

303
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,250
Go!

304
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,570
Go!

305
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:39,409
Go!

306
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,008
Go!

307
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:40,809
Go!

308
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,770
Stop!

309
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:45,889
If we continue on our journey,

310
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,169
our horses would die of tiredness.

311
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,369
Let's take a rest here for two hours

312
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,488
and grab a bite.

313
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,688
Well, I'll go gather some wood and make a fire.

314
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:01,489
Okay.

315
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,490
Destroy the gromwell and Buzhen can live.

316
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:52,648
Hand me the water.

317
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:53,610
Here, take it.

318
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:15,610
On guard.

319
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:19,649
Wolves.

320
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:29,969
Xu Feng, Shiba, you two protect Ms. Mi and the gromwell.

321
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,768
You guys leave first.

322
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:31,808
- Yes.
 - Yes.

323
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,489
The rest of us, cover for them with me.

324
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,249
Senior Qin, Yes!

325
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,050
Watch out!

326
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,810
Come on.

327
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,530
Go!

328
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:04,689
Shiba!

329
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,050
Stop!

330
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:16,369
Here you are.

331
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,129
I... I...

332
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,849
Young Master believes in you.

333
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,808
So do I.

334
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,009
- But I can't...
 - You can!

335
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,129
I'll hold the pursuers with Shiba.

336
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,089
Mu Jin is waiting for you.

337
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,890
Go now!

338
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:27,489
Go!

339
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,650
Go!

340
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,910
Are you okay?

341
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,350
Let's go.

342
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,350
Stop!

343
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,590
Destroy the gromwell and Buzhen can live.

344
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,360
I promise

345
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,760
I'll take gromwell back.

346
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,680
Mimi,

347
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,439
I like you.

348
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,440
No.

349
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,639
I can't lose Mu Jin.

350
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,440
No!

351
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:51,879
Go!

352
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,160
You're awake.

353
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,198
Don't move.

354
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,319
You lost much blood.

355
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,198
Help me up.

356
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,799
Slowly. Watch out.

357
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,679
I had a hard job getting you all wrapped up.

358
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,959
Don't rip it open.

359
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,718
I didn't mean to touch you.

360
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,760
But I couldn't leave you by the road and watch by.

361
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,119
I know you wouldn't want to,

362
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,560
but just think of me as a cushion and lean on me for a while.

363
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,198
Senior Qin is on his way to chase after Mimi.

364
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:09,039
They should be arriving at Eagle Division now.

365
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,039
I made a straw matress for you.

366
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,959
It'll be more comfortable when you're riding horse later.

367
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,160
Then we should set out now.

368
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,240
Let me put it on first.

369
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,879
Did you hurt your legs?

370
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,680
No.

371
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,319
They're just numb.

372
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,079
Sun,

373
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:30,039
Taoist Sun has done all he can.

374
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,759
Don't make things difficult for him.

375
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,560
Shut up.

376
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,680
Don't start with that negative talk.

377
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,760
Sun,

378
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,559
help me up.

379
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,480
I want to see the sunrise one more time.

380
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:00,799
Sun,

381
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,559
there's something I want to tell you.

382
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,879
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to say it later.

383
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,799
You're my only friend

384
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,719
my whole life.

385
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,799
Don't sacrifice yourself for nothing.

386
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,679
For all these years,

387
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,919
you've been repaying Great Khan's kindness.

388
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,839
But it's all over now.

389
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:32,640
I'm sorry that I've failed you, bro.

390
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:40,120
But from now on, you're all they got for Eagle Division.

391
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,039
There is just one more thing.

392
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,880
I want you to take care of Mimi Guli.

393
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,039
She really had a hard time.

394
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,199
If you die, I won't take care of her.

395
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,120
You will.

396
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:14,120
You're just being stubborn.

397
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,719
You're firm in your speech and soft in your heart.

398
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,000
I know you so well.

399
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,119
Go!

400
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,599
Go!

401
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Go!

402
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,560
Go!

403
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,320
Mu Jin...

404
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:53,999
Go!

405
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,560
Go!

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,800
Taoist.

407
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,199
Absence seizure leads to death.

408
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,559
Look at him.

409
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,919
Do you think he still has consciousness?

410
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:26,958
But you said gromwell would save him.

411
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,000
And where is it?

412
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,074
♫ We drifted apart ♫

413
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:49,399
♫ The sand fell through the fingers ♫

414
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,839
Mu Jin, I didn't promise you anything.

415
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,320
You hear me?

416
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,958
You're supposed to take care of her yourself!

417
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,759
You hear me?

418
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,949
Mu Jin!

419
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,799
♫ Those were the days ♫

420
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,438
♫ we spent together ♫

421
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,359
We're back!

422
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,639
We've got gromwell back!

423
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,040
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

424
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,749
♫  I was left behind ♫

425
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,349
♫ I'll move on with smile ♫

426
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,174
♫ along the rest of the way ♫

427
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:28,279
♫ My tears turned into sand ♫

428
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,080
Mu Jin!

429
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,960
Mu Jin.

430
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,460
Don't scare me.

431
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,038
♫ I miss you so bad ♫

432
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,038
Wake up, Mu Jin.

433
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,539
Don't scare me like that.

434
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,038
♫ I wonder ♫

435
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,838
You're an asshole!

436
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,479
You promised you'd wait till I get back!

437
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,479
Wake up! Wake up!

438
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,639
Stop crying.

439
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,999
He still has one breath left.

440
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,559
Go make medicine for him now!

441
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,639
Come on!

442
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,599
Get out of the way!

443
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,260
♫ I'm always haunted ♫

444
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,999
♫ by the memories we had ♫

445
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,474
♫ The journey we shared ♫

446
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:06,299
♫ I can't ask for more than that ♫

447
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,174
♫ I turned away ♫

448
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:13,050
♫ not daring to look back ♫

449
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,099
♫ Forget it. Have you forgotten ♫

450
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,950
♫ How can I ever forget? ♫

451
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,174
♫ I remember your silhouette ♫

452
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:29,874
♫ See you again in my next life ♫

453
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,549
♫ Even if a handful of sand is all I have ♫

454
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:38,850
♫ I'd be able to ♫

455
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,850
♫ share a moment with you ♫

456
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,199
You're so ill and weak.

457
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,280
Be a lamb and take your medicine.

458
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:27,160
Don't force yourself to speak.

459
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,919
By the way, Khan,

460
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,279
I've got a good news for you.

461
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,959
We'll move our capital.

462
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,839
I've given the order on your behalf.

463
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,240
Lei Meng begs an audience with Great Khan.

464
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,319
Come on in.

465
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:02,519
Khatun.

466
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Don't mind him.

467
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Just say it.

468
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,880
They brought back gromwell.

470
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,359
Then I guess we can't count on Mimi Guli.

471
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,160
Then shall we kill Buzhen?

472
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,400
The best timing to kill someone

473
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,120
is something you need to think about.

474
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,480
Khan, don't worry.

475
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,400
I won't kill you now.

476
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,919
To deal with Eagle Division, we can't just wager on Mimi Guli alone.

477
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,958
I will think of something else.

478
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,079
Have you decided on the troop sent to Mobei?

479
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,399
Bear Division has just arrived here.

480
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Tu Kashe is waiting outside Khan's Tent right now.

481
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,719
Khan,

482
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
would you like to meet Tu Kashe?

483
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,120
Khan, Khatun, this is Tu Khashe.

484
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:26,719
Tegin Tu Kashe, you can stand up.

485
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,320
Thank you, Khatun.

486
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,159
This is the edict written by Great Khan himself.

487
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,519
I'm just a woman.

488
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,639
I'm in no place to read that.

489
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,880
Take a look yourself.

490
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,120
Yes, Khatun.

491
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:56,759
Khan,

492
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,359
I've always been waiting for a historic victory.

493
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,958
This time, I'll put down the rebellion in Mobei.

494
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,679
I won't let you down, Khan.

495
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,640
Khan,

496
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,759
you can count on me.

497
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,439
Tegin Tu Kashe will go all out to fulfill this task.

498
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,799
Tegin Tu Kashe,

499
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,520
it's time for Khan to take medicine.

500
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,839
Then if you'll excuse me.

501
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,760
Khan, take care.

502
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,559
You want to seek help?

503
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,718
Tegin Tu Kashe can't wait to fight the war

504
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,599
so that he could take credit for Bear Division.

505
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,199
He's in no mood

506
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,640
to read your facial expressions.

507
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,719
He's not Ashile Sun.

508
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,000
You miss your son?

509
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,120
What a pity.

510
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,760
You might not be able to see him ever agin.

511
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,400
Senior Qin, where's Changge?

512
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,038
And why are Xu Feng and Shiba not here, either?

513
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,958
We were under attack on our way here.

514
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:38,318
Shiba was wounded.

515
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,280
She and Xu Feng will be arriving here soon.

516
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,838
As for Young Master...

517
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,760
What happened to her?

518
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,280
Young Master offered to be held hostage

519
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,399
so that we could take gromwell back successfully.

520
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,038
She stayed in Mobei.

521
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,000
Why?

522
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,918
Khan's Tent delivered conscription notices in Mobei and Monan.

523
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,400
They also wanted to hold the two kings' mother and daughter in custody.

524
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,999
Instead of giving in to oppression, it's better to form an alliance.

525
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,519
Young Master promised King of Mobei

526
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,999
that she'd persuade you into forming this joint force.

527
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,519
She offered to be held hostage.

528
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,200
That was why King of Mobei would let us go.

529
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:16,960
I see.

530
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,520
Well...

531
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,838
I understand your concerns about fighting against Khan.

532
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,160
You can discuss it with Young Master when you see her.

533
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,680
Come on.

534
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,519
Does it still hurt? Your hand?

535
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,679
Does it taste good?

536
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,480
Yeah.

537
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,039
I remember every word you said that day before you left.

538
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,760
Forget about it.

539
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,798
No way.

540
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:02,319
A promise is a promise.

541
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,960
You can't take it back.

542
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,160
Sun.

543
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,280
I'll go to decoct the herb soup for you.

544
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,160
Alright.

545
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,799
You can come in now.

546
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,079
I suppose you were in a haste when you put the bandage on.

547
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,879
It did stop the bleeding.

548
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,478
But still, it was rouly done.

549
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:53,719
I must've hurt you a bit when I changed your dressing, right?

550
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,719
No. Thank you.

551
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,959
You're welcome.

552
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,998
If you need any help, feel free to tell me.

553
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,119
No need to be courteous.

554
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,399
We Eagle Division owe a lot to you.

555
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,399
Thank you, Auntie.

556
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,399
Have some rest.

557
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,519
I have some errands to run.

558
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,960
Okay.

559
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:09,920
- Thank you.
 - You're welcome.

560
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,520
Does it still hurt?

561
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:26,999
Much better now.

562
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,680
Well, then.

563
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,319
Come here.

564
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:37,279
Come on.

565
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:40,119
Sit.

566
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,920
Why don't you wrap it up?

567
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,040
I haven't had time to do so.

568
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,359
Let me help you.

569
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:54,839
Does it hurt?

570
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,000
No.

571
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,000
I'll be gentle.

572
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:46,639
Alright.

573
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,400
I've applied medicine for you.

574
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,278
But... you haven't even had my wound dressed.

575
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:56,318
Well...

576
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:57,799
Just... Just do it yourself.

577
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,199
We've just caught our breath for a while.

578
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,478
And now they want us to march against the desert tribes.

579
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:17,400
What do you think?

580
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,200
Changge is in Mobei now.

581
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:21,279
If I don't go there,

582
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,519
someone else will.

583
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,359
"Bear Division will fight with us", they say.

584
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,319
As I see it,

585
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,478
they're only sending Bear Division to spy on you.

586
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:35,279
I guess we have to play it by ear now.

587
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,359
Mu Jin,

588
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,159
you've just recovered from the plague.

589
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,320
You'd better not go to Mobei.

590
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,559
Come on, brotherhood means a lot to me.

591
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,960
I'll always be by your side, my friend.

592
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,360
Come to think of it,

593
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,159
Changge's proposal is not entirely infeasible.

594
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,960
What advice?

595
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:01,720
Khan's Tent is no longer what it used to be.

596
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
Yeah, you should've thought of some way out.

597
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,519
Great Khan was indeed kind to you.

598
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,360
But now you owe him nothing.

599
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:17,880
Khatun.

600
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,959
Tegin Tu Kashe, you can stand up now.

601
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,880
Thank you, Khatun.

602
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,278
Khatun, may I ask why you'd summon me here at this hour?

603
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,920
Great Khan has a secret order for you.

604
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,318
Now, Great Khan is seriously ill.

605
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:36,799
You've seen that.

606
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,799
Everything seems to be calm and smooth in Khan's Tent today.

607
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,719
But actually, there is more at stake here.

608
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,160
It's facing both inside turmoil and foreign invasion.

609
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:49,920
I know about the "foreign invasion".

610
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,519
But what do you mean by "inside turmoil"?

611
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm just a woman.

612
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,839
I know nothing about military affairs inside Khan's Tent.

613
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:03,479
But I once heard Great Khan say that

614
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:08,038
among Bear, Eagle and Wolf Division,

615
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,120
Eagle Division is the strongest one.

616
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,160
Too bad they swear loyalty to Ashile Sun,

617
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,639
not Khan Yanli.

618
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,440
Indeed.

619
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,640
If it wasn't for me, Ashile Sun must've revolted a long time ago.

620
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,359
Now Great Khan's seriously ill.

621
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,079
No one is in charge of the Khan's Tent.

622
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,479
I'm worried that if Eagle Division rises in rebellion...

623
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,680
Khatun, don't worry.

624
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,238
If so, I will definitely confront him till the end.

625
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,318
No, no, that won't work.

626
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,119
Tegin,

627
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,799
if you confront him, you'll suffer heavy casualties.

628
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,160
So you're saying...

629
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:48,600
Khan sent me to give his order that

630
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,640
this time when you quell the disturbances in Mobei,

631
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:56,600
you could simply rely on Eagle Division and just reap the benefits.

632
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,319
Got it.

633
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:03,999
Then...

634
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,279
I'm leaving now.

635
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,999
I understand now.

636
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,439
Princess, you're trying to have Tu Kashe kill Ashile Sun.

637
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,119
That is a great trick, indeed.

638
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,558
Ashile Sun has always been the mortal enemy to Tu Kashe.

639
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,519
All I'm doing is to make use of that.

640
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:42,199
It's just...

641
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,360
What's your most concern?

642
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:46,159
Tu Kashe is crude and rash.

643
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,278
I'm afraid he'll ruin our plan eventually.

644
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:50,119
Send some assassins to keep an eye on him.

645
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,038
If he fails,

646
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:54,758
I want you to order those assassins to get rid of Ashile Sun.

647
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:56,279
Make sure he's dead.

648
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,319
I'll get on with it now.

649
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,020
[Shesheti Tribe Chumuwei Tribe Huluwu Tribe]

650
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:14,479
What are these?

651
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:18,078
These places circled in red ink are the ones that are willing to

652
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,478
make friends with your father and King of Mobei.

653
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:22,838
Now those tribes have sent out their troops on the way here.

654
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,439
They'll arrive in Mobei in two days.

655
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,798
There may be about 30000 soldiers.

656
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:28,719
Plus the soldiers we have.

657
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,279
That'll amount to over 80000.

658
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,599
That's a lot.

659
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,079
So we'll win for sure.

660
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:35,639
Not necessarily.

661
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,159
Why?

662
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,119
We've got so many people.

663
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,479
Why can't we defeat them?

664
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,478
If there're only two tribes involved, it'll be easier to deploy.

665
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,239
But this time so many tribes are involved.

666
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,679
This is a newly raised regiment without much adjustment.

667
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,959
We can't be sure about its fighting capacity,

668
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,318
When you're on the battlefield, the outcome of the war

669
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,078
is based more on the tactics used and its morale.

670
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:00,120
If it's founded on quicksand, the size won't make any difference.

671
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,038
If you can't do the job, just let me be the leader.

672
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,679
I don't mind leading the whole regiment alone.

673
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,119
No way.

674
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,758
You want to command the whole army?

675
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:12,199
Do you want to take this opportunity and plot against Monan?

676
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,919
We're in the midst of a war.

677
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,478
Stop fighting.

678
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:17,039
He started it.

679
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:20,920
Report!

680
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:25,639
King, Ashile Tribe... Ashile Tribe is mounting an attack.

681
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:30,919
Which one?

682
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,679
The troops leading the charge hang out the flags of Eagle and Bear Division.

683
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,480
Eagle Division?

684
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,720
Eagle Division is here.

685
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,040
That'd make things much easier now.

686
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,549

687
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,029

692

♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

694
