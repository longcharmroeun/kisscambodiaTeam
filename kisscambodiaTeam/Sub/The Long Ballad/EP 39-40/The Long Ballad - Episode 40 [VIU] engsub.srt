00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,840
(The Long Ballad)

2
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,400
(This is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,159
(Episode 40)

4
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,599
(Quadrangular Courtyard)

5
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,719
- It has been a while. - Yes.

6
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,680
This way, please.

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,840
Let's go.

8
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,920
It's a nice place.

9
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,239
Please.

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,120
- Here you are. - Come on.

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,319
Is it nice?

12
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Look at that.

13
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
You can't find it in the desert.

14
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,919
The yard is reserved for you guys...

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,439
so that you'll be more comfortable.

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,719
In that case, you don't have to fight for a case.

17
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,439
That's nice of you. Thank you.

18
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,810
We're so close,

19
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,159
you don't have to thank me.

20
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,879
If you're not used to it,

21
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,960
you can let me know anytime.

22
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,560
You must be tired from sending us off.

23
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,280
Since the arrangement has been made,

24
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,280
why don't you get back to work?

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,319
Get some rest.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,840
Chang Ge, we have so many rooms.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,879
Where do you live?

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
Your Highness, you may choose first.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,199
That's great.

30
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,479
I want one over there.

31
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,840
You two, come with me.

32
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,319
- Yes. - Yes.

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Come on.

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
Which house do you live in?

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
I'll clean it up for you.

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm not in a hurry.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,159
I need to go somewhere...

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,560
to meet someone important.

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
I'll go with you.

40
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,560
Go.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
Go.

42
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,560
Stop.

43
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,680
Mr. Wei.

44
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,520
It is time to report to the palace.

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,599
Get some rest.

46
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,719
I can go by myself.

47
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,919
Yes.

48
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,639
Go.

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,159
Go!

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,560
Shu Yu looks tired.

51
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,599
He didn't even see us.

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,240
Mr. Wei just came back.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,400
He didn't even enter the house.

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,599
(Wei Residence)

55
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,879
Greetings, Princess Yong'an.

56
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,639
- Please get up. - Thank you, Your Highness.

57
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,120
Why is Mr. Wei in such a hurry?

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Where did he go?

59
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,319
Your Highness.

60
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,759
Mr. Wei just came back from Quadrangular Courtyard.

61
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,000
He's just done settling down the envoy from the Northern Desert.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,280
Now, he's going to the palace to report for work.

63
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,680
Mr. Wei works so hard.

64
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,360
Did your trip to the west go well?

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,960
It's all good.

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,000
However, it seems that...

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,639
in the Northern Desert, Mr. Wei met someone he used to know.

68
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,000
(Speak and act cautiously)

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,319
Your Highness.

70
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,920
This is the room of the princess of Northern Desert.

71
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,560
All right.

72
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,120
Yes.

73
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,839
It's you.

74
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,120
I was too rash in the past.

75
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,120
This is Princess Yong'an of the Tang Dynasty.

76
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,199
- Don't be rude. - An Rou.

77
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,439
I didn't know that you're a princess.

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,519
So she is Chang Ge's friend.

79
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,639
But isn't Chang Ge...

80
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,399
hold a grudge against the palace?

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,639
Should I let her know...

82
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,000
that Chang Ge is in Chang'an?

83
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,120
I didn't expect you to be the princess of the Northern Desert.

84
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,839
What happened in Yunzhou was a misunderstanding after all.

85
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,959
I've been meaning to ask you.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,959
How did you know...

87
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
there's a word "bunny" in my pouch?

88
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
It's because the same character...

89
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,040
was embroidered in my pouch too.

90
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,800
Maybe it's a coincidence.

91
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,959
I think we're meant to meet each other.

92
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,560
My pouch was given by my best friend.

93
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,319
I thought you two knew each other.

94
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,959
In that case,

95
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,839
since you've traveled a long way,

96
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,920
get some rest.

97
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,279
If you need anything,

98
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,439
just let the servant in the Quadrangular Courtyard know.

99
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,959
I won't disturb you further.

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,720
(Quadrangular Courtyard)

101
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,319
What should I do?

102
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,959
She's alive.

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,319
If Her Highness knows about it,

104
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,319
she'll be over the moon.

105
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,959
Your Highness.

106
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,199
Since you came back from Quadrangular Courtyard,

107
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
you've been spacing out.

108
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,279
The princess of Northern Desert...

109
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,000
reminded me of Chang Ge.

110
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,720
I wonder...

111
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,879
how is she doing?

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
What pouch was that?

113
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,120
What Yunzhou?

114
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,040
I don't understand.

115
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,199
It's all in the past.

116
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,000
It doesn't matter.

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,800
Perhaps Mr. Wei is still in the palace.

118
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,560
Do you want to see him, Your Highness?

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,360
Shu Yu has been rushing around for a few days.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,480
I'll go in a few days.

121
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,560
This is...

122
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,639
(Salvation through charity to others)

123
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,959
This is where my mother rests in peace.

124
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,079
I want you to meet her.

125
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,319
What are you doing?

126
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,319
This is the first time your mother meets me.

127
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,879
I have to leave a good impression.

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,759
If my mother sees you with her own eyes,

129
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,210
she'll like you a lot.

130
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,159
Chang Ge.

131
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,919
Thank you for bringing me here to see your mother.

132
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,759
Let's go.

133
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,090
(Salvation through charity to others)

134
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,799
(Memorial tablet of Madam Jin)

135
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,480
(Memorial tablet of Madam Jin)

136
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,240
Someone still remembers your mother.

137
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,279
That's why they clean the place regularly.

138
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,840
These offerings are very fresh as well.

139
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Yes.

140
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm surprised that someone in Chang'an...

141
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,559
would still remember my mother.

142
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,879
I don't know if it's Le Yan or Yu Shu...

143
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,090
who ordered someone to do it.

144
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,879
In the past,

145
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,399
when I left Chang'an,

146
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,279
what worried me the most was the people in Chang'an...

147
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,090
would forget her, the neglectable sacrifice.

148
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,039
(Memorial tablet of Madam Jin)

149
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,450
But now,

150
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm relieved.

151
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,039
(Memorial tablet of Madam Jin)

152
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,559
Mother, I am back.

153
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,679
I came back to see you.

154
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,120
This is Ashina Sun.

155
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,039
I'd like him to meet you.

156
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,240
I'm Ashina Sun and I pay my respects to you.

157
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,039
Chang Ge.

158
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,039
I'd like to propose a toast to your mother.

159
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,840
Madam.

160
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,879
It's our first meeting.

161
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,480
I wasn't prepared.

162
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,090
Please take this cup of wine...

163
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,799
as a token of my apology and respect.

164
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
All this time,

165
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,679
I put Chang Ge through so much trouble.

166
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,639
Please forgive me.

167
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,879
Now, Chang Ge and I are in love.

168
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,120
Let me take care of her from now on.

169
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,200
(Memorial tablet of Madam Jin)

170
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,720
Madam, don't worry.

171
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,120
From now on, I'll look after her...

172
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,639
and take care of her...

173
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,919
to make it up to her.

174
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,799
What nonsense are you talking in front of my mother?

175
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,759
It's not nonsense, it's the truth.

176
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
Have you forgotten what did you say when we're in the Northern Desert?

177
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,799
Are you going back on your own words...

178
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,679
in front of your mother?

179
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,320
When men on the grasslands fall in love with someone,

180
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
they'll love her, protect her,

181
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,960
and take care of her for the rest of her life.

182
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,720
Ashina Sun.

183
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Thank you.

184
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,120
We're so close.

185
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
You don't have to thank me.

186
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,879
Mother.

187
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,279
I'll visit you often from now on.

188
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,559
Ashina Sun and I...

189
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,159
will visit you together.

190
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,480
Chang Ge?

191
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,720
Chang Ge.

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
You left in a rush at Wei River.

193
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,639
Now that I know...

194
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,120
you're safe,

195
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,919
I can finally be at ease.

196
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,000
I haven't killed the murderer.

197
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,320
I would still be alive of course.

198
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,080
Stop right there.

199
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,799
Stay away from her resting place.

200
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,960
God is above our head.

201
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,120
Aren't you afraid of karma?

202
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,759
(Memorial tablet of Madam Jin)

203
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,200
Drop the act.

204
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
You don't deserve to be here.

205
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,799
I will kill you one day.

206
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
Chang Ge.

207
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,639
If you really want to kill me,

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,559
you would have killed me with the arrow...

209
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,559
when we met each other at Wei River.

210
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,360
If I may guess,

211
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,840
you shot the arrow...

212
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,799
when we were at Wei River, right?

213
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,159
I wasn't going to save you.

214
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,559
I wanted to save the people of Tang Dynasty.

215
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
You put the Tang Dynasty first.

216
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,080
You always put people first.

217
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,960
You've never dishonored the country because of your personal agenda.

218
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,519
That's great.

219
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,360
Princess Yongning...

220
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,279
has finally grown up.

221
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,320
About what you did in Luoyang,

222
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,759
Minister Du...

223
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,279
has told me everything.

224
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,559
So what?

225
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,559
I won't forgive you.

226
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,720
I won't ask you to forgive me.

227
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,559
(Memorial tablet of Madam Jin)

228
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,039
I won't ask Jin to forgive me.

229
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,159
Shut up.

230
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,919
Don't call my mother's name.

231
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,120
Fang Yi, stand down.

232
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,559
Don't worry.

233
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,919
Her Highness prioritizes the nation.

234
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,600
She won't harm His Majesty.

235
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,879
I raised you.

236
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,440
I know what kind of person...

237
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,159
is my child.

238
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,399
You look good together.

239
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,240
Since you're being protected,

240
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,879
I'm sure...

241
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,960
Jin will feel...

242
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,240
relieved.

243
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,440
(Memorial tablet of Madam Jin)

244
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,159
It's him.

245
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,200
He has been praying for my mother.

246
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,639
Mother.

247
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,360
I won't be able to avenge you.

248
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,319
This is a household registration deed prepared for you.

249
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,119
You can use a new identity...

250
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,799
to live in the Tang Dynasty.

251
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,519
You don't have to hide anymore.

252
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,839
Is this an idea from that person?

253
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,480
It doesn't matter whose idea it was.

254
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,839
We want you to start over...

255
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,759
and live the life you want.

256
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,279
Change my name...

257
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,920
and bury all of my past.

258
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,960
That's what you want.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,799
I used to be your teacher in the past.

260
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,890
I know a little about you.

261
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,890
Since you're not obsessed with revenge,

262
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,240
what's the point of trapping yourself in the past?

263
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,799
I still have some unfinished duties.

264
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,359
I knew that...

265
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,279
the secret letter came from you.

266
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,650
Are you determined...

267
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,759
to be the envoy for the desert?

268
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,200
I became the ambassador for the Northern Desert...

269
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,170
to seek help...

270
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,519
and to make peace.

271
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,240
If the Tang Dynasty...

272
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,440
is willing to be the shield to the Northern Desert,

273
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,759
the Northern Desert...

274
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,359
will naturally become the spear to the Tang Dynasty.

275
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,200
In that case,

276
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,119
if Ashina Tribe wants to colonize the desert...

277
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,960
or if they intend to invade the Tang Dynasty...

278
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,960
they will at least stop and think.

279
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,119
Do you know...

280
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,000
if both parties decided to form an alliance...

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,119
due to the fear of the situation,

282
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,170
but not to sincerely make peace,

283
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,759
the alliance...

284
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,240
is just an agreement...

285
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,039
that can't withstand any blow.

286
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,599
- It's worth a shot. - It's worth a shot.

287
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,960
Sir.

288
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,680
You're now...

289
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
next to the stronger master.

290
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,519
Could it be due to the fear of the situation?

291
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,240
Chang Ge, have you ever thought about it before?

292
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Prince of Qi and your father...

293
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,170
decided to make things difficult for His Majesty.

294
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,119
How did His Majesty...

295
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,650
know about the details...

296
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,039
of such a well-hidden affair?

297
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,240
His Majesty was informed...

298
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,839
by the spies in the East Palace.

299
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,279
The crown prince had meticulous planning.

300
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,480
No matter how long His Majesty's arms and legs are,

301
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,680
he couldn't get into the crown prince's study.

302
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,680
Who could it be?

303
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,039
How about I tell you a story?

304
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
That year,

305
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,680
Emperor Sui Yang traveled to the north to the Great Wall.

306
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,240
When His Majesty arrived at Yanmen Pass,

307
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,680
he was besieged by Ashina Tribe.

308
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
While saving His Majesty,

309
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,359
a young general...

310
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,240
saved a pretty, young woman...

311
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,119
by accident.

312
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,960
Later on,

313
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:50,170
the young general was ordered to go on the battlefield.

314
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,890
He told that young lady to stay back with the other women.

315
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,240
He was...

316
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,170
my mother's lifesaver.

317
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,119
No way.

318
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,359
Then...

319
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,039
Mother was...

320
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,410
My mother wouldn't hurt my father.

321
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,240
They're husband and wife.

322
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,650
That's not all.

323
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,119
That young general made a great contribution...

324
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,720
in his first fight.

325
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,890
Hence, he was entrusted with important tasks.

326
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,079
Later, he was sent to battlefields...

327
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,410
more and more frequently.

328
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,890
However, he didn't know that...

329
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,039
when he was fighting battles,

330
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,170
his elder brother...

331
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,279
mistaken that young lady...

332
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,650
as his mistress.

333
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,650
after getting drunk.

334
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,279
When he returned from war,

335
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,680
that lady was already pregnant.

336
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,559
She was pregnant with me.

337
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,519
After you were born,

338
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,200
that general adored you.

339
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,359
Maybe it's fate.

340
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,319
When you were young,

341
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,039
you didn't even smile when you saw your father.

342
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,079
Only when your eyes met the general,

343
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,680
you would smile nonstop.

344
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,839
Slowly, you grew up.

345
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,519
And then you guys got along...

346
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,319
like a father and a daughter.

347
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,839
I don't have to go into that.

348
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,519
Chang Ge.

349
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,119
In this world,

350
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,650
only he truly cares...

351
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,519
about you and your mother.

352
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,319
Why didn't my mother tell me anything about him?

353
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,319
Was that the reason why she couldn't get along with my father?

354
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,000
My father was never pleased with me.

355
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,000
I thought it was because I was not good enough.

356
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,359
I couldn't read my mother's mind.

357
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,200
What kind of daughter am I?

358
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,920
Chang Ge.

359
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,160
You brought your mother a lot of joy.

360
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,039
Because of you,

361
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,720
she's not lonely.

362
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,920
Since...

363
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,400
Since my mother was a spy,

364
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,079
why did he kill my mother?

365
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,039
Sometimes what you see...

366
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,440
is not always the truth.

367
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
Not always the truth?

368
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,400
(Chang'an)

369
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,079
Ashina Sun, do you think...

370
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,559
Mr. Wei is speaking the truth?

371
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,400
The grudges...

372
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,480
that I've been holding are all in my head.

373
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,880
Is that so?

374
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,480
Chang Ge.

375
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,279
It's not your fault.

376
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,799
It's a complicated world.

377
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,319
It can't be explained with simple language.

378
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,079
(Chang'an)

379
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,000
Every person who wants to leave Chang'an...

380
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,160
will have to pass by this path.

381
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,119
In the past,

382
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,440
I left this place in the name of the treacherous princess.

383
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,000
I thought when I came back again,

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
I would be leading an army...

385
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,400
to avenge my late father.

386
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,160
I didn't expect...

387
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,880
I would be so confused.

388
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,359
I hesitated even when facing my enemy.

389
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,799
But I have to admit,

390
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,599
he was a good emperor.

391
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,400
I should hate him.

392
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,559
But he has always doted on me.

393
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,119
He was the one who taught me both the pen and the sword.

394
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,079
I'm closer to him than to my father.

395
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,079
I know how you feel.

396
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,119
My mother was killed by She Er.

397
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,240
I hoped I could kill She Er on the stop...

398
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,839
to avenge my mother.

399
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,680
But when I actually had to do it,

400
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,119
I hesitated too.

401
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,440
If I had killed She Er,

402
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,119
I would bring trouble to the Eagle Army.

403
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,720
It'll affect the peacefulness on the grasslands.

404
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,440
That's not what I want.

405
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,559
And it's not what my mother wanted.

406
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,359
When personal vengeance conflicts with the great cause,

407
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,920
we can't help but get flustered.

408
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,839
Furthermore,

409
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,519
you're dealing with the leader of the Tang Dynasty...

410
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,680
and the millions of people behind him.

411
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,000
You hesitated...

412
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,319
because you care about the happiness of other people.

413
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,079
I think...

414
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,720
your parents won't blame you.

415
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,440
It's over.

416
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,559
It doesn't matter whether your mother informed him.

417
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,960
This tragedy...

418
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,559
was probably inevitable.

419
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,440
Your mother was sandwiched between the siblings.

420
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,440
I'm sure she had a hard time.

421
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
I know.

422
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,319
I just feel sorry for my mother.

423
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,880
She couldn't share it with anyone.

424
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,119
That's why...

425
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,200
my mother told me to kneel before the Buddha.

426
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,119
She wanted me to make a vow to live with no grudges.

427
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,759
She knew it.

428
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,200
Your mother is an amazing woman.

429
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,039
She's a great mother.

430
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,200
Therefore, Chang Ge,

431
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:31,960
you should pull yourself together...

432
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,799
and live a better life.

433
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,160
Ashina Sun.

434
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,960
When everything is over,

435
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
the Tang Dynasty, the desert,

436
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,000
and the grasslands...

437
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,759
will be at peace for a long time.

438
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,720
When the time comes,

439
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,119
let's go live in the countryside, all right?

440
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,599
No matter where you go,

441
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,599
I will follow.

442
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,759
(Chang'an)

443
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,200
(Quadrangular Courtyard)

444
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,119
Chang Ge.

445
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,160
What's wrong?

446
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,920
You look tired.

447
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,279
I'm fine.

448
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,720
It's just that I'm so stubborn.

449
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,519
I enlarged the family feuds.

450
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,480
I almost...

451
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,400
I almost killed someone who has been nice to me.

452
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,160
It's over.

453
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,720
Have you...

454
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,480
forgiven the man who killed your father?

455
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,279
I don't know.

456
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,240
Some things...

457
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,440
are hard to explain...

458
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,720
whether it's right or wrong.

459
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,960
I would have told her if I knew.

460
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,119
What?

461
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,960
The princess of the Tang Dynasty was here yesterday.

462
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,960
She's the princess you gave the pouch to.

463
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,119
Le Yan?

464
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,359
Did she say anything?

465
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,519
She thought I was the princess of the Northern Desert.

466
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,119
She also asked...

467
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,160
how did I know about the pouch.

468
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,240
But I didn't tell her the truth.

469
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,400
I didn't want you to feel bad about it.

470
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,359
She's my best friend in Chang'an.

471
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,079
That's right.

472
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,880
I should see her since I'm here.

473
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,799
Your Highness,

474
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,160
didn't we just go to Quadrangular Courtyard yesterday?

475
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,640
Why are you going there again today?

476
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,799
Furthermore, you opted not to take a carriage.

477
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,000
You're so secretive.

478
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,960
That lady we saw yesterday...

479
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,559
wasn't the princess of the Northern Desert.

480
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,359
From how she dressed,

481
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,599
I could tell that she's not from a noble family.

482
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,920
I guess...

483
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,920
she's just a servant.

484
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,759
Your Highness, you...

485
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,480
Did you make a conclusion based on those aspects?

486
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,680
Yesterday, when I asked her about the pouch,

487
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,799
she was stuttering and she was also delirious.

488
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,920
She was so condescending when she was in Yunzhou.

489
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,960
She has completely changed.

490
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,359
Hence, I'm sure that...

491
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,720
she knows Chang Ge.

492
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,240
What?

493
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,680
Is Princess Yongning here too?

494
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,559
For the sake of Chang Ge's safety,

495
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,920
we need to keep a low profile.

496
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,359
I just want...

497
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,920
I just want to verify my speculation.

498
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,160
I don't want to alert anyone.

499
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,119
And I hope Chang Ge is really there.

500
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,039
Come on.

501
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,200
Hao Du.

502
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,319
I saw Your Highness leaving the palace...

503
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,359
without taking the carriage.

504
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,599
I was worried about your safety.

505
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,519
So are you...

506
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,279
following me in secret again?

507
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,039
I'm just worried about Your Highness.

508
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,640
This is Chang'an.

509
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,119
I'm safe.

510
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,440
You're right, Your Highness.

511
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,720
However, all the ambassadors from different tribes are here.

512
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,480
You should be careful, Your Highness.

513
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,400
Hao Du.

514
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,559
You once said that...

515
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,759
you'd only capture those who harmed the Tang Dynasty.

516
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,079
Yes.

517
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,079
If Your Highness is worried,

518
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,720
I'll just follow you from afar.

519
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,359
As long as it's not dangerous,

520
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,160
I'll never come between you and...

521
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,519
your friend.

522
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,759
All right.

523
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,400
I didn't want to draw any attention anyway.

524
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,759
Got it.

525
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,200
I will keep it a secret.

526
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,640
Chang Ge.

527
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,799
Chang Ge.

528
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,759
Let me go with you.

529
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,680
Don't worry, Mimi.

530
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,759
I'll be fine.

531
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,279
But this is Chang'an.

532
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,119
And you've been hurt before.

533
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,799
I'm really worried.

534
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,960
If you don't promise me,

535
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,359
I'll tell Ashina Sun.

536
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,160
- Well... - Are you going out?

537
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,400
(Quadrangular Courtyard)

538
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
I want to see Le Yan.

539
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,960
Are you going to the palace?

540
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,480
But before I go see Le Yan,

541
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,039
I'm going to meet with Shu Yu first.

542
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,480
You don't have to go there.

543
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,279
Chang Ge.

544
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,160
Le Yan.

545
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,759
Chang Ge.

546
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,720
I knew you'd be here.

547
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,359
I didn't get to see you yesterday,

548
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,279
but I have a hunch that you're here.

549
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,319
It's my bad.

550
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,759
I didn't go to see you after coming back to Chang'an.

551
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,880
It's not too late to see you now.

552
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,359
I met her on the grasslands.

553
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,359
Her name is Mimi Guli.

554
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,759
I think you've met each other.

555
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,400
This is...

556
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
I know him.

557
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,799
When I was in Luoyang,

558
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,079
he saved you.

559
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,079
His name is Ashina Sun.

560
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,960
Ashina Sun, this is my sister.

561
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,839
All right.

562
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,200
Stop chatting, everyone. Let's go inside.

563
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,880
I had fun today.

564
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,319
All my best friends are here.

565
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,480
I didn't have the guts to dream of a reunion like this.

566
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,839
Chang Ge.

567
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,440
Are you still going to leave Chang'an?

568
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,599
You're right.

569
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,960
Chang'an won't be able to hold you back.

570
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,759
But...

571
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,519
how did you become the princess of the Northern Desert?

572
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,759
It's a long story.

573
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,920
This is a feasting song.

574
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,319
Feasting?

575
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
The ritual of feasting is only for the guests.

576
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,119
The ritual is used to welcome the newly joined convoy.

577
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,799
However,

578
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,319
all the convoys are already here.

579
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,839
Why are there newly joined convoys?

580
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,519
I don't know.

581
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,839
How about this, Mimi?

582
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:56,960
Wait here.

583
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,599
Let Le Yan and I find out what's going on.

584
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,400
All right, come back soon.

585
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:01,759
Sure.

586
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,119
Why are you in a panic?

587
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,119
What should we do?

588
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,759
We have to do something.

589
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,000
We can't just wait here to die.

590
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,079
That's right.

591
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,559
Am I right?

592
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,559
Chang Ge.

593
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,400
Chang Ge.

594
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,880
Who is she?

595
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,799
If I may ask,

596
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,720
does Your Highness know that convoy of Ashina Tribe is here?

597
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,039
Your Highness,

598
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,799
did the Tang Dynasty invite them here?

599
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,319
The Tang Dynasty didn't intend to invite them.

600
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:25,000
You...

601
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,519
You're from the Tang Dynasty.

602
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,079
The princess of the Northern Desert met with a Tang person in private.

603
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,440
That's not true.

604
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,160
Ashina Tribe coming to Tang...

605
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,480
means they know about the alliance.

606
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,160
I don't care if you collude with each other.

607
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,759
We have to leave now.

608
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,000
Zhi Xi.

609
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,039
What if Ashina Tribe found out our alliance with Tang...

610
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,880
and decided to attack us at this juncture?

611
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,279
All of us will be wiped out.

612
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,559
- Yes. - All of us will be wiped out.

613
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,559
We have to go back quickly.

614
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
Don't worry.

615
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,160
The Tang Dynasty will never abandon all the tribes.

616
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,400
I can promise you.

617
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,960
I'm Princess Yong'an of the Tang Dynasty.

618
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,960
- Princess. - She's a princess.

619
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,079
No.

620
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,599
We still need to leave.

621
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,559
The Emperor of Tang is far away.

622
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,960
It's easy for you to say that at the moment.

623
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,000
When the dog is beaten, the lion is tamed.

624
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,809
They will leave us hanging for sure.

625
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:15,960
- Yes. - Let's go.

626
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Listen to me, everyone.

627
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,480
- Don't make noise. Hold on. - Move.

628
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,719
Calm down.

629
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,880
Listen to me, everyone.

630
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:23,440
Listen to me, guys.

631
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,679
Now, listen to me.

632
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,159
Are you done?

633
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,920
Since Ashina Tribe...

634
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,289
has the guts to come to Quadrangular Courtyard,

635
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,639
they must have passed through customs.

636
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,329
They are here for a diplomatic mission.

637
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,079
However, if anything happens,

638
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,329
do you think the Tang Dynasty will turn a blind eye?

639
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
What are you afraid of?

640
00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:57,840
We can't take it lightly.

641
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,519
Why are you all standing there?

642
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:03,769
Are you welcoming Ashina Tribe?

643
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,119
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

644
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,559
It's you.

645
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,559
Ashina Tribe is here.

646
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,639
Yes.

647
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,289
I heard that Young Khan is here.

648
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,199
The lady that he's escorting...

649
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,920
is someone from Ashina Tribe...

650
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,079
known as Khatun.

651
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,360
Are you serious?

652
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,400
I think it's real. That's what I heard anyway.

653
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,559
Khatun?

654
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,880
The time has come.

655
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,960
The old Mimi is dead.

656
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,159
Right now,

657
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,769
you can be bold and brave.

658
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,679
You can be yourself, Mimi.

659
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,329
Look.

660
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:06,960
The moment Ashina Tribe is here,

661
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,199
these guys behave...

662
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,119
as if they are rabbits that run into an eagle.

663
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,329
All they do is run.

664
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,920
No one is running away.

665
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,239
The Southern Desert isn't afraid of you.

666
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Zhen Zhu.

667
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,289
You're dressed inappropriately.

668
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,199
What role are you playing...

669
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:23,440
in the Quadrangular Courtyard?

670
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,440
If I expose your true identity,

671
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,329
will you...

672
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,440
She Er.

673
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,639
You...

674
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,719
You're alive.

675
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:54,199
Why did you lie to me?

676
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,199
You're a jerk.

677
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,119
I thought you were dead.

678
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,039
I can't believe you pretended to be dead.

679
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,000
Coward. Liar.

680
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,000
I overestimated you.

681
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,119
I engraved your name on the warrior tombstone.

682
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,289
You don't deserve it.

683
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,809
Don't play innocent here.

684
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,039
You two colluded to stab me in the back.

685
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,119
Don't tell me you know nothing.

686
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,960
I don't want to be your enemy.

687
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,329
From now on,

688
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,599
we're not brothers anymore.

689
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,119
Yicheng came to Chang'an.

690
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,679
This is...

691
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,199
It has been a while,

692
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:54,559
Li Chang Ge.

693
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,159
Today, the Great Khan is relaxed.

694
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,159
He kept making noise when he was first moved to the room.

695
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,360
Tell me about it.

696
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,079
Maybe the decoction is working.

697
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,480
He has stopped making noise now.

698
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,159
Great Khan was so cool all his life.

699
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,840
It's a pity that he fell sick.

700
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
What are you talking about?

701
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:24,519
I told you before.

702
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,559
Don't ever...

703
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,599
talk about anything that happens here.

704
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,119
- Forgive us, Commander Lei. - Forgive us, Commander Lei.

705
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,289
- We are sorry. - We are sorry.

706
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:32,360
There is no next time.

707
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,880
I'm showing mercy by letting you live.

708
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,769
It's also a lesson for everyone else.

709
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,809
This is what happens when you gossip.

710
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,079
The Great Khan's illness...

711
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,809
is strange.

712
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:06,769
(May blessings abound)

713
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,159
(Imperial Kitchen)

714
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
- Why did Khatun come to Chang'an? - Yes.

715
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,719
Chang Ge.

716
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,559
This is...

717
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:15,880
She is She Er's mother.

718
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,400
I'm Khatun from Ashina Tribe.

719
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:22,440
Great Khan has caught an illness.

720
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,199
My son and I had to come...

721
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,289
on his behalf...

722
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,329
to sincerely express our gratitude...

723
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,480
to the Tang and other tribes.

724
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,289
Of course.

725
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,679
It's also for the betrothal...

726
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,039
between the Tang Dynasty and Ashina Tribe.

727
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,599
I shouldn't have come.

728
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,679
But we're discussing our children's marriage.

729
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,119
At least, one of the parents...

730
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,480
has to be here.

731
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,599
The Tang Dynasty always honors its words.

732
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:49,519
I believe that...

733
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:51,119
they will keep their promise.

734
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,239
I think everyone was here in Chang'an...

735
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,329
because you believe the same.

736
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,840
So they're here for the betrothal.

737
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
- They're here for the betrothal. - Yes.

738
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,039
I'd like to propose a toast...

739
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,769
to everyone.

740
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:17,880
Chang Ge, she means...

741
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,199
the Emperor of Tang had a betrothal with Ashina Tribe.

742
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,840
If His Majesty goes back to his own words,

743
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,960
does that mean...

744
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:27,329
he will overturn the alliance with the desert anytime?

745
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,199
I can't believe that she said that.

746
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,360
Could it be that she is certain that...

747
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,480
the Emperor of Tang won't marry the princess as promised?

748
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,519
Hao Du, take her away first.

749
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,679
I'll handle things here.

750
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,480
Khatun and Young Khan have just arrived today.

751
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,119
On behalf of the Northern Desert,

752
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,880
I propose a toast to Khatun and Young Khan.

753
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,679
Wait.

754
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,289
Why don't we let your guard...

755
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
drink for you?

756
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,920
The tour guard is so obedient, Your Highness.

757
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:49,960
It looks like you taught him well.

758
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:52,239
Since Your Highness can come to Chang'an...

759
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,719
on behalf of the Ashina Tribe,

760
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,519
it seems that you've taken well care...

761
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,769
of the capital.

762
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:00,360
Well,

763
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,679
a guard of the Northern Desert...

764
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,199
has no say in it.

765
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:49,559
