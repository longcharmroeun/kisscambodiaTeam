1
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,400
(The Long Ballad)

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,359
(This is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,239
(Episode 39)

4
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,000
Ashina Sun.

5
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Ashina Sun.

6
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,040
I guess the effect of the medicine isn't enough.

7
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,879
Starting today, increase his dosage.

8
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,879
Yes.

9
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,159
Tell those heading to Northern Desert...

10
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,879
to investigate more carefully.

11
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,439
They must see...

12
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,840
Ashina Sun's body.

13
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,920
Mimi Guli didn't even destroy the purple gromwell.

14
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,840
I don't believe that she'll kill Ashina Sun.

15
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,039
Don't worry, Your Highness.

16
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,599
I'll surely handle this well.

17
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,199
Right.

18
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,879
I heard that Bu Zhen and King of Sui...

19
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,039
are very close.

20
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,680
They're playmates who are in the same age group.

21
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,810
The King of Sui really likes him.

22
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,039
As long as we still have him,

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,479
then he would still...

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,840
be useful.

25
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,240
Young Khan.

26
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,759
We've already confirmed that aside from Mu Jin,

27
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,879
no survivors came back from the Bear and Eagle Armies.

28
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,479
Why?

29
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,680
Ashina Sun has fought in many battles.

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,240
He is very experienced.

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,639
How can this happen?

32
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,800
Ashina Sun.

33
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,759
I haven't had a good drink with you yet.

34
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
I thought that if you were dead, I'd be very happy.

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
Why am I not happy at all now?

36
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,159
You were the opponent I have the most faith in.

37
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,879
I haven't proven to you yet that I won't lose to you.

38
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,599
Ashina Sun, you brat!

39
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,319
Do you want me to lose to you forever?

40
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,170
When you were alive,

41
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,050
I couldn't stand you.

42
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,610
You're making me suffer even after you're dead.

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,439
Do you believe that Ashina Sun is dead?

44
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,170
He's the God of War of the grasslands.

45
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,759
How can he die?

46
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
She Er.

47
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,000
You're drunk.

48
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,399
Uncle.

49
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,160
It must be Uncle.

50
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,959
If he hadn't agreed,

51
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,360
how would Tu Ka She dare...

52
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,879
to kill him?

53
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,279
Who would dare to lay a finger on Ashina Sun?

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,399
I can even imagine...

55
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,360
that on the battlefield in the Great Desert,

56
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,240
on the front were troops from Great Desert...

57
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,240
and Tu Ka She was on the back.

58
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,199
They all wanted Ashina Sun dead.

59
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
We all have our own destinies.

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,839
Don't jump to your own conclusions.

61
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,680
If people with ulterior motives...

62
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,120
hear what you're saying,

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,360
your uncle will get angry.

64
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,800
It will be bad for the Wolf Army too.

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
Angry?

66
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,000
Ashina Sun is dead...

67
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,639
and I can't even speak my mind?

68
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,759
In the past,

69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,519
I've always tried to beat Ashina Sun.

70
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,279
The Eagle Army is gone now.

71
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,600
Even if...

72
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,480
I become king of the grasslands,

73
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,879
what's the point?

74
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,560
Of course there's a point.

75
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,600
You're the true king of the Ashina Tribe.

76
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,680
You should rule the grasslands.

77
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
Ashina Sun is dead.

78
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,240
You should be pleased.

79
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,319
You can't let me down.

80
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,079
She Er.

81
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,079
She Er.

82
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,120
Ashina Sun.

83
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,720
I can't believe...

84
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,959
that you even managed to win my son over.

85
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,800
I underestimated you.

86
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,560
Where is he? Did you catch him?

87
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,839
He's dead.

88
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,040
Who shot the arrow?

89
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,319
We've got him surrounded.

90
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
He knew he couldn't get away so he killed himself.

91
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,079
Where is his corpse?

92
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,480
It's outside.

93
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,879
We searched him.

94
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,399
He didn't have anything of value.

95
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,319
Ashina Tribe is the one...

96
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,720
who wanted him dead.

97
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,079
One of their own...

98
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,319
wanted to kill Ashina Sun.

99
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,240
It's the capital.

100
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,120
If they ever try to hurt Ashina Sun again,

101
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,480
I'll surely avenge him tenfold.

102
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,759
I have one more favor to ask.

103
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,519
Tell me.

104
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,800
Since they sent a spy,

105
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
they must want to see the corpse.

106
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,079
Can you burn down the battlefield and destroy the corpse?

107
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,920
Under such grief, you can even think so meticulously.

108
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,079
Incredible.

109
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,240
Don't worry. Leave that to me.

110
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,199
How is he?

111
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,279
I did everything I could.

112
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,600
But...

113
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,480
whether he last until tomorrow...

114
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Anyway,

115
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,279
you'd better be prepared.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Thank you.

117
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,399
I want to take good care of him.

118
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,090
Come on.

119
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Ashina Sun.

120
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,360
You can hear me, right?

121
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,120
I've already asked Bodhisattva...

122
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,639
to make arrangements for the Eagle Army.

123
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,639
When you wake up,

124
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,600
we'll leave together.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,330
Let's go to a place...

126
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,559
where people never go into battles.

127
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,840
The water and grass would be abundant there.

128
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,879
There would be herds of cows and sheep.

129
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,519
I heard that if we go a little further north,

130
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,399
there's a very beautiful snow-covered mountain.

131
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,639
Come and see it with me, all right?

132
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,679
I suddenly remembered when we first met.

133
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,679
Back then,

134
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,759
I've lost all my family.

135
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,960
But I became friends with Qin Zhun,

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,210
an unexpected guest.

137
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,360
My surname is Qin.

138
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,519
My name is Zhun.

139
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,090
You can call me Qin Zhun.

140
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,039
Be it rain, storm, or thunder,

141
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,879
be it blades or arrows,

142
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,960
let me block them for you.

143
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,000
That was the darkest moment of my life.

144
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,519
But you were there.

145
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,399
This is also your darkest moment.

146
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,279
I'll never leave you.

147
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,600
We've been through so much.

148
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,919
We surpassed them all.

149
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,120
We can still surpass more things in the future.

150
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Am I right?

151
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
Actually, I really hate you.

152
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,039
You're arrogant, egotistical,

153
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,360
and you can't take care of yourself.

154
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,799
But I can't live without you.

155
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,360
Didn't you always tell me...

156
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,480
to use the rest of my life to repay you?

157
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,159
I promise you.

158
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,679
I'll never ever leave you in this lifetime.

159
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,039
But you have to give me a chance.

160
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:28,960
Wake up.

161
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,080
Ashina Sun.

162
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,639
Can you please wake up?

163
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,039
I'll stay here with you.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,159
Wake up.

165
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,480
There are so many things that we haven't done yet.

166
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,200
There are so many places that we haven't seen.

167
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't abandon me.

168
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,639
I didn't expect things to turn out this way.

169
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,159
In the Northern Desert,

170
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,039
that was what happened with Ashina Sun and Chang Ge.

171
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,080
Go and meet up with them first.

172
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,440
The Eagle Army doesn't exist anymore.

173
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,200
I'm afraid it's not safe for you to stay here.

174
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
What about you?

175
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,320
Why are you staying here?

176
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Great Khan is sick.

177
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,440
The capital will be moved.

178
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,000
I've already looked into it.

179
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,679
The capital will be relocating to Dingxiang.

180
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,639
I have to go with them.

181
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,039
I still have some unfinished business.

182
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
What is it?

183
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,240
Since we're all in the same boat now,

184
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,080
the Yanxing Sect...

185
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,279
won't desert you.

186
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,399
It won't be convenient if you follow me.

187
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,440
Please relay this information to Ashina Sun.

188
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,679
Also,

189
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,960
Ya Luo is dead.

190
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,639
I went to the prison in the capital secretly.

191
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,360
Ya Luo was nowhere to be found.

192
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,039
The guard at the prison told me...

193
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,039
that when Ya Luo arrived at the capital that night,

194
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,799
he was already killed.

195
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,399
The capital...

196
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,000
isn't what it used to be anymore.

197
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,519
You said the capital is moving to Dingxiang.

198
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,360
So there is someone...

199
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,840
from the Sui Dynasty in Ashina Tribe?

200
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,519
It's Khatun.

201
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,000
That's really interesting.

202
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,440
I can't interfere with Ashina Tribe's affairs.

203
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,600
I only follow orders...

204
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,559
from Young Master.

205
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,639
Thank you, Elder Qin.

206
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,000
In the future, you must be extra careful.

207
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,440
Also,

208
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,120
if you see Mimi,

209
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
tell her...

210
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,279
to live well.

211
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,039
Young man,

212
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,639
I think...

213
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,159
she'll wish to hear that from you yourself.

214
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,039
Xu Feng, tell our men...

215
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,399
that we'll stay here...

216
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,039
and await the orders of the Young Master.

217
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,200
Also,

218
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
send a letter to Northern Desert first.

219
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,639
Yes.

220
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,639
Young man,

221
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,480
take good care of yourself.

222
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,000
Farewell.

223
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,919
Ashina Sun, you're awake?

224
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,759
You're really awake.

225
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,600
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.

226
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,759
You're really awake.

227
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,799
Are you really...

228
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,080
won't ever leave me again in this lifetime?

229
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,320
Did you hear me?

230
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,759
Since I was able to hear your true feelings,

231
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,480
even getting shot with 10 more arrows would be worth it.

232
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,879
What are you talking about?

233
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,919
Don't you know how worried I was last night?

234
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,320
I was scared...

235
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,159
that you'll really die.

236
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,279
I thought I was going to die too.

237
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,639
But I heard you call out my name,

238
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,159
so I came back from where the Heavenly Wolf God was.

239
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
I even heard...

240
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,080
that you'd avenge me.

241
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,679
I'm really happy.

242
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,919
Chang Ge.

243
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,360
The moment I got hit by the arrow,

244
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,480
I didn't think about anything.

245
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,799
I just wanted to take you home.

246
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,440
Chang Ge, I...

247
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,720
Prince Sun, you're awake.

248
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,840
There is no Prince Sun anymore.

249
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,399
Just call me Ashina Sun.

250
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,960
All right.

251
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,360
I'll inform them first.

252
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,039
Everyone was worried all night.

253
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,399
Hurry up.

254
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,559
Be careful. Don't break it.

255
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,960
- Keep up. - Here's another box.

256
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,759
- Keep up. - Slowly.

257
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,960
- Give me a hand. Place it here. - Don't break it.

258
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,440
Those at the back, keep up.

259
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,799
That's good. Here.

260
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,679
Here, give me a hand.

261
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Be careful.

262
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,960
- Slowly. Put it here. - You're so noisy. Shut up!

263
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,200
Young Khan.

264
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,839
What is going on?

265
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,920
Great Khan gave orders...

266
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,000
that the royal court will be moved to Dingxiang.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,039
We're starting on it today.

268
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,000
The Great Khan is terminally ill.

269
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,480
His Majesty must not tire himself out.

270
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,960
From now on, perhaps the stamp, the capital,

271
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,559
and the entire grassland...

272
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,759
will be in your hands one day.

273
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
You're the true king of Ashina Tribe.

274
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,519
You should rule the grasslands.

275
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,119
It's my mother.

276
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,359
Uncle is sick.

277
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,000
Ashina Sun and Tu Ka She are dead.

278
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,170
I'm the only one left in the royal court.

279
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,759
Is this a coincidence...

280
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,519
or my mother's plan?

281
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,650
Tu Lu Ke, what do you think?

282
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,240
You're reunited with your mother now.

283
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,519
It's a good thing.

284
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
What's the matter?

285
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,039
The spy we sent to Northern Desert...

286
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,519
- is dead. - He's dead?

287
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,650
I think the Northern Desert Army found out.

288
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,960
You're all useless.

289
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,519
That means...

290
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,960
no one actually saw Ashina Sun dead.

291
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,480
Yes.

292
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,650
One more thing.

293
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,279
Tu Ka She's body hasn't been found either.

294
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,319
The Northern Desert Army...

295
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,890
defeated Ashina Tribe for the first time.

296
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,650
They burned down the battlefield...

297
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,680
to boost their morale,

298
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,039
so...

299
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,170
I got it.

300
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,410
You may go.

301
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,279
Yes.

302
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,200
What did I say?

303
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,279
A wolf on the grasslands has nine lives.

304
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,960
He won't die that easily.

305
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,799
Let's get down to business.

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ashina Sun.

307
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,720
I know you're a tough guy.

308
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,650
I won't beat around the bush with you.

309
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
The one who tried to kill you...

310
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,960
was sent by the Ashina Tribe.

311
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,440
There is no reason to hesitate anymore.

312
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,119
As long as you surrender with the Eagle Army,

313
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,279
I guarantee...

314
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,170
that I'll treat you well.

315
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,599
Thank you for your kindness, King of Northern Desert.

316
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,599
But I led the Eagle Army in pretending to be dead.

317
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,240
I didn't do it to let my men work for someone else.

318
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,839
Aside from Northern Desert,

319
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,170
where else can you go?

320
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,279
Anywhere is fine.

321
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,960
Even being in exile...

322
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,680
is better than spending our days...

323
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,440
in battles and bloodshed.

324
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,480
Your talent for leading troops would be wasted.

325
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,960
- Why not come to Southern Desert... - The Eagle Army...

326
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,720
won't become anyone's weapon.

327
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Now that we've talked things out,

328
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,440
I want to say something too.

329
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,079
Go ahead.

330
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,079
I think no matter how wary...

331
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,480
Yan Li Khan is of the Eagle Army,

332
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,279
he wouldn't kill Ashina Sun.

333
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,839
Behind this...

334
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Dingxiang.

335
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,079
It must have something to do with Dingxiang.

336
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,720
So you thought of that too.

337
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes.

338
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,960
No matter how much my father hates me,

339
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,079
he wouldn't just throw away this weapon of his.

340
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,759
But if it's that person...

341
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,920
She knows better than anyone...

342
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,319
that there's no way the Eagle Army will work for her.

343
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,000
Now, all of Great Desert's tribes have rebelled.

344
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,359
Princess Yicheng's plan has failed.

345
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,839
But I don't think she would just let it go.

346
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,519
I'm just afraid...

347
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,359
that more people in the Ashina Tribe will be manipulated by her...

348
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,599
and blindly participate in battles.

349
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:36,480
For now, if we want a peaceful life,

350
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,839
there's only one option.

351
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,440
Form an alliance with Tang.

352
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,960
Form an alliance with Tang?

353
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,519
If we form an alliance with Tang...

354
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,559
and let a third party get involved,

355
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,440
when the time comes...

356
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,480
that Yicheng wants to start another war,

357
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
she'll also think twice.

358
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,519
What if she doesn't stop?

359
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,650
I can't just sit and watch Tang attack the Ashina Tribe.

360
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,680
I don't want such a thing to happen too.

361
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,079
But we have to do our best.

362
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,240
Only in getting all three sides involved...

363
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,599
can this war not begin.

364
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,200
Chang Ge,

365
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,079
you're oversimplifying things.

366
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,759
This isn't a simple matter in the first place.

367
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,720
But if we don't do our best,

368
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,890
there would be no hope at all.

369
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,920
This is the letter Elder Qin sent me this morning.

370
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,119
There is some news...

371
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,650
from Mu Jin.

372
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,039
Ya Luo is dead.

373
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,960
My father is also very sick.

374
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,559
The capital...

375
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,960
I can't believe the capital is moving to Dingxiang.

376
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Yes.

377
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,680
If my guess is right,

378
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,319
Yicheng...

379
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,200
is slowly controlling the royal court.

380
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,240
The capital is moving to Dingxiang.

381
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,839
Once Yicheng is in complete control of the whole Ashina Tribe,

382
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,960
her next move...

383
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,079
would be against Tang.

384
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,119
Does that mean...

385
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,359
you came to us for Tang's sake?

386
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
No.

387
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,480
I'm doing this for all the innocent citizens...

388
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,599
who would suffer from war.

389
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,319
Regardless if it's Great Desert,

390
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,759
Ashina Tribe, or Tang,

391
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,519
these innocent citizens...

392
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,599
shouldn't be used and sacrificed...

393
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,279
by these people's plots and desires.

394
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,839
None of us can stay out of this.

395
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,960
And I thought you had a great plan.

396
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,119
Form an alliance with Tang?

397
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Don't forget.

398
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,880
We were all Tang's enemies once.

399
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,599
That's right.

400
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,359
In getting Tang involved,

401
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
who can guarantee...

402
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,119
that it won't be like the Ashina Tribe?

403
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,359
It won't.

404
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,759
This crisis...

405
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,240
can only be solved by Tang.

406
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,359
Based on what I know about Li Shi Min,

407
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,000
Tang will never become like the Ashina Tribe.

408
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,359
If we let Tang keep Ashina Tribe in check,

409
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
when the time comes,

410
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
the entire Great Desert...

411
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,160
can get through this without suffering any losses.

412
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,079
There is nothing more convenient than this.

413
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,359
Besides,

414
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,960
all of you want to seek alliances...

415
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,200
to resist the Ashina Tribe.

416
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,519
How can you let go of such a powerful ally?

417
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,240
Wait.

418
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,880
We've been discussing here for so long.

419
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,079
Here's the thing.

420
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,880
Why would Tang join forces with us?

421
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,039
In a few days,

422
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,960
I'm sure we'll hear some news.

423
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,519
Ashina Sun.

424
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,759
Ya Luo...

425
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,599
Ya Luo died for the Eagle Army.

426
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,599
Don't be so hard on yourself.

427
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Chang Ge.

428
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,119
Father wouldn't kill Ya Luo.

429
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,559
I know.

430
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,680
Father was as strong as an ox.

431
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,880
It's impossible for him to get sick so easily.

432
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Ashina Sun.

433
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,400
I know that.

434
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,400
If not for the greater good...

435
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,079
If not for the greater good,

436
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,359
you'd lead the entire Eagle Army and charge to the capital...

437
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,599
to avenge Ya Luo then save your father.

438
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,359
Yes.

439
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,680
As Eagle Army's commander,

440
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,640
I couldn't protect Ya Luo.

441
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,599
As a son,

442
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,599
I shouldn't let Yicheng continue to harm Father all the more.

443
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,200
I know we're all waiting for the right time.

444
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,839
But don't worry.

445
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,279
Yicheng would never kill Great Khan.

446
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,880
After all, she needs him to lead Ashina Tribe's troops.

447
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,839
I'm so confused right now.

448
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,279
Don't.

449
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,839
I'm here.

450
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,200
Ashina Sun.

451
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,240
I'll go with you to save your father.

452
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,160
We'll seek justice for Ya Luo...

453
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,359
and the entire Eagle Army.

454
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,160
Chief, the envoy of Tang wishes to see you.

455
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,960
- All right, you may go. - Yes.

456
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,599
Tang?

457
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,960
That was fast.

458
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,920
Li Chang Ge is not an ordinary person.

459
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,519
I'll meet the envoy.

460
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,119
Will you stay here...

461
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,559
or stay on the side?

462
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,279
I don't want to hear your crap.

463
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,119
Summon the envoy of the Tang.

464
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
King of Northern Desert.

465
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,039
I'm the envoy of Tang, Wei Shu Yu.

466
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,039
Recently, our imperial court found out...

467
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,680
that the Ashina Tribe was drafting soldiers in Great Desert.

468
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,640
His Majesty sent me...

469
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,079
to invite all the leaders of Great Desert...

470
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
to head over to Chang'an...

471
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,759
and discuss our alliance.

472
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,079
Thank you, Envoy Wei, for coming such a long way.

473
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,160
Let's discuss this slowly...

474
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
and carefully.

475
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,039
Chang Ge?

476
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Wei Shu Yu?

477
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,559
Why are you here?

478
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:27,079
Chang Ge, why did you come to Northern Desert?

479
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,160
Ever since we parted in Liuyun Abbey,

480
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,160
Le Yan and I have been worried about you.

481
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,279
What about Le Yan? How is she?

482
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,000
Her Highness is doing well.

483
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,960
She personally inspected the farmers...

484
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,079
to get close to the citizens.

485
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,279
She is so different from before.

486
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,920
After all, she suffered...

487
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,359
a lot of hardships.

488
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
But that's a good thing too.

489
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,440
After all, the princess of Tang needs to become mature.

490
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,359
You're also a princess of Tang.

491
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,839
You've matured too.

492
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,799
Shu Yu.

493
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,440
Tell me how Li Shi Min...

494
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,400
Tell me your motive in coming here this time.

495
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,519
A secret report came to His Majesty.

496
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,880
After reading the secret report,

497
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,400
he told me to come here to discuss the alliance.

498
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,920
That secret letter...

499
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,400
was from Shuozhou.

500
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,039
Was that from you, Chang Ge?

501
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Yes.

502
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,480
I didn't expect...

503
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,279
that you'd still care about Tang.

504
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,799
After all,

505
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,559
Tang is my hometown.

506
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,759
Is he your friend?

507
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,519
Yes, he's my friend, Ashina Sun.

508
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,640
Ashina Sun, come here quickly.

509
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,480
Let me introduce you to my friend from Tang, Wei Shu Yu.

510
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,599
I don't think...

511
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,279
your friend likes me very much.

512
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,160
That's just how he is.

513
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,559
Don't mind him.

514
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
It's fine.

515
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,279
Ashina Sun...

516
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,480
Ashina Sun.

517
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,880
He is Ashina Sun from the Ashina Tribe.

518
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,839
Yes.

519
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,519
He is Ashina Sun of the Eagle Army.

520
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,720
I received a secret report.

521
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,160
The Eagle and Bear Armies fought in Northern Desert...

522
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,400
and they're all dead.

523
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,759
How can he still be alive?

524
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,960
It's a long story.

525
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,799
Please hide the news...

526
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,640
that Ashina Sun is still alive.

527
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,319
The alliance meeting is coming up.

528
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,839
We don't want to cause more trouble.

529
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,559
I can promise you that.

530
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,720
But Chang Ge,

531
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,240
if you consider me as a friend, listen to me.

532
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,359
He's not a good person.

533
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,720
You should stay away from him.

534
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Wei Shu Yu.

535
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,839
I know you mean well.

536
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,799
But I know what I'm doing.

537
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Don't worry.

538
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,759
In that case,

539
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,519
there is no point in discussing this further.

540
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,680
Chang Ge, I still have work to do.

541
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,200
I have to go.

542
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
Today,

543
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,960
my meeting with Envoy Wei...

544
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,880
might have raised a lot of questions in your mind.

545
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,279
Then go ahead and tell us yourself.

546
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,039
I used to belong in Tang's East Palace.

547
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,519
The current emperor killed my entire family.

548
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,359
While I was on the run,

549
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,680
I met Ashina Sun...

550
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,200
and became friends with him.

551
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,279
So...

552
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,440
Envoy Wei and I are old friends...

553
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,839
and I'm also the military strategist of the Eagle Army.

554
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,079
Interesting.

555
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,240
Won't Tang kill you now?

556
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,759
If not,

557
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,960
how am I able to meet you now?

558
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,279
I'll believe you for now.

559
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,599
Great Desert cannot afford to lose a strong ally.

560
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,079
However,

561
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,720
who should we send to Chang'an?

562
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,279
I want to hear your opinion.

563
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,359
If you two trust me,

564
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,400
I'm willing to be an envoy of Northern Desert...

565
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,720
and attend the alliance meeting in Chang'an.

566
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You?

567
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,920
I was the one who talked to other tribes about the alliance before.

568
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,319
So they must trust me somehow.

569
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,119
Don't worry, Chief.

570
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,640
I'll surely do my best for Great Desert.

571
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,720
You're not from the Great Desert.

572
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,880
Why are you working so hard for the alliance?

573
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,119
I want to end the wars as soon as possible.

574
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,839
Be it the Central Plains, grasslands, or the Great Desert,

575
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,200
people won't suffer from starvation and separation anymore.

576
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,440
Is that all?

577
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,519
Aren't those enough reasons?

578
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,680
What kind of identity do you want to go as?

579
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,519
Is it up to me?

580
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Let me hear it.

581
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,440
I want to go as princess of Northern Desert.

582
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,319
As your sister.

583
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
What do you think?

584
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,599
That's fine.

585
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,039
Thank you, Chief.

586
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,000
Since you made a deal with me for the purple gromwell...

587
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,200
until now,

588
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,839
it seems like every step is going according to your expectations.

589
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,559
It's a good thing that you're a friend,

590
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,640
not a foe.

591
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,359
Father.

592
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Father.

593
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,039
I want to go to Chang'an too.

594
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,759
Even a fake princess like Chang Ge can go.

595
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,599
Why can't a real princess like me go?

596
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,359
You're eavesdropping on us by the door again.

597
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,440
I was just passing by.

598
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,720
Then I heard Chang Ge mention...

599
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,279
that she's going as a princess.

600
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,920
Father.

601
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,599
- You can't go. - You know this.

602
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,400
I've always wanted to go to Chang'an.

603
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
No.

604
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,200
Father, this is a rare opportunity.

605
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,599
If I have such a troublesome daughter,

606
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,759
I would have sent her away as far as I could.

607
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
You...

608
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,640
Since Her Highness is a very active girl,

609
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,200
if you won't let her go,

610
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,839
she'll surely find every possible way to go.

611
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,599
She should just come with me.

612
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,680
That's easy for you to say.

613
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,599
What if something happens to my precious daughter?

614
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,960
I have Chang Ge and Ashina Sun.

615
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,519
If anything happens to me,

616
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,759
you can hold Chang Ge accountable.

617
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,920
Father.

618
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,039
I'm telling you.

619
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,039
Tu Jia is my one and only precious daughter.

620
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,599
All right.

621
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,079
Chang Ge will keep me safe, right?

622
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
For this trip to Chang'an,

623
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,920
please proceed with caution...

624
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,599
and form the alliance successfully.

625
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,039
I surely won't let you down.

626
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,839
I'll see you off here.

627
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,279
Have a safe trip.

628
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,640
Ashina Sun, have you been to Chang'an?

629
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,240
This is my first trip to Chang'an.

630
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,640
From what I heard, Chang'an is huge and beautiful,

631
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,839
and there's plenty of delicious food.

632
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,839
You'll never know what will happen in our trip to Chang'an.

633
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,400
Are you ready?

634
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,119
Back then in Liuyun Abbey,

635
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,240
Abbess told me to do what my heart tells me,

636
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,720
then just suffer the consequences.

637
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,039
If I just want to seek safety and avoid calamity...

638
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,720
and back out in the face of difficulty,

639
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,000
I wouldn't be who I am today.

640
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,799
No matter what happens, I'll have no fear or regrets.

641
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,759
Also, I have you, right?

642
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,359
You're right.

643
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,440
Come on.

644
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,519
I'll go and get a few people to come and help.

645
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,599
All right.

646
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:15,809
- Come on. - Here.

647
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,719
Check everyone coming and going.

648
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Do not miss anyone.

649
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Do you understand?

650
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,159
- Yes. - Yes.

651
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,809
Is Great Khan's meal ready?

652
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:12,840
Yes, it is ready.

653
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,559
Did you add enough ingredients?

654
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,519
I did.

655
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,599
Khatun provided instructions.

656
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,119
She's afraid that Great Khan won't feel full.

657
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,440
Please ask Khatun not to worry.

658
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,119
Great Khan surely won't be disappointed.

659
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:48,239
(May blessings abound)

660
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
You may go.

661
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Yes.

662
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,079
Your Highness.

663
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,119
Northern and Southern Deserts already sent envoys...

664
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,199
to head to Chang'an and discuss the alliance.

665
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,239
The leader is no other...

666
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,480
than Li Chang Ge.

667
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,809
No matter where Li Chang Ge goes,

668
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:24,599
she can establish herself.

669
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,480
We have quite a few men in Chang'an.

670
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,440
We'll just await your instructions.

671
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,289
Do you plan to kill her?

672
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,679
Tang and Great Desert's alliance will happen for sure.

673
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,159
Killing Li Chang Ge...

674
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,880
won't be useful.

675
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:41,639
Your Highness, you mean...

676
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,559
Since Great Desert is going to form an alliance with Tang,

677
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,039
I should also...

678
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,199
show my sincerity in cooperating with them.

679
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,239
Your Highness, you can't.

680
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:54,329
I know what you're worried about.

681
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,599
But now,

682
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,719
I'm not that girl in the carriage...

683
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,639
who couldn't do anything but cry anymore.

684
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,199
I'm very looking forward...

685
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,440
to going to Chang'an.

686
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,769
Since you're going,

687
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,039
I'll go with you.

688
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:09,289
No.

689
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,329
I still need you to guard Dingxiang for me.

690
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,440
When did you...

691
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,519
start following me?

692
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:20,159
Was it at Daxing Palace...

693
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,039
or when I got married?

694
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,679
In the 18th year of the Kaihuang Era,

695
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,769
I became a guard in Daxing Palace.

696
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,400
On your second year, you came to the grasslands with me.

697
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,239
I have married four husbands.

698
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,199
But in the end,

699
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:39,440
you're the one who has always been by my side.

700
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,329
In other words,

701
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,159
I'm also the one who's always with you.

702
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,400
In these huge grasslands,

703
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,809
you're the only one...

704
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,480
I can trust.

705
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,769
On behalf of Your Highness,

706
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,480
I'll surely guard Dingxiang well.

707
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,639
There you are.

708
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,039
I personally made some food for you.

709
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,809
Mother.

710
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,239
What's the matter?

711
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,719
You can't sleep?

712
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,840
Do you miss the grasslands?

713
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,000
It's late.

714
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,079
Mother, get some rest too.

715
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,679
Wait.

716
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,039
I want to talk to you.

717
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,809
Try it.

718
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,809
I know...

719
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,809
that you have a lot of questions in your mind.

720
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,440
And you feel like...

721
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,559
some things happened too suddenly.

722
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,519
I only want to ask you.

723
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,960
All these years,

724
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,440
have you ever thought of breaking away...

725
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,079
from your uncle's shackles...

726
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,239
and being able to see me every day?

727
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Yes.

728
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,840
When I was young, whenever I got hurt...

729
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,159
or punished,

730
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,679
I wanted to go to you the most and seek solace.

731
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,039
But I wouldn't dare and I couldn't.

732
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,880
I can only nurse my wounds myself.

733
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Mother.

734
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,199
I'm not quite used to this.

735
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,289
I understand.

736
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,119
All these years,

737
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,329
you grew up all by yourself.

738
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,559
You're already used...

739
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,519
to life without me.

740
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:19,880
No.

741
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,840
Now, we've reunited...

742
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,289
at last.

743
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Are you happy?

744
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,719
Yes.

745
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,719
Dingxiang is my hometown.

746
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,360
Here,

747
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,840
I have too many memories...

748
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:39,769
as well as regrets.

749
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,519
I hope that while I'm alive,

750
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,769
I can make up for some things as much as I can.

751
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:50,119
Are you willing to stay beside me?

752
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,480
Everything I do...

753
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,769
is for you.

754
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,559
I know.

755
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,559
All right.

756
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:02,769
You should get some rest too.

757
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,920
I should go.

758
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,239
I still have to go to Chang'an.

759
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,519
Chang'an?

760
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,400
Why would you go to Chang'an?

761
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,920
To finish what I started.

762
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,679
Mother.

763
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,440
I'll go with you to Chang'an.

764
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,880
Stop.

765
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,809
I didn't know that Chang'an would be so lively.

766
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,039
This is so much more fun than Southern and Northern Deserts.

767
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:12,000
Ashina Sun, Chang Ge.

768
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,239
I'll go and buy something.

769
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,000
Miss, look at this candy figure.

770
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,599
It's two pennies each.

771
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,039
I still came back here.

772
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,239
The place remained the same, but everything else has changed.

773
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,769
The past can only remain in my memory.

774
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:35,079
Mother, how are you?

775
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,400
You've returned to your sad place.

776
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:40,769
I'm sorry about that.

777
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:43,679
I'm fine.

778
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,809
I just feel a bit nostalgic.

779
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,960
As soon as this matter is over,

780
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,920
I'll take you out of here.

781
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,519
Coming back this time,

782
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,920
it feels like everything happened ages ago.

783
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,679
Life...

784
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,289
is really unpredictable.

785
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,329
I tried so hard to run away back then.

786
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:10,920
Now, I threw caution to the wind and came back again.

787
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:12,559
Ashina Sun.

788
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,559
Don't you think people are very fickle?

789
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,920
You ran away back then in order to live.

790
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:20,440
Now, you came back,

791
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,920
so that more people can live.

792
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Chang Ge.

793
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,289
You didn't do anything wrong.

794
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,639
If everyone is living in misery and suffering from the conflicts of war,

795
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,480
how can I live an ignoble existence?

796
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,360
Saving others is also the same as saving myself.

797
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:42,320
Don't worry.

798
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,639
I'll surely keep you safe.

799
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:48,320
I'm the princess of Northern Desert now.

800
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,199
Who would dare to harm me?

801
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,480
That makes sense.

802
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,119
With a guard like me here,

803
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,119
I'm afraid the one who tries to offend you...

804
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,480
would be doomed.

805
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,280
(The Long Ballad)
