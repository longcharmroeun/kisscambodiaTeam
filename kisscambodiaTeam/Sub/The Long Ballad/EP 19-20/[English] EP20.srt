00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,180

Turn west a few times.

33
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:04,139

39
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,179
What Leyan?

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,220
I don't know her.

41
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,940
It's urgent now.

42
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,460
Look carefully.

43
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,259
It's an official token.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,419
Leyan is the daughter of his Majesty.

45
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:46,860
What?

46
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,539
If anything's wrong with Noble Princess Yongan Li Leyan,

47

you can't afford it, can you?

48
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,740
Is Leyan really a princess?

49
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,259
You've met her?

Listen, the officers searched for her everywhere,

53
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,740
but failed at last.

54
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,580

I'll call magistrate of Yunzhou right now.

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,820

59
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,539

Do you know where she's gone?

62
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,860
The court is immigrating people on the frontier.

63
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:27,259
She followed them to Luoyang.

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,899

77
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:43,979

and stay up late to embroider.

82

who are selling wool and cloths around here?

94
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:39,820
Just a few.

95

There're some stores ahead.

96
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,899
They're together.

97
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:44,179
I don't mean stores.

98
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,820
It's a girl with a basket on her back selling cloths.

99
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,500
She was here yesterday.

100
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,739
I know her.

101
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,339
A girl selling cloths stole a pouch

102
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,980
and was caught by the owner.

103

You're here for the princess too, right?

115
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,019

If you go after him right now, you can meet him definitely.

121
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:12,299
Leyan must have suffered a lot.

122
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,579
I thought I could meet her and give it back to her.

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,260
Why do you have this pouch?

124
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,299
Leyan lost this pouch yesterday.

125
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,100
She said it's a gift from her best friend

126
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,420
then cried for a long time.

127
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,019
We comforted her for a long time.

128

129
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,779
Don't be sad.

130
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,380

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,059
She helped us embroider and made good money.

Why is nobody here?

143
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,140
Go.

144
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:42,980
Why is the stable empty?

145
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:52,859
Where's Sun?

146
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,420
Why is there only you here?

147
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,339
You don't report before going into Sun's tent now, do you?

148
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:58,980
Tell me where he is.

149
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,220
He's gone to Khan's Tent.

150
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,579
Khan's Tent?

151
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,500
You think I'm a 3-year-old kid?

152
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:05,540
He didn't need to go there with a half of the troops.

153
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,339
Every time Great Khan calls in,

154
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,980
he takes away a lot of soldiers.

155
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:10,899
Yanli is paranoid.

156
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,980
How can he allow Sun to take so many soldiers there?

157
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,820
Not to mention they're all elites.

158
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,459
Tell me the truth.

159
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,940
Is anything wrong?

160
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,059
No, nothing happened.

161
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,179
I just put these in order.

162
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,420
I told you nothing happened.

163
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,380
Are all the people from the central plains paranoid like you?

164
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,100

165
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,299
Luo Yi's Tianjie Army stations there.

166
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,059
What's the meaning of these lines?

167
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:43,619
They mean nothing.

168
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,940
Luo Yi's Tianjie Army failed.

169
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,219
How can he fail?

170
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,979
Changge, don't be paranoid.

171
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,580
Luo Yi failed.

172
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,859
The north gate of Tang are widely open.

173
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,780
Then Ashile Tribe will lead a large number of troops and flood in...

174

175
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,700
Changge, what are you going to do?

176
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,260
Changge.

177
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,979
They said you came from Yunzhou.

178
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,020
Where's Changge's coutel?

179
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:39,260
Mimi.

180
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,419

It's cold at night.

182
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,700
Put it on.

183

What happened?

184
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:55,940
Tegin Sun is gone.

185
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:57,619
Changge sneaked out too.

186
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:58,859
Where did they go?

187
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,539
I guess she thought the life here was too hard.

188
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,900
She just ran away while Sun's out.

189
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,140
Changge is not such a person.

190
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:10,219
Just joking.

191
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,419
Don't worry.

192
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,700
She won't suffer with her character.

193
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,340
I can guess where she went.

194
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,859
What do you mean?

195
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,739
She's chasing Sun.

196
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,059
It's due to my inattention.

197
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,739
I forgot to put away the maps in Sun's tent.

198
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:27,380
Get to the point.

199
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,580
The point is the order from Khan's Tent.

200
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,179
Sun has to march to the south.

201
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:33,619
South.

202
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,539
Another attack?

203
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,099
This time is different.

204
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,380
Luo Yi, Jingzhou's general, rebelled and was defeated by Tang.

205
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,419
They lost Jingzhou,

206
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,179
so Great Khan marched to the south.

207
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,780
He has reached the central region of Tang.

208
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
That means...

209
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:01,940
Your Majesty, Yuchi Jingde pays respect to you.

210
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:03,380
Arise.

211
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,659
Mr. Fang, Mr. Du.
[Yuchi Jingde]

212
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,299
General Yuchi.

213
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,619
Give today's military intelligence to General Yuchi.

214
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,739
Ashile Tribe has marched to Jingzhou.

215
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,859
Two forces in Wugong are going to Gaoling.

216
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,340
They can arrive in two days.

217
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,659
How about our reinforcements from other cities?

218
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,940
It's too late.

219
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,260
Tang has just established.

220
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:41,099
You know clearly how many troops we have.

221
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:47,140
I ask all of you here to discuss a consultation.

222
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,140
In your opinion,

223
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:52,580
what's the target of Yanli this time?

224
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,219
We've lost Jingzhou and almost lost Gaoling.

225
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,619
If he continues,

226
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,380
he is targeting at...

227
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,580
He wants Chang'an?

228
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:05,900
Chang'an is the foundation of Tang.

229
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,260
We must defend it.

230
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:12,260
If we can stop him in Gaoling,

231
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,580
we may buy some time for relief troops.

232
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:19,700
Your Highness, let me go to fight in Gaoling.

233
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:21,820
No.

234
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,820
How about making the door wider open for him?

235
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:29,739
Do your Majesty want to

236
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,140
move the decisive battlefield to Jingyang?

237
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,419
They're good at horseback and archery, like direct tactics.

238
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,659
They have invincible cavalry.

239
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,380
Jingyang is encircled by three mountains.

240
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,140
With complicated terrain, it's a natural cover for defense.

241
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,900
We can use its strengths and avoid its drawbacks.

242
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,539
Yuchi Jingde.

243
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:50,539
I'm here.

244
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,179
Now I order you the commander of Jingzhou force.

245
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,020
Go with 50,000 soldiers today.

246
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:59,700
I want you to keep Ashile Tribe at bay and delay it.

247
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:08,140
You can only succeed, not fail.

248
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,619
As Your Highness wish.

249
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,380
Once the war starts,

250
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,859
the counties at the border will suffer a lot.

251
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:26,179
How's the south immigration of northern people?

252
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,099
Your Majesty,

253
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,859
the order has been given.

254
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,099
In a few days,

255
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:33,659
hundreds of groups have been gathered and started off.

256
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:40,460
Instead of winning the war with Ashile Tribe,

257
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:44,179
I'd rather not start it from the very beginning.

258
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:49,419
Tang can't afford the cost.

259
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,820
People can't bear the torment of war.

260
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,380
Let's take a rest.

261
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:19,500
Take a rest.

262
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,580
Okay.

263
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,340
Watch your step.

264
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:23,539
Sit here.

265
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:28,459
Water.

266
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,179
Thank you, mom.

267
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:35,700
Do you have water?

268
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:49,739
It's my cake.

269
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:50,859
Stop.

270
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,099
You stop now.

271
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,380
Hey you.

272
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:55,500
Stop.

273
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,940
Stop now.

274
00:14:59,460 --> 00:14:59,940
Stop...

275
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:00,500
Listen...

276
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,780
I've eaten your cake.

277
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,340
I'll never vomit it for you.

278
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:04,780
It's you again.

279
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,539
The last time I gave a cake to you, you stole my money.

280
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:08,780
Now you steal my cake again.

281
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,380
You...

282
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,219
Are you full?

283
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,820
I have more if you're hungry.

284
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,739
Are...are you a fool?

285
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,859
You know it now.

286
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,340
Liar.

287
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,739
I didn't tell you because I don't want you involved.

288
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,140
I'm a slave of Eagle Division,

289
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,059
but I'm also a part of Tang.

290
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:50,179
In my vein flows the blood of Tang.

291
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,179
How can I be not involved?

292
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
You followed me

293
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,460
because you want to investigate the army itinerary

294
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,299
and send it to Tang court.

295
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,460
Am I right?

296
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,460
Yes.

297
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:05,380
Now it is not in my power.

298
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,340
Even if I stopped Eagle Division,

299
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
you could have other forces.

300
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,180
Even if I stopped you once,

301
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:11,099
you could start war twice.

302
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,660
But if you want me to stay out of it,

303
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,699
it's better to kill me directly.

304
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,339
I said,

305
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:19,660
your life belongs to me.

306
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:21,579
Ashile Sun.

307
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,140
Eagle Division lives a good life in grassland.

308
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,619
Why must you become a part of it?

309
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,540
Later,

310
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:27,619
later.

311
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,339
You won't fight against Tang.

312
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:30,300
Besides Eagle Division,

313
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,939
Great Khan dispatched 100 thousand troops.

314
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,219
This battle can't be stopped.

315
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:36,579
Su Yishe.

316
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:41,459
Take her to Eagle Division.

317
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:43,579
But...

318
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,219
Go back now.

319
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,939
Cut it out.

320
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,819
If you do anything against Tang,

321
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:51,819
I won't forgive you.

322
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,859
Ashile Sun.

323
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:02,219
Don't force me to meet you on the battleground.

324
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Tie her up now.

325
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,420
Take her to Eagle Division.

326
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:11,699
Yes.

327
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,459
Military counselor, I'm sorry.

328
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,459
Go with me.

329
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,660
Don't give me a hard time.

330
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,979
Nuer, Yaro.

331
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,500
My order, speed up.

332
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:22,660
Yes.

333
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,140
Give me that.

334
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,140
I...

335
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:10,900
You? Me?

336
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:12,500
Take it back if you can.

337
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:13,540
Listen,

338
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:14,780
if you have other food,

339
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,140
give me first, remember?

340
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,619
You bastard.

341
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,739
Why didn't you scold him like what you did to me?

342
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:36,859
I...

343
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,619
Useless.

344
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,099
I'm not a disloyal man.

345
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,380
Young boy.

346
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,140
Why are you always acting like an old man?

347
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,939
I say it again.

348
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,339
I'm not a boy.

349
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,500
At least I can protect food in my hand.

350
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,780
Much better than you, wishy-washy.

351
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:08,219
I don't know what you're afraid of?

352
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:09,579
If you're bullied,

353
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:10,579
fight back.

354
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,140
I don't know how to fight.

355
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,540
Bite, kick, grab, scratch, whatever works.

356
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,219
Where are you going?

357
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:24,380
Luoyang.

358
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,979
You?

359
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,579
I...I don't know.

360
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:29,939
Everywhere is okay.

361
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:32,500
Where are your mom and dad?

362
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,380
They...

363
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:40,140
they died early.

364
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,739
I even don't remember how they look like and where they died.

365
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,900
What?

366
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:50,780
Do you want to be my friend?

367
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:51,619
You?

368
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,979
You're not good enough.

369
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,900
It smells good.

370
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,260
Here you are.

371
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,579
You're not happy, are you?

372
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,099
I'm not happy too.

373
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,260
I have to take you back,

374
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,219
so I can't fight with Tegin.

375
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:27,540
A fight is to protect, not to bully.

376
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,380
Su Yishe.

377
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,699
how about untying me?

378
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,540
I'm the same as you guys from Eagle Division.

379
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:39,579
I need to protect my family, friends.

380
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,219
No.

381
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:44,339
I promised Ashile Sun to take you back to Eagle Division.

382
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,979
Don't be so pious.

383
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,699
Listen to me first.

384
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,859
If you untie me,

385
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,060
you can tell him I ran away.

386
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:53,699
You failed to avoid me.

387
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,739
He won't blame you.

388
00:21:58,219 --> 00:21:58,859
Su Yishe.

389
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,619
Su Yishe, consider it carefully.

390
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:02,300
I'm deaf.

391
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,780
You...

392
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,939
You have a really glib tongue.

393
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:06,339
Su Yishe.

394
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,300
I won't listen.

395
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,459
Come here.

396
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,660
No, no, no.

397
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:10,419
Take your hands down.

398
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,060
No, no, no.

399
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,939
Su Yishe, I'm hungry.

400
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,699
Not a word, no.

401
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,099
Su Yishe, I'm hungry.

402
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:19,140
I'm hungry.

403
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,540
Here you are.

404
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,579
How can I eat it with my hands tied?

405
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,819
Untie me.

406
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,180
I'll eat with my hands.

407
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:32,900
No.

408
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,660
Once I untie you,

409
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,380
you must run away.

410
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:37,540
I'm not foolish.

411
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,540
But I'm hungry.

412
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,500
How about me tearing it up and feeding you?

413
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:48,699
In any case, I can't understand your big words.

414
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,660
So don't try to play tricks.

415
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,180
I only know it won't be wrong to follow Tegin Sun's words.

416
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:56,500
Hurry up.

417
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:57,939
Eat it and have a rest.

418
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,020
We have a long way to go tomorrow.

419
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:11,260
I'm sorry, Su Yishe.

420
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,780
I must go back.

421
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,060
Your Majesty.

422
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:23,819
Your Majesty.

423
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:25,020
What's going on?

424
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:28,180
Eagle Division has good military strategies.

425
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:31,739
They distracted Yuchi's troops and deplete them.

426
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,540
They're malicious.

427
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,859
Yuchi's force was exhausted because of their attack.

428
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,859
Their main force seized a chance and went across Jingyang.

429
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,380
They'll arrive at Weishui River at dusk.

430
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:46,859
I heard Eagle Division was good

431
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,219
but didn't expect they are so battle-wise.

432
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:50,900
No wonder Khan Yanli was so bold.

433
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,339
He even sent envoy Shixin Sili here.

434
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,260
He has submitted the paper and is waiting outside.

435
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,739
He sends a messenger now.

436
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:04,140
Does he really want to discuss an issue?

437
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,780
He tries to explore the real condition of Chang'an.

438
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,619
Your Majesty, how should we deal with the envoy's visit?

439
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:21,819
Arrest him.

440
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:50,859
Strange.

441
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,380
Tang didn't fortify at Weishui River, why?

442
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,859
It's just 40 miles to Chang'an.

443
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,859
Even if Li Shimin were a 3-year-old boy,

444
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,500
he should know it's time to beg and run.

445
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,540
I think he just wants to abandon the city and escape,

446
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:05,900
ready to surrender without a fight.

447
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:08,979
We'd better speed up and across the river

448
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,780
before they get prepared.

449
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,900
We can camp outside Chang'an city tomorrow.

450
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:19,060
Sun, what do you think?

451
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:21,939
We've been here.

452
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:24,020
No rush.

453
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,780
Be careful.

454
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,020
Report.

455
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,099
Report.

456
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,020
Khan.

457
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:36,140
Why so panic?

458
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:37,459
Why are you alone?

459
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,420
What happened?

460
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:49,540
Uncle Khan.

461
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,660
Shixin Sili has been detained by Tang.

462
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:53,459
What?

463
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,780
They're trying to seek their doom.

464
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,380
If we can't conquer Chang'an today,

465
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,260
Ashile Tribe would be embarrassed.

466
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,140
The messengers shouldn't be involved in the war.

467
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,579
Tang detained Shixin Sili.

468
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:11,420
Please think about the reason, Father Khan.

469
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,900
My order.

470
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,939
Stop and camp here.

471
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,819
Yes.

472
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,739
Stop and camp here.

473
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,819
Uncle Khan, why did you stop?

474
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,500
It's a trap.

475
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:54,780
Fang Yi.

476
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:17,739
Why is he here?

477
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,420
We've arrived here with a lot of efforts.

478
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,660
Are we retreating now?

479
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:32,540
Father Khan.

480
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,619
We don't know the exact number of Tang forces.

481
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,859
If we attack now, I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

482
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,420
I agree.

483
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,699
I'd like to try it for Uncle Khan.

484
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,260
Maybe we can get it in one hit.

485
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,540
Wolf Division alone can't do that.

486
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:48,420
Sun.

487
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:49,500
Go with him.

488
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,300
Gather troops at once and attack Tang at night.

489
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:56,060
I'd like to see how incredible the Tang army is.

490
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:57,500
Yes.

491
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,300
Changge should have returned to Eagle Division now.

492
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,660
Tegin.

493
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,020
Tegin.

494
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,819
Su Yishe.

495
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,060
Why are you here?

496
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,660
I ruined everything.

497
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,219
Where's Changge?

498
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:27,660
He's fine.

499
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,339
But I fell into his trap by mistake.

500
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:31,619
We just traveled for half a day

501
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:33,060
and I fell into his snare.

502
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,300
He ran away.

503
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,380
Forget it.

504
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,180
Su Yishe.

505
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,500
Take a rest.

506
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,420
Then fight with me.

507
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,579
Yes.

508
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,780
If you do anything against Tang,

509
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,579
I won't forgive you.

510
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,619
Ashile Sun.

511
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:00,619
Don't force me to meet you on the battleground.

512
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,500
Who's that?

513
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:44,459
Princess Yongning.

514
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:00,500
Changge.

515
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,699
It's you.

516
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:06,619
Fang Yi.

517
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,900
Bring her to the tent.

518
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,699
Your Majesty.

519
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,819
Fang Yi.

520
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,380
Go out now.

521
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,140
Yes.

522
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,219
From Hao Du, you've been executed on the plains.

523
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,900
Seeing I'm alive standing here,

524
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,219
you're disappointed.

525
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,339
Since you ran away from Chang'an,

526
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:00,859
I tried my best to find you.

527
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,300
You don't know.

528
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,420
You don't know how I worried about you.

529
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,060
Worried about me at large,

530
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:10,819
getting in your way of ascending the throne.

531
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,020
So you want to find me and kill me at once, right?

532
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,020
I worried that you would do something bad for Tang.

533
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,780
I waited for your news everyday,

534
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,579
but was afraid of bad news.

535
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,699
Hao Du sent a message

536
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,780
saying you died to relieve the crisis of Shuozhou.

537
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:39,979
Do you know how I...

538
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,819
Fine.

539
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:46,979
You're alive, that's fine.

540
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,300
Changge.

541
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,619
You suffered a lot in Shuozhou.

542
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,699
I return what you want.

543
00:31:58,339 --> 00:31:59,660
Don't be hypocritical.

544
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:01,900
Compared to Governor Gongsun,

545
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,420
compared to people in Shuozhou,

546
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:05,260
my suffering means nothing.

547
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:08,939
But you hide in Chang'an in comfort.

548
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:12,260
How much do you know about their pain?

549
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,260
Knowing we lost Shuozhou

550
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,619
and the sacrifice of you and Gongsun Heng,

551
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,459
I lost my sleep too.

552
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:21,140
So why did you abandon Shuozhou?

553
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,020
Why?

554
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,459
I never abandon an inch and anyone of Tang.

555
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:31,219
Shuozhou is located in the border.

556
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,020
We lost Bingzhou and Daizhou,

557
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,900
so couldn't get the news of losing Shuozhou.

558
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,459
When I knew it, it's too late.

559
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,459
Even if you had known it,

560
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:42,300
you wouldn't have made every effort to help.

561
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:44,099
After all, in your eyes,

562
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,300
Shuozhou is only a dispensable borderland.

563
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,260
You're right.

564
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,900
Even if I had known it,

565
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:57,339
I couldn't have deployed lots of troops for it.

566
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,739
So cold-blooded as you are.

567
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,179
I've taught you the truth of strength and weakness,

568
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,219
offense and defense.

569
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,219
Do you still remember?

570
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:07,939
When we're weaker,

571
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,099
we should save power and strive to survive.

572
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:11,579
Now Tang's in its early stage,

573
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,180
our military strength is weak.

574
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,540
Yanli knew it and made full use of it.

575
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,900
So he distracted his forces to attack our frontiers.

576
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,260
When we lose our defense,

577
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,699
he will sweep in.

578
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:23,260
I didn't fall for it,

579
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,219
but Tianjie Army rebelled and then got defeated,

580
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,780
so he exploited this loophole.

581
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,459
What nonsense are you talking about?

582
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:31,699
Now Tang has several times of troops more than Ashile.

583
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:32,780
We have the upper hand.

584
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:34,579
Now you're telling me what saving power and survival?

585
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:50,660
How can it be?

586
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,099
Why is there such a wide gap of strength?

587
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:57,819
There're only 40 thousand troops left in Chang'an.

588
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
All of them have encamped along the Weishui River now.

589
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:08,180
A vast spread of barracks you can see are all empty.

590
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:11,699
There's no Chang'an to rely on.

591
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,139
The army is fake.

592
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,379
The situation of the strong beating the weak is fake.

593
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,899
It's your empty fort strategy.

594
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:23,459
So far,

595
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,820
Ashile Tribe has been bluffed only temporarily.

596
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:27,699
You're insane.

597
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,860
Once the soldiers know they have no backup and waver,

598
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:33,219
it'd be a catastrophe.

599
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:34,139
How can you...

600
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,500
That's why I must be here.

601
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,739
I'll identify myself to stabilize the condition

602
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:41,179
when it's necessary.

603
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,540
But with few force,

604
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,459
how can you resist Ashile Tribe?

605
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,540
How can you save the country?

606
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:51,179
Changge.

607
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,580
I taught you another truth.

608
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,860
You know it's impossible, but you'll still do it.

609
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,540
Even millions of people are holding you back,

610
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:58,939
but you'll still do it.

611
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:02,500
Night attack.

612
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,939
Night attack.

613
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,060
Your Majesty.

614
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,020
Ashile Tribe attacked us suddenly.

615
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,219
Your Majesty.

616
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:18,540
You're still alive.

617
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:22,340
Shuyu, perfect timing.

618
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,260
Send Changge out here now.

619
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,820
Fang Yi, prepare horses.

620
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:28,939
Your Majesty, horses are ready.

621
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,020
We'd guard your Majesty away at once.

622
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:31,899
No.

623
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:34,139
Embattle with me.

624
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,219
Against Ashile cavalry.

625
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,300
You're fighting it yourself.

626
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,300
My order to all forces.

627
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,100
Hold high the dragon flag, light torches.

628
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,459
We must let Ashile troops know I'm here.

629
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,379
Yes.

630
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,939
If the emperor of Tang is captured on the battlefield,

631
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,620
Tang is all over.

632
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:19,540
We're facing an existential crisis.

633
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,419
If we show the weakness and defense,

634
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,260
the truth would be exposed.

635
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:26,139
I must be there.

636
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,020
Only in this way could Ashile Tribe believe

637
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,820
Tang is confident of success.

638
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,179
Don't worry.

639
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,620
I'm always lucky.

640
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,659
Shuyu.

641
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:43,860
You must take Changge to a safe place.

642
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:44,979
Yes.

643
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:16,698
Go.

644
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:17,340
Your Majesty.

645
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,139
Your Majesty.

646
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,300
Your Majesty, please don't go.

647
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,580
Please don't go to war.

648
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,260
Now you two reach a consensus.

649
00:37:27,939 --> 00:37:28,580
Hands off.

650
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,340
Your Majesty.

651
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:30,300
Your Majesty.

652
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,500
At present the situation's still in control.

653
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,100
Please reconsider it and find another way.

654
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,979
I'm the emperor of Tang.

655
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm also a part of Tang.

656
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:46,219
It's my final responsibility to defend the country.

657
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:48,820
It's urgent now.

658
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,739
I must go and fight myself.

659
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,060
Only in this way can I show Tang's prestige, improve morale,

660
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:53,979
and reduce causalities.

661
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,659
I spent half of my life on the battlefield and never feared any battle.

662
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:01,899
Now Yanli's isolated force came here.

663
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:02,979
He must be afraid now.

664
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:06,620
He'll be more terrified when he sees me.

665
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,860
It's all or nothing.

666
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:12,100
Just stay here and see it.

667
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:14,899
Hands off.

668
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,899
Your Majesty.

669
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:18,179
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

670
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,300
Your Majesty.

671
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:28,100
Your Majesty, be careful.

672
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:01,100
Attack.

673
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,860
Fight.

674
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,899
Leave me alone, Wei Shuyu.

675
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:52,620
I won't let you go in any case.

676
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,419
Do you think you can hold me back?

677
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,979
I'll try my best.

678
00:39:58,139 --> 00:39:59,820
I can't put you in danger again.

679
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:01,219
You're ridiculous.

680
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,260
Who on earth put me in danger all the way?

681
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:07,459
You haven't changed at all.

682
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,340
Just like before, you're still a self-righteous playboy.

683
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,739
I know you won't believe me no matter what I say.

684
00:40:14,939 --> 00:40:16,219
But you met his Majesty now,

685
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,860
you know he didn't intend to kill you.

686
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:19,260
We still have time.

687
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,739
Go to Chang'an with me.

688
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:22,820
Enough.

689
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,219
From the day my father was killed,

690
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,419
nothing can return to the past.

691
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:31,860
We can't go back as well.

692
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:34,219
You don't need to tell me that.

693
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,500
I don't need your care.

694
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:38,300
I didn't need it.

695
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:40,780
So is now.

696
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,860
Changge.

697
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:48,100
Changge.

698
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:48,899
It's war out there.

699
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,860
Where are you going?

700
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,540
It's none of your business.

701
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,340
Get off.

702
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:53,939
Go.

703
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:12,860
Look, Khan.

704
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,060
It's Li Shimin.

705
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:15,979
The emperor of Tang came here in person.

706
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,820
It's strange.

707
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:21,620
It can't be...

708
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,739
Hail Tang.

709
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:32,379
Hail Tang.

710
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,939
Hail Tang.

711
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,659
Hail Tang.

712
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,580
Hail Tang.

713
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:39,300
Hail Tang.

714
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:40,979
Hail Tang.

715
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,620
Hail Tang.

716
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,899
You traveled a long way here.

717
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:25,820
Won't you go ahead, Khan?

718
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:26,939
Li Shimin.

719
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,780
Stop your bullying.

720
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:32,300
Who's bullying on earth?

721
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,459
Ashile Tribe and Tang promised each other to be brothers.

722
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,379
You broke the promise first and led an army here.

723
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,860
You treat a brother like this, right?

724
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:47,739
I come here alone only to tell you

725
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,540
I don't like war,

726
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:51,419
but I don't fear it.

727
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:56,219
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers gather on Weishui River shore.

728
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,780
I don't want the blood of soldiers to flow into the river.

729
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,659
I'm much less willing to see the warriors from grassland die here.

730
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:06,300
We're the warriors from grassland.

731
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:09,139
We fight for faith and are not afraid of death.

732
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,899
If you insist to fight,

733
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:13,860
along the Weishui River tonight

734
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,179
we won't withdraw from the battle.

735
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,980
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

736
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,290
♫ gradually revives, ♫

737
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,570
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

738
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,130
♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫

739
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,460
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

740
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:49,610
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

741
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,370
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

742
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,370
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

743
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,980
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

744
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,050
♫ the longing flows. ♫

745
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:07,260
♫ There's always a moment ♫

746
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:12,850
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

747
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,610
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

748
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:23,370
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

749
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,740
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

750
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,089
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

751
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,570
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

752
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,020
♫ layer after layer. ♫

753
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,370
♫ it turns into eternity. ♫

754
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,330
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

755
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,500
♫ There's always a moment ♫

756
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:57,050
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

757
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,660
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

758
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:07,289
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

759
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,849
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

760
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,210
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

761
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:16,690
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

762
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,420
♫ layer after layer. ♫

763
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,569
♫ it turns into eternity. ♫

764
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:27,980
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

765
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,150
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

766
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,280
The Long Ballad
