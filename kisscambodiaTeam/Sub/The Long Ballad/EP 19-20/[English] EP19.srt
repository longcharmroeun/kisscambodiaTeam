00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,999
♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,950
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,919
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,789
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,789
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,839
♫ To the distance. ♫

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,909
♫ The miserable past is like a dagger. ♫

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,719
♫ Though my wings are broken, ♫

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,840
♫ I will keep flying. ♫

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,199
♫ Following the light, ♫

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,359
♫ I'll forget you. ♫

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,159
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness. ♫

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,359
♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night, ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad. ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,269
♫ The river of life is under my feet. ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,760
♫ I don't regret my craziness. ♫

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,819
The Long Ballad

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,700
Episode 19

22
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:52,619
Mu Jin, thank you for
helping me carry water today.

23
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,018
Do you feel better about your foot?

24
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,819
I made some lamb bone soup for
you, do you want to drink it?

25
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:01,779
Mu Jin?

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,260
I'm coming in, may I?

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,260
Mu Jin.

28
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:14,739
Mu Jin.

29
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,898
Mu Jin, what's wrong?

30
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:16,659
Mu Jin.

31
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,179
Are you okay? Wake up!

32
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,380
Gosh.

33
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,538
It's so hot.

34
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,539
No.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,418
Right, alcohol, any alcohol?

36
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,419
Alcohol.

37
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Be careful.

38
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:00,939
Does it work?

39
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,459
Once the fever is brought
down, it would be okay.

40
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,338
I will go to find the witch doctor.

41
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:07,538
I'd take more alcohol.

42
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:08,539
Okay.

43
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,179
You must get better soon!

44
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,699
You can't die.

45
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,139
Why are you here?

46
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,740
You are awake!

47
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,779
Why did you take off all of my clothes?

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,039
The fever is brought down.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,939
Lie down, quickly.

50
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,299
You must be dead if you get the fever again.

51
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,299
Bah bah!

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,099
How can you curse me death?

53
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
You...

54
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:06,939
You stepped on the rusty pin for helping me.

55
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,618
If you die, I...

56
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:12,099
My mom have got the similar experience

57
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,178
of stepping on a rusty pin.

58
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:15,580
Her fever lasted for many days.

59
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,619
When I figured out this method,

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,339
it's too late.

61
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,140
Fortunately, you survived.

62
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,579
Mimi, don't feel sad.

63
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:32,099
I'm very strong. I won't die easily.

64
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,419
I'm one of the warriors from the grasslands.

65
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,049
Your look now is not that persuasive.

66
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,018
Stop flaunting your manhood.

67
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,939
I didn't.

68
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,659
I'm a great man, indeed.

69
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,859
You are if you're alive,
or else you're just a dead man!

70
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,018
So, did you take care of me for the whole night?

71
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:55,019
Of course.

72
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:57,619
Lie down.

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,980
It's a little bit cold.

74
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,018
Why are you laughing?

75
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,179
It's itchy, itchy.

76
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
Go.

77
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,459
Go.

78
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
Stop.

79
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,660
The northwest region is on the
left, much more away from Luoyang.

80
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,099
Her Highness can't be there.

81
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,338
Jizhou is in the middle.

82
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,940
Cangzhou is on the right.

83
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,339
Princess, if you left
Yunzhou, where would you go?

84
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,700
This is from you,
hope it can tell me about your trace.

85
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,260
Jizhou on the front, Cangzhou on the reverse.

86
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:15,899
Go.

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Sun.

88
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,058
Did I tell you to take a good rest?

89
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,659
Why do you come? You're just cured.

90
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,298
I've been recovered long before.

91
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:40,379
Well, our provisions are running out, right?

92
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,019
I want to purchase some with Mimi Guli.

93
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,099
Why? Still suspect her?

94
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,979
Only taking her with you can make you convinced?

95
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,699
No! No!

96
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,058
It's not what I mean!

97
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:00,659
Well, I think this girl is smart.

98
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,379
I can get better bargain with her.

99
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,009
Besides, I want to show my appreciation to her

100
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,480
for taking care of me that day.

101
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,858
Okay.

102
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:14,859
Great.

103
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,819
Look at your lambs, all of them look like you!

104
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,820
They are white!

105
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,120
Mimi.

106
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,020
Wait a minute.

107
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,219
Look, Mu Jin is here again.

108
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,058
Right.

109
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,699
What's wrong?

110
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,119
I want to ask you that if you're willing

111
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,499
to purchase goods in Yunzhou with me?

112
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,618
Me?

113
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,898
Don't be overthinking.

114
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,459
Just because a woman is better
at bargaining than a man.

115
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,979
Although Yunzhou is not comparable to
Changan, it's bustling enough.

116
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,379
You must haven't seen it before.

117
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,139
I will tell Military Counsellor Li later.

118
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,379
Just go with me.

119
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,578
Okay.

120
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,579
See you later!

121
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,139
Changge, what are you embroidering?

122
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,779
It's quite ugly.

123
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,578
This is the only pattern I'm able to embroider.

124
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:27,458
If you don't like it,
just use the package.

125
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,458
Yes!

126
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,139
I like it.

127
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,338
Who said she didn't like?

128
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,500
Go on.

129
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:39,019
This money bag is indeed ugly.

130
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,619
It's not, it looks good.

131
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:47,218
What's wrong?

132
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,459
Are you okay?

133
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,218
Yes.

134
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:51,738
I didn't mean that.

135
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,020
Anyone who said it's ugly shows no appreciation.

136
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,780
You said it, too.

137
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,459
I think each one you embroider is pretty.

138
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,538
Changge, how about telling
me something interesting

139
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,339
or delicious in the markets
of the central plain?

140
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,218
Or tell me what do you want? I will buy for you.

141
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,260
Do you have money?

142
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,939
I can borrow from Mu Jin.

143
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,538
I can be his servant for
some days as the payment.

144
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,379
I don't allow you to be the servant of others.

145
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,618
Changge, you like rabbits very much, do you?

146
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,339
I liked them.

147
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
What about now?

148
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,019
[Rabbit.]

149
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
It's done.

150
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,899
Here.

151
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,699
Is this for me?

152
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,499
I've got some payment as military counsellor.

153
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,019
Just buy anything you want.

154
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,180
No need to save money for me.

155
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:16,619
I haven't been treated so well for so long.

156
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,658
Thank you, Changge.

157
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,619
I will buy anything you want for you.

158
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,178
When you arrive in Yunzhou,
it woulld be the Mid-autumn Festival.

159
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,119
In my hometown, we'd eat moon cakes

160
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,779
and stay with our family in this festival.

161
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,819
Besides, we'd light the sky lanterns as well.

162
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,618
There is no mooncake in the grasslands.

163
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,780
You may taste it in Yunzhou.

164
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:41,299
Are you homesick?

165
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:49,299
Be assured, I'd definitely
buy many mooncakes for you.

166
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,978
The stitch is not tight enough.

167
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:11,899
It's still the problem of the warping.

168
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,260
Lack of practice.

169
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,819
This is a completed fabric.

170
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,859
Send it to the cloth shop, they must be happy.

171
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,058
Bad news!

172
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,279
The purchasing manager said that

173
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,499
due to the constant heavy
rain and their dead stock,

174
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,199
so they wanted withdraw this cloth order.

175
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,178
We tried every method to persuade
but
they insisted on cancelling the order.

176
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:51,179
Luckily, they didn't ask
for the front moeny back.

177
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,120
- What should we do?
- Right.

178
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,260
The front money is useless.

179
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,500
It seems that we might suffer a heavy loss.

180
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,380
Ms. Chai, I've got an idea.

181
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:11,580
We can take our cloth products
to the market for selling.

182
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,139
This idea is practical.

183
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,819
Right.

184
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,979
It's a good idea.

185
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:18,738
Okay.

186
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,649
Let's follow Yan's advice and
sell the cloth at the market.

187
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,499
Get ready now, let's go to sell our cloth.

188
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

189
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,579
Hurry.

190
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,259
Be careful.

191
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,339
Okay.

192
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,459
This is good.

193
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,859
Right, let's come again later.

194
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
Waiter.

195
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Waiter!

196
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,298
How many days does it take to Cangzhou?

197
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,658
Sir, it isn't far away.

198
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,939
It would take one or two days if you speed up.

199
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
Thank you.

200
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,700
What a coincidence.

201
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:08,900
What's wrong? Got ill?

202
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,459
Not serious.

203
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,098
I was caught in a rain and got a cold.

204
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:17,058
You must take care,

205
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,700
or else you may get worse
before finding the princess.

206
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,618
It's nothing comparing to Leyan's safety.

207
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:27,819
Don't worry, I can stick it out.

208
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,858
Let's deal with her Highness's business later.

209
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:33,098
His Majesty has decreed to call
you back to Changao for reporting.

210
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,259
You will be appointed as Supervisory Censor.

211
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,819
What?

212
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,979
How do you know?

213
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,379
It's no doubt that I always keep in
contact
with the people in Changan.

214
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,098
But...

215
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:42,699
Stop it.

216
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,738
Do you want to resist the decree of his Majesty?

217
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:48,619
Leyan hasn't been found, how can I just leave?

218
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:53,579
I hope to atone for my fault.

219
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,499
I won't shrink from my responsibility.

220
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,940
I must find Leyan back.

221
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,579
Look at your current condition.

222
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,418
If you don't get treatment in time,

223
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,699
you can hardly see her Highness in the future,

224
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,978
not to mention working for his Majesty.

225
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,500
You should think twice which
one is the most important.

226
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,140
I can go back to report.

227
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,939
However, Hao,
Leyan is just like my sister.

228
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,618
Please remember...

229
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:23,900
I will try my best.

230
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,539
Boss, do you really think this
kerchief can sell well in Cangzhou?

231
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,849
Yunzhou is famous for handicraft industry.

232
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,978
Most of the people there are weavers.

233
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,459
What about Cangzhou?

234
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:15,098
Look, this delicate skill and
stitch looks like royal style.

235
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:20,178
If we bring this to Cangzhou,
the royal ladies must treasure it!

236
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,049
Look, I embroidered a rabbit.

237
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,459
Other people always embroider
the rabbit's eyes in red

238
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,098
but I embroidered it in green.

239
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:32,939
Because there are meadows in the rabbit's
eyes, that means freedom.

240
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,700
I think the girl who embroidered
this must be sophisticate.

241
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,538
What are you doing?

242
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,939
Where is this kerchief from?

243
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,058
Do you want to be my competitor?

244
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:44,259
I'm not interested in the business.

245
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,379
I'm asking you again.

246
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,499
Where did you get the kerchief?

247
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,858
I've been a merchant for decades
but never been afraid of threat.

248
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:56,260
Let me tell you,
a business man only cares about profit.

249
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,899
Is this enough?

250
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Boss?

251
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,399
Weaving workshop of western suburb in Yunzhou,

252
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,098
It's made by a young lady.

253
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,619
Your Highness, it turns out
that you are still in Yunzhou.

254
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,020
I'm too careless.

255
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
He left so quickly!

256
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,049
Today is the Mid-autumn Festival,

257
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,779
a festival for families to gather together.

258
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,940
However,
I have something sad to tell you.

259
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:27,779
What's that?

260
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,019
Actually, it can't be called as a sad story.

261
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,978
It's a good news.

262
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:37,418
Because of the military havoc,
the government notes door to door

263
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,939
that if anyone in the border
who
wants to go back to the central plain

264
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,618
can go with their army to the south.

265
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:45,460
At that time, a new identity will be registered.

266
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,339
It's said that they also distributes lands.

267
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,339
Really?

268
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,819
That means I can go back home!

269
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,418
Perfect!

270
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,738
We have the fate to meet each other,

271
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:58,779
how about we selling Ms.
Chai's cloth before we leave?

272
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,779
Okay.

273
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
Of course!

274
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:06,499
Whatever, the weaving workshop of
western suburb is always our home.

275
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,739
It will be here forever.

276
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,299
Okay, go to sell the cloth now.

277
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,259
Nobody can go if she sells even a penny less.

278
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,540
- Yes.
- Okay.

279
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:18,938
Let's go.

280
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:21,379
- Yan
- Here.

281
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,858
- This one.
- Yan.

282
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,059
Just stay, you're homeless.

283
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,618
I won't make you hungry once I've got any food.

284
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:30,739
Thank you, Ms. Chai.

285
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,338
Ms. Chai, may I ask where is
the troop to the south going?

286
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,099
They will go straight to the south.

287
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,779
I think they may pass by many places.

288
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,618
Will they go to Luoyang?

289
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,938
Do you want to go to Luoyang?

290
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:50,060
One of my houses is located in Luoyang.

291
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,338
Ms. Chai, please let me go with
them to sell the cloth for you.

292
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,059
I want to pay your favor back as much as I can.

293
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,978
Don't you worry about the
manhunt of local authority?

294
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,858
I think it is fine.

295
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:06,859
Didn't you say that no one
is asking about me now?

296
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,218
Okay.

297
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:10,659
Go with them.

298
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,380
It's good to get more experience.

299
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:15,699
Here.

300
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,339
Go.

301
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Go.

302
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,218
Here.

303
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,698
Thank you, mom.

304
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,699
Good.

305
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:37,939
Come here.

306
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,220
[Yunzhou.]

307
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Let's go.

308
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:54,859
Let's go.

309
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,818
I bet you'd like here.

310
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:15,819
There!

311
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
There're more!

312
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:23,979
Looks nice!

313
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,180
How much is it?

314
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,618
Hurry, hurry up!

315
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,619
Coming!

316
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,338
Taste this, is it yummy?

317
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:39,339
Yes.

318
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:43,419
Mimi, how is it?

319
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,179
Did you enjoy it?

320
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,679
Should we go purchasing now?

321
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,779
Don't rush.

322
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,849
This is my first time to see
so many people and goods!

323
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,698
What's more, they look so happy!

324
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:52,978
Today is the Mid-autumn Festival.

325
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:54,609
Of course it is bustling.

326
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,640
Mid-autumn Festival?

327
00:19:57,219 --> 00:20:00,299
The Mid-autumn Festival is also
called as the festival of moon.

328
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,199
Every year, the people in the central plain

329
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,059
gather together to appreciate
the moon on this day.

330
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,639
And...

331
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,098
Eat the mooncake.

332
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,299
How do you know?

333
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,979
Do you think you're the only
one who is knowledgable?

334
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,938
Mimi.

335
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:15,659
Mimi.

336
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,219
Did I say anything wrong?

337
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,618
No.

338
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,819
So the Mid-autumn Festival
should be spent with family?

339
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,899
Actually, it's not that interesting.

340
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,938
Just see the moon with the family members.

341
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:30,219
Nothing special.

342
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,499
Look there!

343
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Let's go!

344
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,379
Candid haws on sell!

345
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,319
This cloth looks good.

346
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,419
Mimi, look.

347
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,699
It's suitable for you.

348
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,969
Come on!

349
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,139
This color?

350
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,420
I think it's more like auntie Su Yili's style.

351
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,578
How about this?

352
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:57,818
This color is special.

353
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:00,458
This is suitable for Su Yishe.

354
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,539
Let's go.

355
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Lady.

356
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,458
Look, lady.

357
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:09,179
Do you like this pattern?

358
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,919
Unfortunately,
the cloth with embroidery was sold out,

359
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,458
if not, you must look great in that pattern.

360
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:15,899
You should show this earlier.

361
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,979
This is really good.

362
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,218
Today is a festival, I want to buy it as a gift.

363
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:23,479
Today is the Mid-autumn Festival.

364
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,379
If you like,
you can pick more for your family.

365
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,420
They must feel happy to see it.

366
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,059
No need.

367
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,259
Lady.

368
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,738
Did I say anything wrong?

369
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,139
Don't badger with me.

370
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,938
I won't buy.

371
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:40,818
Lady.

372
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:42,569
I didn't mean to let you buy my cloth.

373
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,240
When I mentioned about your family, you...

374
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:51,739
Mimi.

375
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:53,739
Get away from me.

376
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,259
That girl said without thinking just now.

377
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,339
Don't mind it.

378
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,780
You shouldn't talk about it, either.

379
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:19,699
Well, I've got bad temper just now.

380
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:21,859
I'm sorry.

381
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:24,818
No need to say sorry.

382
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:26,500
It's fine once you feel happy.

383
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,060
Shall we go on shopping?

384
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,738
Do you want to eat this?

385
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,339
- Yes.
- Sachet, come and have a look.

386
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,140
Be careful to hold it.

387
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:42,899
Mooncake.

388
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,698
Mooncake on sell.

389
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:45,098
This looks tasty.

390
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,499
How about I buying you one?

391
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,338
As my apology.

392
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,019
Okay, I accept that.

393
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,059
Mooncakes.

394
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,818
Mooncakes on sell.

395
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:54,779
Hello.

396
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,059
How much for a mooncake?

397
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,338
Three coins for five, reasonable price.

398
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:00,098
Okay.

399
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:01,260
They're all just ready.

400
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:07,499
What's wrong?

401
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,979
Do you keep Changge's money bag?

402
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,140
No.

403
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,419
I don't keep it.

404
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,259
No good.

405
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,818
It seems I've lost Changge's money bag.

406
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,779
Just lost some money, I've got enough.

407
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,259
It's not a matter of money.

408
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,818
This is a money bag made by Changge.

409
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,139
Just a bag.

410
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,578
I will buy ten for her later.

411
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,338
She won't blame you.

412
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,139
No.

413
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,218
I can never lose the gift from Changge!

414
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:31,539
I have to find it back!

415
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,858
I'll go back now.

416
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:33,618
Mimi.

417
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,419
Mimi.

418
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,419
Where are you going?

419
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,859
Don't be anxious.

420
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,899
Let's recall which stalls we've been to.

421
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,499
You might leave it behind
in one of those stalls.

422
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,259
Right.

423
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,578
Trust me, I'll help you find it out.

424
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:45,059
You can look for it in this market.

425
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,779
I will go back to the previous
stalls to have a look.

426
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,179
Let's meet here later.

427
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,260
Okay, go now.

428
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,060
The stalls just now.

429
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,738
One hundred and sixty-one.

430
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,338
One hundred and sixty-two.

431
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,459
One hundred and sixty-three.

432
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:08,020
Finally I can pay Ms.
Chai's favor back this time.

433
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,439
But I feel so sorry for that lady.

434
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,019
She might think of something
grievous by my words.

435
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,210
I should apologize to her
if I can see her again.

436
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,818
Don't move!

437
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:34,900
You're back.

438
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,379
Certainly I should.

439
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,539
I knew it!

440
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,139
Lady, you must like this cloth.

441
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,359
Let me give you this as a gift for apology.

442
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,900
What? Do you want to end this
by giving me a roll of cloth?

443
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:49,259
What do you think?

444
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,419
I certainly want you return me
the money bag you've stolen.

445
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,619
What are you doing?

446
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,779
This is my bag!

447
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,619
How could it be yours!

448
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,618
What a coincidence?

449
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:59,539
This is exactly the same as the one I lost.

450
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,699
Even the ugly rabbit on it is the same.

451
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,458
Give it back to me!

452
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:07,219
You must recognize it
wrongly, this is really mine.

453
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,858
Thief!

454
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:11,299
You stole my bag but deny it!

455
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,419
- How dare you grab it?
- Give it to me.

456
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,339
What are you doing?

457
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,139
I said it was my money bag,
how can you behave so rudely?

458
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,458
I..

459
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,459
Unreasonable.

460
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,779
I didn't!

461
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,458
I discussed with you in nice manner and tone.

462
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,019
But you refused to return it to me.

463
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,019
Give it back to me,
or else I'd take it by myself.

464
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,499
You're so unreasonable.

465
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,338
Fine.

466
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:36,569
You want to be reasonable, right?

467
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,699
Tell me, can you prove
this is your money bag?

468
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,799
There is one hundred and
sixty-three coins in the bag.

469
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,659
I earned it by selling the cloth roll by roll.

470
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,899
The bag is at your hand,
of course you know how many coins in it.

471
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,779
Fine.

472
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,719
Show me your proof if you think this is yours.

473
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,919
This rabbit.

474
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,139
I used the ugly but cute
colors of white and green.

475
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,379
Besides, the stitch has been
repeatedly removed and sewed.

476
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,499
The most important is,

477
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,099
there is a twisted character
of "rabbit" sewed in the bag.

478
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,520
[Rabbit]

479
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,899
How do you know that?

480
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,500
This is my money bag!

481
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,259
See? I'm telling the truth.

482
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,818
Really.

483
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,779
See?

484
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,539
This thief stole my bag but said it was hers.

485
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,858
She's a liar!

486
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:33,499
Listen, I won't take
any one of your coin.

487
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,139
I'm in a hurry today,
or else I would not let you go.

488
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,379
Thief!

489
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,458
Stop there!

490
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:41,899
Shame on her.

491
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,098
How could she steal from others?

492
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:44,499
Right.

493
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,379
Let's go.

494
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,380
What a bad girl.

495
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,459
What happened?

496
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:19,618
Forget it.

497
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,539
If you didn't sell it well, it's okay.

498
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,698
This is your first time to sell at the market,

499
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:26,818
you must be shy to cry your wares.

500
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:30,419
If you sincerely want to go to
Luoyang, I won't deduct your money.

501
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
It's okay.

502
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:43,019
You earned so much money!

503
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,858
Leyan, you're amazing!

504
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,459
I looked down upon you.

505
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,780
Leyan, have you decided to go back to Luoyang?

506
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,090
Give me your hand.

507
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,659
Take this money.

508
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,779
You need lots of money on you way.

509
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,578
Don't tell them.

510
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:05,299
I will pay you all wages later.

511
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,499
This is my secret reward to you.

512
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,020
This is our fate.

513
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,098
But there would be hardness
and evil conditions on the way.

514
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,338
It won't be as cosy as Yunzhou.

515
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:17,738
Can you stand it?

516
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:21,818
I had never gone out of my home alone before.

517
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:24,139
Even though I were driven out

518
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,459
I would not be able to know how to go back home.

519
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,698
But now I've learned a lot
from you and the ladies.

520
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:35,738
I can even sell the cloth at the market.

521
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:36,739
I think...

522
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:40,339
I can find the way back home.

523
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,500
I will never forget you.

524
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,040
Okay, okay.

525
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:05,179
Mimi.

526
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,618
I found it!

527
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,899
How can you be so careless?

528
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,299
You left it in the previous shop.

529
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,858
Check it.

530
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:10,859
Anything missed?

531
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Well...

532
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:19,039
Oh no.

533
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,698
This is embroidered by Changge.

534
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:22,299
So the thief just now...

535
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,858
What thief?

536
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:24,859
The girl...

537
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,938
Mimi, where are you going?

538
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:29,979
The market is off.
The gate of the city is closing.

539
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,179
We made some money these days.

540
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,459
I will distribute the
money to each of you.

541
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:44,979
Now that you've decided to leave,
we should say goodbye in harmony.

542
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,219
In a word,
hope you all be safe and sound.

543
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,218
There are some flapjacks in the kitchen.

544
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:54,338
Take some with you.

545
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:56,338
When you leave Yunzhou,

546
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:58,540
it would be hard to eat
something warm on the way.

547
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:01,979
Here.

548
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,938
I'm worried about you the most!

549
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,939
You've been here just for a few days,
learning only some brief skills.

550
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:15,618
But at least you've got a
craftsmanship for living.

551
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:20,099
You should be diligent on your
way so that you can survive.

552
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,699
Why are you crying?

553
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:29,219
Everyone has its destiny.

554
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,739
I'm still here to weave.

555
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,419
Everybody, promise me you will live a good life.

556
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,060
Someday we might meet each other in the future.

557
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:46,259
Come on.

558
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,978
Go and pack up.

559
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,738
Go with the troop before
the city gate is closed.

560
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:52,739
Go and pack up.

561
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:58,619
Go.

562
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,019
Mimi, it's getting dark,
who are you looking for?

563
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,059
No.

564
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,779
She's left.

565
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,858
The girl who sells the cloth,
this money bag is really hers.

566
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:23,380
I grabbed it from her just now.

567
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,179
Look, although the bags are nearly the
same, one is brand new,

568
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,139
the other has been used for some time.

569
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,458
Maybe they are both made by Changge.

570
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:36,139
The only difference is the
time Changge embroidered it.

571
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,698
They are exactly the same.

572
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:40,019
How could it be such a coincident.

573
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,218
I don't know it, either.

574
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:43,978
Maybe only Changge knows the true story.

575
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:45,900
Let's go back and ask her.

576
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,899
I've blamed you frequently these days,

577
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,578
but that is for helping
you to improve your skill.

578
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:57,699
Don't be mad at me.

579
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,179
Remember to follow them closely later.

580
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,098
The weather is cold,

581
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:11,059
remember to put on more
clothes in case having a cold.

582
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,619
Ms. Chai, are you sure you won't go with us?

583
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,659
All generations of my family live in Yunzhou.

584
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,699
This is my home.

585
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,858
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

586
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,419
Leyan can't give you anything else

587
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:31,499
but a bag made by myself as a souvenir.

588
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,260
Come on, time to go!

589
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:38,698
When you meet with a trouble
alone, don't be anxious or scared.

590
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,698
Learn to ask for help if necessary.

591
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:42,818
Just stay away from the danger.

592
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:44,219
Don't get injured.

593
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:48,180
I believe that you can protect yourself well.

594
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,858
By the way,
I packed many flapjacks in your bag.

595
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:53,818
You can eat them for a long while.

596
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:55,978
Don't let them see it.

597
00:32:55,979 --> 00:32:57,858
The gate is closing.

598
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:58,859
Go.

599
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,459
Ms. Chai, take care.

600
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:05,579
Stand up.

601
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:07,979
Be careful on the way.

602
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
[Yunzhou]

603
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,859
We can't go out?

604
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,260
Let's go back tomorrow.

605
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,978
It's all my fault.

606
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:28,059
I lost the bag so we are late.

607
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,620
It's impossible for us to go
back to Eagle Division today.

608
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,729
It's not a big deal.

609
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,489
Every year I purchase in the border market,

610
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,649
I'd stay for one or two nights.

611
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,249
Nobody would worry about this.

612
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,729
What should we do tonight?

613
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,519
Go with me.

614
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,750
Brother Mu Jin will take you
to live in the post house.

615
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,410
I...

616
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,770
Wait me.

617
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,010
I've asked Mu Jin to buy
the cloth and herb we need.

618
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,810
[August 15th of lunar calendar.]

619
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,009
What's wrong?

620
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,319
Today is August 15th of lunar calendar.

621
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,560
Right, the winter is coming.

622
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,359
August 15th of lunar calendar,

623
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,520
it is the Mid-autumn Festival
of your hometown, right?

624
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,849
I heard that in the central plain,

625
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,769
people would appreciate the moon and lights,

626
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,079
and eat mooncakes every Mid-autumn Festival.

627
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,840
Can Ms. Su Yili make moon cakes?

628
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,839
I will let her have a try.

629
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
No need to bother.

630
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,010
The meaning of this festival is not about these.

631
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:50,389
Once the home and the family is with you,

632
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,990
it can be called as Mid-autumn Festival.

633
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:58,568
Tegin Sun, if you have no
more command I'm leaving now.

634
00:35:58,569 --> 00:35:59,569
Wait.

635
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:02,889
I've got something for you.

636
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:10,609
Here you are.

637
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,490
How can this stone shine?

638
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:23,129
Look at the light.

639
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,170
Is it like the glowworm we saw that night?

640
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,839
Why do you give this to me?

641
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,839
I just want to tell you

642
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,449
that once you sincerely
pursue the beautiful things,

643
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,870
they can surely be saved.

644
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:40,369
Likewise,

645
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,449
the place with family is home

646
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,170
while the place makes you feel
secure can be called as home as well.

647
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,120
There is also happy reunion in the grasslands.

648
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,840
Actually, I hope peace and happiness

649
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,320
would last forever both in the
grasslands and the central plain.

650
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,650
Hope there will be no more war.

651
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,449
Thanks for your gift, Tegin Sun.

652
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,450
Goodbye.

653
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,770
Mimi.

654
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,279
You scared me.

655
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,319
Haven't you gone to bed?

656
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,559
What are you doing here?

657
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,879
I'm watching them spend the festival here.

658
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,689
The boy over there held a pile of moon
cakes, staying with his family.

659
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,930
They are happy and harmonious.

660
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:54,328
Try it.

661
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:55,769
Where did you buy it?

662
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,729
When I searched the money bag for you,

663
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,799
the mooncake stall hasn't been off.

664
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,190
And you were not back, so I bought one there.

665
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,599
Have a taste, it's still warm.

666
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,409
It's been a long time,
how could it be still warm?

667
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,520
I kept it in my arms, warming it by my body.

668
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,128
How is it?

669
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:21,929
It tastes good.

670
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,569
How about having a taste as well?

671
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,929
Don't tear it.

672
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,249
Mooncakes should look like the moon,

673
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,089
if you tear it up,
the meaning of reunion would be ruined.

674
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,039
Really?

675
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,359
Absolutely.

676
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,840
The is the local custom.

677
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,450
Well...

678
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,880
It tastes just so so,
and may hurt my teeth.

679
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,170
Anyway, I think it tastes good.

680
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,880
Let me take one more bite,
I didn't get the flavor.

681
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
How is it?

682
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Very tasty.

683
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,450
Great.

684
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,369
♫ You're in my sight. ♫

685
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,709
♫ My heartbeat is fast. ♫

686
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,570
♫ Sneaking in my hairs. ♫

687
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:30,049
Mimi, are you homesick?

688
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,730
No.

689
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,969
You can tell me about your past.

690
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,330
I won't tell anyone else, I swear.

691
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,690
I have been kidnapped as a
servant since my childhood.

692
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:55,770
So I can remember little about my hometown.

693
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,729
What a coincidence.

694
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,368
I was a servant, too.

695
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:01,359
You?

696
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,599
I'm a servant born in the Khan's Tent,

697
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,829
so I haven't been to my hometown at all.

698
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,149
If so, how can you...

699
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,879
Became the military
counsellor of Eagle Division,

700
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,599
admired and followed by ten thousands of people?

701
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,770
Stop the narcissism.

702
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,969
Actually these are all because of Sun's help.

703
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,249
When I was a child,
I was nearly beaten to death.

704
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,519
Sun saved me.

705
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,119
Later, he was titled as "Great
Warrior" by the Great Khan.

706
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,969
He took me to the Eagle Division.

707
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,930
Later, Eagle Division became my home.

708
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,489
Mimi.

709
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,128
Actually, Eagle Division is a nice place.

710
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:37,559
Look at Li Changge.

711
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,649
She also lives well there, doesn't she?

712
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,510
I hope someday,
Eagle Division can be your home as well.

713
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:55,970
It's too late.

714
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,450
Go back and have a good rest.

715
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,359
Okay, you should go to bed early, too.

716
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,650
We'll set off tomorrow.

717
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,730
Changge.

718
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,879
Where did you get this?

719
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,559
Kind of grabbed by me.

720
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,649
Yesterday, I carelessly lost the
money bag you gave me in the market.

721
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:53,039
And a girl's bag was exactly the same as yours.

722
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,649
I though mine is stolen by her.

723
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,650
So..

724
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,799
However, Changge,
I saw you embroider this money bag here.

725
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,039
How could she get the same one?

726
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,800
I made one to a friend of mine as well.

727
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,249
Mimi, what does the girl look like?

728
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:16,119
She is not tall,
but her appearance is comely.

729
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,839
And she's timid.

730
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,489
I didn't say anything harsh while
she dared not to speak more.

731
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,770
It's really Leyan.

732
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,969
Why is Leyan in Yunzhou?

733
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,489
Leyan?

734
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,010
She is a best friend of mine before.

735
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,449
Mimi.

736
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,799
Where did you meet her?

737
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,799
At Yunzhou's market.

738
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,888
She took a bamboo basket with
her to sell cloth at the market.

739
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:43,649
There must be something wrong.

740
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,528
How could Leyan be in Yunzhou?

741
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,809
A girl like her who has never
worked should do business now.

742
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,029
No.

743
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,359
I have to go to find her.

744
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,888
Mimi.

745
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:57,729
Thank you.

746
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,009
Changge, where are you going?

747
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,209
Yunzhou.

748
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,410
Do you need... my company?

749
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,470
- Great Khan decided to set
off now?
- Lower your voice.

750
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,649
There is no sign before.

751
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,750
Great Khan has planned about this long before.

752
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:21,669
Tegin Sun, the military
counselor made me inform you

753
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,830
that she went to Yunzhou for some business.

754
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:31,489
Does she really want to inform you?

755
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,490
Let her be this time.

756
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:37,650
Mu Jin, do not tell her
about my military expedition.

757
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,789
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

758
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,269
♫ gradually revives, ♫

759
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,589
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

760
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,750
♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫

761
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,070
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

762
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,549
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

763
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:21,709
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

764
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,389
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

765
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,869
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

766
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,709
♫ the longing flows. ♫

767
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,069
♫ There's always a moment ♫

768
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:39,869
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

769
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,309
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

770
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:50,029
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

771
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,429
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

772
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,709
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

773
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,269
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

774
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,029
♫ layer after layer. ♫

775
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,069
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

776
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:09,950
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

777
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:18,349
♫ There's always a moment ♫

778
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:23,989
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

779
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:27,589
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

780
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:33,909
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

781
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,469
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

782
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,829
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

783
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:43,309
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

784
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,189
♫ layer after layer. ♫

785
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,189
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

786
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:54,590
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

787
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,790
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

788
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:16,910
The Long Ballad
