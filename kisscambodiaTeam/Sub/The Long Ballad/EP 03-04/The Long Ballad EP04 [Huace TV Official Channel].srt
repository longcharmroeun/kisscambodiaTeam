00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,920
♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,760
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,630
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,950
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,680
♫ I’ve never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,630
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,790
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,720
♫ To the distance. ♫

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,750
♫ The miserable past is like a dagger. ♫

♫ Though my wings are broken, ♫

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,840

♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night, ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,230
♫ I’ll return it with a long ballad. ♫

♫ The river of life is under my feet. ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,760

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,480
The Long Ballad

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Episode 04

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,480
Hurry.

23
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:53,440
Hurry.

24
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,360
Go and get her.

25
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,559
Have you found her?

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,319
Not yet.

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,680
There.

28
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:07,839
Hurry.

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,119
Master,

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,039
you really escaped alive.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,679
Why are you here?

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,199
If you wanna revenge,

33
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,639
you'll come to Hongyi Palace.

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,160
The Palace's heavily-guarded.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,831
In case you'll be in trouble,

36
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:36,525
I've been here round the clock for two days.

37
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,119
See,

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
I'm still of some use.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,520
What's more,

40
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,279
no one knows the corners of Chang'an better than me.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,320
Master,

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,839
keep me by your side.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Master, await me.

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,039
Master,

45
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,160
what's this?

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
Not a good thing.

47
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:54,919
Save questions.

48
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,160
As you said,

49
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,759
I won't ask again.

50
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,679
I'm so obedient.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,919
Master, can you keep me by your side?

52
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,533
You'll die for this.

53
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:09,679
Go back.

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
All men will die,

55
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:14,399
but I think it's worth following my heart to be with you.

56
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,839
Aren't you afraid of death?

57
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,240
Yes, I am.

58
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,839
So why must you follow me?

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,039
But...

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,800
to live in infamy is more terrible than to die.

61
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,520
Master,

62
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,000
you can even smile.

63
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,679
Your smile is so charming.

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,320
Since you ask for death,

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
don't blame me.

66
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,800
So you agree to take me your apprentice?

67
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,279
Hurry up.

68
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:44,559
What?

69
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,600
He ran away.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,279
Yeah.

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,759
Unexpectedly, he ran away so fast.

72
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,919
I'm more interested in him.

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,880
Tegin, it's not that easy to deal with him.

74
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,199
Su Yishe,

75
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,160
Does Li Jiancheng have any son or general in exile?

76
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,800
Not that I know of.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
None of his five sons survives.

78
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,399
All his men have surrendered.

79
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,000
That guy may be a nobody in Eastern Palace.

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,440
It seems it's not just us

81
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,880
worrying about how to leave Chang'an.

82
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,279
It's my fault.

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I'm to blame.

84
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,239
Your Highness, please allow me to deploy our men

85
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,760
to search the city for three days.

86
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,640
I'm sure I'll catch Princess...

87
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,880
... the escaped criminal

88
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
to get the treasure back.

89
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,760
Fang Yi,

90
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,920
you've served your Highness for years.

91
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,040
Why're you still talking nonsense?

92
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,920
Commander Fang's arresting the criminal.

93
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,440
Why do you think he's talking nonsense?

94
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,000
Isn't it nonsense?

95
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,839
Though your Highness has granted a general amnesty,

96
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,000
except Feng Li and Xie Shufang, etc.,

97
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,671
all those involved with Li Jiancheng,

98
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:59,865
including military generals and dignitaries in royal court,

99
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,119
take a seesaw policy

100
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,519
for fear the amnesty

101
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,399
is a lure for them to be exposed.

102
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:07,359
If you deploy men to search the city,

103
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
without knowing whom to arrest,

104
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,040
they'll all squeeze their way to run away.

105
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,959
Keming,

106
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,320
fury isn't good for your health.

107
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,320
It's said nothing forcibly done is gonna be agreeable.

108
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Have a taste.

109
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,320
Taste it.

110
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,399
Princess Yongan's born to be timid and fragile.

111
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,359
How can she be capricious?

112
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:35,519
With no one backing her up,

113
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,519
how dare she?

114
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,519
Why're you looking at me?

115
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,959
The two princesses are childhood chums.

116
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,760
It's reasonable for her to call on one another.

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,440
Is it reasonable for her to steal the Seal of Crown Prince?

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
There you go.

119
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,320
Princess Yongning is braver than I thought.

120
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,920
Are you praising her for it?

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't wrong me!

122
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,000
It has nothing to do with me.

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,320
I won't support her to steal the Seal of Crown Prince.

124
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,519
Shut up!

125
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,279
Leyan's in the wrong.

126
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,760
I've shut her up for pondering over her misdeeds.

127
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,600
As for Changge,

128
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
as I ordered,

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,791
deploy a crack troop of our men in plain clothes

130
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,160
to make inquiries secretly.

131
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't arouse a sensation in the city.

132
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,959
Remember,

133
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,959
bring her back alive.

134
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,000
Your Highness,

135
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,200
Princess Yongning's highly skilled in martial arts.

136
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,559
If she resists being arrested,

137
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,880
I want her alive.

138
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,480
Don't let me repeat it.

139
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,880
It's a big deal.

140
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,720
Don't leak it out.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,239
Yes, your Highness.

142
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,279
Mr. Fang,

143
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,399
you said dignitaries

144
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,200
in royal court took a seesaw policy.

145
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,760
Do you have any suggestion?

146
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,399
Do you know the allusion

147
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
that to carry out the reform,

148
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,320
Shang Yang set up a log outside the south gate,

149
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,079
and promised anyone who can

150
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,640
move the log to the north gate 200 taels of gold?

151
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,239
Someone gave it a shot and did get the gold,

152
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,320
so that people believed

153
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,959
the royal court would keep its words.

154
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,799
It sounds easy.

155
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,559
But where to get the log?

156
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,600
There's one avail in Yongxing Fang.

157
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,000
Wei Zheng.

158
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,119
Father.

159
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,200
Father,

160
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,799
what happened?

161
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,959
Your Highness is too merciful.

162
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,880
I worry he'll fall victim of his own deeds.

163
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,440
You mean Princess Yongning?

164
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:08,040
Princess Yongning used to be close to your Highness.

165
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,600
It's not a secret

166
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,700
their relationship's closer than that of their fathers.

167
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,160
It's natural for him not to kill her.

168
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:14,920
Idiot!

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,160
Li Changge has been educated with civil and military skills

170
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,079
as a prince since childhood,

171
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,720
and has been domineering.

172
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,320
She was just out of danger.

173
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,119
Ordinary people must be in shock,

174
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,040
but she committed a crime

175
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,400
of assassinating the Crown Prince.

176
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,520
These days I've been thinking

177
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,960
maybe it's she who spread rumors in the army.

178
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,280
If we can't root her out,

179
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,039
it'll be too late to make up for the fault.

180
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,119
But your Highness didn't allow us to harm her.

181
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,919
Just keep your Highness's good reputation.

182
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,760
I don't care about mine.

183
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,320
To ensure the stability of our Tang Dynasty,

184
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,960
I dare remove more obstacles,

185
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,719
let alone Li Changge.

186
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,919
You mean...

187
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,679
I can only entrust you with this task.

188
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,599
Will you let me down?

189
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,919
I won't let you down for sure.

190
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,039
By the way,

191
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,359
go ask Chang He

192
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
how the rumor-spreading case is going.

193
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,159
If there's no progress,

194
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,559
let him make room for others.

195
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,679
Yes.

196
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,039
Commander Hao,

197
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,471
Father asked me to inquire about the case.

198
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:50,659
Under investigation.

199
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,559
Please tell Mr. Du

200
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,119
I'll report to him in person once there's any progress.

201
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,640
If you go on like this,

202
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,919
you won't solve the case next year.

203
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,400
You!

204
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,599
Show me the note.

205
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,348
[Crown Prince and Prince Qi are killed.
Their remnants are annihilated.]

206
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
Why's there a fishy smell?

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Officer,

208
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm just an ordinary fishmonger

209
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:22,840
running a small business.

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,760
Did I...

211
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,440
Did I do something wrong?

212
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,559
Cut the crap. Tell me

213
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,880
who told you to put the note in the fish stomach.

214
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,960
I don't understand.

215
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,840
Tell me the truth,

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,159
or you won't go back.

217
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,039
Spare my life.

218
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,711
I was given some money

219
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:43,281
to put the note into the fish stomach.

220
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,440
I don't know who it is.

221
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,080
I can't even read.

222
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,598
You must know whether it's a male or female, fat or thin.

223
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,400
I know.

224
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,080
It's a male.

225
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,640
Male?

226
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,239
Is it a handsome youngster

227
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,280
with a mole near his eye?

228
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,520
No, it's a tall guy of few words.

229
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,559
That's all. There's no other feature.

230
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,960
All I said is true.

231
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,359
Spare my life, Officer.

232
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,159
Master,

233
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:07,159
let's go south after the meal.

234
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,351
The inspection there

235
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:09,773
isn't as strict as it is here.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,640
They know it better than you do.

237
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,080
Stop eating.

238
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,559
- Let's go.
- Okay.

239
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:34,919
Don't look around.

240
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,039
They're Prince Qin's men.

241
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,400
Let's run separately,

242
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:40,239
and meet at the tavern in Yining Fang.

243
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:50,679
Yong...

244
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,551
Run!

245
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:52,146
Follow her!

246
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:56,840
Stop!

247
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,039
Step aside!

248
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,479
Stop!

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,320
Yeah.

250
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,640
Don't know what's up.

251
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,719
He's quite honest.

252
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,919
What's for?

253
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,679
He runs a small business.

254
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,520
Yeah.

255
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,159
He dares not kill people.

256
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:19,791
What's up?

257
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,230
A fishmonger is publicly exposed.

258
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,320
Go have a look.

259
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,599
Fishmonger?

260
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,559
Tegin.

261
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:48,919
Tegin,

262
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,960
bad news.

263
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,520
The fishmonger was caught,

264
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,840
and is yoked at the intersection

265
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,920
of Zhuque Street.

266
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,404
That fishmonger met Su Yishe.

267
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Will he give us up?

268
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,119
Ask all our men to leave at once.

269
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,799
Now?

270
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,599
Why?

271
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,640
You're exposed.

272
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,640
How come?

273
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:04,640
It's impossible.

274
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
If they've got the clue,

275
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:07,250
why bother getting him yoked publicly?

276
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,280
They're doing so

277
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,960
for they haven't got any useful clue.

278
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,580
That's why they're observing spectators' reaction.

279
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,299
You should have been followed

280
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,960
when back from the street.

281
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,799
Tegin,

282
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,799
It's too late.

284
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,239
They're already here.

285
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,400
What shall we do?

286
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,919
Follow him!

287
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,559
Step aside!

288
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,559
Step aside!

289
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Step aside!

290
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,840
Step aside!

291
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
How can I always meet you

292
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:20,960
in such a big Chang'an City?

293
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,159
You followed me, too?

294
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,719
You're just in time.

295
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,799
Thanks.

296
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,239
Go.

297
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,000
You!

298
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,440
Go.

299
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,599
Chang He,

300
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,320
why is he chasing me instead?

301
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,280
Follow her!

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,591
Come on,

303
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:41,311
Go up and have a look.

304
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,670
Yes.

305
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:42,491
Commander Fang.

306
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,479
General Chang,

307
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,080
are you also chasing Princess Yongning?

308
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,239
Princess Yongning?

309
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,679
Nobody's here.

310
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,400
I just saw her running into this road.

311
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,479
General Chang,

312
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,919
did you see her or not?

313
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,119
We've been chasing her for long in vain.

314
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,119
Princess Yongning? I didn't see her.

315
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,239
Go over there.

316
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,520
Tegin,

317
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:22,730
thanks to you this time.

318
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,300
I'll be more cautious next time.

319
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,030
It's great you're fine.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Thank Sirius.

321
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,799
Are you silly?

322
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,960
Alright.

323
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Su Yishe,

324
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,440
have you found a way to get out of the city?

325
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,440
Tegin, don't worry.

326
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,520
I've found one.

327
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,479
What a fool you are!

328
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,319
How can you mess up a sure thing?

329
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,280
That guy's good at martial arts

330
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,230
and horsemanship.

331
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,760
He shook off us.

332
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,199
But I find this.

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,920
Fang Yi is chasing Princess Yongning.

334
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:25,399
If I get it right,

335
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,479
The Fish Token

336
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,920
is what fell off her.

337
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,599
Unexpectedly, lose on one side

338
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,920
while gain on the other.

339
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,860
[Xiuwen Hall]

340
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,640
It's you.

341
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,959
Do you know what it is?

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
Don't beat about the bush.

343
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,199
I know you're Li Changge's childhood chum.

344
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,640
You must know her well.

345
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,280
Know the enemy and know oneself.

346
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,760
Do you want me to arrest Li Changge?

347
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,760
Please tell Mr. Du,

348
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,319
there's a room for discussion on everything

349
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,959
except this one.

350
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
You know the Fish Token

351
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,760
she used to sneak into Hongyi Palace is yours?

352
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:20,640
What punishment does an accessory

353
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,312
deserve for stealing the Seal of

354
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:23,880
and assassinating Crown Prince?

355
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:27,359
Nine generations of your family will be killed for it.

356
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,119
Well,

357
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,280
I know where Li Changge's going.

358
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,199
Come to me at any time

359
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,760
after you come round.

360
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,479
A'Dou,

361
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,047
I find the only way

362
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,216
to get out of city without being checked

363
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:55,680
is that I'm not me.

364
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,119
What do you mean by you're not you?

365
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,439
A'Dou,

366
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,439
can you forge ID cards?

367
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,800
Forge ID cards?

368
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,359
Master,

369
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,400
I don't know how to forge ID cards,

370
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,177
but I know how to be dressed up as Hu merchants.

371
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:12,920
In Chang'an City,

372
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,959
there're so many unknown Hu merchants.

373
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,680
It's easy to blend into them among piles of goods.

374
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,760
This is on me.

375
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,640
Tighten it up.

376
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:25,839
Here it is.

[Yunjin Clothing Store]

378
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:32,880
Guests,

379
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:34,040
what do you want?

380
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,300
We stock various kinds of satin,

381
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,909
ranked No.1 in Chang'an City.

382
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,439
East to the seashore;

383
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,599
West to Yumenguan Pass.

384
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Though with vast wealth,

385
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,119
it only costs several pennies.

386
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,239
What nonsense are you talking?

387
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,000
Master, it's a password.

388
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,520
Guest, sorry.

389
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,000
The quota of getting out of the city was filled just now.

390
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,719
Just filled?

391
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,479
Yeah.

392
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,119
No one left?

393
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,880
There's still a caravan.

394
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,479
Go and give it a shot.

395
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,079
Hurry.

396
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,560
Excuse me,

397
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,760
could you please take us out?

398
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,479
No, I can't.

399
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:19,985
I've something urgent.

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,079
It's you!

401
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Caravans tend to smuggle some goods.

402
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
It's also true of yours.

403
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,920
Let's make a deal,

404
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,280
or I'll denounce you.

405
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,079
I heard Prince Qin's arresting the remnants of Eastern Palace

406
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,040
who'll be beheaded when caught.

407
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,160
Do you think I'm the one who're afraid of being denounced?

408
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:46,880
How do you know?

409
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,040
I get it right.

410
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,839
Why're you here?

411
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,400
Keep it down.

412
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,239
You wanna alert them?

413
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You idiot.

414
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,319
You're unable to stay in Chang'an any longer?

415
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,239
As we've a shared future,

416
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,680
please do me a favor.

417
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,260
Have you thought about it or not.

418
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:08,349
If you're recognized,

419
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,839
all men in my caravan will be involved.

420
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,280
You're not my friend as well.

421
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,079
Why must I help you?

422
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:19,950
There're so many carriages and goods.

423
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,217
They won't check them closely.

424
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,920
Just give me a place to hide myself.

425
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,479
If they find me,

426
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,640
I'll say I mingle with your men myself.

427
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:28,959
You're innocent.

428
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,119
If you were polite when borrowing my horse yesterday,

429
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,119
I might have agreed.

430
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,479
I had something urgent at that time.

431
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,880
I beg your pardon.

432
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,920
It's no use for an oral apology.

433
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,168
If you really wanna apologize,

434
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,755
just give me something.

435
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,760
I've nothing to trade with you.

436
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,280
I think your dagger is good.

437
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,319
It's an exception.

438
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,640
Then no way.

439
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,359
Go.

440
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,160
Master.

441
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,199
Get out first.

442
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,079
After getting out,

443
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,680
we can find chances to get it back.

444
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:14,880
Okay.

445
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,040
I agree,

446
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,160
but you've to wait till I get out of the city.

447
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:19,839
Deal.

448
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,119
A'Dou,

449
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,640
don't risk your life with me.

450
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,000
You won't be checked.

451
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,959
Await me at Shili Pavilion outside.

452
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,959
If I don't arrive in three days,

453
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,839
it must be our fate.

454
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,800
But Master,

455
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:33,640
you're alone...

456
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm your Master.

457
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,004
- Why don't you listen to me?
- I...

458
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,400
Alright.

459
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:38,800
Master,

460
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,199
you must take care.

461
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,439
Hurry to go.

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,119
Don't you think

463
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,000
Tegin becomes talkative when meeting that guy?

464
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,560
Tegin said

465
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,640
the enemy of our enemy is our friend.

466
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,800
Now that he's our friend,

467
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,959
it's natural for him to talk more.

468
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,119
Sounds right.

469
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,640
Officers.

470
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,560
It's...

471
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,239
Has this guy come to find a way out of the city?

472
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,071
You must be kidding.

473
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,251
- We're decent businessmen.
- Look closely.

474
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,680
Yes, he has.

475
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,760
When a caravan passed by,

476
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,319
she followed that caravan.

477
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,079
Go find her.

478
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,560
Wait.

479
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,199
Officer,

480
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,560
we've the passport.

481
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,239
Checked.

482
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,040
It's identical with the goods registered.

483
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:23,920
Go.

484
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,359
Thanks, Officer.

485
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:28,959
Go.

486
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:29,520
Wait.

487
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,359
Show me the passport.

488
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:06,719
Commander,

489
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,359
I checked the goods just now.

490
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,359
There's no problem.

491
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,119
Yes, they've been checked.

492
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
No problem.

493
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:32,760
These are common medicine, cloth and so on.

494
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,199
To some extent, smuggling is

495
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,199
a tacit understanding for businessmen.

496
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,839
Why must you hamper us?

497
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,040
Can we go now?

498
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,400
Okay, let's go.

499
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,040
Go.

500
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,680
Commander,

501
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,391
I've searched all over but still can't find her.

502
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,880
Maybe she has been out.

503
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,800
What shall we do?

504
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,719
No matter how she gets out,

505
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,239
if she wanna travel long,

506
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
she's bound to pass the Shili Pavilion.

507
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,439
Deploy men to block her with me.

508
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,959
Call Wei Shuyu to see me.

509
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:37,199
Yes.

510
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,800
I'm guilty.

511
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,959
What for?

512
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,359
Your Highness,

513
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,800
I'm sorry to let you down, your Highness.

514
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm guilty of

515
00:27:58,199 --> 00:28:01,280
conniving at Changge's treason.

516
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,520
No one is more cunning than you.

517
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,959
No wonder Keming's unable to do with you.

518
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,040
It was me who asked you to

519
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,560
shoulder the responsibility.

520
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,680
Now that Changge ran away,

521
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,479
I'm also to blame.

522
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:24,119
Are you satirizing me for being victim of my deeds?

523
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,079
I dare not.

524
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,719
It's all my fault.

525
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,680
Come on,

526
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,640
you may rise.

527
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,199
Stop pretending.

528
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,400
I don't blame you.

529
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,079
I didn't expect a girl to be so stubborn.

530
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,640
Your Highness,

531
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,000
the Seal of Crown Prince matters.

532
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,640
This time Changge really made a big trouble.

533
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,079
So much for that.

534
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,920
Show me the way.

535
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,000
Someone is awaiting us.

536
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,199
Yes.

537
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I'll go get everything ready.

538
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,239
What kind of medicine do you have?

539
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:40,520
Why's it put with abdomen wraps up?

540
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,599
Persian aphrodisiac.

541
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,280
What?

542
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:44,760
You!

543
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,040
I told you before you got in.

544
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,199
At your own risk.

545
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,560
Wanna hide in this box?

546
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:58,439
No.

547
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:03,040
They'll especially check the goods instead of the animals.

548
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,160
At that time,

549
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:06,040
just wrap me up in the fur and put me

550
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,640
in the middle of two humps.

551
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,599
I know a better place to hide yourself.

552
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,239
You'll never be found.

553
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,439
You may have a try,

554
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,800
but it's at your own risk.

555
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,479
Why're you as affected as a girl?

556
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:23,959
Wanna buy some?

557
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,439
I can give you a discount.

558
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,839
What?

559
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,880
You pervert!

560
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:38,961
Your symptoms are relieved now.

561
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,959
You're welcome.

562
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,479
According to our agreement,

563
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:44,959
you've got out with our caravan.

564
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,119
Your dagger is mine now.

565
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,280
Wait.

566
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,280
How to address you?

567
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,599
We just met by chance,

568
00:30:52,503 --> 00:30:53,918
and will never meet again.

569
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,880
I entrust you with my dagger for the time being,

570
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,148
and will retrieve it back later.

571
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,800
Are you afraid so that

572
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,361
you won't tell me your name?

573
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,680
Su Yishe,

574
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,719
give him a horse.

575
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,199
Well,

576
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,800
we lose another horse.

577
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,959
It's a far sweeter deal for you.

578
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,800
Don't bother me.

579
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,599
Let's go.

580
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,079
Go.

581
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,719
Go.

582
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,920
Thanks for your horse,

583
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,520
but I'll retrieve my dagger back.

584
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,660
[Wei's Mansion]

585
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,119
Xuancheng,

586
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,359
I'm here again.

587
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,160
I'm sick,

588
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,811
and can't meet guests.

589
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,880
Get out.

590
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,880
Are you still angry with me?

591
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,079
I failed to taste your tea last time.

592
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,000
Today,

593
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,359
I'll finally make it.

594
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,319
Your tea is really bitter.

595
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,400
Well,

596
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,439
I'll show you someone

597
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,880
who'll cure you for sure.

598
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,680
Your Highness.

599
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,520
You've been sick for long.

600
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm here specially to visit you.

601
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,719
Go.

602
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:08,800
Go.

603
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:12,560
Go.

604
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,040
Go.

605
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:21,640
Go.

606
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,439
Go.

607
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,000
Stop.

608
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,239
Li Changge,

609
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,359
what a coincidence.

610
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,160
It's you who're chasing me with him.

611
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,000
Changge...

612
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:56,880
Wei Shuyu,

613
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,800
you're Princess's friend indeed.

614
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,160
You know she'll pass by here.

615
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,640
Thanks for informing me in time.

616
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,879
Go.

617
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,799
Go.

618
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:21,878
Go.

619
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:25,879
Go.

620
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,679
Go.

621
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:34,760
Go.

622
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,479
Go.

623
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:42,799
Go.

624
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,279
Go.

625
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,000
Go.

626
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,239
Stop.

627
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,280
Li Changge,

628
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,560
you've no way out.

629
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,000
Go back with me

630
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,679
and take your punishment.

631
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,679
What's up?

632
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,479
Heartbroken?

633
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,719
Don't act like I'm utilizing you.

634
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,280
Now that you're here,

635
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,600
you've made your choice.

636
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:43,961
I've no time to stand here waiting for you.

637
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:44,910
Wanna find her body?

638
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,199
Hurry to get down.

639
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,360
Changge,

640
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,760
I'm sorry.

641
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,239
I'm here to invite you to be my adviser.

642
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,320
I'm steadfast.

643
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,600
Prince Qin,

644
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,320
please go back.

645
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,639
Do you wanna follow Zhuge Liang's example

646
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:44,010
to establish my reputation of visiting you three times?

647
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,000
Then I must thank you in advance.

648
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,280
Your deeds will be recorded in the history.

649
00:39:56,399 --> 00:40:00,199
The Crown Prince didn't listen to me.

650
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:03,000
That's why he failed.

651
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:07,120
I heard you suggested Jiancheng send me out of Chang'an.

652
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,040
You alienated me from my brother.

653
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,040
- Why?
- Don't call him your brother!

654
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,800
I regret not persuading

655
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:21,080
the Crown Prince to root you out.

656
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,959
Get out!

657
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,679
Get out!

658
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,959
You have slaughtered many lives.

659
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,560
Mine won't be an exception.

660
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,360
You!

661
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:47,719
Your Highness,

662
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,399
it's getting dark.

663
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,760
It's time to go back.

664
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,399
Your Highness,

665
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:55,320
Wei Zheng's always at will.

666
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,120
Please forgive him.

667
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,639
I'm here waiting for you, Prince Qin.

668
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:06,959
You...

669
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,439
Don't cover up my mouth.

670
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,959
Don't stop me!

671
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,239
Get out!

672
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,879
Loyal men tend to die worthy deaths.

673
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,320
I'm here waiting for you!

674
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:36,760
Tegin,

675
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:37,840
I got enough water.

676
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,639
Su Yishe and Nuer went ahead to explore the way,

677
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,630
and found substitutes for us

678
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,959
to head for the grassland through the pass.

679
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,639
But at our current speed,

680
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,479
it'll take us half a month to reach Youzhou.

681
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:50,560
Half a month?

682
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,000
It's too long.

683
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:54,919
- We've to speed up.
- Yes.

684
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,390
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

685
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,700
♫ gradually revives, ♫

686
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,980
