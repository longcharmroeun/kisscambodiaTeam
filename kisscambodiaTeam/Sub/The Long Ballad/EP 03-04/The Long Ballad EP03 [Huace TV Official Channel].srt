The Long Ballad

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,260
Episode 3

22
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,910
Yesterday you were still fine.

23
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,680
And today you get hurt.

24
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,000
Did you meet you foe?

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,910
Eat something at least, brave man.

26
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,270
Then you can get recovered soon.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,800
I've been wandering in streets since little.

28
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,550
And I've met all kinds of people.

29
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,630
I can conclude that

30
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,030
you must been in tough days recently,

31
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,320
or you have a blood feud.

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,470
Did you just have a tough fight with your foe today?

33
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,360
If you say one more word,

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,390
you will die.

35
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,030
No. No. No.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,360
Brave man.

37
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,030
No. Master.

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Though I don't know who you are,

39
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,240
you can't be an ordinary person.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
Me, A'Dou, lives a poor life.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,670
Even if I died someday,

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,100
I'm afraid that no one would realize it.

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,750
If I can follow you and do something great,

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
it would be worth even if I'd die.

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,830
Search carefully.

46
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,670
Master, why are soldiers here?

47
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,160
Finding this place from Rongen Temple,

48
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,830
they move too fast.

49
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,110
Rongen Temple?

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
I heard that soldiers guarding Rongen Temple

51
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,750
got poisoned.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Was that you?

53
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,960
I knew that I was right about you.

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,260
You even dare poison soldiers.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,190
Master, you're indeed not ordinary.

56
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,240
Mr. Du.

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,440
It's so late now.

58
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,030
I didn't expect you're still investigating here.

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,080
Mr. Du.

60
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,960
Why are you here, Mr. Fang?

61
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,440
I heard that Pinxiang Store
[Pinxiang Store]

62
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,520
has the best cookie among Changan City.

63
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,630
My wife wants to taste it,

64
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,160
so I'm here on my own to see how good it is.

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,720
When I was downstairs,

66
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,600
I got stopped by soldiers.

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,830
After me inquiring,

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,360
it turns out Mr. Du is investigating here.

69
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,320
You're really well-informed, Mr. Fang.

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,080
Why is it on fire?

71
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,600
It looks like I can't buy cookies today.

72
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:17,950
Father.

73
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,920
Mr. Fang.

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
Mr. Fang.

75
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,350
Do you really insist breeding the evil?

76
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,790
I don't understand, Mr. Du.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,950
I'm confused.

78
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,350
Mr. Du. I have to go.

79
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,600
I need to go home now

80
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,320
to tell my wife about it.

81
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,110
See you.

82

[Pinxiang Store]

83
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,200
Master, why is it on fire?

84
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,510
Father, it's weird about the fire.

85
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm afraid...

86
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,860
Please be assured, father.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,230
I'll investigate it thoroughly.

88
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,670
No need.

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,040
Since someone wants to protect her,

90
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,920
he won't leave a trace.

91
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,350
Is it possible...

92
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,070
that Mr. Fang set it on fire?

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,070
Don't draw a conclusion so soon.

94
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,670
Pinxiang Store is empty today.

95
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,760
That person might not want to hurt innocent people.

96
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,640
Let's leave here.

97

98

Master, the fire is too strong.

99
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,600
What should we do?

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,510
Run.

101
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,790
Master. Wait. Stop.

102

And that ladder.

Master.

108
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,350
Why don't you say anything?

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,350
Remove the trace showing I was there with fire.

110
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,790
There won't be any evidence of my trace there.

111
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,830
Then that's a favor for you, right?

112
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,670
A favor?

113
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,550
My mother just died recently in Rongen Temple.

114
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,440
I won't accept that favor.

115
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720

116
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,230
So Lady Jin is your mother?

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Knowing too much won't do any good to you.

118

188
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,550
Your Majesty has granted Prince Qin as Crown Prince.

189
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,280
Naturally Lady becomes Princess now.

190
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,160
Thanks to your Majesty.
[Great Mountains]

191
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,760
Why did Princess want to meet me?

192
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,080
Mr. Fang.

193
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,110
I want to ask for your help.

194
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,030
Changge?

195
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,520
I know that Mr. Fang cherished Changge most.

196
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,320
I also know that you won't catch Changge.

197
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,000
Today I come here

198
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,320
just wanting to know the truth from you.

199
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,280
How is Changge?

200
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,110
Please don't worry, Princess.

201
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,910
Princess Yongning hasn't been caught.

202
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,350
I knew it.

203
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,000
I knew Changge would be fine.

204
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,670
Please be assured, Princess.

205
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,790
She was taught by Your Highness and Wei Zheng.

206
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,110
I also spent a lot of time on her.

207
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,200
How can she be caught easily?

208
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,030
Just... it would be tough to her.

209
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,320
[Elegance and Serenity]

210
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,230
About your Highness' intention to pardon people.

211
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,100
I can understand that.

212
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,910
But I think your Highness can't pardon everyone.

213
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,960
What do you mean?

214
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,280
Leader of Tianjie Army, Luo Yi,

215
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,320
has been good friends with Li Jiancheng.

216
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,710
If he wants to revolt, it will be huge trouble.

217
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,910
Also, Li Changge, the daughter of Li Jiancheng,

218
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,760
will do harm to...

219
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,760
Keming.

220
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,840
The essence to make the country in harmony
is to win people's heart.

221
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,150
If officers keep suspecting each other

222
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,790
and I get strict and abuse punishment,

223
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,760
I'm afraid that I'll be like Emperor Yang of Sui.

224
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,670
Have you heard the saying?

225
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,900
Civilizing people after the turmoil

226
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,790
will be much more effective.

227
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,440
I'm too ignorant.

228
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,470
No wonder.

229
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,590
It's from Wei Zheng.

230
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,000
Xuanling just recommended him to me.

231
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,030
Your Highness.

232
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,520
Wei Zheng has always been stubborn.

233
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,030
And now your Highness wants to recruit him.

234
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,350
I'm afraid that it won't be easy.

235
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,520
Stubborn?

236
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,470
Wouldn't that just match your flavor?

237
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,110
Mr. Du.

238
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
[Crown Prince and Prince Qi died. Kill all their followers.]

239
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,520
It's about the safety of Changan City.

240
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,400
Be careful.

241
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Don't leave any trace.

242
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,790
Besides,

243
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,080
it's special period now.

244
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,590
Send more people to guard every city gate.

245
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,670
Don't let any related person sneak out.

246
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,520
Please be assured.

247
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,960
I'll try my best to do it for your Highness.

248
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,780
[Tonghua Gate]

249
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,220
Does the officer from Eastern Palace

250
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,910
also need to hide in Changan City?

251
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,470
Move away.

252
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,030
You can even beat soldiers in the street in public.

253
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,580
What are you hiding from?

254
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,030
So it's you.

255
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,840
Why are you tracking me?

256
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,080
Tracking you?

257
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,960
It's you that ran into me.

258
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,150
What do you want?

259
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,880
You're from Eastern Palace
and you haven't pledged allegiance.

260
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,300
Why can you go in and out at your will?

261
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Non of your business.

262
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,280
What are you doing?

263
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,110
Someone's coming.

264
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,000
Why do you look like this?

265
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,440
As if I'm bullying you.

266
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
From now on, soldiers will guard the city gate

267
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,790
and control those in and out.

268
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,470
Yes.

269
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,640
If it weren't for that guy,

270
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,260
we would have been out of this city now.

271
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,790
Let's figure out another way.

272
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,030
Go back first.

273
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,150
Let's go.

274
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,740
[Serenity is Wealth]

275
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,230
It seems that Retinue is determined to

276
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,550
keep sleeping until it's dark today.

277
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,880
I'm sorry for that, Mr. Du.

278
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,400
My father doesn't feel well recently.

279
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,020
It's not convenient for him to meet guests.

280
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,790
Your father doesn't feel bad physically,

281
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,710
but psychologically.

282
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,280
My father wouldn't listen to anyone.

283
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,470
I apologize on behalf of my father.

284
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,110
Shuyu, do you have siblings?

285
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
I have three brothers and one sister at hometown.

286
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,150
They're with my mother now.

287
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,280
Your father is so stubborn.

288
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,840
Just like a tall tree,

289
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,110
it'll get broken if it's too tough.

290
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,670
If your father has a bad ending,

291
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,150
can your family survive?

292
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,550
I'm just sorry for Family Wei.

293
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,400
Don't you understand the gains and losses inside of it?

294
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,400
I understand.

295
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,080
Good.

296
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,640
You're at the similar age with my foster son Hao Du.

297
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,880
He acts very properly.

298
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,280
You can communicate with him more often.

299
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,320
Seeing him is like seeing me.

300
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,910
Can you understand my words?

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,790
I'll do my best to persuade my father.

308
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,840
Good boy.

309
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,710
Your Highness gives this Fish Token especially to you.

310
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
From now on,

311
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,109
you're with us, working for Mansion of Crown Prince.

312
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,800
You can use it to come in and out of Palace,

313
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,830
and meet your Highness and me anytime.

314
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,520
What's that?

315
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,590
There. Look.

About the case that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji revolted,

318
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,470
since the head were killed,

319
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,470
Crown Prince asked Your Majesty for pardoning others.

320
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,800
As long as they pledge allegiance on their own,

321
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,040
they'll be pardoned and no more punishment.

322
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,350
That's really a kind Crown Prince.

323
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,350
Right.

324
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,590
With such Crown Prince,

325
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,350
it's our fortune.

326
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,640
Changge. That was really you.

327

You caught me.

328
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,920
And you can get promoted with that, right?

329
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,310
Why would you think of me like that?

330
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,000
I won't do it no matter when.

331
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,710
Then why did you surrender to Du Ruhui?

how can I save my parents?

Please trust me.

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,800
I don't trust anyone now.

Am I guilty?

347

I don't need to be pardoned.

348
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,350
You're not guilty.

349
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,560
Neither am I.

Everyone isn't guilty.

351
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,640
So you have to trust me.

I'll accompany you.

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,350
No one can accompany me now.

No. The Fish Token.

358
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,220
She probably wants to use Fish Token to get in the palace.

359
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,400
Why does she want to go back?

Tribe of Ashile has been very cunning.

363

They often betray their allies.

364
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,310
We can't reckon them like others.

365
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,680
I'm afraid the turbulence these days was also from them.

366

It's late now.

367
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,640

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,230
Congratulations!

372
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,110
Your Majesty let me send Seal of Crown Prince here,

373
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,920
your Highness.

374
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,400
Mother died. The Eastern Palace was in a disaster.

375
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,520
So many people's lives were for such thing.

376
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,430
Put it here.

377
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,920
If you don't have anything else,

378
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,560
you can go back.

379
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,110
Yes, your Highness.

380
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,230
Looks like something is wrong.

381
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,190
Changge. You can show yourself.

382
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,710
I knew I'm here.

383
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,640
You can hide from others,

384
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,760
but not from me.

385
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,470
I've let them record

386
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,950
that Princess Yongning has died.

387
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,560
You killed so many people in Eastern Palace.

388
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,070
Why would you like to let me go now?

389
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,950
Is it that you finally find your humanity?

390
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,160
So you can do me a favor,

391
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,040
and comfort yourself
because you suffered from a sense of guilt.

392
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,800
Or is it because

393
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,760
I'm just a woman without the status as Princess?

394
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,520
So I can't be a threat to you.

395
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Changge.

396
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,190
Changge. Stop.

397
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,760
Even if I might die,

398
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,040
I'll revenge for my mother.

399
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Changge. Just leave!

400
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,820
[Taoism Brings Peace]

401
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,560
Your Highness.

402
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,460
Your Highness' safety matters to the society.

403
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,280
How can you be in such a danger?

404
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,190
Traitor. You can't escape now.

405
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,880
Take Li Changge away.

406
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

407
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,920
Stop.

408
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,110
That dagger belongs to her.

409
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:07,680
I'll use this dagger kill the murder that killed my mother.

410
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,310
How dare you!

411
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,310
Someone here. Put her into the dead cell.

412
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,040
Wait.

413
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,880
Take Princess Yongning to the wing.

414
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,350
And take good care of her.

415
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,710
Your Highness.

416
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,560
You're breeding the evil.

417
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,640
Keming. I'm tired.

418
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,560
About what happened today,

419
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,000
you can't tell anyone else.

420
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,920
Yes.

421
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,160
Take her away.

422
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,000
- Move.
- Go.

423
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,430
Father. It's already well arranged.

424
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,400
I've set lookouts everywhere in Hongyi Palace.

425
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,430
Please be assured.

426
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,800
Father.

427
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,100
How's your Highness going to deal with Li Changge?

428
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,680
Breed the evil and cause lots of trouble.

429
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,710
Father, don't get too tired.

430
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,190
What should I do next?

431
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,710
Double the soldiers.

432
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,400
And let them secretly guard the wing at every corner of it.

433
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Give her illusion that she's not well guarded.

434
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,830
If she wants to run away,

435
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,070
kill her at the spot.

436
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,230
Yes.

437
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,520
Why are they guarding me with so few soldiers?

438
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,470
Mother, what should I do?

439
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,640
Your Highness.

440
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,640
Mr. Fang. I can't fall asleep.

441
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Play chess with me.

442
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,710
Yes.

443
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,560
How dare you!

444
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,520
I haven't started.

445
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,000
How dare you make your move?

446
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,800
Isn't your Highness waiting others to make a move first?

447
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,920
You can't know about me better.

448
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,230
Changge isn't a girl easy to deal with.

449
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,190
Your Highness is busy with official duties.

450
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,280
No need to bother with that.

451
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,880
Your Highness urgently summoned me here because of trusting me.

452
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,400
Your Highness. I'll deal with that.

453
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,760
She's your student.

454
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,230
You have to be responsible for her.

455
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,950
Yes.

[Assassination in Mansion of Prince Qin.
The assassin failed and got locked at the wing]

457
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,430
Assassination in Mansion of Prince Qin?

458
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,310
I didn't expect him to be so dauntless.

459
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,070
Tegin. Who are you talking about?

460
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,830
The guy that won us at the Cuju court.

461
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,230
So he's not an ordinary man.

462
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,590
Needless to say.

463
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
He's more than uncommon.

464
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,520
He also has an uncommon relationship with Prince Qin.

465
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,830
Prince Qin didn't put him into cell,

466
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,110
but let him live in the wing.

467
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,350
So we'll be friends with him.

468
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,400
Friends?

469
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,280
The enemy of our enemy is our friend.

470
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,880
What?

471
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,680
Changge was caught by my father.

472
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,880
And she got locked?

473
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,470
I heard servants talking about it this morning.

474
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,600
And they were seriously scolded by Commander Hao Du.

475
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,830
As for where's she now,

476
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,310
I didn't hear that.

00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,800
Changge.

00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,400
What should we do?

479
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,470
Changge.

480
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,880
Mr. Fang.

481
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,880
Mr. Fang must know

482
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,070
where they locked Changge.

483
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,950
Mr. Fang.

484
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,070
Princess.

485
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,760
I was going to visit you.

486
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,280
Princess.

487
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,830
Mr. Fang is really like a prophet.

488
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,430
The rain tonight is the biggest assistant.

489
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,040
Are you really prepared, Princess?

490
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,310
I'm afraid.

491
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Don't be afraid, Princess.

492
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,830
Think of every step that Mr. Fang has taught you.

493
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,430
And just do as he said.

494
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,800
Things will be okay.

495
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,710
I believe Mr. Fang.

496
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,230
Since little, it was Changge that protected me.

497
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,710
Now it's time for me to protect her.

498
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,640
Stubborn as her, Changge won't eat anything these days.

499
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,040
But your Highness ordered that

500
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,590
they should take good care of her.

501
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,230
Those guards are also worrying about that,

502
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,830
because no one can afford to neglect Princess.

503
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,070
Only your appearance will let Changge eat something.

504
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,880
The guards pretend to stop you.

505
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,430
Actually they wish that you can show up.

506
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,400
Only by this can they be off responsibility.

507
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Remember. Don't get afraid.

508
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,950
The guards will definitely let you get in.

509
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,280
How dare you! That's Princess.

510
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,880
Mr. Du said that no one can get closed to the wing.

511
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,230
Please don't make things difficult for us.

512
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,110
I heard that Princess Yongning

513
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
hasn't been eating for 24 hours.

514
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,470
My father said that you should take good care of her.

515
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,190
If something bad happens to her,

516
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,040
can you afford that?

517
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,040
That's..

518
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,230
Princess just wants to send her some food.

519
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
She won't stay long.

520
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,470
Or are you doubting Princess?

521
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,800
Please, Princess.

522
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,640
Wait for me here.

523
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,920
Changge.

524
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,560
Chang... Changge.

525
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,190
I'm Leyan.

526
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,800
Why are you here?

527
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,560
Who sent you here?

528
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,880
Don't let Changge know that I sent you there.

529
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,160
She wouldn't accept this favor.

530
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,280
What you should do

531
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,110
is to show flaws deliberately.

532
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,350
Give her the information to run away.

533
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,000
Let Changge run away by herself instead of being rescued.

534
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,710
That's what Changge would accept.

535
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,630
It's raining tonight and suddenly becomes cold.

536
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,800
The guards the in backyard went home due to chill.

537
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,710
So I bring you hot soup and cookies.

538
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,520
Eat it when it's still hot.

539
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,519
How did you get in?

540
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,150
I'm Princess now.

541
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,630
They dare not stop me.

542
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,189
Your father killed my father.

543
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,040
You became Princess.

544
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,120
Princess Yongan.

545
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,520
Changge. It's not like what you think.

546
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,870
I don't care about being Princess or whatever.

547
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,120
From your room to this wing,

548
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,520
you won't pass the backyard.

549
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,950
How did you know there are no guards in the backyard?

550
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,840
Who taught you that?

551
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,320
Changge is extremely smart.

552
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,390
If she found out you're lying,

553
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,000
you don't need to hide anything from her.

554
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,950
Changge. Leave here now.

555
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,840
The door of the backyard is open.

556
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,320
The guards were also kept away.

557
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,080
Go as far as you can.

558
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,320
Don't ever come back.

559
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,630
How can I believe you?

560
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,040
Is it your father's trap,

561
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,710
or Du Ruhui's?

562
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,580
Then you'll declare that Princess Yongning

563
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,710
die from arrows when she was running away.

564
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,280
Yes or no?

565
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,600
Yes or no?

566
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,670
Changge.

567
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,360
Do you really think that I'll do harm to you?

568
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,120
It's Mr. Fang.

569
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,000
Mr. Fang taught me that.

570
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,950
He said that you're stubborn.

571
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Only by this can you run away.

572
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,040
Fang Xuanling.

573
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,760
Tell Fang Xuanling,

574
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,360
It's my business. I'll try to think of a way it on my own.

575
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,080
He doesn't need to have a pity on me.

576
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,760
I don't want to owe him anything.

577
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,800
The only thing can dispel her misgivings

578
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,600
is your sisterhood since little.

579
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,800
The only one can save Changge

580
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,470
is actually you.

581
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,470
Changge.

582
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,320
This is the amulet that I prayed for you recently.

583
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,040
Take it with you.

584
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,600
Then you'll definitely be safe.

585
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,280
Amulet?

586
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,520
You Mansion of Prince Qin

587
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,040
killed everyone in our Eastern Palace.

588
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,230
Your father killed my mother and father.

589
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,630
Now you want me to be safe?

590
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,230
I'm sorry, Changge.

591
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,430
I didn't know that.

592
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,910
I...

593
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,520
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,040
Princess Yongan.

595
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,190
From now on,

596
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,280
we two are foes and absolutely irreconcilable.

597
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,950
Changge.

598
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,470
We two are best sisters since childhood.

599
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,840
Changge.

600
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,190
Sisters?

601
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,950
How can I be sisters

602
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,800
with the daughter of the man that murdered my father?

603
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,500
I'll count down from three.

604
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,230
Leave here now.

605
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,710
Otherwise don't blame me for being too cold.

606
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,840
Three.

607
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,760
Two.

608
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,230
One.

609
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,760
Changge.

610
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,760
I don't believe you really wanted me to leave.

611
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,870
If my death can relieve your hatred to my father,

612
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,520
I won't regret.

613
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,520
Changge.

614
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,430
Leyan.

615
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,040
Sorry.

616
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:27,910
Princess.

617
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,670
Why don't say anything?

618
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,520
Is it because Mr. Fang's strategy didn't work?

619
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,710
Your Majesty let me send Seal of Crown Prince here,

620
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,600
your Highness.

621
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,240
Anything abnormal?

622
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,360
Princess Yongan was here with some food.

623
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,280
I have checked.

624
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,040
Nothing abnormal.

625
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:43,800
Princess Yongan?

626
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,390
Right.

627
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,150
Princess?

628
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,230
- Somebody here.
- Yes.

629
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,230
Lock down Hongyi Palace.

630
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,320
The rest go after her with me.

631
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,230
Yes.

632
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,800
Princess.

633
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,560
Princess.

634
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,950
Princess.

635
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,980
Call the imperial doctor.

636
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,320
Your Highness.

637
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,430
Li Changge is the serious trouble of Tang.

638
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,150
Your Highness.

639
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,600
We found Princess' maidservant

640
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,000
fainted outside of the study.

641
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,280
The study?

642
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,470
Hurry.

643
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,390
Back to the study.

644
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,080
Keming.

645
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,520
It's gone.

646
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,870
Someone here.

647
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
You have to catch Li Changge.

648
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:47,950
Yes.

649
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,430
Go.

650
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,080
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

651
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,390
♫ gradually revives, ♫

652
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,670

654
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,560

The Long Ballad
