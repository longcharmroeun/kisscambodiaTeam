00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,099
♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,059
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,130
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,969
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,050
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,019
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,889
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,889
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,939
♫ To the distance. ♫

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,009
♫ The miserable past is like a dagger. ♫

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,819
♫ Though my wings are broken, ♫

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,940
♫ I will keep flying. ♫

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,299
♫ Following the light, ♫

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,459
♫ I'll forget you. ♫

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,259
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness. ♫

♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night, ♫

17
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,409
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad. ♫

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,369
♫ The river of life is under my feet. ♫

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,860

00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:32,799
The Long Ballad

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,558
Episode 26

22
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,720
Now my mother is dead,

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,359
I want to realize her last wish.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,960
I want to look at this world.

25
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,238
If father has a fit person to take charge of Eagle Division,

26
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,798
please ask him to take good care of Eagle Division.

27
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,838
Sun, on this grassland, apart from Sun,

28
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,759
no one is qualified to be the Tegin of Eagle Division.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,559
No matter where I go, Ashile Tribe would be in my heart forever.

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,928
Please let me go, Father!

31
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,729
Sun,

32
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,609
you know, father has cultivated you so hard since you were young,

33
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,809
I placed great hope on you.

34
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,289
Why are you flinching now, Sun?

35
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,329
I have been thinking that as long as I am strong enough,

36
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,288
I could protect everyone.

37
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,569
But now, I can hardly protect my own mother.

38
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:41,578
Maybe I am not the hero on this grassland.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
Please let your son go.

40
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,638
I don't want to compete with anyone.

41
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,039
Why do you improperly belittle yourself?

42
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,559
I have done my best.

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,600
If I knew this, I shouldn't have done those things.

44
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,400
Let me leave.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
Then I will let you go.

46
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,999
But you have to remember,

47
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:25,760
no matter where you are, your father loves you forever.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,879
Sun, I don't expect you to forgive me.

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,560
I just hope that after I leave, you would get rid of a burden.

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,079
Don't suffer from me.

51
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:48,999
Come on.

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,599
This girl is in some kind of trouble.

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,479
Everyone has his or her own difficulty.

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,800
Since she doesn't want to tell you, why bother to ask her?

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
That makes sense.

56
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:08,959
But, grandpa, can we change a horse when we get to the next town?

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,518
Look at this donkey, Little Gourd is about to give birth.

58
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,959
How could she drag us three?

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,078
It's too slow.

60
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,560
When can we arrive?

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,839
The donkey is good enough.

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,838
You, young people, have so much time left, why in such a hurry?

63
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,839
Drink tea.

64
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,879
Fine.

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,958
Do you know that due to your impulsion, Alir died,

66
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,359
what would the consequence be like?

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,919
I was wrong.

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,118
Please punish me, Uncle Khan.

69
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,119
Punish?

70
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,998
If I punish you, could Alir come back to life?

71
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:49,878
Do you know that Alir is the only one Sun cares about in his life?

72
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,199
The biggest advantage of Sun is not his ability to lead troops,

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,438
but he got the hearts of all the people in Eagle Division.

74
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,398
But from now on, I can never control Eagle Division.

75
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,639
Now Ashile Tribe is in disorder, and I lost my Eagle Division,

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,920
When can I get my strength back and fight the south?

77
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,959
Crap!

78
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,040
Just a bunch of crap!

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,558
The root cause of her disease is not just a wound,

80
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:32,919
but a mental trauma.

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,759
According to her pulse condition, she is dispirited,

82
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,118
with no hope for life.

83
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:45,080
She doesn't want to live, even the god can't help her.

84
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,438
Why are you looking at me?

85
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,799
I can only save her.

86
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,558
I can't heal her.

87
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,759
Nonsense.

88
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,919
Save, save.

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,039
You have to bring her back to life, so that it can be called save.

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,040
If she can't be brought to life, how can you say you've saved her?

91
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:06,479
I can just save her, but not cure her.

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,919
You have to make her move again now.

93
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,999
Move... move...

94
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,679
Since you two ask for no return, then I would leave now.

95
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,479
No, no!

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,039
You can't...

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,118
Chase her back.

98
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,999
A patient like her is hard to find.

99
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,479
Not bad, not bad!

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,379
Looks like a soft girl,

101
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,878
but act fast and violently when being attacked, A good student!

102
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,039
What are you doing?

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,919
Since you don't want to live, then I can slay you.

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,718
Why did you save me?

105
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,319
Right, why would I save you?

106
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,399
Then I should slay you.

107
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,039
Grandpa, she... she is moving.

108
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,838
But,

109
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,079
she spitted blood...

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Is that serious?

111
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,959
This way to arouse her desire of survival is a strong pill to sooth her depression.

112
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,640
You've found a snap course!

113
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,878
Since it works, then I have something to do on this way.

114
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,438
What?

115
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,760
Grandpa, I...

116
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,839
would be a master soon.

117
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,239
The famous Tegin of Eagle Division is resigning.

118
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,319
You said I was a coward.

119
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,639
I think you are more suitable in this title.

120
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,799
This is the best chance for you to put me to death.

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Why did you help me?

122
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,520
Believe it or not, I've never wanted to put you to death.

123
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,159
I see you as my biggest rival, indeed.

124
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,200
But we were also brothers, weren't we?

125
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,999
I didn't hate you at the beginning.

126
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,718
I've tried my best since young.

127
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,158
I really work hard on battlefields, I fought for Uncle Khan,

128
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,239
I tried my best to achieve success and earn the recognition of the whole grassland.

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,879
But no matter how hard I tried, and how well I behaved,

130
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,158
you were always ahead of me.

131
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,079
Every time you surpassed me in some aspects.

132
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,359
More and more people are talking behind my back,

133
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,158
they were saying that you were better than me.

134
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:00,719
It seemed like all my efforts were like a joke.

135
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,679
So the more they supported you, the more I hated you,

136
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,039
the more I wanted to compete with you.

137
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,979
But after all these things, I found out that

138
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,800
actually I didn't hate you,

139
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,600
but myself that was not as good as you.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,479
It was my obsessiveness that led to the situation now.

141
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,040
I admit that it's my fault.

142
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,398
So this is why you saved me?

143
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,158
If I really lost you, how boring would it be?

144
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,119
Don't expect my forgiveness.

145
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,158
I would never forget my mother's death.

146
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,638
Then stay and retaliate against me.

147
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,580
I said that, if it worked, you would have been dead now.

148
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,479
Did you leave Eagle Division for Li Changge?

149
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,399
The whole Eagle Division is no match for Li Changge?

150
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,078
As long as I am the Tegin of Eagle Division,

151
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,879
I will be responsible for it.

152
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
But Li Changge,

153
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,339
she is the one who I will protect by my life as Ashile Sun.

154
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,499
As soon as I settle Eagle Division down,

155
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,900
I will find her even if she is at the end of the world.

156
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,769
I think I know why I always lost to you.

157
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,610
Sher!

158
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,970
Where is Changge?

159
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:23,888
Tell me now!

160
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,009
Where is she?

161
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:32,169
Mimi...

162
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,729
- Please tell me where she is!
 - Stand up!

163
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,489
Please!

164
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,008
Tell me where she is.

165
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:36,568
Stand up.

166
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,128
You were the last one who saw her.

167
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,529
You must know it.

168
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,530
I...

169
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:43,929
Mimi!

170
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,929
Don't ask him!

171
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,368
He doesn't deserve it!

172
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:48,169
He won't tell you.

173
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,448
Sher...

174
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,930
I know who you are.

175
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,008
If you have any grudge, just vent it on me!

176
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:55,689
Changge is innocent.

177
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,448
She was in the south,

178
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,169
and saved by a man seemingly from the Central Plains.

179
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,969
I have no idea if she is alive or not.

180
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,129
Did you lie to me?

181
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,129
I will never lie to you.

182
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,368
This is what she left when she got saved.

183
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:27,369
Here you are.

184
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,090
This is Changge's wooden hairpin.

185
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,208
Send Su Yishe to search along the way to the south.

186
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,008
Don't miss any man from the Central Plains.

187
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:45,609
Yes.

188
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,610
Go quickly!

189
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,490
Changge!

190
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,170
Wait for me!

191
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,008
Khatun.

192
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,609
Aunt Alir's remains have been packed up.

193
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,050
How should we deal with it?

194
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,368
Burn it up.

195
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:27,369
Yes.

196
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:37,768
Khatun.

197
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,329
Are you missing the Central Plains?

198
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,889
The willows dance in the breeze in spring,

199
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,209
fireflies fly in the summer's night,

200
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,449
red autumnal leaves drifting along the stream,

201
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:02,530
the white snow covers the lantern and glass.

202
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:12,448
The central plain in my memories always has four distinctive seasons.

203
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:17,050
But in the south, even if it's in winter,

204
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:25,009
green grasses and trees are always on the lush mountains.

205
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,609
Just because of your longings for your homeland,

206
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,368
you gave birth to this trouble-making son.

207
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:37,688
Your boy is so foolish that he killed Alir!

208
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:39,089
Fine.

209
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,929
Now no one can keep Sun here, he wants nothing here!

210
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,448
And he is leaving me.

211
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,888
I put Alir in your tent, why didn't you take good care of her?

212
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:51,610
Now you two are unforgivable for making such a big trouble!

213
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,328
Please calm down, Khan!

214
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:59,888
Khan... I... I can die for my fault, but Sher...

215
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,929
Sher is always loyal to you, and to the prairie.

216
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,489
Maybe he is not good enough now.

217
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,568
But if you give him some time, and wait till he makes progress,

218
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:11,368
he could take the important mission of the grassland.

219
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,929
Please give him another chance, Khan.

220
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,849
Another chance?

221
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,489
Don't think that Sun leaves,

222
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,089
so I could pass all the things to your silly son!

223
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,448
A loser can never be the king of the grassland.

224
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:27,530
The glory of Khan always belongs to a powerful man!

225
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,489
The sad face again!

226
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,970
I hate you being like this!

227
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,008
From now on, you are grounded for a month.

228
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,009
Together with your silly boy, reflect on your faults deeply!

229
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:02,009
Remember, from now on, no these stuff again!

230
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,768
Tegin, good news.

231
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,888
We found the people from the Central Plains at the boundary of grasslands.

232
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,609
The guard once inquired a donkey cart,

233
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,649
with two men, a young and an old, as well as a young lady in there.

234
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,170
The old man said that they were the doctors going to the south.

235
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,170
It must be Changge.

236
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,929
Su Yishe, find some more details.

237
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,930
Yes.

238
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:35,569
That's so great!

239
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,489
Mu Jin.

240
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,489
Stay at Eagle Division.

241
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,049
Just as always, report to me as soon as you get news.

242
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,849
Sun.

243
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,289
I want to go with you.

244
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,448
I want to take Mimi with us too.

245
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:53,329
Many hands make light work.

246
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,489
No.

247
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,768
I need to do it on my own.

248
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,448
The big trouble made by Changge has just been eliminated.

249
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:06,049
If Khan finds out our action, we will be in trouble.

250
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,410
You and Mimi would be better to stay here.

251
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:10,608
Sun.

252
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,409
What about your wound?

253
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,050
I'm quite clear how my wound is now.

254
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,809
Mu Jin.

255
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,609
You are the only one I can rely on about Eagle Division.

256
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,368
Fine.

257
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,329
You won't listen to me anyway.

258
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,209
I must owe you something last life.

259
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,569
Find her back quickly.

260
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,209
Take care of yourself.

261
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,529
By the way, Where is Luo Shiba, who was taken here by Changge?

262
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,608
She has left since the day you came back from the court.

263
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:38,128
She believed that Changge was alive,

264
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,728
and said that she had to find her.

265
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:41,409
She was right.

266
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,049
Good.

267
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,249
The more concern there is,

268
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,369
the more hope it will be.

269
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,129
Sun.

270
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,009
Are you really into Changge?

271
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,089
If you don't want to say it, forget it.

272
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,450
Yes.

273
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,129
I'm saying,

274
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:10,369
yes.

275
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,050
I like her.

276
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,049
Then did you tell her?

277
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,088
Does she know it?

278
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:22,848
Is it necessary to tell her if you like someone?

279
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,289
Is it unnecessary?

280
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,609
What you do matters.

281
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,450
I think she will know it.

282
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:40,008
What a nice fur!

283
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:40,888
Leather of excellent quality.

284
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:42,008
Give me another blanket.

285
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,009
Okay.

286
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,008
Have you seen her?

287
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,128
No.

288
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:55,888
No.

289
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:56,889
Have you seen her?

290
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,849
You are so funny!

291
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,169
Have you seen her?

292
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,690
What are you drawing? No.

293
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:11,529
Have you seen her?

294
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,530
No.

295
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,689
Have you seen her?

296
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,008
No.

297
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:18,929
Have you seen her?

298
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,930
No.

299
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,289
Please enjoy it.

300
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,290
Okay.

301
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,649
Miss, are you looking for someone?

302
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,488
Let me have a look.

303
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:30,489
Have you seen her?

304
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,449
Is it a man or a woman?

305
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,968
Woman.

306
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,728
Can't you see it?

307
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:44,088
Yes, I can.

308
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,930
Your drawing is quite good.

309
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,888
It's a bit familiar.

310
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,248
Could you tell me how old she is?

311
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:52,409
I don't know.

312
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,888
The same with me, perhaps.

313
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:55,169
You are not friends?

314
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,768
Then why are you looking for her?

315
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,569
Does she owe you money?

316
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,449
No.

317
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,008
Then are you in a deep relationship?

318
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,649
No.

319
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,169
What's her name?

320
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,209
You should know this.

321
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,488
Then I can't tell you if I know her.

322
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:10,650
Her name is Li Changge.

323
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:14,128
Wait... I saw her.

324
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,129
Where is she?

325
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,330
Follow me.

326
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,289
Where is she?

327
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,929
Just ahead of us.

328
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,089
There, we are almost there.

329
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,128
Go ahead.

330
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:45,049
Just at the front.

331
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,170
Pass that door and we will see her.

332
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,488
Tell me the truth.

333
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:52,289
Who is your boss?

334
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,449
Who asked you to find Li Changge?

335
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,769
Are you from Chang'an?

336
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:06,728
Liar!

337
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:07,569
Lady... no, no...

338
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,728
Swordswoman! Don't be angry.

339
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,248
Just a misunderstanding.

340
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:11,368
Was she killed by you?

341
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:13,088
No, no. I am her friend.

342
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,290
How could I kill her?

343
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,488
Friend?

344
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:17,409
Yes, yes.

345
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,690
We were in the same camp.

346
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:20,889
What is a friend?

347
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,368
That's it.

348
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,129
Then I don't know what happened next.

349
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:37,769
I never thought that Young Master would have gone through this.

350
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,128
Young Master had a good luck!

351
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,728
She was captured by Ashile Tribe.

352
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,689
She could even made them such a mess.

353
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,488
Maybe not.

354
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:47,489
What do you mean?

355
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,209
We don't know if she is alive or not,

356
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,810
so we don't know if she has a good luck.

357
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:55,968
Believe me, Ms. Luo.

358
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:59,449
People of Yanxing Sect have been looking for her too.

359
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,809
We would finally find a way out.

360
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,849
Yanxing Sect?

361
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,728
We were the staff of the former governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng.

362
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:15,569
We are now following your master, and we are called Yanxing Sect.

363
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,968
We pretend to be a trade caravan.

364
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,849
You should believe us.

365
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,969
More people would be of more power.

366
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,930
It'd be hard for you to find her only by this drawing.

367
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,530
Why?

368
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,450
Anyway, we will look for her with you together.

369
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,049
Ms. Luo, since we are for the same goal,

370
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,488
we have to exchange our messages,

371
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:53,689
so that we can work together to find Young Master.

372
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,409
No matter who get the message first,

373
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,609
we have to contact each other through these codes on this paper.

374
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,690
Is that clear?

375
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,690
Take this too.

376
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,008
Miss, you'll be in danger if you go alone.

377
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:34,170
Do you need my protection?

378
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:46,489
Okay. Never mind.

379
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,608
Situ Langlang!

380
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,409
Is that enough?

381
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,049
No! Not enough!

382
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,169
Far away!

383
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,569
Taoist Sun is my creditor.

384
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,569
He asked me to train you to cure you.

385
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,008
I have to listen to him.

386
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:04,929
Cure?

387
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,088
You call this a cure?

388
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:06,728
Watch it!

389
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:08,089
If you get hurt, it won't be good.

390
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,488
Situ!

391
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:16,089
Your apprentice is quite good!

392
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,329
Stop, stop!

393
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,049
What... what student?

394
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,809
You take a long weapon, bullying a girl with no weapon.

395
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,169
How could you say you are a swordsman?

396
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,170
Bully you?

397
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,008
Since you have to counter with me everyday,

398
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,210
why not give me your weapon?

399
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:35,489
Of course I can.

400
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,650
So what?

401
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,289
Why you...

402
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,290
Again!

403
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,529
How is it?

404
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,530
Am I superior?

405
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,249
Little girl, would you like to be my apprentice?

406
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:21,968
We are at the same age.

407
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:23,330
I won't take you as my master.

408
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:26,169
Don't say it.

409
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,289
It's been hard for me to find an apprentice.

410
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,488
Think about it.

411
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:32,289
Yue Maiden's Swordsmanship has to be inherited.

412
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,329
If I learn it, can I conquer all enemies,

413
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,529
and kill all the enemies in the battlefield?

414
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,529
Of course, so easy.

415
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,329
If it's true, if you can help me with my revenge,

416
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,890
then I'd like to take you as my master.

417
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:53,049
Forget it.

418
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:53,848
I won't do it.

419
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:54,929
You didn't hear it.

420
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,209
Wait!

421
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,128
You haven't taught me. How do you know that I can't?

422
00:25:58,129 --> 00:26:00,329
I've heard from what you said.

423
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,728
We are in a different world, you can't learn it.

424
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:03,968
Don't waste our time.

425
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:05,248
I don't believe it.

426
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:07,848
You are so stubborn.

427
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,169
Fine, I'll teach you.

428
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,768
But you know what, you can't learn it.

429
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:15,669
I'm Li Changge.

430
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,390
Thanks for teaching me swordsmanship, Situ.

431
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,650
Fine.

432
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,608
She just recovered, so don't make her too tired.

433
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:31,849
Grandpa... I also worked hard, why don't you care about me?

434
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:37,968
Little girl, I have a student, he was asking me for a diagnosis.

435
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:39,930
Would you come with us to Luoyang?

436
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,530
Luoyang?

437
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:46,289
I said you should leave first.

438
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,329
If you didn't have to take care of me,

439
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,729
you would already be in Luoyang.

440
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:56,169
If I didn't have you, I would already died.

441
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,728
Don't say that.

442
00:26:57,729 --> 00:26:59,049
We will soon arrive in Luoyang.

443
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,450
As soon as we arrive, I will find you a good doctor.

444
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,449
Don't brag.

445
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,368
It's said the doctor in Luoyang is very expensive...

446
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:08,529
Xiao Wu!

447
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,608
Come on to my back.

448
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:11,049
Come on.

449
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,128
No, no.

450
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:14,368
I am a strong man.

451
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,449
How could I let a girl carry me?

452
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,929
Where can I put my dignity as a man?

453
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,689
- Come on.
 - Help!

454
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,169
No.

455
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,248
Help!

456
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:21,570
Help! Help!

457
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:27,209
Don't beat him!

458
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,210
Don't beat him!

459
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,090
You are also the refugees from the north?

460
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,088
Don't be afraid.

461
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:42,449
He is not a good man.

462
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,368
Just a bad official in the government.

463
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:46,049
You're lucky to meet us.

464
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,768
Go!

465
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,209
Let's divide our grains!

466
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,210
Go!

467
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,008
Let's go.

468
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,129
Follow them and have a look.

469
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,008
We have food, folks!

470
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,128
We have food!

471
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:15,488
Mine. mine!

472
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:17,049
Don't grab mine!

473
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,608
Don't grab mine!

474
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,609
I want it!

475
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,929
Folks!

476
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,449
Look at this bad official!

477
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,888
He was transferring so many grains, but refused to give us any.

478
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:31,289
How could he do that?

479
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,569
Since he wants to starve us to death,

480
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,529
then it's not wrong for us to grab this!

481
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,809
Yes, we were right!

482
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,649
We did a right thing!

483
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,488
Do you know why did they refuse to give us food?

484
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:44,529
Why? Why?

485
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,209
Why?

486
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,410
Now the distinguished are in power, we normal folks have no way to go.

487
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:53,809
Now we are in such a disaster, so many innocent people are in trouble.

488
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,368
Those nobles and officials in Luoyang even feed their dogs with meat,

489
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,449
instead of sharing food with poor people.

490
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,488
So even death would not expiate the crimes of these men.

491
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:05,888
Yes, yes!

492
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:06,889
You're wrong!

493
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:12,529
What's wrong?

494
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,968
We have no food now because of the natural disaster.

495
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,569
It's been desolate soil along the way here.

496
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,569
No food can be produced.

497
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,728
We can't avoid the natural disaster,

498
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,248
while man-made calamity is evitable.

499
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:23,128
Now you grab these grains,

500
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,889
those who are waiting for it would be starved to death.

501
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:31,209
If not, we would be starved to death.

502
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,368
Yes, yes!

503
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:33,329
We would die!

504
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:33,848
Yes!

505
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:34,689
It would be us instead.

506
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,729
But you should not kill them.

507
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,409
They just transferred these grains as asked from afar to earn their wages.

508
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,488
He might need to support a whole family.

509
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:48,008
They are also the friends, families and brothers of others.

510
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,089
They also have families waiting for him to go back.

511
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,848
What a miserable wretch!

512
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:00,728
She is taking for the government even in this situation.

513
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,569
If you don't want to eat it, then don't!

514
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,449
Piss off!

515
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,008
Get away!

516
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:05,768
Get away!

517
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:06,689
Get away! Don't stay here!

518
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,449
Piss off!

519
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,248
Go! Go!

520
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:09,128
Piss off!

521
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:10,488
Piss off!

522
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:12,209
Come on, distribute the grains.

523
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,210
Come on, come on.

524
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,430
Stop.

525
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:30,050
Grandpa, have you ever seen her?

526
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,248
What happened these days?

527
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,169
Someone asked me with a painting, too.

528
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,689
What a coincidence!

529
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,569
You are looking for the same person.

530
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,570
Where did he go?

531
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,050
Who are you?

532
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:18,329
It has been a long time since we met.

533
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,330
It's you.

534
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,810
Since you have made it to Yunzhou, please hold on.

535
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:51,930
I will find you.

536
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,848
It's been a tough time for you.

537
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:02,809
You haven't even had any water.

538
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,008
Hold on.

539
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,129
We will find the princess.

540
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,888
Your Majesty, Hao Du sent a message,

541
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:39,329
Princess Yongan once appeared in Yunzhou.

542
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,369
It's said that she went to Luoyang with a refugee.

543
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,050
Okay.

544
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:56,849
I knew that Yan would be alright.

545
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,809
Mr. Du, please stand up!

546
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,329
Pass my order,

547
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,608
Dispatch more people to find Yan in Yunzhou and Luoyang.

548
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,209
She has to be found quickly!

549
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,968
Send her back safely to me!

550
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,728
No worries, your Majesty!

551
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:14,929
I had already arranged this as soon as I got the message.

552
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,008
Princess Yongan must can turn ill luck into good.

553
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:21,368
Don't be too anxious about it, your Majesty.

554
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:25,410
How can I calm down under such a situation?

555
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,810
The disaster is getting worse and worse.

556
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,129
More and more refugees are coming out.

557
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:35,488
It's fairly good here in Chang'an,

558
00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:38,968
but Luoyang is full of refugees and starved bodies now.

559
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:42,728
It's too wretched to hear such a situation.

560
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:47,809
Now the most important thing is to calm down refugees.

561
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:54,089
All the people of Tang are my subjects, I am so worried.

562
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:56,930
But I have no time for them.

563
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,088
Mr. Du,

564
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:05,649
would it be good to arrange my prince to calm refugees in Luoyang for me?

565
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,329
Your Majesty loves people deeply.

566
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,088
If you dispatch prince to do that,

567
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:15,689
I believe people in Luoyang would feel your sincerity.

568
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,450
But prince is too mischievous, I can't rely upon him.

569
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:24,930
I have to dispatch someone to go with him, and take care of him.

570
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:32,528
Send Mr. Wei to go with him, he is a careful and prudent man.

571
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:37,288
Prince can't be too outrageous with him by his side.

572
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:38,128
Yes.

573
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:44,410
Your Majesty, after I finish my work, I will head to Luoyang too.

574
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,888
What are you going to do in Luoyang?

575
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,808
Although Ashile Tribe has already retreated,

576
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:52,888
but the peace can't last long.

577
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,649
We would have a fight sooner or later.

578
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:59,489
I think I am not good enough for this issue,

579
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,769
and I am not feeling good recently.

580
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,128
I want to head to Luoyang and

581
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:09,649
find someone more suitable for the position of Minister of War.

582
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,048
Who is it?

583
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:12,729
The abandoned talent of Sui dynasty.

584
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,250
Li Jing, Li Yaoshi.

585
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:28,170
Sister, have some rest.

586
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,848
No, I'm okay.

587
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:34,848
You can't even tell lies.

588
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,289
You are already sweatened.

589
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:40,048
Xiao Wu.

590
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:41,009
Sister.

591
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,010
Xiao Wu.

592
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:45,808
Forget it.

593
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,209
You're tired.

594
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:47,729
Xiao Wu.

595
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,528
Let me walk.

596
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:50,848
Don't say that.

597
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,328
We are almost there in Luoyang.

598
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:53,329
Just ahead of...

599
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,288
Xiao Wu!

600
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,368
Xiao Wu, don't sleep, Xiao Wu!

601
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,689
Xiao Wu, don't sleep, Xiao Wu!

602
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,649
Xiao Wu, wake up!

603
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,209
It's my order, don't sleep!

604
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,649
Xiao Wu!

605
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,088
Sister...

606
00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:10,888
You...

607
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:12,889
Are you really a princess?

608
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,608
Yes, I am.

609
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:19,888
When we arrive at Luoyang, you can have anything you want.

610
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:21,489
Think about what you want most now.

611
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,490
Don't sleep!

612
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:25,129
I...

613
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:31,209
I want you to reward me a lot of rice.

614
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,730
I haven't eaten rice...

615
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,689
Okay.

616
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,169
I will reward you a cart of rice.

617
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,050
I would let you have as much as you want, okay?

618
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,328
Okay.

619
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,769
If you really are a princess,

620
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,770
you must be the best princess in this world.

621
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:57,608
Good Xiao Wu, we are arriving at Luoyang, Luoyang is just ahead of us.

622
00:36:57,609 --> 00:36:59,369
Everything will be okay when we arrive.

623
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,410
Come on.

624
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,390
[Eastern Palace]

625
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:41,849
Wei Shuyu is here to welcome your Highness.

626
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,169
Wei Shuyu!

627
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,729
Which prince in this world is like this on his royal progress?

628
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,689
Look.

629
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,848
Look at this.

630
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:52,888
No flags, no servants, no vigour.

631
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,528
Isn't it a humiliation for me?

632
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:56,608
Please calm down, your Highness.

633
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,249
His Majesty always refrains from extravagance strictly.

634
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,729
You are on this inspection tour for your father,

635
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,528
you should also be frugal.

636
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:04,088
Now the disaster in Luoyang is urgent.

637
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:06,048
If you could set a good example,

638
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:08,409
and show your determination of tiding over the difficulties with people,

639
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,250
people would extol your merits and virtues.

640
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:15,689
But should I be frugal to this extent?

641
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,649
You see.

642
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,048
This carriage is going to fall apart.

643
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:21,489
Why not ask me to ride to Luoyang?

644
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,009
It can't fall apart, even if it does,

645
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,769
we can change a new one at the courier station.

646
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,528
Please set off quickly.

647
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:28,769
The earlier you start,

648
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,328
the earlier you can send your father's bounties to refugees.

649
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:34,528
So that your Highness and his Majesty can show your concern to refugees.

650
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,088
But I am not the Dragon King.

651
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:39,209
Would it rain as soon as I arrive?

652
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,608
I've already prepared to go traveling.

653
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,009
Now I can't.

654
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,649
What a good timing!

655
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,969
Why was my father in such a hurry?

656
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,969
He drove me away so anxiously.

657
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,969
I even had no time to take my toys!

658
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,888
Prince!

659
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:53,889
Please!

660
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,808
I must be the poorest crown prince in this world!

661
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,450
I must be!

662
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:37,450
Sister,

663
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,450
are we in Luoyang now?

664
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:43,489
Almost there, Xiao Wu.

665
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,049
Luoyang is ahead of us.

666
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,568
Sister.

667
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:51,489
Did you hear it?

668
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,569
Mom was calling me.

669
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,489
Xiao Wu.

670
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,009
Ask your mother to wait for you.

671
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,328
Don't find your mother now.

672
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:04,450
I'm taking you to Luoyang.

673
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,249
Xiao Wu.

674
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,009
You see.

675
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,608
See that pass?
 [Luoyang]

676
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:20,209
As long as we pass it, we will arrive at Luoyang.

677
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,490
Then I will take you to eat rice.

678
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,410
Sister,

679
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:29,769
it's so good to have you.

680
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:34,410
Rice... so delicious!

I'll take you there, I'll let you eat rice soon.

♫ Those years ♫

686
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,729
Stop.

687

Magistrate has an order, the dead people can't come in,

688
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:16,689
for the prevention of the plague.

689
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:20,009
No dead man here.

690
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,010
The boy on your back is dead,

691
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,450
you can pass, not him.

692
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:28,089
He is alive.

693
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,969
Take him off!

694
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,209
What are you doing?

695
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,009
What are you doing?

696
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,009
Let me go!

What?

704
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,930
You dare to fight with officials!

705

Xiao Wu...

706
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:49,568
Open your eyes!

Piss off!

708
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:51,529
Yes!

709
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,328
Look at me!

710
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:55,329

Why am I so useless?

718

If I was a bit faster, if I worked harder,

719
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:25,209
Xiao Wu could have survived.

720
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,128
Why?

721
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:28,849

00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:25,230
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

735
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,749
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

736
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:36,229
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

737
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,709
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

738
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,629
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

739
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,029
♫ the longing flows. ♫

740
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,669
♫ There's always a moment ♫

741
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:54,509
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

742
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,829
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

743
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:04,629
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

744
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,629
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

745
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,149
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

746
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:13,429
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

747
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,149
♫ layer after layer. ♫

748
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,109
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

749
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:24,190
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

750
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,669
♫ There's always a moment ♫

751
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,549
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

752
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,109
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

753
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:48,629
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

754
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,829
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

755
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,189
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

756
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,909
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

757
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,909
♫ layer after layer. ♫

758
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,349
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

759
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:07,990
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

760
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,950
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

761
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:31,150
The Long Ballad
