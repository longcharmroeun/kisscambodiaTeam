♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,950
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,919
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,789

Episode 25

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,529
Let go of my mother.

23
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:51,609
Now that you kneel down, what about a kowtow to amuse us?

24
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,609
Do you think your dignity's more important than her life?

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,680
Mother!

26
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,798
♫ The past can't be blown away; the moonlight can't be forgotten ♫

27
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,799
Run away.

28
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,798
Hurry.

29
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,919
Mother!

30
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,358
Mother!

31
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:03,359
Mother!

32
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,840
Let's see the doctor, okay, mother?

33
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,119
I'll kill them!

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,238
I'll kill them!

35
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,998
I'll kill them!

36
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,200
I'll kill them!

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,718
Mother.

38
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,239
Mother, let me take you home, okay?

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,659
Mother!

40
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,559
♫ If the moonlight can't be seen in the heart ♫

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,719

47
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:28,399
Ashile Sher!

48
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,119
Young Khan.

49
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,718
Did you kill her?

50
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:37,838
No, I didn't.

51
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,839
It was she...

52
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,480
It's too late.

53
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:18,118
Sun.

54
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,079
Sun.

55
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,558
Sun.

56
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,278
Sun.

57
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,479
Tegin Sun.

58
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,479
- Tegin Sun.
 - Sun.

59
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,878
Find Tegin Sun in all directions.

60
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,319
Hurry.

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,199
Guard Alir.

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,799
Sun.

63
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,519
Find Tegin Sun.

64
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,079
Sun.

65
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,998
Sun.

66
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,320
Hurry. Sun.

67
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
No!

68
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,438
Mother!

69
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,158
Mother!

70
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,878
Sher.

71
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,959
Mother, are you okay?

72
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,319
Step aside.

73
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,519
No, Sun.

74
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,519
I'm begging you.

75
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,039
For the sake of my relationship with Alir for years, I'm begging you.

76
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,599
Don't hurt Sher.

77
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Ashile Sun,

78
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,398
Alir died because of me.

79
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,759
Just kill me.

80
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,998
Don't hurt my mother.

81
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:18,799
No.

82
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
I'm his mother.

83
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,878
I can die for him.

84
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,639
Don't hurt him.

85
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
No!

86
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,158
Mother.

87
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,678
It's okay.

88
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:57,519
Sher, are you okay?

89
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,438
Are you okay?

90
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,479
Khatun.

91
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,159
Khatun, are you okay?

92
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,080
Guards, take Ashile Sun.

93
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,550
Sun.

94
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:19,199
Eagle Division Vanguard is here.

95
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,718
Take Tegin back.

96
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:21,550
Take Tegin back.

97
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:22,734
Who dares ask for troubles?

98
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,839
Guards, escort Khatun and Young Khan back.

99
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,359
Don't let them go.

100
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,079
- Take Sher down.
 - Yes.

101
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,878
Sun.

102
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,718
Su Yishe.

103
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,359
Piss off.

104
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,239
Sun, calm down.

105
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,758
Sun.

106
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,759
Calm down?

107
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,652
I told you not to act recklessly. Did you listen to me?

108
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:49,050
If you hadn't been stubborn, how could it be like this?

109
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,800
If you hadn't been stubborn, how could my mother have died?

110
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,319
Mu Jin, take him away.

111
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,799
Assemble the Wolf Division and chase them.

112
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,719
Wait, let them go.

113
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,339
The capital was in chaos, and Khatun was badly hurt.

114
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,560
How can you account for this?

115
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Chase them back.

116
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,398
Go.

117
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,318
Go.

118
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:34,319
Go.

119
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,879
Stop.

120
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,679
What's up?

121
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,679
Mu Jin, there's a dry river bed.

122
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,119
You can hide inside.

123
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,399
And Shiba, protect Alir's body.

124
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,559
What about you?

125
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,398
I'll take the troop to the right.

126
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,239
You wanna distract the Wolf Division?

127
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,309
Yes.

128
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,799
After I distract them, take Sun to see a doctor.

129
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,599
No.

130
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,958
After Sun wakes up, he'll blame me.

131
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,479
No, he won't.

132
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,359
I caused his mother's death, and involved Eagle Division.

133
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,078
He must hold a grudge against me.

134
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,919
It's too risky.

135
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,249
Mu Jin, Eagle Division is inseparable from Sun.

136
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,240
You're the only one who can protect Sun.

137
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:21,169
He'll be clear of the charges Sher accused him of

138
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,158
when Great Khan's back.

139
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,198
Only you can protect Sun well.

140
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,879
Go.

141
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,758
There's no time. Go!

142
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,879
Eagle Division Vanguard, listen to Military Counsellor Li.

143
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,679
Yes.

144
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Go.

145
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,480
Eagle Division Vanguard, go ahead with me.

146
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,519
Go.

147
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,679
Wake up, bastard!

148
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Don't sleep.

149
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Go.

150
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Go.

151
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,079
Stop.

152
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,159
Go.

153
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,638
Military Counsellor, what's up?

154
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,529
Listen to my order, in line with Ashile Tribe's rules,

155
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,439
captives from their own tribe won't be killed.

156
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,758
If Wolf Division arrives, don't resist desperately.

157
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,949
Surrender once being caught.

158
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,638
For the sake of Eagle Division and Tegin Sun, save yourselves.

159
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,318
What about you?

160
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,239
They won't let go of me for I released Luo Yi.

161
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,999
Don't worry about me. I'll run away then.

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But...

163
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,958
Remember what I said.

164
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,638
Save yourself.

165
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,078
I'm not under Eagle Division now.

166
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,119
Don't worry about me.

167
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Go.

168
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,439
Go.

169
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,158
Go.

170
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,159
Go.

171
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,519
- Chase them respectively.
 - Yes.

172
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Go.

173
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,398
What's wrong?

174
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,519
What happened to Tegin?

175
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,710
Mu Jin, what happened to Tegin?

176
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:58,670
Go find witch doctor.

177
00:12:58,671 --> 00:12:59,758
I'll go now.

178
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,759
Witch doctor.

179
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,479
Mu Jin.

180
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,919
Mu Jin, wait.

181
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,065
What's wrong with Tegin Sun?

182
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:09,899
Where's Changge?

183
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,518
Why isn't Changge back with you?

184
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,839
I've no time to explain to you.

185
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,759
Where's she?

186
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,799
Put me down.

187
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,518
Put me down.

188
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,398
Tegin Sun.

189
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,399
Sun.

190
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,519
Where's my mother?

191
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,159
Where's my mother?

192
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,399
We've taken Alir's body back.

193
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
I wanna see her.

194
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,959
Mu Jin, take me to see her.

195
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Mother.

196
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,959
I failed to protect you well.

197
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,360
I know father took you hostage

198
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,199
and connived at Sher's fight with me.

199
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,000
I thought as long as...

200
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,680
as long as I pretend not caring much about you, you'd not be involved.

201
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,399
But I was wrong.

202
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,440
If I had known it,

203
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,959
I'd bring you back even if I disobey Father

204
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,829
or give up everything.

205
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,786
The victory or loss is far less important

206
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,920
than the well-being of families and clansmen.

207
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,199
Mother, you may rest assured.

208
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,639
From now on, I won't be reckless,

209
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,839
or do things causing killing sprees.

210
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,880
Now I just want to protect the ones I want to protect

211
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,560
from sufferings like you.

212
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,240
Please rest assured.

213
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,120
I can only pay my debt of gratitude to you in my next life.

214
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,519
Take the medicine.

215
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,159
Sit down.

216
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
What about others?

217
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,479
Su Yishe and other men are captured by Wolf Division,

218
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,679
but not in danger.

219
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,319
What about Li Changge?

220
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,310
Did she return to Central Plains?

221
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:36,311
She...

222
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,678
She got separated from Su Yishe.

223
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,119
I've sent men to find her.

224
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,400
Luo Shiba went as well.

225
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Got separated?

226
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
What do you mean?

227
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,918
Tell me.

228
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,558
She distracted Wolf Division's soldiers.

229
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,600
Now... Now she's missing.

230
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,159
Sun, you haven't recovered.

231
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,479
You've to have a rest.

232
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,038
I must find her.

233
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,558
Don't stop me.

234
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,198
Sun.

235
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,599
Sun.

236
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,558
Changge finally secured your life.

237
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,199
Are you asking for death?

238
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,918
I've lost my mother.

239
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,610
I can't lose her.

240
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:19,479
She's unfamiliar with grasslands.

241
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,839
She can't survive.

242
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,838
Li Changge said you must keep alive,

243
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,678
and can't make her efforts in vain.

244
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,639
Neither can I.

245
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,558
I've sent all men to find her.

246
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,558
I'll go as well, and keep you abreast of news.

247
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,480
You must be alive to wait for her return.

248
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,399
Mimi.

249
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,359
Mimi.

250
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,879
Where're you going?

251
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,078
I wanna find Changge.

252
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,639
How can you find her without knowing her position?

253
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,718
Everyone's looking for her.

254
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,678
Why can't I?

255
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,599
Being out of the capital, Changge must be heading for Eagle Division.

256
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,999
I believe as long as she's alive,

257
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,678
she'll even crawl her way to meet me.

258
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,718
I wanna find her.

259
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,719
Let me accompany you.

260
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,718
How's it going with Khatun?

261
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,399
Thank Sirius.

262
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,999
Finally the arrow was taken out.

263
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Khatun's out of danger.

264
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,038
Great.

265
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:54,558
Young Khan, it's not convenient for you to step close.

266
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,799
Now that Khatun's out of danger, you may as well go back first.

267
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,198
All of you can step in and out to help and look after her except me.

268
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:16,479
Young Khan, we're all grateful for Khatun's kindness in daily life.

269
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,838
In such a clutch, we'll take good care of her for sure.

270
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,318
Young Khan, don't worry.

271
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:29,038
If Great Khan knows you're standing here, Khatun will be in trouble.

272
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,240
Just go back.

273
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:35,439
I'll go.

274
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,760
Young Khan as I am,

275
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,280
I've no right to visit my mother.

276
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,360
I'm not Young Khan at all.

277
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,799
Threatening me with a woman, Sher, you're a coward!

278
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Mother!

279
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,199
Ashile Sun,

280
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,240
how could we be like this?

281
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,359
What've we been doing all these years for?

282
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,558
If I were not Young Khan, and you hadn't gone to Eagle Division,

283
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,120
would we be friends?

284
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Young Khan.

285
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,969
Most of the cavalry of Eagle Division

286
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,239
breaking into the capital have been captured in prison.

287
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,958
Where's Ashile Sun?

288
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,599
We didn't find him in the pursuit.

289
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,679
According to the scout, he returned to Eagle Division.

290
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:07,078
I know he won't die that easily.

291
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,839
This time, we lost the golden chance to kill him.

292
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,760
It'll be much harder for us to kill him.

293
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,759
It seems you're more desperate to kill him than me.

294
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Isn't it our goal to uproot Eagle Division?

295
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,918
Is your heart softened?

296
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:27,919
I...

297
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,519
No, it isn't.

298
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,159
Don't you forget Great Khan's expectation of you?

299
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,479
You'll never be satisfied with being outperformed

300
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
by Ashile Sun, right?

301
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,159
I don't know if you can meet Khatun after defeating Ashile Sun,

302
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,038
but I can tell for sure.

303
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,520
If you can't win, Great Khan'll never allow you to meet Khatun.

304
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,798
Don't forget without Khatun's protecting you from the arrow,

305
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,399
Ashile Sun's arrow'd have pierced your throat.

306
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Did he show mercy on you?

307
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,199
Young Khan, the kindness to the enemy is the cruelty to yourself.

308
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,759
If Khatun hadn't been that lucky,

309
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,438
you'd have lost your mother forever today.

310
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,439
Enough.

311
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,640
I don't need you to remind me.

312
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,719
Where's Li Changge?

313
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,840
When we surrounded her, a skilled swordsman

314
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:36,448
suddenly popped up from nowhere.

315
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,718
Is he from Eagle Division?

316
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:53,639
No.

317
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,759
He's dressed like a man from Central Plains.

318
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,919
I followed them secretly.

319
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,078
Judging from the donkey's hooves, they went straight south

320
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,438
instead of heading for Eagle Division.

321
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,318
Does anyone else know about it?

322
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,559
Except the men searching for her from Wolf Division, no one knows.

323
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
Changge,

324
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:35,679
where're you?

325
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,159
Though she's a woman, she's a hero,

326
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,958
and a true warrior in Eagle Division.

327
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,718
All the men in Eagle Division will remember her.

328
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:51,318
I don't want her to be a hero.

329
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:56,038
I just hope she can return safe and sound.

330
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,039
She will.

331
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,480
She likes Eagle Division and you so much.

332
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,078
She'll return anyway.

333
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,479
She's a bastard never knowing how to take care of herself,

334
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,600
but only knowing to press herself.

335
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,198
Mu Jin, I'm really afraid.

336
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,879
Changge shouldn't die.

337
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,400
I believe she'll be okay for sure.

338
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,120
Yes, you're right.

339
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,798
- Maybe our men have found her and taken her back, right?
 - Yes.

340
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,678
Maybe she's in Eagle Division now.

341
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,679
Let me take you back.

342
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,273
If you hadn't been stubborn, how could it be like this?

343
00:26:59,274 --> 00:27:02,120
If you hadn't been stubborn, how could my mother have died?

344
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,079
I didn't mean it.

345
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:14,959
Sun.

346
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,520
Any news?

347
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,719
With so many men having searched so many places,

348
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,119
if she hasn't been found, she may have been captured by Wolf Division.

349
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,760
If so, what's your plan?

350
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,438
How's it going with my mother?

351
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:46,198
Don't worry.

352
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:48,479
Khatun's getting better.

353
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,718
She just took the medicine and fell asleep.

354
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,558
Alright.

355
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,400
- You may leave.
 - Yes.

356
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Unexpectedly, it's you.

357
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,537
You still remember the previous password.

358
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:41,078
I didn't mean to kill Alir.

359
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,079
In fact, I...

360
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,359
You killed my mother.

361
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,640
Don't mention her!

362
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,159
It's... It's an accident.

363
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,999
Accident?

364
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,079
My mother died for your accident.

365
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,559
Sher,

366
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,639
is victory or loss that important to you?

367
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Isn't it important?

368
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,959
Because you're the one who always wins.

369
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:15,639
Ashile Sher, till when can you understand?

370
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,950
Whether Young Khan or Tegin, it's not only a title,

371
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:20,689
but also the responsibility on our shoulders

372
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,531
for the future of the grassland.

373
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,838
At this point, you're still talking about the false

374
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,600
and ridiculous victory with me.

375
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,144
Naive!

376
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,573
Since our childhood, you've always been so naive.

377
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,120
The moment my mother passed away, no,

378
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:45,039
even now, I wish I could tear you to pieces.

379
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,199
But I won't.

380
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,159
Because I can't change anything by killing you.

381
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,119
I can't get my mother back by killing you.

382
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Understand?

383
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:05,839
Revenge and killing

384
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,520
can only bring endless pains and fights.

385
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,760
I've nothing left to talk to you.

386
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,480
Let go of my men in Eagle Division and Li Changge.

387
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,000
Just target at me.

388
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,770
You've got the wrong person.

389
00:30:24,771 --> 00:30:26,289
I can release the men in Eagle Division,

390
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,838
but Li Changge isn't in my hand.

391
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,927
What?

392
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:32,718
Wolf Division didn't capture her, believe it or not.

393
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,879
Where did she go?

394
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
I don't know!

395
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,789
The grassland is full of dangers, with quicksand, swamp,

396
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,119
poisonous snakes and beasts.

397
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
She runs away alone.

398
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:44,309
Do you think it's possible for her to survive?

399
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,798
I experienced life and death with her.

400
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,438
She can't die so easily.

401
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:48,959
Go find her yourself!

402
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,079
Don't be so worried.

403
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,558
Sun.

404
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,559
Any news?

405
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,160
Sher said Changge wasn't in his hand.

406
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,519
How can you believe in Sher?

407
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,519
It seems not to be a lie.

408
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,959
Did Changge really have an accident?

409
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,558
No.

410
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,798
I believe she won't die so easily.

411
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,119
Yes.

412
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,798
Changge won't die this easily.

413
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,400
Let's find her until we make it.

414
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,558
She is awake.

415
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:18,959
As I said, she may not live long, but she won't die this soon.

416
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Who're you?

417
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,429
Where am I?

418
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,430
Don't you remember?

419
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,959
No, I don't.

420
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:47,879
Unbelievable.

421
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,519
Her head didn't get injured.

422
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,759
How come?

423
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,079
It's unreasonable.

424
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,078
Alright.

425
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,838
If you don't remember, let me tell you.

426
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,239
I'm Situ Langlang, a swordsman.

427
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,999
This is Taoist Sun, my creditor.

428
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,318
We just passed by.

429
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,759
I saved you a half-dead from Ashile Tribe,

430
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,999
and he found ways to save you a half-dead.

431
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,119
That's it.

432
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,759
No need to say something like

433
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,558
repaying our favors even after your death.

434
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:25,360
We get used to healing the wounded and rescuing the dying.

435
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,599
Li Changge, how powerful do you think you're?

436
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,798
Now Luo Yi's dead.

437
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,279
You got yourself, Eagle Division and I involved.

438
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,664
It's the result of your stubbornness.

439
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:39,349
If you hadn't been stubborn, how could my mother have died?

440
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:46,959
Leave me alone.

441
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:56,719
Sorry, Sun.

442
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,640
I caused your mother's death.

443
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,599
- Ask Sher here.
 - Yes.

444
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,229
What?

445
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,640
Who told you to report to Great Khan?

446
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:22,959
For such a big deal, others will report to Great Khan if I won't.

447
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,238
It's my duty not to get Wolf Division involved.

448
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,239
But...

449
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,079
But Alir is my mother's slave.

450
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,758
What if mother gets involved?

451
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:37,038
It depends on how you explain to Great Khan.

452
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,439
What you said is the fact.

453
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,960
Great Khan'll believe you.

454
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,880
But Alir died because of me.

455
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:52,679
Why must you... Why must you keep it in mind?

456
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,998
She's just a slave.

457
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,120
Just?

458
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,207
I haven't been able to meet mother for years.

459
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,719
It was Alir who sent letters for us,

460
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,758
so that we can know about each other.

461
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:04,719
Mother and I owe a debt of gratitude to her.

462
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,318
I acted so recklessly that I threatened Ashile Sun with Alir.

463
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:09,879
I regret it very much.

464
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,680
What's more, Alir is Ashile Sun's foster mother.

465
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,199
Why can't I return her favor?

466
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,599
You remember her favor,

467
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,160
but forget Khatun's sufferings and tears for years?

468
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,599
How has Great Khan treated Khatun?

469
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,640
Don't you know it?

470
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,838
As long as you have power, you'll soon get reunited with Khatun,

471
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,519
and free her from sufferings.

472
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,798
Ashile Sun is the biggest obstacle to

473
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:41,479
your grasp of the supreme power in the grassland.

474
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,364
Your mercy on him is your mercilessness on Khatun.

475
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,640
You can't be swayed by his words.

476
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,759
Young Khan, Great Khan asked to see you.

477
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,758
Uncle Khan, I'm sorry for my neglect of duty.

478
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,318
I beg your pardon.

479
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:21,879
As for Luo Yi, I've killed him.

480
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,078
Please go check with me, Uncle Khan.

481
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,640
Assemble all the crack soldiers in Wolf Division,

482
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:29,002
prepare bows and crossbows, and go with me.

483
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,318
What for?

484
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,038
Ashile Sun rescued the capture of Tang

485
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,639
and shot Khatun when I was away.

486
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,160
I can't keep such an alienated guy anymore.

487
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Uncle Khan.

488
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,479
I've a thing to report.

489
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,959
Eat first.

490
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,838
You don't sleep, drink or eat.

491
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,279
Before being punished by Great Khan, you'll collapse first.

492
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,159
What's this?

493
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,399
It shows the pastures and waters I found before.

494
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,798
If... If one day the capital forsakes Eagle Division,

495
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:37,559
move our men out to these places.

496
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,278
Sun, I know what your plan is.

497
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:43,856
There's no if.

498
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:46,318
You won't be with our Eagle Division later?

499
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:51,440
Are you gonna settle everything here and then leave, aren't you?

500
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,599
I'm busy now.

501
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,318
Go out.

502
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:56,319
I won't.

503
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,199
Are you gonna shoulder all things alone?

504
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,359
What do you think of me?

505
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,240
What do you think of our men in Eagle Division?

506
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:06,999
- Tegin.
 - What's up?

507
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,679
According to our scout, the men from the capital are coming

508
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,489
with banners of Great Khan and Wolf Division.

509
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,720
They will be here soon.

510
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,039
There seems no need for my explanation.

511
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,360
Sun, what about assembling all the cavalry?

512
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:39,479
No.

513
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,000
A war can only badly undermine Eagle Division.

514
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:47,879
I'll protect each and every one of you.

515
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Mu Jin,

516
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:56,440
remember, no matter what you see or hear later, don't act recklessly.

517
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,920
Listen to my orders.

518
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
Besides,

519
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,200
prepare to welcome a new Tegin.

520
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,439
In Eagle Division, I only claim Ashile Sun as our leader.

521
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,120
All men in Eagle Division only claim you as our Tegin, Ashile Sun.

522
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:22,799
Do as I ordered.

523
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Tegin.

524
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,639
I know what you're coming for.

525
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,600
Father, for our years of relationship,

526
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,480
please spare lives of others in Eagle Division.

527
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Stand up.

528
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,759
Let's talk inside the tent.

529
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,559
I know what happened to Alir.

530
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Sun,

531
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,799
you suffered a lot.

532
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,159
I received a letter on the third day of my hunting.

533
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,639
It said Eagle Division helped Luo Yi out, fought with Wolf Division,

534
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,318
and shot Khatun.

535
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:03,558
On hearing it, I was so furious that I even wanna kill you myself.

536
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:07,278
But Sher told me what happened in detail.

537
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:12,879
It was good of you two to compete for Luo Yi,

538
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,159
but held a grudge against each other for credit.

539
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,518
Sun, I know you'd not hurt Khatun on purpose.

540
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:28,318
Anyway, Alir died because of Sher.

541
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,359
It was his fault.

542
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,999
Sher, apologized to Sun.

543
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,719
I shot Khatun, so I deserve the punishment.

544
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,439
Why're you doing so?

545
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,439
It's not your fault.

546
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,880
I'll justify you.

547
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,278
Thanks, father.

548
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:50,839
Sun, stand up.

549
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,998
This time I took lots of supplies and weapons from the capital,

550
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,439
and gave them all to Eagle Division.

551
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,839
I know these can't make it up to you,

552
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,440
but now, a dead man can't come back to life.

553
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,959
This time, I took the Wizard with me.

554
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,599
I'll let him pray for Alir.

555
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,319
I'll pray for Alir as well.

556
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:29,518
Sun, what else do you want?

557
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,440
Just tell me.

558
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,439
Your foster mother passed away, but your father who loves you

559
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,518
will always be by your side.

560
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,758
I've a thing to ask for your permission.

561
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:48,599
I'll approve of whatever you want.

562
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,759
My mother had always

563
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:53,758
been eager to visit some further places,

564
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:56,359
but hadn't found a chance to in these years.

565
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,519
She's no longer here now.

566
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,759
I wanna fulfill her last wish, and visit the world at large.

567
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:09,038
If you can find someone suitable to take over Eagle Division,

568
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,799
please let him take good care of it.

569
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,909
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

570
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,389
♫ gradually revives, ♫

571
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,709
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

572
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,860
♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫

573
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,190
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

574
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,669
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

575
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,819
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

576
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,499
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

577
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,989
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

578
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:59,819
♫ the longing flows. ♫

579
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,189
♫ There's always a moment ♫

580
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,989
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

581
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,429
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

582
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:19,149
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

583
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,539
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

584
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,819
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

585
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:28,389
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

586
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,149
♫ layer after layer. ♫

587
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,189
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

588
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:39,060
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

589
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,469
♫ There's always a moment ♫

590
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:53,099
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

591
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,709
♫ There's always solicitude ♫

592
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:03,019
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

593
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,579
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

594
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,949
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

595
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,429
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

596
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,299
♫ layer after layer. ♫

597
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,299
♫ It turns into eternity. ♫

598
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:23,710
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

599
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,880
♫ It is sleepless. ♫
