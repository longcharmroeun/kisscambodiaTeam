<i>[Episode 21]</i>

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,779
I don't like war,

23
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:45,660
but I don't fear it.

24
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:50,459
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers gather on Weishui River shore.

25
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:55,019
I don't want the blood of soldiers to flow into the river.

26
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,979
I'm much less willing to see the warriors from grassland die here.

27
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,079
We're the warriors from grassland.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,458
We fight for faith and are not afraid of death.

29
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,499
If you insist to fight, along the Weishui River

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,419
we won't withdraw from the battle tonight.

31
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:17,978
If you'd like a backup plan, the noon of tomorrow,

32
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,779
I'll give you a second chance at this bridge,

33
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,419
so that you may make up with Tang.

34
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,380
Go.

35
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,059
Li Changge.

36
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:16,939
Why are you wearing a Tang costume?

37
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,820
Where did you go?

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,258
What are you doing?

39
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,059
Come with me.

40
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,740
You may leave.

41
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,660
Your Majesty, good night.

42
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,540
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,538
Where's Changge?

44
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,778
Please forgive me.

45
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:46,779
I'm so useless

46
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,058
that I lost the princess.

47
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:50,459
Where did she go?

48
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,539
To the north bank.

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,779
As long as she's alive, it is great.

50
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,860
If she wants to leave,

51
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:04,820
nobody can stop her.

52
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,300
You may leave.

53
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:08,699
Yes, your Majesty.

54
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,779
Your Majesty.

55
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,580
Are you all right?

56
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,699
I'm fine.

57
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,859
Your Majesty, please don't do it again.

58
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,018
Your Majesty, it's a pity that you didn't see

59
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,819
how agitated Minister Du was.

60
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,099
He was either looking around outside the tent,

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,458
or walking in circles inside the tent nonstop.

62
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,419
Like a loach trapped in a pot.

63
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,140
Got me so dizzy.

64
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,619
Xuancheng, say something.

65
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,499
Congratulations, your Majesty.

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,739
Your wish finally comes true.

67
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:54,459
But we won't know it for sure until tomorrow.

68
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,939
Go and have a rest, all of you.

69
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,778
I'll rest for a while, too.

70
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,140
We're counting on tomorrow.

71
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,299
Good night, your Majesty.

72
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,619
Do you know were it not for me, you would be dead now.

73
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,618
Take a hide here.

74
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:31,979
Be good and stay within the campsite.

75
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,618
Without my order, you may go nowhere.

76
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:34,219
You...

77
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm the boss here.

78
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,259
You're trying to force me again.

79
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,500
Yes, so what?

80
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,940
I didn't plan to ruin my Eagle Division here.

81
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,579
No one wants a battle.

82
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:54,659
You mean it?

83
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,299
Believe it or not.

84
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,290
Is Ashile Sun here?

85
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,890
Yes.

86
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,569
Father.

87
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,569
Li Shimin wants to ally with me.

88
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,810
And makes a peace treaty,

89
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,009
which I've agreed to.

90
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,969
Tomorrow on the make-shift bridge,

91
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,570
I'll sign the treaty with him, face to face.

92
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,250
Like I'll really ally with him.

93
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,569
Listen up, both of you.

94
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,050
When I'm signing the treaty tomorrow,

95
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,689
dispatch the best archers of your divisions.

96
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,168
Bring bows and arrows, and lurk at the north bank.

97
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,650
After I drink the wine,

98
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,410
shoot Li Shimin on the spot.

99
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,608
<i>They want to shoot Li Shimin on the spot.</i>

100
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:07,849
To defeat the Tang army on the battleground this time

101
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,290
is rather unlikely.

102
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,769
I have no choice but to murder Li Shimin.

103
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,329
To win or to lose depends on tomorrow.

104
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,090
Yes, uncle.

105
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,810
Sun, any problem?

106
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,049
No, sir.

107
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,448
The alliance is tomorrow.

108
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,888
And you're breaking the treaty.

109
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,129
How do you win others' trust with such caprice?

110
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,569
Even if you kill Li Shimin, with the numerous armed Tang soldiers,

111
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,929
you really think you can take charge of the Tang State?

112
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,769
Say something.

113
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,210
I have to do it.

114
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,529
Ashile Sun, you said you wouldn't ruin the Eagle Division here.

115
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,608
Then what is this?

116
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:32,769
I can't disobey the order of the Great Khan.

117
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,649
Even if I don't do it, Sher will go.

118
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,770
If Sher doesn't do it, Tu Kashe and Qibi Duo will go.

119
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,410
We have numerous archers,

120
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,850
this assassination is going to happen.

121
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,170
Such being the case, we shall part ways here.

122
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,689
Where are you going?

123
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:58,688
Take note.

124
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:00,089
You're not going anywhere from now.

125
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,890
Guards.

126
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,768
Tegin.

127
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,768
Take her away and lock her in a camp.

128
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:06,730
Don't let her out of it.

129
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,568
Ashile Sun, you have no right to do this to me.

130
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:12,650
I'll say this again.

131
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:14,490
You owe your life to me.

132
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,689
Take her away.

133
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:39,089
<i>You didn't change at all.</i>

134
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,369
<i>Still so arrogant just like before.</i>

135
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,449
<i>Changge, I'm not being arrogant.</i>

136
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,089
<i>It's you who are too stubborn.</i>

137
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,970
<i>You don't understand me at all.</i>

138
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,089
<i>But that's okay.</i>

139
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,929
<i>The alliance will be after dawn.</i>

140
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,289
<i>No one knows what will happen.</i>

141
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,049
<i>So it's good that you've gone.</i>

142
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,970
<i>As for Leyan, if I'm lucky enough to get through tomorrow,</i>

143
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,449
<i>I will find her.</i>

144
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,929
You're so noisy.

145
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,730
Get out of my way.

146
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,169
It's a wide road.

147
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,530
I'm not in your way.

148
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,888
What are you looking at?

149
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,368
It takes me a lot of efforts to get these.

150
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:55,289
I won't share with you.

151
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,730
Wait.

152
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,169
You coughed.

153
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,490
Are you having a cold?

154
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,448
No, I'm not.

155
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:08,290
Stop cursing me.

156
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,289
What are you doing?

157
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,289
Making fire with trunk.

158
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,649
You don't know it?

159
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,329
How do you even make it to today?

160
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,768
So many mushrooms.

161
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:06,489
Can you eat them all?

162
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,969
I'll wrap up the rest if I can't.

163
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,329
Save them for tomorrow.

164
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,768
How about I buy some from you?

165
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,729
Or I can trade some with my cakes.

166
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,530
No.

167
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:23,769
That's fine.

168
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,689
They don't look good anyway.

169
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,050
What a nasty brat!

170
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:40,128
I've changed my mind.

171
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,050
Come and eat with me.

172
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,090
Thank you.

173
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,529
My name is Li Leyan, and you?

174
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,929
I don't have a name.

175
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,009
Just call me Mr. Wu.

176
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,610
Why would somebody be nameless?

177
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,448
There are many people who don't have a name.

178
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:09,768
It's not uncommon.

179
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:11,089
I grew up with no parents.

180
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,650
Nobody has ever named me.

181
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,610
You're so young.

182
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,889
Nobody is taking care of you?

183
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,969
I've been living here for as long as I can remember.

184
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,169
Growing up alone.

185
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,409
Hanging out with a bunch of guys who beg and steal.

186
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,050
As long as they get some food, I won't starve.

187
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:33,688
Don't look so sad.

188
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,808
We are very happy together every single day.

189
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:38,208
I used to rank the fifth.

190
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,730
I had several little brothers.

191
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,530
Thanks.

192
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,008
So where are your friends?

193
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,329
They are... dead.

194
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,929
Because of the war?

195
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,049
No.

196
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,888
We are beggars.

197
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:00,729
They died of hunger, coldness, illness

198
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,969
or being caught and beaten to death while stealing.

199
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,209
It's quite common.

200
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,409
You are so nagging.

201
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,370
Are you going to eat it?

202
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:11,129
Stealing is not decent,

203
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,688
but those thieves should be beaten to death.

204
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:15,768
What are you crying for?

205
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,089
I'm not bullying you.

206
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,328
I'm not crying.

207
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:19,530
I just feel...

208
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,930
I just feel there's nothing I can do to help.

209
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,730
Here.

210
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,409
<i>I finally found you.</i>

211
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,970
<i>Dared to trick me?</i>

212
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,410
Run!

213
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,650
Hurry.

214
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,289
You little brat!

215
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,370
Don't you run away from me!

216
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,769
Brat!

217
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:05,128
Xiao Wu.

218
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:05,849
Save yourself.

219
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,768
Stop!

220
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:08,368
You ate a lot just now.

221
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:09,650
Now don't waste it.

222
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:22,409
I'm so sorry.

223
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,849
Please forgive us.

224
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,289
I shouldn't have messed with you.

225
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,529
My sister and I are both sorry.

226
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,529
Please forgive us.

227
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,689
Little brat.

228
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,330
Don't expect me to buy it.

229
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:35,329
Didn't you throw a stone at me?

230
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,410
Xiao Wu.

231
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,769
Threw stones at me?

232
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,448
Please forgive us.

233
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,568
We're so sorry.

234
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:53,129
We've learned our lesson.

235
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,929
Okay.

236
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,929
I'll let you go today.

237
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,969
Do keep in mind.

238
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,850
Stay away from me as far as possible.

239
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,050
Should I ever see you again, I'll kill you two.

240
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:05,730
Brat.

241
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,049
Don't let me see you ever again.

242
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,049
Xiao Wu, are you all right?

243
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,329
Let me have a look.

244
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,770
I'm fine.

245
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:25,090
I've been beaten up more than you could imagine.

246
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:27,129
You...

247
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,008
Are you really okay?

248
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,089
You're spitting blood.

249
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,089
I'm good.

250
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,089
That was like a massage to me.

251
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,729
Don't make a fuss.

252
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,290
I just bit my tongue by accident.

253
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:41,368
Let's go back.

254
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:42,530
The fire is about to go out.

255
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,008
Xiao Wu.

256
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,049
Wake up.

257
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,209
They've already left.

258
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,609
We need to hurry.

259
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,008
Come on.

260
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:28,929
I wanna sleep... Xiao Wu, wake up.

261
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,730
Xiao Wu...

262
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:37,330
You have a fever.

263
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:39,169
Xiao Wu...

264
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,170
Your Majesty, I've asked Wei Shuyu to get the guards ready.

265
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,689
General Yuchi will be there, too.

266
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,929
But the Ashile Tribe is known for sudden caprices,

267
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,729
taking such a risk by yourself, what if...

268
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,809
So you know it's an "if".

269
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,169
Don't meet trouble halfway.

270
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:16,529
Your Majesty... Your Majesty, it's time for the alliance.

271
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,609
We may go.

272
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,810
Should anything happens to me,

273
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:45,050
please assist the crown prince to govern.

274
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,489
Yes, your Majesty.

275
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,410
I've dispatched the best archers of the Wolf Division.

276
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,889
The honor of killing Li Shimin is mine.

277
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,689
Don't you bother to try.

278
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,210
It's too soon to say it.

279
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,290
We shall see.

280
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:23,289
Go.

281
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,129
Go.

282
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,289
Go!

283
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,128
<i>Time is running out.</i>

284
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:45,848
<i>It is not a military fortress that I'm guarding,</i>

285
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,248
<i>but the welfare of the people.</i>

286
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:51,489
<i>Their safety and happiness are really important.</i>

287
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,289
Since you're looking forward to peace,

288
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,929
and have agreed to retreat today.

289
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,930
The Tang State will let the past rest.

290
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,009
Now we'll give your man back.

291
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,010
Khan.

292
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,090
Tegin.

293
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:50,690
It can wait.

294
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,609
But... the military counselor is gone.

295
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,529
What?

296
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,608
I found it just now.

297
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,888
I've searched the campsite.

298
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:04,848
She's not there.

299
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,608
There's no sign of a fighting in the tent.

300
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:07,848
But I found a small opening.

301
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,530
I think the counselor has run away.

302
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:12,729
Li Changge.

303
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,529
Keep an eye on it.

304
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,330
Yes, sir.

305
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:25,450
The emperor of the Tang State is truly generous and tolerant.

306
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:03,768
Protect his Majesty.

307
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,089
Protect his Majesty!

308
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:07,930
Hold on!

309
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:14,929
How dare you try to assassinate his Majesty?

310
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,849
It's a misunderstanding.

311
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:26,929
What was that?

312
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,848
It was him.

313
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:29,809
He fired the arrow in advance, and missed.

314
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,888
Take him away.

315
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:34,768
In a quiet manner.

316
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,089
Yes, sir.

317
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:45,809
Considering the alliance with the Ashile Tribe before,

318
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,650
we've met you halfway again and again.

319
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,848
We did it for our people, as well as for your warriors.

320
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:56,769
But it seems you don't want to take the opportunity.

321
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,248
Your Majesty, it must be a misunderstanding.

322
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:02,248
Misunderstanding?

323
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:04,050
How do you explain this arrow?

324
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:07,728
We have treated the Ashile Tribe with sincerity,

325
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:10,128
yet you did this to us.

326
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,608
Instead of being grateful,

327
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,449
you tried to assassinate his Majesty in our territory.

328
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,329
Even death cannot atone for your guilt.

329
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,449
If I really intended to assassinate you,

330
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,368
I wouldn't have waited until now.

331
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:24,809
Yesterday at the Wei River, I could have fought to death against you.

332
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,450
We need to investigate this accident.

333
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,488
It's likely that someone wanted to set me up

334
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,170
and take advantage of our rivalry.

335
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:34,569
Your Majesty is valorous and wise.

336
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,248
But I'm no fool, either.

337
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:41,170
In my tribe, there are tens of thousands of excellent archers.

338
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:46,649
It's unlikely that we couldn't find even one crack shot,

339
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,570
and got me in this situation.

340
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,728
If it's really the case,

341
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:54,369
then I don't deserve being king of the prairie.

342
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,769
As for this accident,

343
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,128
please trust and understand me.

344
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:05,649
The minute I find out about the truth,

345
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,170
I'll give you a satisfactory explanation.

346
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,008
It sounds beautiful.

347
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,608
But you break your words again and again.

348
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,809
It's hard for us to believe you again.

349
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:20,248
If you really mean it, tell your men to retreat 90 miles.

350
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:23,049
Then we will let you go.

351
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,850
Otherwise...

352
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:30,650
General Yuchi.

353
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:40,128
Tell them.

354
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:43,449
Move the campsite north and retreat 90 miles.

355
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,250
Yes, sir.

356
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,009
Didn't you hear the Great Khan's order?

357
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,409
Retreat!

358
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,210
Now!

359
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,170
I said now!

360
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:12,968
Retreat.

361
00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:13,769
Hurry.

362
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:15,289
Let's go.

363
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,248
Stop.

364
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:55,529
Nobody move.

365
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,570
Stop right here.

366
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,888
We haven't gone that far, which doesn't meet their requirement.

367
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:05,728
Qibi Duo, what are you doing?

368
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:06,530
Keep going.

369
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,690
What do you know?

370
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,008
Now is a perfect time for a surprise attack.

371
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:13,289
They think we're retreating.

372
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,889
So if we turn back now, we can destroy them.

373
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,848
Surprise attack?

374
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:20,409
Don't you forget the Great Khan is in their hand?

375
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,170
Do you want to commit treason?

376
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:28,368
My Qibi Tribe has trekked this far with no reward.

377
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,570
We deserve more than this.

378
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:36,329
If the surprise attack works, we will not only get properties,

379
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,210
but also the whole central plain.

380
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:39,888
True.

381
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:40,729
He's right.

382
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:42,649
Who dares?

383
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,849
What's Qibi Duo doing?

384
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,728
Warriors, let's return to the Wei River.

385
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:49,050
Get the Great Khan out.

386
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,369
It's a perfect opportunity.

387
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,130
Hold on.

388
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,848
Stop!

389
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:57,529
You're going to get the Great Khan killed.

390
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,449
Nobody move!

391
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,169
Somebody take him down.

392
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:00,608
Yes, sir.

393
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:01,529
Don't you touch me.

394
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,050
Anyone who tries to stop me shall be punished with him.

395
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,809
But the Great Khan...

396
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,570
Even if the Great Khan dies, so what?

397
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:10,289
Then things will...

398
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,369
His life is not your responsibility.

399
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:16,089
See, Ashile Sun didn't say anything, either.

400
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,368
<i>Ashile Sun, what are you thinking?</i>

401
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,848
Warriors, follow me back to the Wei River.

402
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:27,488
Get the Great Khan out.

403
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:28,289
Go!

404
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,488
Eagle Division!

405
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:46,289
Yes, sir.

406
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,369
The Great Khan has ordered us to retreat.

407
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:52,848
Anyone who disobeys shall be killed on the spot.

408
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:53,649
Yes, sir!

409
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:57,929
Tegin Sun.

410
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,728
Shixin Sili.

411
00:30:58,729 --> 00:30:59,848
Yes, sir.

412
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:02,169
Keep retreating, make a campsite 90 miles away,

413
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:04,009
and wait for Khan's return.

414
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:07,488
Wait for Khan's return!

415
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:09,329
Wait for Khan's return!

416
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,889
Wait for Khan's return!

417
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:27,848
Thanks to Heaven's blessing, Your Majesty didn't get hurt.

418
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:30,769
I really broke out in a cold sweat.

419
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:33,570
Heaven's blessing?

420
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:40,049
Your Majesty.

421
00:31:57,489 --> 00:32:00,649
Hitting the glass in my hand from ten feet away.

422
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,368
If Heaven is not behind this,

423
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:04,129
it must be somebody with excellent skills.

424
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:10,569
Send the scout to the Ashile Tribe to look into this.

425
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,929
Find out who fired this arrow.

426
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,369
Your Majesty, you mean...

427
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,609
If it's someone whose loyalty belongs to us, do get him out.

428
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,250
Yes, sir.

429
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:28,849
<i>Please prove me wrong.</i>

430
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:33,849
Bring the guy who fired the arrow and missed.

431
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:37,809
Ask Sun and Sher to come here.

432
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:42,209
I want to see which division this idiot comes from.

433
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,010
Yes, sir.

434
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:01,889
Idiot, even if you're cut into pieces,

435
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:05,410
it won't atone for the trouble you caused today.

436
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,650
- Father.
- Uncle.

437
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:20,170
Sher, so this is what you've trained?

438
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,569
I'm sorry, Great Khan.

439
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,728
I was so eager to earn honor for the Wolf Division and you

440
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:26,810
that I missed the target.

441
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,250
Bullshit!

442
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,290
Why are you dressed like this?

443
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,450
I've never seen you.

444
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,409
There are so many warriors in the Wolf Division.

445
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,369
It's natural that you don't know me.

446
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:46,650
I made a mistake for being impatient.

447
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,129
But I'm a hundred percent loyal to you.

448
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:55,728
Great Khan, I swear to Sirius,

449
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,489
my whole family was killed by Li Shimin.

450
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:00,369
If he hadn't raised the glass so suddenly,

451
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,930
I would have already avenged their death.

452
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:09,209
Great Khan, please give me a second chance.

453
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,210
Not killing Li Shimin will make me turn in the grave.

454
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,608
I don't care about your history with Li Shimin.

455
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:17,649
Now tell.

456
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,808
Why are you wearing this outfit?

457
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,649
I'll kill you if you don't tell the truth.

458
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,650
If I had succeeded in killing Li Shimin,

459
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,970
would you still doubt I'm one of the Wolf Division?

460
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,450
So this is one of the best warriors of your division?

461
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,649
Uncle, he... he's trying to fool us.

462
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,209
One outfit of my division.

463
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,889
It's easy to get if someone intends to set me up.

464
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:49,569
Why are you looking at me?

465
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,050
Well?

466
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:53,328
You think I set you up?

467
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,250
It's not unlikely.

468
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,009
Great Khan, it's Shixin Sili.

469
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,810
Come in.

470
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:06,089
Great Khan.

471
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,888
What is it?

472
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:08,689
Qi...

473
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,849
Don't waste time.

474
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,690
Qibi Duo really did this?

475
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:33,528
That was too easy for him to die like that.

476
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:34,568
It was.

477
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:38,129
Were it not for Tegin Sun, things would have got very terrible.

478
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,609
Sher, answer me.

479
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,129
What were you doing when Qibi Duo betrayed me?

480
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,650
If Sun hadn't shot him,

481
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,929
would you have turned on me?

482
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,888
No, I would never.

483
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,128
Uncle, please allow me to explain.

484
00:35:57,129 --> 00:35:58,449
I've never meant to hurt you.

485
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,128
Ever.

486
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:01,288
I... I was just in shock then.

487
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,650
Please believe me, uncle.

488
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,490
Idiot.

489
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,048
You've trained an idiot.

490
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:08,250
You're an idiot, too!

491
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:16,089
Sun, you did a good job.

492
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:23,010
No matter what, I'd never let you in danger.

493
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:28,849
Son, you've saved my life.

494
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,009
A son doesn't have to beat about the bush with his father.

495
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,089
Now tell me what you want.

496
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,770
Father, please don't kill him.

497
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:45,528
Why?

498
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:46,650
No particular reason.

499
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:48,490
It's just that he said

500
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:51,970
to kill Li Shimin and earn you honor was his lifelong dream.

501
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,088
If everyone is like him,

502
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,009
it won't be long before we defeat the Tang army.

503
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,490
He only missed the target because of bad luck.

504
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,370
Death is too harsh a penalty.

505
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,128
Besides, this long trek has produced no fruit.

506
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:07,209
The morale is low.

507
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,050
Soldiers are on edge.

508
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:09,849
If we kill a loyal warrior,

509
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,210
I'm afraid it'll chill their hearts.

510
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,089
Why not spare him as he's loyal?

511
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,410
The soldiers will not forget it.

512
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:23,409
In the future,

513
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,970
they will fight for us with more determination.

514
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:32,410
Did you hear it?

515
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:37,410
You always see the big picture, and always think long-term.

516
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,849
Okay, I'll allow it.

517
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:49,649
You useless idiot.

518
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,409
Take your guy away.

519
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,730
Do not let me see him again.

520
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,009
It's best that you stay out of my sight for a while.

521
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:57,810
Yes, sir.

522
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:02,369
Take him away.

523
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:22,170
♫ Crossing the river to pick hibiscus,

524
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,210
♫ the brilliant orchid and many fragrant herbs.

525
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:34,089
♫ I pick it and desire to give it to someone.

526
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,650
So cold... is it snowing?

527
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,849
Xiao Wu, are you feeling better?

528
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,689
You were singing?

529
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,849
It was beautiful.

530
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,490
I know you suck at many things.

531
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:56,889
Didn't know you're good at singing.

532
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:58,849
When you get better,

533
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,289
I'll sing to you everyday.

534
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:06,329
Where are the others?

535
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,089
Why are we here alone?

536
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,409
The others... they've left.

537
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,009
But that's all right.

538
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,568
When you get better, we can catch up with them.

539
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:22,569
I thought you were just a little silly, but you're actually an idiot.

540
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:24,769
You think we're in the city?

541
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,009
You have nothing with you.

542
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,730
How do you have the nerve to be left alone?

543
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:35,129
Let alone reaching Luoyang, you'll get eaten by the wolves soon.

544
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,490
Xiao Wu...

545
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,528
Why are you still sitting here?

546
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:55,889
Go catch up with them.

547
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,449
I'm not going anywhere.

548
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,729
You've already called me your sister.

549
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,849
No sister will leave her little brother alone.

550
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:08,409
So you got yourself a little brother.

551
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,609
Took advantage of me.

552
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,450
Xiao Wu, let's make the best of our lives.

553
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,490
So girlish.

554
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,810
Careful.

555
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,369
I'm young and strong.

556
00:40:34,129 --> 00:40:35,969
It will take more than a fever to kill me.

557
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,490
Let's hit the road.

558
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,328
Come on, or we'll never catch up with them.

559
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:46,129
Come on.

560
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,568
Careful.

561
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:53,369
Slowly.

562
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,770
Here he comes.

563
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:01,010
Tegin.

564
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,449
Where's the counselor?

565
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,090
She claimed to be from the Wolf Division.

566
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,930
Sher took her.

567
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,129
She's sacrificing herself for us Eagle Division.

568
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:15,649
No, I'll go to save her.

569
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,929
You can't go.

570
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,328
You going there now won't save the counselor.

571
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:22,088
It will only prove she's connected to us Eagle Division.

572
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:24,529
Then her effort will go to waste.

573
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:27,649
That's right.

574
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:30,409
We can't do anything now.

575
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,649
But the troops are going to leave,

576
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,249
and we need to return to our domain.

577
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,169
Then the counselor will be at the capital all alone.

578
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,328
We need to do something.

579
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,409
Young Khan won't spare her.

580
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,210
I will save her.

581
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,609
There's no way I'll stand by and watch her die.

582
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,530
Save?

583
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,930
Who are you going to save?

584
00:41:52,129 --> 00:41:54,609
The guy who couldn't even hit his target?

585
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:58,288
He claimed to be one of my men.

586
00:41:58,289 --> 00:41:59,450
Why do you care so much?

587
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:03,569
I wasn't sure if he is one of your men back there.

588
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,369
Now watching you like this,

589
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:09,369
I am sure of it.

590
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:13,608
It's fine that you don't admit it.

591
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:15,848
There are plenty of ways to get him talk.

592
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:16,770
Sher.

593
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,769
Don't you dare.

594
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,089
Let's see.

595
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,730
I took a nap.

596
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:41,129
And dreamed about this arrow.

597
00:42:43,049 --> 00:42:46,529
But I just couldn't see who fired it.

598
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,210
I was wondering whether he did it to save me

599
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,129
or it was just a failed assassination.

600
00:42:55,129 --> 00:42:57,368
Your Majesty, you've narrowly escaped death.

601
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:58,729
You're thinking too much.

602
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,889
Please take care of your health.

603
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,809
I'd like to hear what you really think about this.

604
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:13,769
Your Majesty, I never believe in coincidence

605
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,129
when it comes to life or death.

606
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,930
I believe coincidences are careful plannings.

607
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,328
Whether the man who fired this arrow is loyal to us,

608
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:25,010
there's one thing that's for sure.

609
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:28,500
He definitely disapproves Yanli Khan's act of aggression.

610
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,898
Your Majesty, I heard it from my son.

611
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:35,418
The night before the negotiation,

612
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:37,139
Princess Yongning went to the Ashile Tribe.

613
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,860
So you think it was Changge?
