<i>[Episode 22]</i>

22
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:45,243
My son told me that Princess Yongning

23
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:47,740
went to Ashile Tribe before the negotiation.

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,810
So you think it's Changge?

25
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,670
I have no idea about it.

26
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,671
But I believe if she knows the assassination,

27
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,580
she'll try her best to save you.

28
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,540
If she really did so,

29
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,630
I will be sorrier to her.

30
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,630
Hurry.

31
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,250
Halt.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,290
Have you ever seen the lady?

33
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,800
No...

34
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,404
We've never seen her.

35
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:49,590
No.

36
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,020
Sir.

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,154
We haven't seen her.

38
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:57,330
Only your team sets off from Yunzhou.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,400
How can you haven't seen her?

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,176
Sir, please listen to me.

41
00:03:02,177 --> 00:03:05,580
See, how far have we walked?

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,039
Some of us refused to walk halfway.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,954
Some chose to join another team.

44
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,079
And some...

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,887
We don't know where they have gone.

46
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:14,932
- He's right.
- So...

47
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,329
how can we know where she is?

48
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,599
Am I right?

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,910
Do you agree?

50
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,629
We haven't seen her.

51
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,729
He's right...

52
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,399
- I don't know her.
- I haven't seen her.

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,640
So do I.

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,969
Enough. It's getting dark.

55
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,599
Let's go on our way.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,850
Let's go.

57
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,220
<i>Princess, where are you?</i>

58
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,365
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:13,150
Scouts have found out the source of the arrow.

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,610
Who's its owner?

61
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:19,230
An elite from Young Khan's Wolf Division of Ashile Tribe.

62
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,258
Yan Li has reprimanded him.

63
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,350
And now they've gone back to grasslands.

64
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,529
Mr. Wei.

65
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,700
What do you think of the news?

66
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,676
Don't be nervous.

67
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,100
It's a chat.

68
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,280
Your Majesty, to tell the truth,

69
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,720
my first thought is

70
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,450
fortunately not Changge.

71
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,140
Please forgive me.

72
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,070
That's also what I think.

73
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,030
Khatun, Great Khan is back.

74
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,743
Alir.

75
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:26,454
Let's go to welcome him.

76
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:27,610
Khatun.

77
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:29,676
I heard that they returned with nothing.

78
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,880
Please be cautious.

79
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,476
I see...

80
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,560
Let's go.

81
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,680
Welcome back, Khan.

82
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:24,630
Please have a cup of wine first.

83
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,809
Hundreds of thousands of troops brought nothing back.

84
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,120
Is it a pleasure?

85
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,280
Your dejected expression...

86
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,680
makes me feel unlucky!

87
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,320
Don't show up in front of me again!

88
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:43,880
Yes.

89
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,276
Khan.

90
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:53,343
Young Khan comes to greet you.

91
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:54,790
Greet me?

92
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,721
I think he wishes me to die!

93
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,054
Ask him back to reflect!

94
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,387
I don't want to see him!

95
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:01,560
Yes.

96
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:08,480
Why are you still freezing here? Get out!

97
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,739
Sun, you're back! Are you okay?

98
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,854
What's going on?

99
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:33,276
Have you seen the counsellor?

100
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:35,590
Sheer captured her and brought her back.

101
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,809
What happened to Changge?

102
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,379
Prepare some gifts. I'm to see Khan.

103
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,049
You're just back without a rest.

104
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,779
And what's your reason to see Khan?

105
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,787
- Report on military affairs.
- What are they?

106
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:46,809
I'll write at once.

107
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,276
I'll go with you! I want to see...

108
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,899
Mimi, please!

109
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,854
It's no use of you to go with him.

110
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:54,379
Haven't you heard that Changge is arrested?

111
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,390
Should I wait here and do nothing?

112
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,699
Shouldn't you prepare gifts to see Khan?

113
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,139
Why are you scouring your sword here?

114
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,830
Kurultai will be held in three days.

115
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,140
I'll request to fight a duel with Sheer.

116
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,409
I want to win her back.

117
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,609
Sun, are you mad?

118
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,343
He's stuck for how to kill you fair and upright.

119
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:34,289
How can you provide him a chance?

120
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,650
You'll show mercy but he won't.

121
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,230
I won't either.

122
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,459
Mimi wants to follow you to the capital.

123
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,830
Don't bring her there.

124
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,699
It's too dangerous.

125
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,390
I'm worried about you.

126
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,650
So I can't let Changge stay there for long.

127
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,832
Tegin, let me go with you.

128
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,076
Why?

129
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,854
Changge must be cold and hungry now.

130
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,179
Maybe she's injured.

131
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,080
So I bring her some food, drinks and medicines.

132
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,299
Give it to me.

133
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,339
No.

134
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,210
I must see her with my own eyes.

135
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,454
Tegin, please bring me there!

136
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:16,850
I'll be useful!

137
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,850
Young Khan.

138
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,965
Young Khan.

139
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:40,121
We've just met the slave whom you brought back.

140
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,721
Do you dislike him either?

141
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,139
No.

142
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,929
We've seen him before.

143
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,054
When?

144
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:48,410
When we're in Youzhou.

145
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,450
And also he helped Ashile Sun.

146
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,521
He's the friend of the scamp...

147
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,190
<i>Khan, would you please</i>

148
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:59,080
<i>keep him alive?</i>

149
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,139
<i>I will save him.</i>

150
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,850
<i>I won't stand by and watch her die.</i>

151
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,830
As expected, their relationship is unusual.

152
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,339
Tuluk.

153
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,140
Go to bring him here.

154
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,790
Yes.

155
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,610
Tegin.

156
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,519
Have you seen a new slave with a nevus under his eye?

157
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,320
Yes, I have.

158
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,099
Where's he?

159
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,560
Young Khan's soldiers brought him to the archery field.

160
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,476
Wait for me here.

161
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,340
No woman can enter the archery field so don't bring me more trouble.

162
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,830
Once again.

163
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,049
What did that scamp ask you to do in Wolf Division?

164
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,299
To frame up my troop?

165
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

166
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,560
Do you think I won't kill a slave?

167
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,099
I'll count to three.

168
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,740
You still have time to regret.

169
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,080
Let's go to see Great Khan

170
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,779
and confess that you're a member of Eagle Division.

171
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,010
I am not.

172
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,854
Fine.

173
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:41,740
It seems you know no fear of death.

174
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,120
Sheer, are you crazy?

175
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,590
It seems he's special to you.

176
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:21,120
You can start to fight against me for him.

177
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,500
Let a man be your target?

178
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:29,743
Don't you fear to be damned by the god?

179
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:30,920
Ashile Sun.

180
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,809
Sober up.

181
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,499
Here's the capital, not your place.

182
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,120
And he's not your man.

183
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,019
He's my slave.

184
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,320
How can't I shoot him?

185
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:46,120
You've come just in time.

186
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,350
We haven't had a competition for long, right?

187
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,900
I don't think we should have one.

188
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,940
Don't try to refuse me so easily.

189
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,710
As you mind him a lot, then he'll be the award.

190
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,520
What do you mean?

191
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,579
Do you remember that

192
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,000
we always scrambled for small rewards by battles of archery?

193
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,700
No.

194
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,350
Never mind. I still remember it clearly.

195
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,680
Our first competition was for such a tiny Ping Po.

196
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:26,669
Sheer.

197
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,565
Release him. Let's have the competition.

198
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:29,880
How can I release the award?

199
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,669
It's a ready-made target.

200
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,632
It's right for us to test our archery.

201
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:35,676
You...

202
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,232
Choose the winner within three rounds.

203
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:41,143
If you win, I'll allow him to go with you with no other words.

204
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:42,280
Deal?

205
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,320
Deal.

206
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,990
Again!

207
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,190
You lost that game.

208
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,543
It's the past.

209
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:00,760
It won't be the same now.

210
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,080
You not only lost the game

211
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:05,960
but also cheated.

212
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,830
<i>Father.</i>

213
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,321
Sheer.

214
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:15,721
Is it enough?

215
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:18,560
I've told you to compete in three rounds so none can be omitted.

216
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,030
Let's change into a smaller target this round.

217
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:34,010
You...

218
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,920
What's wrong? Hate to see?

219
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,629
Or do you think I shouldn't do so?

220
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,029
It's too small.

221
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,721
You can't hit the target as it's windy.

222
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,010
Ashile Sun.

223
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:45,850
You're really arrogant.

224
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,480
You can hit it. Of course, I can!

225
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,480
Sheer!

226
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,650
You've suffered a lot.

227
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,632
Why are you here?

228
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,700
I...

229
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,940
I come to report to Great Khan.

230
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,940
Tegin Sun!

231
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,030
Great Khan summoned you to report! Hurry up!

232
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,299
Ashile Sun.

233
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,700
Nobody hit the target in the last round so we drew.

234
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,320
And you can't take him away.

235
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,120
Leave now.

236
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,700
I'll be fine.

237
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:52,250
Sun.

238
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,480
Wait for a few days.

239
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,250
I will bring you back.

240
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,587
Boring.

241
00:20:18,588 --> 00:20:20,743
Tuluk, bring him back.

242
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:21,830
Yes.

243
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,900
Get in!

244
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,880
Changge!

245
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,076
Mimi...

246
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:43,499
Changge.

247
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,850
Why are you here?

248
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,900
You're injured...

249
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,960
Any wounds on your body?

250
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,119
Li Changge!

251
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,219
Tegin Sun told me that you would care for yourself!

252
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,650
Then why did you get hurt?

253
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,379
Why are you laughing?

254
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,650
I'm fine.

255
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,740
Or you can touch it.

256
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,390
I refuse.

257
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,430
Sit here.

258
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,030
Come on.

259
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:31,500
Does it hurt?

260
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,121
If you can't take good care of yourself, I'll...

261
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:42,700
You can break my head, okay?

262
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,190
How can you make fun of it?

263
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,320
Don't worry. I'm okay.

264
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,850
I will return to Eagle Division

265
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,920
and eat the boiled mutton legs you made.

266
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,680
Eagle Division is brave and skillful indeed, with strict disciplines.

267
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,450
During the battles in Weishui, your casualties are the least.

268
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,280
Thanks to Father.

269
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,743
As you've made a great contribution, I'll grant you a large reward.

270
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:34,409
Thanks, Father.

271
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,099
Comparing with the reward, I hope that Father could grant my request.

272
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,210
Go ahead.

273
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,409
Kurultai will be held in three days.

274
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,390
I want to duel and win the award of Sirius.

275
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,921
I hope to gain Father's permission.

276
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:50,165
It's a snack.

277
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,500
I agree.

278
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,409
You're really my son.

279
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,790
I'm waiting for your victory in three days.

280
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,898
By the way.

281
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:05,632
I know what you want but I still need to remind you of one thing.

282
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:07,121
You can fight for the victory

283
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:10,560
but don't act precipitately and unfriendly.

284
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,049
I see.

285
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,379
Father, please be at ease.

286
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,720
I won't embarrass you.

287
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,619
That's fine, good boy.

288
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,219
Kurultai is coming soon so don't leave in a hurry.

289
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,739
Stay here for a few more days.

290
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,610
Let's live together, chat all night and improve our skills.

291
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,790
Okay.

292
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,921
Report to Great Khan.

293
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:37,543
Luo Yi has been captured.

294
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,190
He'll be taken to Khan's Tent soon.

295
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,143
Okay, leave.

296
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:43,160
Yes.

297
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,250
Sirius!

298
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,030
I know you won't treat me badly all the way!

299
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,280
It's all your will!

300
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,965
Father. Was he General of Tang, Luo Yi?

301
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:11,143
Yes.

302
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:12,809
It's him.

303
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,410
He's commanded Tianjie Army to guard Jingzhou for years.

304
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:18,870
We fought many times

305
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,240
and I seldom won.

306
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:27,259
His good luck has simply run out this time.

307
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,049
I heard that Luo Yi was close to Li Jiancheng.

308
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,809
Therefore he hates Li Shimin very much.

309
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,076
That's why he led the Tianjie Army to rebel,

310
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:37,165
making Tang lose the north defense line.

311
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:41,099
While he escaped and hid after the defeat, how did we capture him?

312
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,299
After Li Shimin defeated him,

313
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,129
only a few trusted followers survived and protected him.

314
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,619
In desperation, he fled toward the grasslands.

315
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,500
As I got the news, I dispatched troops to find him along the border.

316
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,560
To my surprise, we found and captured him.

317
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:10,543
With Kurultai coming soon, Sirius really gives me a lavish gift.

318
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:11,990
Congratulations, Father!

319
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,720
How do you want to deal with him?

320
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,960
He knows the posts and the march deployments well.

321
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,232
If he can surrender to us, we could be more powerful

322
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:29,632
and it'll be easy for us to succeed.

323
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:33,050
What if he refuses?

324
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,100
If so,

325
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,339
I'll keep on torturing him.

326
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,450
My resentment won't be eliminated only until his spirit is destroyed.

327
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,720
Once a day. Don't forget.

328
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:54,099
And here's the food.

329
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,390
Hide it.

330
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,340
Don't be snatched by others.

331
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,379
You've stayed for a long time, so you'd better return now.

332
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,099
You shouldn't stay long here.

333
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,500
It'll be terrible to be found by Sheer's men.

334
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,254
Don't drive me away.

335
00:27:14,255 --> 00:27:17,410
I don't know when we can meet again.

336
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:19,219
Maybe...

337
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,099
I'll be back to Eagle Division without finishing using them.

338
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,276
Time to leave.

339
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,430
I refuse.

340
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:36,499
Mimi.

341
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,960
You go first, Mimi.

342
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,900
Take care of yourself.

343
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,540
Greet to Young Khan.

344
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,160
Where were you these years?

345
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,730
No matter where I am, I've been a slave in the grasslands all the way.

346
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,676
Not so bad...

347
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:05,080
I thought you're...

348
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,743
Where do you live now?

349
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:08,854
I...

350
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,100
What are you going to do?

351
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,410
She's now a member of Eagle Division.

352
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,579
You're now in Eagle Division?

353
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,120
You're his slave?

354
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:25,560
Mimi.

355
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,190
Go back.

356
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:29,230
Yes.

357
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,099
Please forgive my leaving, Young Khan.

358
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,480
I have to leave now.

359
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,080
Mimi.

360
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,760
Do you want to say something to me?

361
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,300
Li Changge is my friend.

362
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,540
I hope you do not kill him.

363
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,030
Could you?

364
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,870
Fine. I promise.

365
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,459
I promise her that I won't kill you.

366
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,900
Well, don't want to live in comfort.

367
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,390
I'll bring you a hard time!

368
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,410
Have you seen Great Khan?

369
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:23,676
Did he embarrass you?

370
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:25,010
No.

371
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:26,250
Just a chat.

372
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,060
You've been arrested so why are you worrying about me?

373
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,009
You're right...

374
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,232
It'll be a long period for me to stay in Khan's Tent.

375
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm afraid I can't come to accompany you.

376
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,849
Don't worry about me.

377
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,254
Mimi left something to me.

378
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:43,739
Three days.

379
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,339
Hanging on for three days, I'll come to take you back

380
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,560
as soon as Kurultai is over.

381
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,379
Young Khan, why do you call me in a hurry?

382
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,343
Do you still remember Mimi Guli?

383
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,632
Yes.

384
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:13,121
A slave from Mobei.

385
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:14,499
Why do you suddenly mention her?

386
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,699
Tell me... where she went.

387
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,121
Why did she suddenly disappear without telling me?

388
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:23,609
Great Khan worried you would lose your ambition for her

389
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,409
so he expelled her to some other place.

390
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,129
But why is she now with Ashile Sun?

391
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,529
She's now his slave!

392
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,840
The slave was handpicked by Great Khan.

393
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,920
Damn it!

394
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:42,390
So I'm the only fool...

395
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,965
Please give it to me.

396
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:50,032
Okay.

397
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,230
Just put it here.

398
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,299
Why are you in a daze? You want to die?

399
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,539
Young Khan asked me to keep my eyes on you.

400
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,190
Don't try to loaf! Get to work!

401
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,432
I was wondering who would rush to see me.

402
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:39,960
Well... It's you.

403
00:32:41,277 --> 00:32:42,760
Long time no see.

404
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,938
Luo Yi.

405
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:51,560
I scarcely recognize you!

406
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:58,009
Are you still the brave and skillful man in my memory?

407
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,889
Ashile Chuobi.

408
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:04,339
I heard that you went out to battle yourself with nothing back.

409
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,760
You're now really good-for-nothing!

410
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,926
As you're captured by me, you're still reluctant to admit your defeat!

411
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,254
As long as you can kneel to surrender to Ashile Tribe

412
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:25,960
and fight for us, I'll now provide you a feast and a higher rank.

413
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,143
Ashile Chuobi.

414
00:33:29,144 --> 00:33:32,190
Don't lose in your daydream.

415
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,340
How can I associate with a rubbish like you?

416
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,920
Want to kill me? Just come on!

417
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,009
Incorrigible.

418
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,650
You want the hard way?

419
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,320
It must be a tiring journey for him

420
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,787
so give him a "nice massage"!

421
00:33:56,788 --> 00:33:58,030
Yes.

422
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,790
Young Khan, what are you looking at?

423
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,187
Mimi Guli called him Changge.

424
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:27,569
Effeminate!

425
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,140
No machismo.

426
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,010
I really don't know why she's close to him.

427
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,329
Just a liking between young people.

428
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,259
Why do you worry about the two slaves?

429
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,819
She's my slave.

430
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,143
Why does she love him?

431
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:42,410
That's past history now.

432
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,849
Just a female slave.

433
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,219
You can have as many as you want.

434
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,699
If you need, I'll find one for you.

435
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,050
I didn't mean that.

436
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,210
Uncle Lei.

437
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,300
Instruct them to assign him more jobs. Don't let him relax.

438
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:04,450
Yes.

439
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,630
Who's coming?

440
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,240
I'm ordered to clean the cell, General.

441
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:19,030
Shiba, hold on!

442
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,760
He called me General.

443
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,050
Bandits of Ashile won't call me General.

444
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,740
You have the sleeping-draught!

445
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,540
You made the guards faint.

446
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,450
You want to rescue General Luo?

447
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,539
Who are you?

448
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,320
Ten years ago,

449
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,210
you sent me a horn bow and praised me as brave as my father

450
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,590
in the garden of Eastern Palace

451
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,480
Princess Yongning.

452
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,100
Shiba, release her! Don't be rude!

453
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,760
But why are you here?

454
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,165
It's a long story.

455
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,499
Let me get you out first.

456
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,630
No need.

457
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,720
Even though you open the lock,

458
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,319
my legs will prevent me from escaping.

459
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,410
How dare he hurt you so badly!

460
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,365
We fought against them continuously all the way.

461
00:38:24,366 --> 00:38:26,870
Then I was careless and hurt my right leg.

462
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,032
It's good to know that you're alive.

463
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,520
It's still hopeful.

464
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,540
It seems I can reconsider his suggestion.

465
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,254
Yongning, listen to me.

466
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:45,049
I know the position of Tang Army well.

467
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,143
As long as I agree to cooperate with Ashile,

468
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:49,609
we can use their forces to storm Changan.

469
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,010
We can appeal his Majesty's former subordinates in your name

470
00:38:52,011 --> 00:38:53,365
and then kill the traitor, Li Shimin!

471
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:54,430
We can't!

472
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,579
Why?

473
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,450
Don't you want to avenge?

474
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,100
I see...

475
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,610
That's it... You've been close to your uncle from childhood.

476
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,720
I didn't mean that.

477
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:15,350
Since then,

478
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,889
he is not my second uncle anymore.

479
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,500
He's only my enemy.

480
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:24,030
I've suffered day by day

481
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,880
to find a chance to revenge.

482
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:29,630
But...

483
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,369
if we help Ashile Army to storm, we cannot repent anymore!

484
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,610
Uniting with another party to attack is a common occurrence.

485
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,743
We cannot find another good chance again!

486
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:39,854
General.

487
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,849
As a superb military commander,

488
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,120
how can't you know it's hard to return the military forces?

489
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,329
As I just ran away from Changan,

490
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,320
I thought there's nothing more to lose.

491
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,520
Nothing could hold me back.

492
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,630
I thought to borrow troops from Youzhou and Shuozhou to attack

493
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,300
but I knew I was wrong after a series of difficulties.

494
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,190
Bodies are piling up at battles

495
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,140
and how innocent are they?

496
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,329
If we help Ashile Army to attack,

497
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,476
how can the people of Tang yield without resistance?

498
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:26,560
At that time, corpses and blood will be all over the land.

499
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,143
Soldiers will die for their nation.

500
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:32,560
I hope you could think carefully!

501
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:43,560
Why do you laugh?

502
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,630
I was to sound out your intention.

503
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,429
Princess of Tang. His Majesty's daughter.

504
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,910
It's suspicious for you to be in the capital of Ashile Tribe.

505
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,150
It seems what you've done is better than mine.

506
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,699
As your father was my friend,

507
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,889
I just wanted to speak out against injustice.

508
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,899
I thought to force Li Shimin to abdicate

509
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,609
while I've never thought to be defeated.

510
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,300
An overwhelming defeat.

511
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,187
Ashile attacked Weishui for it lacked troops.

512
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:22,454
I brought the people a disaster. I should be reviled.

513
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:24,550
There's no need to blame yourself up for this.

514
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,080
Though Ashile Tribe attacked Weishui,

515
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,150
they soon retreated because of the trap.

516
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,299
You've been to Weishui.

517
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,410
Is that the reason why you're arrested?

518
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,699
Brave girl.

519
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,500
You're really as courageous as your father!

520
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,521
I'm...

521
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:45,899
very grateful to you

522
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,590
for maintaining my integrity!

523
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,165
Don't worry.

524
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,210
Though I've been trying to rebel against Li Shimin,

525
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:54,219
I've never forgotten I'm a member of Tang.

526
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,830
I won't surrender no matter what!

527
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,210
The most critical thing for you is to take good care of yourself.

528
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,450
I will come to save you.

529
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,787
By the way, Shiba should leave here as soon as possible.

530
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:11,390
I'll contact you to fetch him when I rescue him. Is that okay?

531
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,454
Shiba, listen to her!

532
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:16,450
Leave here now!

533
00:42:18,477 --> 00:42:19,632
You!

534
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:20,832
Stubborn as a mule!

535
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,210
You dare to violate my words now?

536
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,209
You're the last one of 18 Cavalrymen of Yanyun.

537
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,699
I've already ordered you to escape long ago.

538
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,187
But you violated my order and came here secretly.

539
00:42:33,188 --> 00:42:34,700
Do you want to drive me crazy?

540
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,121
Rules of 18 Cavalrymen of Yanyun are strict and can't be violated.

541
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:40,432
Don't you remember?

542
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,540
Leave now!

543
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,230
Go back, Yongning.

544
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,100
Be careful in the enemy camp.

545
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,343
General Luo, here's the medicine.

546
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:02,810
It'll be useful.

547
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:09,450
Take good care of yourself and wait for my help.

548
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,790
Thank you.

549
00:43:31,855 --> 00:43:32,920
Don't move!

550
00:43:38,522 --> 00:43:39,560
Who are you?

551
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,769
♫ <i>The heart gradually responds,</i> ♫

552
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,249
♫ <i>gradually revives,</i> ♫

553
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,569
♫ <i>gradually swims towards you</i> ♫

554
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,710
♫ <i>Before bidding farewell,</i> ♫

555
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,040
♫ <i>we expect an encounter</i> ♫

556
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,529
♫ <i>As your silhouette weaves</i> ♫

557
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,950
♫ <i>and locks in my nostalgic dream</i> ♫

558
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,359
♫ <i>Before the daybreak,</i> ♫

559
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,849
♫ <i>through the obsession of love,</i> ♫

560
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:27,679
♫ <i>the yearning flowing through thoughts</i> ♫

561
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,049
♫ <i>There's always a moment</i> ♫

562
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:36,849
♫ <i>where the wilderness burns in my heart</i> ♫

563
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,289
♫ <i>There's always solicitude</i> ♫

564
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:47,009
♫ <i>which froze everything between you and me</i> ♫

565
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,399
♫ <i>Meet each other in different time</i> ♫

566
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,679
♫ <i>Encourage each other in different worlds</i> ♫

567
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,249
♫ <i>My longings become a cocoon</i> ♫

568
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,009
♫ <i>Layer after layer</i> ♫

569
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,049
♫ <i>It turns into an eternity</i> ♫

570
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:06,910
♫ <i>The cocoon in the dark night</i> ♫

571
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:15,329
♫ <i>There's always a moment</i> ♫

572
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:20,959
♫ <i>where the wilderness burns in my heart</i> ♫

573
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,569
♫ <i>There's always solicitude</i> ♫

574
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:30,879
♫ <i>which froze everything between you and me</i> ♫

575
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,439
♫ <i>Meet each other in different time</i> ♫

576
