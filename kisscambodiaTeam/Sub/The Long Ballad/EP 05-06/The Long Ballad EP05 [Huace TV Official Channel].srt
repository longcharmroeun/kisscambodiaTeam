00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,920
♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,760
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,630
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,950
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,680
♫ I’ve never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,630
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,790
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,720
♫ To the distance. ♫

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,750

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,840

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,230
♫ I’ll return it with a long ballad. ♫

♫ The river of life is under my feet. ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,760

20
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,380
The Long Balad

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,060
Episode 5

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,040
Tegin,

23
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,120
The water is ready.

24
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,919
Su Yishe and Nuer are exploring the way ahead.

25
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,940
and found substitutes for us

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,620
to head for the grassland through the pass.

27
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,480
But,

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,919
according to our speed now,

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,760
it will take us half a month to get Youzhou.

30
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:52,839
Half a month?

31
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,279
It would be too long.

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
We have to hurry up.

33
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,199
Yes.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,839
That is...

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,599
How could it be a dead body?

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,520
Why is it him?

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,880
Tegin,

38
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:42,919
what's wrong?

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,080
Yaro,

40
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,080
find a place to stay.

41
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,440
Yes.

42
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,720
Tegin, let me hold him.

43
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,279
No.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,839
When did he change to a stickybeak?

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,919
As if that is a piece of gold?

46
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,639
Search carefully!

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,240
Dead or alive, we must find her!

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,160
Yes...yes...

49
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,759
Wei Shuyu.

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,320
Congratulations!

51
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,839
For what?

52
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,559
You intercepted Li Changge yourself.

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,440
And then you took the first place to shoot her.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,520
You made great contributions on clearing the leftover traitor.

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,199
Of course I should tell his Highness
to publicize your contribution.

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,679
Hao Du.

57
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,320
You are so ruthless, aren't you?

58
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,279
Aren't you clear whether Changge is guilty or not?

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
It's not important what I am thinking.

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,559
I just follow Father's order.

61
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,479
What he orders is what I think.

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,639
But Wei Shuyu, I also have something to tell you.

63
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,720
We cannot have it both ways.

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,559
If you want your family,

65
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,199
follow my order.

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,600
Tegin,

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,519
This is where hunters take a rest.

68
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
Few people would come.

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,239
Take the wine bottle and medicine, and a set of clothes.

70
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,720
Yes.

71
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,679
Shameless!

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,519
Why did you hit me?

73
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,720
What are you doing?

74
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,679
Can't you see what I am doing?

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,959
What did you see?

76
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,959
You are a man,

77
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,600
what can I see?

78
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,320
Then why are you covering your eyes?

79
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,279
I don't like blood.

80
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,380
I don't want to see your wound.

81
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,600
Since you are so marvelous,

82
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,320
then do it yourself.

83
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,359
I didn't ask you for help.

84
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,600
Aliqi.

85
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,799
What does it mean?

86
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,119
Spirit from the west.

87
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,320
Much better.

88
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,559
Thanks!

89
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,079
Are you silly?

90
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,640
Bear it!

91
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,200
You are a real man.

92
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,060
Give her the medicine.

93
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,559
Don't touch me!

94
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,880
Don't cry aloud like a woman!

95
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,220
We don't have to wait till now if we want to hurt you.

96
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:18,720
Leave her alone.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,020
He's really ungrateful.

98
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,320
Go.

99
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:53,839
Father,

100
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,359
what's wrong?

101
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
Prince Qin was here just now,

102
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,640
and I scolded him out.

103
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,359
I think he will send someone here soon,

104
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,600
and put me to death.

105
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,399
Father,

106
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,959
I'll prepare for the carriage now,

107
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,959
please escape to hometown Quyang first.

108
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,480
I'll find Mr. Du now.

109
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,480
Shuyu,

110
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,640
your father is not a coward.

111
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:27,119
But, sorry for making you involved.

112
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,238
Father,

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
it's my fault.

114
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:45,159
I'm not strong enough to protect my father, nor my family.

115
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,400
Stand up.

116
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,119
What I did has nothing to do with you.

117
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,479
Today, Prince Qin came to our house,

118
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,400
so he is really a broad-minded man.

119
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,880
If you want to work for Prince Qin,

120
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,080
I won't stop you.

121
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,119
Father,

122
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:17,960
I don't know whether it is a right choice or not.

123
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,119
Mr. Wei.

124
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,280
This is what his Highness asked me to deliver to you.

125
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,880
Father.

126
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,119
No!

127
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,400
I'll plead to his Highness,

128
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,679
and Wr. Du.

129
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,440
Shuyu.

130
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,440
Father!

131
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,640
Take it.

132
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,679
Mr. Wei.

133
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,679
Please enjoy.

134
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,239
Father.

135
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,400
Father, no!

136
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,119
I'll plead to his Highness,

137
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,880
and Mr. Du.

138
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,159
How did I teach you since you were young?

139
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,640
Take off your hands.

140
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,640
Vinegar celery.

141
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,479
Mr. Fang always says that Mr. Wei loves vinegar celery.

142
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,440
Crown Princess Zhangsun
made it with five flavors in person.

143
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,559
Just to show my gratitude.

144
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:03,559
Today it was my fault.

145
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,599
Please forgive me.

146
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,039
Father...father...

147
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,400
Father!

148
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,159
Father! No!

149
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:19,760
Fa...

150
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,479
I was too narrow-minded.

151
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:39,080
But Prince Qin knows when to yield and when not.

152
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,919
Although we are from different sides,

153
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,000
I never say it out but I am clear in mind,

154
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,960
Prince Qin is benevolent and generous,

155
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,479
but also resolute in his decisions.

156
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,119
No one can stop this mishap.

157
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,880
As for my loyalty to my master,

158
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,359
I can decline him for my whole life.

159
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,080
But the lands we are in still belong to Tang.

160
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,960
People here are still people of Tang.

161
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:21,159
My long-cherished wish is just for repaying Tang.

162
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,719
Father,

163
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,239
I know.

164
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,200
For my whole life, I'm convinced by only a few people.

165
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:42,080
This vinegar celery...has convinced me!

166
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,039
Thanks.

167
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,159
It's a misunderstanding.

168
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,919
You saved my life, I will...

169
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,359
It's okay.

170
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
You don't owe me anything.

171
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,159
There's nothing between us.

172
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,559
That would be good.

173
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,880
Well... Can I have this wine?

174
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,799
Yes,

175
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,320
but I never suffer any loss in business.

176
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,200
Why not make an exchange?

177
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,559
I can give you the wine.

178
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,359
You need to answer my questions.

179
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,679
Okay?

180
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,479
It is impolite not to reciprocate.

181
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,000
Then let's play a game.

182
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Dare you?

183
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:04,880
Of course.

184
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,880
We ask each other questions in turn.

185
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,320
If one can not answer,

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,820
then one should drink as a forfeit.

187
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,719
Okay.

188
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Go ahead.

189
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,679
Where did you get the wound on your shoulder?

190
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,880
Soldiers from the court shot me.

191
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,799
You are so straightforward.

192
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,520
Since it's an exchange,

193
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,080
no one is allowed to lie.

194
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,719
My turn.

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,159
What's your name?

196
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,239
Surname, Qin.

197
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,799
Zhun.

198
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,400
You can call me A'Zhun.

199
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,840
A'Zhun...

200
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,520
You?

201
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,119
Surname, Li.

202
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,119
I was the 14th child in the family.

203
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,919
Call me Shisi.

204
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,479
Why did you want my dagger?

205
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:01,479
I just wanted to embarrass you.

206
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,799
I knew you were a bad guy.

207
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,840
A'Zhun, where are you from?

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,980
I'm from central plains,

209
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,440
born beyond the Great Wall.

210
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,679
Then where's your home?

211
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,740
That's another question.

212
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,280
Next,

213
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,200
where would you head to?

214
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,039
For a revenge.

215
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,479
Then what about you?

216
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,559
To the north.

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,880
Revenge for what?

218
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,520
What to do in the north?

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
A huge business.

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,320
Since you have answered it,

221
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,640
why did you take a drink?

222
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,039
Because you will ask me about the business,

223
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,799
and I cannot answer.

224
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,840
I will be drunk if I keep drinking.

225
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,280
Then the last question,

226
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,000
are you really called Azhun?

227
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,799
Then Shisi,

228
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,799
are you really Shisi?

229
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,440
Good!

230
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:37,880
Come on!

231
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:38,559
Cheers!

232
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,000
Again!

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,220
Drink!

234
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,320
What is Tegin talking with him?

235
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,719
I've long been not hearing that laugh from him.

236
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,280
Tegin has been leading Eagle Division for years,

237
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,119
but Great Khan is always suspicious of him.

238
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,919
And he always got impeded by that deadly foe.

239
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,479
Under such a situation,

240
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,039
if it were you, could you laugh?

241
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,359
Yes, you are right.

242
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,119
But never mind that,

243
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,119
don't be upset by that.

244
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,959
But I haven't seen him caring about anyone so much.

245
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,400
Your Highness,

246
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,400
Princess Yongning has nothing to do with the rumor.

247
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,119
It seems that it was done by others.

248
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,760
As for Princess Yongning,

249
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,760
it was my fault to let her escape.

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,800
Fine.

251
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,800
These days, massive forces have already yielded surrender.

252
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,119
Even if she has any move,

253
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
it won't cause a big trouble.

254
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,599
Just pay more attention to her.

255
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,839
Yes.

256
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,400
Keming.

257
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,439
What's more, your Highness?

258
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,640
What Changge took away with her,

259
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,160
is an important item of the court.

260
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,000
No matter what,

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
no one can keep it.

262
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,040
Clear.

263
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,400
Wei Zheng was right.

264
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,119
I'm the most ruthless person in this world.

265
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,000
Princess.

266
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Mr. Du.

267
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,599
His Highness is in there.

268
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,479
You can go in.

269
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,199
Tegin.

270
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Let's go.

271
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:54,199
Where is that boy?

272
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,319
He's gone.

273
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,640
Gone?

274
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,359
Why didn't he tell me?

275
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,119
Just go?

276
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,439
Su Yishe.

277
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,959
Send a scout back to the Eagle Division.

278
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,400
Ask them to prepare these,

279
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,800
and wait for me outside Youzhou.

280
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,400
And, hand this to Great Khan.

281
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,560
Don't worry, Tegin.

282
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:12,520
Go.

283
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,640
Tegin,

284
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,000
what should we do after we get Youzhou?

285
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,359
I've already asked Su Yishe to prepare the road stone.

286
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,560
Greetings, father.

287
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
It's hard for you to see me yourself.

288
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,680
Anything happened?

289
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,359
Nothing.

290
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,079
I just want to come to see you.

291
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,599
That's so kind of you.

292
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,719
If nothing wrong, just go back and have rest.

293
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm still very busy now.

294
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:12,920
I want to ask you about Changge.

295
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,719
Please don't harm her.

296
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,040
Changge just has a bad temper.

297
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,160
- But she...
- Yan.

298
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:35,719
Yan.

299
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,920
Forget Changge.

300
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,119
It's good for both you and her.

301
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,199
Father!

302
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,680
Your Highness, the court sent someone here.

303
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,079
He is here to see Princess.

304
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,199
His Majesty heard that
Princess harbors great righteousness in mind,

305
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,500
and would love to marry into the grassland.

306
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,520
I am here to send rewards,

307
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,119
and the imperial edict.

308
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,800
Please accept it, Princess.

309
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,479
Crown Prince's daughter,

310
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,239
young and quiet,

311
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:26,760
as one of the members of the royal family,

312
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:30,040
all your reward is according to the regime.

313
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,079
Now you are Royal Princess Yongan,

314
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,680
you can get the rewards of 3000 households,

315
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,560
and this is executed at once.

316
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,319
Noble Princess Yongan,

317
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,920
accept it, please!

318
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,280
I accept it with pleasure.

319
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,239
Thanks to your Majesty!

320
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:26,000
I still have to marry into the grassland, right?

321
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,940
[Du's Mansion]

322
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,599
Father,

323
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,839
you have been upset
since you came back from Hongyi Palace.

324
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,800
Is that because his Highness is still concerned about Li Changge?

325
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,079
If she is still alive,

326
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,319
then she'll be a big trouble.

327
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,719
I can't understand.

328
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,839
Why can Li Changge make Crown Prince, Princess,

329
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,160
and Family Wei protect and defend her?

330
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,319
His Highness is very affectionate towards her.

331
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,760
Princess is her good friend.

332
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,400
As for Mr. Wei,

333
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,520
if Li Changge is alive,

334
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,800
she must go to find Wei Shuyu.

335
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,640
Keep an eye on Wei Shuyu.

336
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,479
Find the Seal of Crown Prince.

337
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,160
And kill her.

338
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:43,920
Understand.

339
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:45,920
Hao Du,

340
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,400
remember.

341
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,760
Never mind the trivial things
when doing something important.

342
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,160
Never be tied by any affections.

343
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes.

344
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,100
[Chang'an]

345
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,040
From here I will leave Chang'an.

346
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:31,560
I never thought that I would come here one day.

347
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,040
Hurt! Hurt!

348
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,079
A'Dou?

349
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,319
Master!

350
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:39,439
What's wrong?

351
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,079
Nothing.

352
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,959
Why are you here?

353
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
I asked you...

354
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,760
I've been here waiting for a whole day.

355
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,800
Since I know master will head north,

356
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,479
then you must pass this boundary tablets on your way.

357
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,719
Master, I've been with you for some days.

358
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,959
Am I making any progress?

359
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,479
But if you didn't show up,

360
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,800
I would doubt myself if I was wrong.

361
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,079
A'Dou,

362
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,239
I still have no idea where my future is.

363
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,300
You have a bright future.

364
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,119
Although you can't stay at Pinxiang Store,

365
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:16,079
you have many other choices.

366
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,719
Why must you follow me?

367
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,479
Master,

368
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,719
you are my future.

369
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,800
I will be with you no matter I'm alive or dead!

370
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,800
I said that,

371
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,000
I won't be wrong.

372
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,719
my master must be a big hero!

373
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,160
Which hero has no general with him?

374
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,079
I am my master's general!

375
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:33,839
Master!

376
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,239
I'm serious!

377
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,479
A'Dou.

378
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,040
Master!

379
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,719
Let me follow you.

380
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:52,640
Kowtow.

381
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,640
Since you take me as your master,
we have to obey the ritual.

382
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,599
Master, please take me as your apprentice!

383
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:10,479
From now on, you are my apprentice.

384
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,160
We will never betray each other.

385
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,520
Okay.

386
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,079
Master,

387
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,119
where are we going now?

388
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,280
Youzhou.

389
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,460
My father's soldiers and horses are there.

390
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:26,239
Li Yuan, the Governor of Youzhou, is my father's good friend.

391
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:27,400
Besides,

392
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:30,160
if we can persuade him to help us,

393
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,839
it will be possible for us to win.

394
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,719
Then I am going to be a general so quickly?

395
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,239
Far from that!

396
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,040
But,

397
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,000
I will never give up.

398
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,460
[Chang'an]

399
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,280
My house is not good enough for you.

400
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,000
I am here to say sorry.

401
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,680
Mr. Wei was right.

402
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,119
I scolded you so much,

403
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,079
which one do you mean?

404
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:15,079
This is for that plate of vinegar celery.

405
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:23,640
Mr. Wei is also a father,

406
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,040
when you were risking for Jiancheng,

407
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,959
did you think about Shuyu?

408
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,079
Don't worry,

409
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,920
I have some farmlands at home,

410
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,839
it's enough for my boys.

411
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,319
So a man like Mr. Wei also worries about his sons.

412
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,319
What do you want to say?

413
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:47,400
Just a chat.

414
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:51,199
I also have kids and always worry about them.

415
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,160
I have read a lot.

416
00:29:54,719 --> 00:30:00,319
But I have no idea how to protect them as their parents.

417
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,520
I'm a father,

418
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,520
I can feel your love to kids.

419
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,160
I heard about that marriage of Princess Yongan.

420
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,680
If you're worried about it,

421
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:20,359
then I may give you a suggestion.

422
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,839
Please.

423
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,520
What?

424
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,280
I suffer a strange disease?

425
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,079
Yes.

426
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,119
Remember.

427
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,680
This strange disease can not be cured so quickly,

428
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,900
and you have to go to Luoyang to get medical treatment.

429
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,520
Luoyang?

430
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,239
Yes.

431
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,800
I have already arranged for you.

432
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,520
Start your trip as soon as possible.

433
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,719
Go!

434
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,040
You always cry.

435
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,959
How could you be a princess if you are so weak?

436
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,199
You should learn from Changge!

437
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,680
Yan.

438
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,439
Because you suffer from this,

439
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:23,079
so you can't marry so far.

440
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,599
Understand?

441
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,439
Stay at Luoyang for the treatment.

442
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,119
I will send someone to take you back as soon as you are recovered.

443
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,439
I know you get on well with Mr. Wei.

444
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,520
I have asked him to escort you to Luoyang.

445
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,959
You don't have to worry about anything with his help.

446
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,959
As ordered.

447
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,239
Brother Shuyu.

448
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,079
I will take you to Luoyang.

449
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,400
Thanks, Brother Shuyu.

450
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,000
You will understand your father someday.

451
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,119
You!

452
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,760
Come!

453
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,079
Okay.

454
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,199
Next.

455
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,380
[Youzhou]

456
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,680
Be careful!

457
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,599
Next.

458
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,640
Go.

459
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,719
Okay, okay, go.

460
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,239
Okay.

461
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,800
Next.

462
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,239
Go.

463
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:16,760
Thanks.

464
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,119
What's in your carriage?

465
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Food.

466
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,119
- Food?
- Yes.

467
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,400
You. You.

468
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,319
Go and search.

469
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,000
Yes.

470
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:32,479
No...no need to search.

471
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,319
Just some grains.

472
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,640
It's not up to you.

473
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Any problems?

474
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,119
No.

475
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,119
Okay.

476
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,079
Thanks!

477
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:46,680
- Go.
- Thanks!

478
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,800
Go, let's go.

479
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,920
Wait!

480
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:56,640
Sir.

481
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,560
Why are you so nervous?

482
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,520
No, sir.

483
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:02,359
What's in here?

484
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,800
Officer, just some grains.

485
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:11,918
Sir...

486
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:20,559
Open it and search.

487
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,520
Yes, yes.

488
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,159
No...

489
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,520
Take them all.

490
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,320
Yes.

491
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:50,158
No, no, no...

492
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,120
No, sir!

493
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,120
Go, go.

494
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm wronged, sir!

495
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,679
Wronged!

496
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,959
General.

497
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
What's that?

498
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,600
We didn't get anything,

499
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,199
and you didn't see anything.

500
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,239
Remember?

501
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:05,959
Yes!

502
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,239
I was wronged! Officer!

503
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,840
Go quickly.

504
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,479
I was wronged! Officer!

505
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:23,280
Thanks.

506
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,280
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

507
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,800
Master,

508
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,000
you're so clever.

509
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,760
If we didn't get on this carriage,

510
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,360
how could we get here so quickly?

511
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,520
There would be many blisters on our feet.

512
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,120
This is leveraging.

513
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,239
Learn from it.

514
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,719
Their food is quite good!

515
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:52,800
Slow down, madam!

516
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,760
What will we do next?

517
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:56,879
Wander around.

518
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,919
Okay, let's go.

519
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,600
Let's stay here.

520
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,840
Please.

521
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,399
Waiter?

522
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:04,479
Here!

523
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,679
Two gentlemen,

524
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,000
which room do you want?

525
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,159
The cheapest?

526
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,719
The cheapest.

527
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:14,600
This way.

528
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,080
Go.

529
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,959
Please.

530
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
Have a look here.

531
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,120
Although our room is not big,

532
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,280
it is enough for you two.

533
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:27,639
Besides, it's quiet here.

534
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,439
Are you satisfied, client?

535
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:30,719
Yes.

536
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,879
Okay, have some rest first.

537
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,760
And I will prepare the hot water for you.

538
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,399
I will explore around the Governor Mansion.

539
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,639
you stay here.

540
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:43,719
Don't expose yourself.

541
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes.

542
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,080
Master, just bear it.

543
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,080
It is good enough for the boss to provide us with the warehouse.

544
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,600
I will clean it up.

545
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,600
And make it a cozy place for you to have a rest.

546
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,800
A'Dou,

547
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,959
don't be too tired.

548
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm okay with that.

549
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:10,639
I'm not tired, master.

550
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,120
Have some rest now!

551
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,760
Nothing,

552
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,120
I will explore here.

553
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,520
Master, I will follow you.

554
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,120
You are just a little boy,

555
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,580
it'd be strange for you to go with me.

556
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,600
Sleep early.

557
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,700
I'll take you some food.

558
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,360
This is the last stop.

559
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,840
Tomorrow we will arrive at the palace in Luoyang.

560
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,840
Brother Shuyu,

561
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,959
am I going to leave tomorrow?

562
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,080
The view of Luoyang palace is very splendid.

563
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,679
Those servants will be your side.

564
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:16,679
Those days when we could play together are just like a dream.

565
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:20,719
We three were so good,

566
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:25,719
but now we have to be separated remotely.

567
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,239
and head to different places.

568
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,280
All good things must come to an end.

569
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,780
No one can stay with each other for the whole life.

570
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,399
Brother Shuyu, I understand.

571
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,639
I have to wake up.

572
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,679
We have grown up.

573
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Brother Shuyu,

574
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:52,000
could you...could you write to me when you are free?

575
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,040
As soon as you get news about Changge,

576
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,639
tell me.

577
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,520
I promise you.

578
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,600
I will find her.

579
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,520
It's late.

580
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,000
Go back and have rest.

581
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,840
I never thought that you could be so quick.

582
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,600
I can catch up with you until you are almost at Luoyang.

583
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,760
Listen, Wei Shuyu!

584
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,479
Decree from Crown Prince.

585
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,399
Wei Shuyu is assigned as the special envoy of Chang'an.

586
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,719
No need to go back to Chang'an.

587
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,399
Go with Hao Du to Youzhou.

588
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,639
Call Li Yuan, King of Lujiang, to come to the court.

589
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,159
Please tell me,

590
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,760
do you have her message?

591
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,800
You hope it's a yes, or no?

592
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:16,239
No matter what, you have to go with me.

593
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,639
Besides,

594
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,919
you just need to issue the decree.

595
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,719
As for others,

596
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,600
stay away from it.

597
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,600
Someone saw that Princess Yongning
and a boy appeared on the way to the north,

598
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,560
heading to Youzhou.

599
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,479
Listen.

600
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,679
Keep an eye on Wei Shuyu.

601
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,040
If they meet each other privately,

602
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:50,600
kill Yongning.

603
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,479
If Wei Shuyu stops you,

604
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,639
the same to him.

605
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,280
Yes.

606
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:37,520
Boss.

607
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,320
Which is your best ironware?

608
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,590
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

609
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,900
♫ gradually revives, ♫

610
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,180
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

611
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,740
♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫

612
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,070
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

613
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,220
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

614
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,980
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

615
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,980
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

616
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,590
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

617
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:49,660
♫ the longing flows. ♫

618
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,870
♫ There’s always a moment ♫

619
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:58,460
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

620
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,220
♫ There’s always solicitude ♫

621
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:08,980
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

622
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,350
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

623
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,700
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

624
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,180
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

625
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,630
♫ layer after layer. ♫

626
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,980
♫ it turns into eternity. ♫

627
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:28,940
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

628
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:37,110
♫ There’s always a moment ♫

629
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:42,660
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

630
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,270
♫ There’s always solicitude ♫

631
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:52,900
♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫

632
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,460
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

633
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,820
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

♫ it turns into eternity. ♫

637
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:13,590
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

638
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,760
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

639
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:35,890
The Long Ballad
