00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Episode 6

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,680
Sir.

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,319
Your dishes.

24
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,519
Have a taste.

25
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,279
Here's the wine.

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,360
Have a drink.

27
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,839
Sir, what would you like?

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,320
A plate of mutton.

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:09,919
OK.

30
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,320
Generals, it's my treat.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,600
It's considerate of you.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,520
Where are you from?

33
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,720
Honestly,

34
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:24,119
I have a cousin called Niu Awu

35
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,639
who serves in the army in Youzhou.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you know him?

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
Do you know him?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,199
There are indeed several bros in the camp with the surname Niu.

39
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,119
But I'm not sure whether he's in the troop.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,160
Considering your filial piety,

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,080
I want you to dissuade him from serving in the army here.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,600
Look for another way out.

43
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,000
Why?

44
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,839
You're inexperienced.

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,440
If you serve in the army here,

46
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,679
maybe you'll lose your life soon.

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,360
Mind your words!

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,080
Don't talk nonsense when drunk.

49
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,160
If someone eavesdrops,

50
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,559
you'll be killed.

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,720
Thank you for saving me.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,919
But Youzhou is a very important city in our country.

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,440
Everything is in order here.

54
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,119
Why do you consider it bad?

55
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,639
Since the incident on 4th day,

56
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,279
Commandant Li hasn't come out yet.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
Other commandants are in a hurry to show congratulations
and report on work in the capital.

58
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,880
But our commandant shows respect to no one

59
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,559
and won't go out.

60
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,240
Seven days have passed.

61
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,559
If his Highness blames him,

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,479
He doesn't come out.

63
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,880
King of Lujiang will be killed.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,440
We the defending troops in Youzhou will also be killed.

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,759
General Wang and King of Lujiang are related by marriage.

66
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,199
They're two grasshoppers on a rope.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Perhaps General Wang will be killed, too.

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,639
Just muddle along.

69
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,360
Cheers.

70
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,839
Cheers.

71
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,000
I didn't expect that Li Yuan

72
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,440
is affectionate, righteous and courageous.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
So there's nothing hard.

74
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,320
Thank you for enlightening me.

75
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,559
Have a good meal.

76
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,679
See you.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,440
Have the dishes.

78
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,039
Come on!

79
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,720
You and I are in the same position.

80
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,279
I've always been tolerant of you.

81
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,760
But you've always bothered me.

82
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,440
No need to do that.

83
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,238
You are from a famous family in Shandong.

84
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,760
You have a bright future.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,559
I'm just a warrior.

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,440
How dare I have a comparable position with you?

87
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,399
I don't want to be your enemy.

88
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,440
You don't have to be sarcastic all the time.

89
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,720
These are the gifts from the imperial court.

90
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,399
Be careful. Don't bump on the road.

91
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,320
Go!

92
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,119
Yes!

93

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,320
Where did you get the iron ore?

95
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:10,959
General.

96
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,480
We got this iron ore by accident

97
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,160
from selling goods in the north.

98
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,799
Our master said we can earn a lot

99
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,640
by selling the ore to the blacksmith shop.

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,079
If you impound the goods,

101
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll lose my life when back.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,519
General.

103
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,200
It's too wasteful to smelt such excellent iron ore

104
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,320
into ordinary farm tools.

105
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,119
Little bro.

106
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Can you get more iron ore?

107
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:41,880
I...

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,079
Smuggling iron ore is a felony.

109
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,760
Kill him!

110
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,640
No!

111
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,160
I can!

112
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,119
I can!

113

114
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:01,040
How much do you want?

115
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,920
I want as much as you have.

116
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:03,959
Well...

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,399
I have to discuss with my master.

118

Little bro.

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Remember.

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,760
I want 2000 dan.

121
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,880

OK.

125
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,160
Don't play tricks on me.

126
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,320

135

Do you love me so much that

140
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,760
you follow me all the way?

141
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,279
You think too much.

142
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,040
Why not tell me you come to Youzhou for business?

143
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,000
You didn't ask me.

What do you want to do here?

00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:13,880
Tonight,

192
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,880
let's go to see General Wang.

193
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,400
Really?

194
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,640
Master!

195
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,960
Why do you come back so early?

196
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,440
Did Li Yuan agree?

197
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,640
I didn't see him.

198
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,559
But I have some achievements.

199
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,280
A' Dou.

200
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:37,960
Look for paper and ink.

201
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,880
I want to write a letter for a visit.

202
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,640
OK.

203
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,719
Hope this time my guess is right.

204
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,479
Leyan?

205
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,719
Brother Shuyu.

206
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,280
Princess?

207
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,280
Why hide in the carriage?

208
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,080
Get off right now.

209
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,039
Come on.

210
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,679
Why do you follow us?

211
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Brother Shuyu.

212
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,039
In fact,

213
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,359
I just worry about you.

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,599
So I followed you in secret.

215
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,719
You don't have to worry about me.

216
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,239
Don't be willful next time.

217
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll arrange for my men to send Princess
back to Luoyang immediately.

218
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,159
No.

219
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't want to return Luoyang alone.

220
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,760
Men!

221
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:34,799
Let Princess mount the horse.

222
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,239
Brother Shuyu!

223
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,960
Hao.

224
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,080
Why rush to send her away?

225
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm worrying about her safety.

226
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,960
Brother Shuyu, he's untrustworthy.

227
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,080
Can you send me away?

228
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440
But I'm busy with my official business.

229
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,359
Or shall I follow you?

230
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,359
I won't make any trouble.

231
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:06,640
Hao.

232
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,159
Youzhou's affair is urgent. It can't be delayed.

233
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,359
It's OK to go back a few days later.

234
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:14,280
If there's any trouble with her on the way,

235
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,000
can you take the responsibility?

236
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,320
I will be fully responsible for her safety.

237
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:28,719
Leyan.

238
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,679
You have to share a horse with me later.

239
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,000
At the next station,

240
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,320
I'll find you a carriage.

241
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,000
Brother Shuyu.

242
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,880
This bad guy said that

243
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,039
he would not only kill Changge but also you.

244
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,479
Put things in order.

245
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,159
Ready to go.

246
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,440
Yes!

247
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Don't worry.

248
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,119
Got it.

249
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,280
General Wang.

250
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,720
Thanks for waiting.

251
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,280
Yes!

252
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,320
Are you the master of those merchants?

253
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,920
How long have you been in business?

254
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:32,919
For years.

255
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,440
General.

256
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,510
Nothing is on the cart!

257
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,520
How dare you play tricks on me?

258
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,080
Wang Junkuo.

259
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I haven't seen you for years.

260
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,280
Can't you recognize me?

261
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,119
You're...

262
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,080
You're the Tegin of Eagle Division in Ashile Tribe!

263
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:01,520
Ashile Sun!

264
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:06,439
How dare you come to Youzhou?

265
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,439
You bite the hook.

266
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,800
If my memory doesn't go wrong,

267
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,959
it's you who invited me to Youzhou.

268
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,520
I've found that there's a trick.

269
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,000
But compared with what I want,

270
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,359
I'd better take your head to Chang'an.

271
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,680
That's more valuable.

272
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,079
If you go to Chang'an,

273
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,199
you'll never return.

274
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,000
I come here to give you a way to survive.

275
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,079
But you refuse.

276
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:45,680
Master!

277
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,239
Your handwriting is beautiful.

278
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,400
Master.

279
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,680
What are you writing?

280
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,160
A way to survive.

281
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,439
A way to survive?

282
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,239
Secrets of martial arts!

283
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,359
You can understand like that.

284
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,479
I'll see whether Li Yuan accepts it or not.

285
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,920
Master.

286
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,680
What's this?

287
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,760
Seal of Crown Prince.

288
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,520
Seal of Crown Prince?

289
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,400
Quiet!

290
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:24,880
Master.

291
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,160
You...

292
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,719
From now on,

293
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm afraid of nothing.

294
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,359
Have a seat.

295
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,199
Are you afraid?

296
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,439
What do you want to say?

297
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,760
Prince Qin has entered Eastern Palace.

298
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,479
Youzhou is in emergency.

299
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,920
You're more clear about the situation.

300
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,920
Instead of waiting for death,

301
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,000
you might as well use the favorable terrain of Youzhou

302
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,040
to find your own way out.

303
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,199
I am loyal to my country.

304
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,680
Stop talking nonsense!

305
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,359
You say you're loyal to your country.

306
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,880
Why are you secretly searching for iron ore?

307
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,599
You want to forge weapons in case of rebellion.

308
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,880
Are you going to tell me that

309
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,359
you are going to pay tribute to the new crown prince?

310
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,839
Your mind is not perturbed

311
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,439
because the deal is not that worthy.

312
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,239
If Khan wants to help you,

313
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,880
iron ore is a piece of cake.

314
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,920
What do you mean?

315
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,800
Western warhorse!

316
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,400
Calm down.

317
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,199
If you want this deal,

318
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,359
Ashile Tribe will endlessly provide Youzhou

319
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,359
such warhorse and weapons.

320
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,760
What benefits can you get

321
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,199
by providing us with such aid?

322
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,319
You're quite clear about Prince Qin's strength.

323
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,160
Though Youzhou is important,

324
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,119
you can't resist for long after rebellion

325
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,119
even if you win for the time being.

326
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,560
Why not submit to Ashile Tribe

327
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,160
and rely on our support?

328
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,400
You can resist against Prince Qin,

329
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,040
or even fill his shoes.

330
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,730
It's impossible for me to listen to Yanli,

331
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,040
who is quite disgusting.

332
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,000
Stop daydreaming.

333
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,760
Now that you refuse,

334
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,359
bye.

335
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,119
Go.

336
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,920
General, shall we shoot arrows?

337
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,119
Follow them.

338
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,599
Find out where they're stationed.

339
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,479
Yes!

340
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Go back and tell your General

341
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,880
our Tegin doesn't like his behavior.

342
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,479
One more step,

343
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
your head will be apart.

344
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,239
If you understand,

345
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,920
tie a white towel outside the cottage.

346
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,800
Then someone will contact you.

347
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,000
Who is it?

348
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,760
I'm Su Yishe, a warrior of Tegin Sun.

349
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,680
There's critical intelligence for Great Khan.

350
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,520
Eagle Tribe.

351
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,160
Go!

352
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,680
Young Khan!

353
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,079
Do what?

354
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:16,800
Stop!

355
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,439
It's my intelligence for Great Khan.

356
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,280
You shouldn't read it.

357
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,160
Give it back to me!

358
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,400
Why are you alone?

359
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,719
Where is Sun?

360
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,079
Did he die before I take action?

361
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,199
Stop daydreaming!

362
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,680
Nothing wrong with him!

363
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:28,880
Let me go!

364
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,119
I want to see Great Khan!

365
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,560
Take it easy.

366
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,079
He's quite busy.

367
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,479
Let me read it on his behalf.

368
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,199
No wonder I can't get his information.

369
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,800
He went to Youzhou.

370
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,479
I'll give it to Great Khan.

371
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,239
Go back to Eagle Tribe as soon as possible!

372
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,239
Mom.

373
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,199
Are you OK in the paradise?

374
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,199
I miss you very much.

375
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,599
I'll do something important tomorrow.

376
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,280
I can't predict success or failure.

377
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,439
But I have no other choice.

378
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,560
Even Wei family turns to Li Shimin.

379
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,760
I have no one to rely on.

380
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,280
I can only take risks.

381
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,319
Seal of Crown Prince

382
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,319
belonged to my dad.

383
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,160
I want to contact dad's former troops by it

384
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,119
to revenge for Eastern Palace.

385
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,880
But if you were alive,

386
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,760
you would have blamed me for my impulsion.

387
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,199
Don't worry.

388
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,040
I'll take care of Seal of Crown Prince.

389
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,000
I won't let villains get it.

390
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,319
You look upset.

391
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,000
What are you thinking about?

392
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,479
No.

393
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:39,520
I'm watching the moon.

394
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,640
Really?

395
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,479
I thought you're upset

396
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,839
because you failed to enter Governor Mansion.

397
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,119
You're joking.

398
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,880
I just passed by.

399
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,880
I'm just a nobody.

400
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,000
I dare not make friends with Governor Mansion.

401
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
Nobody?

402
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,000
I remember that when we met for the first time,

403
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,479
you were full of high spirit.

404
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,599
Are you really a nobody?

405
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,160
A'Zhun.

406
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,400
You're used to trusting no one, right?

407
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,839
You'll be tired of suspecting others.

408
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,520
I won't ask where you're from.

409
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,479
And you don't ask where I'm from.

410
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,400
OK?

411
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:29,880
No.

412
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,319
Then there's nothing to talk.

413
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,800
You're so stubborn.

414
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,359
If you don't want to tell me,

415
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
I won't ask you.

416
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,520
Are you getting better?

417
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,880
It's nothing for a man to get hurt.

418
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,800
Man?

419
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,000
Man?

420
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,880
Don't you feel strange that we watch the moon together?

421
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,079
The moon itself is a symbol of reunion.

422
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Seeing the moon in a foreign land,

423
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,800
I'll think of my hometown.

424
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,880
That's nothing strange.

425
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,199
I think moonlight in Central Plains

426
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,079
is not better than that of grassland.

427
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,959
Have you been to grassland?

428
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,040
I just passed by in business.

429
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,599
Yes.

430
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,959
Merchants like you

431
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,680
must have been to many places

432
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,400
and seen a lot of beautiful scenery.

433
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,479
No wonder you looks down upon the moonlight in Youzhou.

434
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,640
Hope I can go to grassland

435
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,719
and see whether the night sky there is as beautiful as you said.

436
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,400
You want to see grassland?

437
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,640
Maybe I'll never have such opportunities.

438
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:55,280
By the way,

439
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,160
what's your business in Youzhou?

440
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:58,920
Is it hard to do?

441
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,719
It depends on fate.

442
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
I don't believe fate.

443
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,920
I only believe human effort.

444
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,920
I didn't expect that a man like you should believe in fate.

445
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,400
Human effort is the decisive factor?

446
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,400
Interesting.

447
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,760
You're right.

448
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,680
I made a slip of the tongue.

449
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,520
But as a merchant,

450
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,119
you're interested in horsemanship and archery

451
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,680
and are strong and vigorous.

452
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,520
Who's your master?

453
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,560
I learned on my own.

454
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,319
I've been bereaved since childhood.

455
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,319
I learn these skills just for survival.

456
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,079
You're quite gifted.

457
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,839
Unlike me, I learn from...

458
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,160
If you're tired,

459
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,359
have a rest.

460
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:10,280
No!

461
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,959
I can!

462
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,950
♫ One thought leaves a trace, eyes are filled with anger. ♫

463
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,719
Stand straight!

464
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:19,900
♫ Looking at the past, I want to forget each other. ♫

465
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,300
♫ The long ballad is silent, the long sword is not victorious. ♫

466
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,000
♫ Desires are endless. ♫

467
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,520
♫ I find myself at a loss. ♫

468
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,079
Stand up!

469
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,640
Again!

470
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,840
♫ No hope, no world, no image. ♫

471
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,599
I don't know how to repay you.

472
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,959
Now that the dagger is won by myself,

473
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,199
I should give it to you.

474
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,520
Yongning, you've grown up.

475
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,520
One day,

476
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,959
I'll kill my mom's murderer with this dagger.

477
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:59,150
♫ Hide the impermanence of the world. Black hair turns gray. ♫

478
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:05,450
♫ Obsession is like Epiphyllum. It's OK to forget it. ♫

479
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,239
Return it to me.

480
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,280
So mean.

481
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,520
You talk like a woman.

482
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,920
Boring.

483
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,319
You should eat more meat.

484
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,560
You're too slim.

485
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,079
None of your business.

486
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,680
Master, why haven't you...

487
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,880
I saw nothing.

488
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,520
Go on.

489
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,760
Thank you for accompanying me.

490
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,479
Master.

491
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,439
Why is the merchant also here?

492
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,400
None of your business. Go to bed.

493
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,160
Shisi.

494
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,520
In fact, the moonlight on the grassland

495
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,119
is not as beautiful as you think.

496
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,439
Your Highness.

497
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,520
Since you asked me to come at midnight,

498
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,920
What can I do for you?

499
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,800
Do you have any information of Changge?

500
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,359
Someone saw Princess Yongning

501
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,280
on the official road to Youzhou.

502
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:55,160
It seems that she is determined to fight me to the end.

503
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:57,439
Your Highness.

504
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,119
The men I sent will be in Youzhou soon.

505
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,000
Don't hurt her.

506
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,880
You treat Princess Yongning as your own daughter.

507
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,640
You've been teaching her carefully these years.

508
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,319
I witness that.

509
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
And I understand your kindness.

510
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,040
But Seal of Crown Prince is out of the ordinary.

511
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,479
Tang Dynasty's just been established.
All kinds of forces are covetous.

512
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,119
Princess Yongning is still young.

513
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,280
She's seen little of the world.

514
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,319
Can she really distinguish between the good and the evil

515
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,439
when surrounded by so many forces and deal with them properly?

516
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,800
If one day she is bewitched

517
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,520
and uses the seal to do something harmful to our country,

518
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,439
the consequences would be unimaginable.

519
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,800
Keming.

520
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,640
I'm tired.

521
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,880
You shall leave.

522
00:33:56,239 --> 00:34:01,520
You know the pros and cons clearly.

523
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:04,000
Things have never been perfect since ancient times.

524
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,680
Hope you can be decisive.

525
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,000
I shall leave.

526
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:25,879
A' Dou.

527
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,239
This time,

528
00:34:27,438 --> 00:34:28,999
I don't know whether I can come back smoothly.

529
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,199
If I haven't come back at dusk,

530
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,800
take the Seal with you

531
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,520
and ask A'Zhun to take you away.

532
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,159
That merchant?

533
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,520
Why?

534
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,919
I don't know.

535
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,280
I think he's trustworthy.

536
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,120
But...

537
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,120
It's my order.

538
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,719
Hope I won't run into you.

539
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,800
Any information from Chang'an?

540
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,600
Don't worry, Governor.

541
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:41,239
Anyway, I'll guarantee your safety.

542
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,199
Report!

543
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,360
Governor.

544
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,360
Someone is outside.

545
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,639
He said he's your old friend.

546
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,760
He wants to see you.

547
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:53,360
And he asked me to give it to you.

548
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
[Eastern Palace]

549
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,879
Governor.

550
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:15,280
Why are you frightened?

551
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,800
He's from Eastern Palace.

552
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,560
What?

553
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,159
As former subordinates of Prince,

554
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,159
this is your hospitality?

555
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,100
A coup happened in the Eastern Palace.

556
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,159
We've long been subordinated to the court.

557
00:36:58,399 --> 00:36:59,919
I won't allow you to act wildly here.

558
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:05,800
Since you're from Eastern Palace,
you'd better fold your hands for capture.

559
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,439
I'm here to see King of Lujiang.

560
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,439
You have no right to see him.

561
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,679
I'm here to give him a way to survive.

562
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,040
Let me listen first.

563
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,879
Youzhou is abandoned and in danger.

564
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:21,140
If he doesn't lead the troops to fight against the rebels,

565
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,800
will he await his doom?

566
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,360
Nonsense!

567
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,320
Wait!

568
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,719
Be careful.

569
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:39,080
He may be a spy of the court.

570
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,679
So my guess is right.

571
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,719
You're so nervous because you're preparing to rebel.

572
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,679
Right?

573
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,040
Since you find that,

574
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,040
I have to kill you.

575
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,120
Since you want to kill me,

576
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,239
Yongning will die with no pity,

577
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,679
Yongning?

578
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,360
You're Yongning?

579
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,840
Brother Shuyu.

580
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,180
You shall leave.

581
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:28,760
Yes.

582
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,239
We're in Youzhou.

583
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,439
I have an idea.

584
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,080
Shall I first take Princess to the inn

585
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,159
and then meet you in Governor Mansion?

586
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,280
You're the envoy from Chang'an.

587
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,239
It's unsuitable for me to do that.

588
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:49,479
But I'm afraid that you do that not for protecting her

589
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,080
but keeping away from me so that you can go to see that Princess.

590
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,679
Why do you frame me up with no evidence?

591
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,560
If I don't protect her,

592
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
will you?

593
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,360
It doesn't matter.

594
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,800
Since you offer to protect me,

595
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:20,360
you have to protect me at all times and don't go away any further.

596
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,159
Do you agree, Envoy Wei?

597
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:25,959
OK.

598
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,479
Since it's the order of Princess,

599
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,959
that's all.

600
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,000
By the way, write a letter to Chang'an

601
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,520
to tell his Highness where Princess is

602
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,919
so as not to make him worried.

603
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,320
At this time tomorrow,

604
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,360
we will meet at the east gate of the city.

605
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,600
Shut up.

606
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,439
Take away all these guards

607
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,719
for the sake of security.

608
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:47,840
People can easily find that they're in the army.

609
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,800
If I take them,

610
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,120
they'll be noticed.

611
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,199
Let me take you to the inn to have a rest.

612
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,040
But you have to ride the horse on your own.

613
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,479
I must play for time.

614
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,239
Considering your speed, you won't arrive at the inn till night.

615
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,280
I'm Princess.

616
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:45,879
You must listen to me.

617
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,639
OK.

618
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,560
Just hang around on your own.

619
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,159
Go!

620
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,639
Hao Du!

621
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,239
Why don't you wait for me?

622
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:08,959
Hold on!

623
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,120
Or if you tumble off, I won't take the responsibility,

624
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,399
Go!

625
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,320
Go!

626
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,320
God is fair.
[Governor Mansion]

627
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,120
You escaped this calamity.

628
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,660
It's a pity that I can't resist against the enemy

629
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,479
with Crown Prince in Chang'an.

630
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,000
Now I live on in degradation.

631
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,439
Yongning.

632
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,620
Since you can turn the bad into the good,

633
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,520
Prince can be comforted in Heaven.

634
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:39,840
Uncle.

635
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:43,199
Yongning is gone from now on.

636
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,840
Just call me Changge.

637
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,560
I'm very sorry.

638
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,199
Forget it, General Wang.

639
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:53,080
Stand up.

640
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,879
I heard that General Wang is alert and brave.

641
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,239
It turns out that he's a tiger-like general.

642
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,159
Yongning.

643
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,479
Don't be afraid.

644
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,639
Although Prince died,

645
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,719
I'll protect you.

646
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,919
Tomorrow, I'll ask men

647
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,000
- to take you to...
- Uncle.

648
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,439
I'm here not for shelter

649
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,399
but to help you.

650
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,080

651
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,390
