1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,910
♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,750
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,020
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,620
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,940
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,670
♫ I've never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,620
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,780
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,710
♫ To the distance. ♫

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,740
♫ The miserable past is like a dagger. ♫

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,460
♫ Though my wings are broken, ♫

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,830
♫  I will keep flying. ♫

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,070
♫ Following the light, ♫

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,190
♫ I'll forget you. ♫

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,670
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness. ♫

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,260
♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night, ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,220
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad. ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,220
♫ The river of life is under my feet. ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,750
♫ I don't regret my craziness. ♫

20
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:32,300
The Long Ballad

21
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:35,540
Episode 02

22
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,350
Father.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,350
That "lad" who reversed the game today. It was you, right?

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,300
I didn't mean to break into the stadium.

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,810
But we were on a losing streak at that time.

26
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:51,990
So...

27
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,960
that's why I had to...

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,940
Well done.

29
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,540
You've brought not only the treasured dagger

30
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:08,670
but also honor for me.

31
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:11,540
Your Grandfather heard it and requested my presence at once.

32
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:12,960
He praised you very highly

33
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:14,650
and gave a rick reward.

34
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,920
I've never thought that a girl

35
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:22,350
could do better than your brothers.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,700
Thanks for the praise.

37
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:26,470
Changge.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,300
Where's Ashile Tribe's treasured sword?

39
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:31,830
Send it to my room.

40
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:33,500
I want to appreciate it.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,070
I've already sent it to Second Uncle.

42
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:41,070
What?

43
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:45,010
How "good and dutiful" you are!

44
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,700
It's me who's raised you up

45
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:51,250
but how can you send the treasure to other people?

46
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,070
Second Uncle is also my family...

47
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,270
He's your family so what about me?

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,960
How dare you take his side?

49
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,320
Changge.

50
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,660
From now on,

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,390
I want you

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,230
to mention nothing about Family Qin.

53
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:07,430
Father.

54
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,610
You've misunderstood me.

55
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,740
- I...
- Please calm down.

56
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,070
Your Highness.

57
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:15,850
Mr. Wei.

58
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,100
[Wei Zheng]
Retinue Wei.

59
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:20,250
You finally come to see me.

60
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:21,560
Your Highness.

61
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:23,100
She's still young

62
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:26,620
so you need not flare up for it.

63
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:28,020
She's unfilial!

64
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,430
She only cares about Prince Qin!

65
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,670
I don't think she'll concern me!

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,810
Your Highness.

67
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:35,990
Wei Zheng!

68
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:37,460
Don't waste time!

69
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,760
Come with me!

70
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:40,300
Yes.

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,700
Leave here.

72
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:47,430
Go to Mansion of Prince Qi and ask Yuanji to come here at once!

73
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:48,470
Yes.

74
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,460
- Mother.
- Halt there!

75
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:15,350
You don't take my advice anymore, right?

76
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,630
Then what did I tell you yesterday?

77
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,430
I just...

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,060
You just went over the wall and dressed up as a player

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,910
to be in the limelight in front of the Ashile, right?

80
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:28,870
Mother...

81
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,160
I won the game.

82
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:32,270
Father said that

83
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:34,260
Grandfather praised me a lot.

84
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,750
You've never slapped me before...

85
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,990
You've been wild since your childhood,

86
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,340
always making trouble.

87
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,030
I'm to blame for not lecturing you well.

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,590
You've been spoiled by me.

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,500
How dare you fight for the limelight against men?

90
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:09,220
Why mention it?

91
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,100
Men and women should be equal.

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,030
Why do you always think

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,150
I'm not as good as a man?

94
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:16,870
I'm able-bodied.

95
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,210
I have skills.

96
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:19,710
I can go wherever I want!

97
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,990
You can go nowhere!

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,820
Mother.

99
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:26,810
Follow me.

100
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,140
Kneel down.

101
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,610
Mother.

102
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:37,270
Kneel!

103
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,820
Take an oath here.

104
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,500
From now on,

105
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,500
no matter what happens

106
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,100
and what you go through,

107
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:55,780
you must live with no hates forever.

108
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,210
Mother...

109
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,100
I've never hated anyone.

110
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,710
I need your pledge.

111
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,220
Okay.

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,660
I swear.

113
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,210
But if someone harms you,

114
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:09,590
I shall certainly hate the guy.

115
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,390
No one will harm me.

116
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:24,630
I only hope

117
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,750
that you can be happy and unfettered forever.

118
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,430
Stay away from disputes and mishap.

119
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,310
As long as my mother stays with me,

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,470
I'm the happiest girl in the world.

121
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:46,060
Do not forget what you've sworn here.

122
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:48,120
Okay.

123
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,500
I'll keep it in mind.

124
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,870
Fine.

125
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,210
Go back and pack.

126
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:55,260
You'll be sent to Biyong Hall tomorrow.

127
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,500
Read and repent there for 10 days.

128
00:06:58,088 --> 00:06:59,500
You must never escape again.

129
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:00,960
Mother.

130
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,910
It's my decision.

131
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:04,660
Nobody can change it.

132
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,410
Mother...

133
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:16,960
Report to Tegin.

134
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:19,740
Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin balance in power but are discordant.

135
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:21,820
We don't know who will be the heir.

136
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,120
Li Yuanji will soon lead troops to Wucheng.

137
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:27,630
We know nothing about his power and plan.

138
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,940
What has he done recently?

139
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,780
Nothing special. He's been visiting Li Jiancheng every night.

140
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,260
It's said they're close.

141
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,340
He did nothing unusual.

142
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,060
Nothing unusual?

143
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:44,500
Conceal your whereabouts and spy on them.

144
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,900
Report to me about all the details,

145
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:52,590
including the things not unsual.

146
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,500
Yes.

147
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,430
[Li Chunfeng]

148
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,660
Abnormal astrology.

149
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,630
A new monarch.

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,150
The world will be changed.

151
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:24,050
Get the cart.

152
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:26,340
I'm to the Palace.

153
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:27,560
Yes.

154
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,050
[Eastern Palace]

155
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:48,500
Princess!

156
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:54,740
Princess.

157
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,010
Madam made you some pastries.

158
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:58,850
All your favorites.

159
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,320
And also,

160
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,630
she made you some clothes.

161
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,700
I'm out for a few days and I'll be back soon.

162
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,310
Why did she...

163
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,660
She stayed up all night.

164
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,950
She's worried about you.

165
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:16,870
But why doesn't she come to see me off?

166
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,010
She's...

167
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,310
tired.

168
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,270
By the way,

169
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:24,850
Leyan doesn't know that I'll leave.

170
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:27,140
Don't forget to tell her to wait for me.

171
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:28,920
You can be at ease.

172
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,030
You've been friends since childhood

173
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,390
so she won't get angry with you.

174
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,610
Well...

175
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,320
It's time for me to leave.

176
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,610
Take care of yourself

177
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:44,900
and my mother.

178
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:46,070
Wait for me!

179
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:49,810
Here you are.

180
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:52,760
Hold it.

181
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:56,190
Mother!

182
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:03,700
Mother.

183
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,340
You ask me to leave but also hate to part with me.

184
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,340
Changge.

185
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,950
Biyong Hall is different from here.

186
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,220
The servants there are not that meticulous

187
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,870
so can you take special care of yourself?

188
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,270
When meals don't agree well with you,

189
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:27,020

00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:48,740
Stop!

382
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,320
Stop running!

383
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,670
Freeze there!

384
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:52,720
Halt!

385
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:54,810
Stop!

386
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:57,720
Stay there!

387
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:59,030
Where can you escape?

388
00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:05,850
Release!

Call the scouts together

393
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:19,270
and ask them to spread it in nearby armies,

394
00:26:19,488 --> 00:26:22,270
especially those which will soon go north to attack Wucheng.

395
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,670
Crown Prince and Prince Qin died.

396
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,150
Execute all their soldiers.

397
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:30,900
Soldiers in the army

398
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:32,550
are mainly their former soldiers.

399
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,500
As it's spread,

400
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,790
trouble may arise.

401
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,390
Then,

402
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,100
Khan could be at ease.

403
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,010
I'll do it at once.

404
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:43,190
Leave.

405
00:26:56,444 --> 00:26:57,740
Lady!

406
00:26:58,311 --> 00:27:00,960
Lady! Mutinous soldiers have been suppressed.

407
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:02,560
We're now safe.

408
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,940
Why are there mutinous soldiers?

409
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,610
What about Eastern Palace?

410
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:08,990
What's happened?

411
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:11,270
Something wrong with Changge?

412
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,190
Trouble arises.

413
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,700
But Prince Qin has suppressed it.

414
00:27:14,777 --> 00:27:16,270
Crown Prince and Prince Qi

415
00:27:16,911 --> 00:27:18,300
have been executed.

416
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:23,300
What are you saying?

417
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,630
What about Changge?

418
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,250
Princess Yongning escaped from chasing.

419
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:29,940
She's now missing.

420
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,790
How come...

421
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,470
She told me to wait for her here.

422
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,340
I won't believe it.

423
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,820
It's so weird. I want to see Father.

424
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,960
Lady.

425
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,520
I'm afraid he has no time.

427
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,920
- Mr. Wei.
- How's going?

428
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,420
I asked the guards of Prince Qin

429
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,910
about Princess as ordered.

430
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,940
Princess escaped from chasing temporarily

431
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,910
but she's missing.

432
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:00,300
She's clever.

433
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,340
As she's escaped, she might be safe now.

434
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:03,850
Well... I'm afraid...

435
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,670
she won't give up revenge.

436
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:07,470
Keep watching on it.

437
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,550

438
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:10,790
Yes.

Set out at once.

00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:14,990

442
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:17,990
Fine, I'm leaving.

443
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,990

444
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:25,550

445
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:28,300

450
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,700
Are there mice in the building recently?

451
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:18,050
Thanks for saving my life.

452
00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:19,470
That's very kind of you.

453
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:21,140
I wasn't to save you.

454
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,590
I was afraid I would be implicated.

456
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:26,430
Do you hide here because you're homeless?

457
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,990
You can sleep on my treasured bed.

It's soft and aromatic, thick and spacious. No one disturbs you!

459
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:50,060
Is it the soft, aromatic and treasured bed?

460
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,420
You can have a try.

461
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,870

462
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,610

Where did you learn your skills?

476
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:24,390
Why did you learn it? To help the weak

477
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,060
or dominate the world?

478
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:28,150

00:32:32,755 --> 00:32:35,510
Sir. I have only one last question. Trust me!

481
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,990
As you're homeless,

482
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,910
I think you may have no money.

00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,410

484
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,550
As you're good at skills,

485
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:47,300
shall we go to steal the funeral objects of Lady of Eastern Palace?

486
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:51,150
There must be countless treasures.

487
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:53,060
Whose funeral objects?

488
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,300
It's hearsay.

What's the matter with you?

497
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,520
I heard Prince Qin was rewarding his soldiers.

- I don't know.

514
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,350
I'm on duty to deliver. Nothing addressed.

515

♫ Sorrow and happiness wane and wax like a flash. ♫

569
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:19,610
[Crown Prince and Prince Qin died. Execute all their soldiers.]

570
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,050
Now the rumor has spread.

571
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:29,590
I'm afraid it's useless for Your Highness to swear

572
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:33,030
or ask His Majesty's help.

573
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:37,110
What a malicious rumor!

574
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,180
Someone must want to stir up troubles,

575
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,070
causing the friction between you

576
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,010
and the generals of Li Yuanji and Li Jiancheng.

577
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:47,550
You should make a decision as soon as possible.

578
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,470
Your Highness.

579
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,550
The suburban army is the main force to support Wucheng.

580
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,230
We can't move it so easily.

581
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,920
What about inviting the general to come

582
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:59,100
in the name of awarding?

583
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:00,960
Separate soldiers and their generals

584
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:02,810
and then handle them.

585
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:04,790
If they're to be malicious,

586
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,320
how could they come?

587
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,650
If they refuse,

588
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,320
it shows their wild ambitions.

589
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:14,140
It will only alarm them and trigger a war.

590
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:16,650
I think you'd better solve it at once,

591
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:18,190
strictly and rapidly.

592
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,610
I don't agree.

593
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:22,070
I think you'd better part and rope them in,

594
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,790
slowly and gently.

595
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,720
Let's wait and see.

596
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:31,920
Your Highness!

597
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:34,550
That will do for the present.

598
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:42,120
- Commander Hao!
- Commander Hao!

599
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,900
Someone poisoned us.

600
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,140
Please forgive us.

601
00:41:46,444 --> 00:41:47,630
Who did it?

602
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,740
A common man.

603
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:52,230
He's clean-cut and brought us pastries from Pinxiang Store.

604
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,030
We didn't eat it until he finished eating safely...

605
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,120
Please forgive us!

606
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:02,670
Anything else?

607
00:42:03,177 --> 00:42:04,390
No... nothing...

608
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,350
We fainted after having it.

609
00:42:08,688 --> 00:42:09,960
Commander Hao.

610
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:13,140
We've examined the sacrificial tablet and tributes
of Lady of Eastern Palace.

611
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,340
Nothing is missing.

612
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,100
Father.

613
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,510
Sorry for letting Father be startled

614
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,790
by the poisoning case.

615
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:28,700
It's not a normal case.

616
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,140
It's happened around Lady of Eastern Palace.

617
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:35,740
Father, here you are.

618
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:38,220
They're poisoned to faint after eating these.

619
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:39,810
Besides,

620
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:41,550
nothing was stolen.

621
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:47,270
The guy dares to poison the emperor's soldiers

622
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,030
but steals nothing.

623
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:51,380
It seems to be our old friend.

624
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,890
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

625
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,200
♫ gradually revives, ♫

626
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,480

628
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,370

630
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,280
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

631

632
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,890
