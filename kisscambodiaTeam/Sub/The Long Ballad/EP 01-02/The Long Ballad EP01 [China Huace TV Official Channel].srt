♫ Nowhere to escape. ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,760
♫ No bough to alight. ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,039
♫ Retrograde with smile. ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,639
♫ Never give in. ♫

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,959
♫ Forget about the youth. ♫

6
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,680
♫ I’ve never been afraid of loneliness. ♫

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,639
♫ I also shed the tears of regret. ♫

8
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,798

00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,720

The Long Ballad

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Episode 1

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,180
[The Long Ballad]

23
00:01:59,319 --> 00:01:59,879
Go!

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,000
Go!

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,759
Li Changge,

26
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,240
you can't get away.

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,720
Just surrender,

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,960
follow us back to Changan and confess your sins.

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,679
Changan is indeed a lively city.

30
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,440
It's so much more fun here than our grasslands.

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,119
What you see is not necessarily the truth.

32
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,759
The prosperity for now may not last long.

33
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,480
How much is it?

34
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,600
Sir, it's 3 wen.

35
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,760
Come on!

36
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,839
Come on!

37
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:43,920
Get out of the way!

38
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:46,920
Come on!

39
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,040
Out of the way!

40
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:50,959
Look out.

41
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,040
Are you blind?

42
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,200
This is what you officers do?

43
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,559
Bullying around?

44
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,160
How dare you.

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,760
Are you seeking death?

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
Don't stir up trouble.

47
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,079
Let's go.

48
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Is that how the guard in Mansion of Crown Prince behave?

49
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,880
I'm the guard there.

50
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Prin...

51
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:51,440
Sir,

52
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,239
I... I didn't know any better.

53
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,799
Please, sir, have mercy on me.

54
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,160
Get lost.

55
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,119
Yes.

56
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,200
Let's go.

57
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,359
Go!

58
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,160
Go!

59
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,399
Are you okay?

60
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,959
You've got some nerve.

61
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,559
I can't believe you'd confront Crown Prince's men.

62
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,679
But given that he stirred up trouble first,

63
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,119
I'll let you go.

64
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,440
Next time,

65
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
you won't be so lucky.

66
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,600
Go!

67
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,040
If it wasn't for that boy,

68
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,679
I'd definitely kick their ass hard.

69
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,880
Don't forget why we come to Changan.

70
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,279
Do not spoil the ship for a half pennyworth of tar.

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,559
Yes.

72
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,640
Mom.

73
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,519
Changge.

74
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,839
Mom,

75
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,839
why are you losing so much hair?

76
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,839
Are you not feeling well lately?

77
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm fine.

78
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,959
I'm just getting old.

79
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,679
Everyone gets old.

80
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,440
You're not getting old.

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,359
You'll never get old.

82
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,640
You'll never be sick.

83
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,359
And you'll stay fabulous forever

84
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
just like now.

85
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
You're so sweet.

86
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,679
Did you sneak out again today?

87
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,559
Yes, I did sneak out.

88
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,959
But Mom, don't worry.

89
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,079
I didn't cause any trouble.

90
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,799
Changge,

91
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,559
there's something I want to tell you.

92
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,079
What is it, Mom?

93
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,239
Why are you so serious?

94
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,320
Changge,

95
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,000
you're always running wild

96
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,760
and I've never been strict with you.

97
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,840
But this time, you must promise me

98
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,000
that you'll stay right in the mansion tomorrow.

99
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,799
Don't come out no matter who sends for you.

100
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,239
Why?

101
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,719
I heard that

102
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,479
Ashile Tribe sent out messengers

103
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,799
without being invited.

104
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,159
They've arrived in Changan.

105
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,640
They came from the grasslands?

106
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,799
Why are they coming to Changan?

107
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,200
In name, they're just messengers.

108
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,200
But they requested for a Cuju game

109
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,359
the instant they arrived.

110
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,840
Everybody knows it's just an excuse.

111
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,799
A Cuju game?

112
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
It'll be so much fun.

113
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Changge,

114
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,039
when your grandpa just started the war,

115
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,119
he made a marriage contract with Ashile Tribe.

116
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,159
It was a stopgap back then.

117
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,119
But now, Wucheng is at war.

118
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
And there's only a few girls

119
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,799
of the right age in the palace.

120
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm worried that

121
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,960
they'll bring it up this time.

122
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,400
Mom,

123
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,440
that was a long time ago.

124
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,000
I doubt they still remember that.

125
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,520
You're thinking too much.

126
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,440
Changge,

127
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,760
you're too young.

128
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,640
Some things are better left unsaid.

129
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,679
I want nothing

130
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,960
but your safety and happiness.

131
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,440
That you'll live carefreely in Changan, warm and fed.

132
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,200
Lady Jin,

133
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,919
you were looking for His Highness.

134
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
He's back now.

135
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,159
Mom,

136
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,479
you're going to see my father?

137
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,200
He just came back.

138
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,359
I suppose he has no time for me.

139
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,919
I'll go later.

140
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,320
Changge,

141
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,719
go back and stay in your room.

142
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,119
Don't upset your father again.

143
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,640
San Niang,

144
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,960
doesn't she always hate to see my father?

145
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,280
Why would she want to see him now?

146
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,599
It appears that

147
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,119
Shimin is waging a war against me.

148
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,760
Brother,

149
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,719
that's the last straw.

150
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,119
We need to handle it immediately.

151
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,640
Let's not talk about it here. Go to my study.

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,679
Chang He.

153
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:50,799
Yes.

154
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,559
Keep an eye on Hongyi Palace.
[Li Jiancheng]

155
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,260
And tell me everything
[Li Jiancheng]

156
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,320
that goes on around Prince Qin.

157
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,960
Yes.

158
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:24,640
Brother,

159
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,960
we can't afford to wait around.

160
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,880
Li Shimin...

161
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,119
Jin.

162
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,320
Why are you here?

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,599
I thought you hate this place.

164
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,520
Your Highness,

165
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,640
I heard that Ashle Tribe has sent out messengers

166
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,640
to Changan without invitation.

167
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,200
If tomorrow they bring up that marriage contract...

168
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,919
It was His Majesty's decision.

169
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,080
It's not up to me.

170
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,799
And it's not for you

171
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,119
to worry about what happened in court.

172
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,719
Yes.

173
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,159
This is the dessert I made for you, Your Highness.

174
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:38,479
Is there anything else you want to say?

175
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,440
Nothing.

176
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,559
Alright. If so,

177
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,359
maybe you should keep away from this place.

178
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,440
Yes.

179
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
[Hongyi Palace]

180
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,520
Leyan,

181
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,239
You're so timid.

182
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,799
I can't believe you'd still fall for this trick.

183
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,520
What will you do when I'm not by your side later?

184
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,799
Changge,

185
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,840
stop messing with me.

186
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,919
Come on.

187
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,479
I'll take you to your Mr. Right.

188
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't have "Mr. Right".

189
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,400
I heard that Wei Shuyu'd show up

190
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,880
in the Cuju game at the stadium.

191
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,400
Don't you want to see him?

192
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,960
Brother Shuyu...

193
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,479
Why would I want to see him?

194
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,599
Since he saved your from drowning years ago,

195
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,280
you'd flush every time you see him.

196
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,119
Leyan.

197
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,119
Leyan.

198
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,239
Are you okay?

199
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,159
You think I'm blind?

200
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,239
Oh,

201
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,599
this is for you.

202
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,719
It's so ugly.

203
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,719
What is it?

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
I even pierced my hand

205
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:45,119
just so I could make this.

206
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:45,840
Now you tell me it's ugly?

207
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:46,599
Forget about it.

208
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,559
Ugly it is,

209
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,799
I like it.

210
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,640
Let me see.

211
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,719
Where's your wound?

212
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,559
I'm fine now.

213
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,479
Let's hurry there before the game ends.

214
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:55,960
Oh,

215
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,760
I got something for you, too.

216
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,840
This is the amulet

217
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,960
I got from the temple.

218
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,679
One is for you,

219
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,200
and another one...

220
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,320
Another one...

221
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,039
is for Brother Shuyu.

222
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,000
You got this yourself.

223
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,840
You should deliver it in person.

224
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,159
I...

225
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,919
Come on, wear this.

226
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,960
What for?

227
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:20,760
So that no one can recognize you.

228
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,919
I need to protect you.

229
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,119
What about you?

230
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,640
Come on, I fear no one.

231
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,799
Let's go.

232
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,599
Please,

233
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm begging you.

234
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,760
Please, don't kill me.

235
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't kill me!

236
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,840
I didn't sell Prince Qin out.

237
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,400
It wasn't me who let out the secret.

238
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,440
Please,

239
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,479
please, let me go.

240
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,400
Please don't kill me.

241
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,840
Don't kill me.

242
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,320
Please!

243
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Don't! Don't kill me!

244
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,239
I didn't sell Prince Qin out!

245
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,200
It wasn't me!

246
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,119
Please don't kill me!

247
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,520
Don't kill me! Please!

248
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,440
No!

249
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:22,040
Let's go.

250
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,119
Leyan.

251
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,040
Hao Du is definitely not a nice guy.

252
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,079
Stay away from him.

253
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:38,959
Don't approach him.

254
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:41,760
Brother Shuyu once told me that

255
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,000
he's a cold-blooded person.

256
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,439
Forget about it.

257
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's go to cheer for Shuyu now.

258
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,520
Let's go.

259
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,800
Nice!

260
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,640
Great!

261
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,920
Nice! Nice!

262
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,199
Nice! Nice!

263
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,280
Great!

264
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,079
Nice!

265
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,280
Nice!

266
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,920
Nice!

267
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,760
Come on.

268
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,280
What a large venue.

269
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,199
Nice!

270
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,160
Great!

271
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,239
Nice!

272
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,359
Thank you.

273
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,280
Go!

274
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,680
Hurry up!

275
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,239
My amulet!

276
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,400
My amulet's gone!

277
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,800
I must've lost it on the way here.

278
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,280
Give this one to him.

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,599
No.

280
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,920
This one is for you.

281
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,400
You see me practically every day.

282
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,359
Next time you go to the temple,

283
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,680
you can give me another one.

284
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:24,640
Take it.

285
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,439
But after today,

286
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,079
you don't know

287
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,040
when you'll meet him again.

288
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
Nice!

289
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,079
Look.

290
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,479
What a pity!

291
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,839
16 points for Ashle Team.

292
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:15,800
Nice!

293
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,599
Changge,

294
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,680
it seems that

295
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,040
we're losing.

296
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,760
We mustn't lose this game.

297
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:25,920
If we lose,

298
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,560
it'd affect the morale in our forces.

299
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,040
Nice!

300
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,319
Nice!

301
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,560
Nice!

302
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,079
Nice!

303
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,040
Nice!

304
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:11,760
Nice!

305
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,719
Team Tang scores 14 points.

306
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,680
Team Ashile scores 16 points.

307
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,400
Nice! Nice!

308
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,160
Yaro!

309
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,719
Hang on, hang on there.

310
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,520
Changge!

311
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:41,800
Hold on.

312
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Your Highness,

313
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,319
don't you underestimate this dagger.

314
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,640
It can cut clear through copper, iron,

315
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,119
gold and jade.

316
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
It can kill people without a sound.

317
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Do you want to try it out yourself?

318
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,280
You're so humorous.

319
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,199
To me, Cuju is just like a war.

320
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,400
What matters is one's courage, strength,

321
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,160
and weapons.

322
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,040
Your players seem a spent force to me.

323
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,520
The game is set.

324
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,239
There's nothing to see.

325
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,959
[Li Shimin]

326
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,880
The result is still an open question.
[Li Shimin]

327
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:51,319
And you're talking so wildly in front of everyone.

328
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,520
Aren't you afraid that

329
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,640
you'll be proven wrong later?

330
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,439
You!

331
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,880
He's always so arrogant and wilful.

332
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,599
He shouldn't have said that.

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,079
Please don't take it personally.

334
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,199
Since it's so sharp,

335
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:13,079
why don't we make it a bonus

336
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,719
and award it to the best warrior?

337
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,839
I've heard a lot about Prince Qin's lofty goals and open mind.

338
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,599
Now that I finally see him,

339
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,640
I suppose all he has is a glib tongue.

340
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,560
You're the sensible one, Your Highness.

341
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,040
Both His Majesty and Your Highness want to

342
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,880
forster cordial relations between our two nations.

343
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,920
Back at that time, His Majesty
made a marriage contract with Ashle Tribe.

344
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,239
How about we take this opportunity

345
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,239
and settle it down?

346
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,640
What?

347
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,920
Whose daughter is that girl?

348
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:15,239
Sir,

349
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,959
you're seriously wounded.

350
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,439
You need time to recover.

351
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,119
Sir, you mustn't...

352
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,239
This game is about the honor of Tang Dynasty.

353
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,719
How can I funk it?

354
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,760
If you go back to the game, it might turn chronic.

355
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,479
Sir...

356
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,599
Doctor,

357
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,959
I'm well-built since my childhood.

358
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:31,599
I'll be fine.

359
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,319
Brother Shuyu.

360
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,599
Why are you here?

361
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,400
Does it hurt?

362
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,719
Lady.

363
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,520
It's just a minor injury. No need to worry.

364
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,880
See? I'm fine now.

365
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,239
This is an amulet for you.

366
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,439
If I had given it to you earlier,

367
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,560
you wouldn't get hurt.

368
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,280
Thanks.

369
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,400
Wh... Where's my suit?

370
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,119
I can't believe there'd still be a player

371
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,479
who'd volunteer to seek his doom.

372
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,959
No matter who you are,

373
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,119
we'll kick your ass.

374
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,000
Just ignore them.

375
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,880
You two, remember...

376
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,680
All I want is...

377
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,280
Victory!

378
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,280
Yes!

379
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,640
Array of echelon.

380
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,040
Interesting.

381
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,640
Nice!

382
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Great!

383
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,800
Nice!

384
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:17,640
Nice!

385
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,199
Nice one!

386
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,400
Great!

387
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,079
Nice!

388
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:22,920
Great!

389
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,839
Nice!

390
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,359
Great!

391
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,000
Nice!

392
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,880
Nice!

393
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,920
Nice!

394
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:06,079
Nice! Nice!

395
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:06,839
Nice!

396
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:07,640
Nice one!

397
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,479
Great!

398
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,400
Nice!

399
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,920
Nice!

400
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,280
Nice! Nice!

401
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,520
Nice!

402
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Nice!

403
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,560
Great!

404
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,920
Nice!

405
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:33,520
Team Tang scores 17 points.

406
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,839
Team Ashile scores 17 points.

407
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,439
Your dress looks so nice.

408
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,160
Yeah, it took me a long time to get it.

409
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,359
There, there.

410
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,040
Nice!

411
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,199
Nice!

412
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,959
Nice!

413
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,680
Great!

414
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,160
We won!

415
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,359
Nice! Nice!

416
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:16,880
Nice!

417
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,719
Game over.

418
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,400
Team Tang scores 18 points.

419
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,839
Team Ashile scores 17 points.

420
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,280
Team Tang wins!

421
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,280
We won! We won!

422
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,640
He is...

423
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,920
She's Changge, of course.

424
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,079
Who else could mess with those Ashle guys?

425
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:53,119
Lady.

426
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,800
Prince Qin ordered me to

427
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,439
escort you back to the Mansion.

428
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,520
How could Father know I'm here?

429
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:01,920
Father...

430
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,079
I'm just following the order.

431
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,359
Leyan,

432
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,319
there must be something important.

433
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,239
Just go back.

434
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,040
I'll explain it to Changge.

435
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:16,959
I...

436
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,439
Don't worry.

437
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,560
You're the Lady.

438
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,719
Nice work.

439
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,680
Great! Nice job!

440
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,079
You won.

441
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,599
This dagger is yours now.

442
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:01,079
Give it to that lad.

443
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:01,680
Yes.

444
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,839
Nice!

445
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:04,640
You've worked hard.

446
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,319
Hold on.

447
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,800
You talked about that marriage contract.

448
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:14,000
We should give this matter further thought.

449
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,040
That girl you've just seen

450
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,239
is indeed a royal lady of our empire.

451
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,879
Would you mind coming to my palace

452
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,280
so that we can discuss it in detail?

453
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,879
Your sincerity really strucks me.

454
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,120
It'd be impolite for me to decline.

455
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:07,840
Nice, great.

456
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,560
You too.

457
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:09,439
Good job.

458
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:34,399
What you did back there is heroic.

459
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,800
The Cuju ball is so heavy.

460
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,000
If it really hit that kid,

461
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,280
the consequences would be unimaginable.

462
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,159
Come on.

463
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,360
As the old saying goes,

464
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,760
"It is a glorious failure."

465
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,840
You can't understand Chinese, right?

466
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,560
I can.

467
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,159
He's so mean.

468
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,120
The boy who made that kick.

469
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,639
Me?

470
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,040
Yes, come here.

471
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:08,479
What?

472
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,399
As per His Highness's order,

473
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,080
this dagger presented by Ashle Tribe

474
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,040
will be awarded to...

475
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,320
How could you still keep your mask on?

476
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,439
Just state your name.

477
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,520
Shixin Sili is here for Tegin Sun.

478
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,719
Tegin Sun, why would you get interested

479
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:14,120
and take part in the game personally today?

480
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,639
I wanted to test their ability.

481
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,040
And how are they?

482
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
If it was a real war,

483
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,199
they'd be annihilated completely.

484
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,040
But that lad who entered at the last minute seemed smart.

485
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,959
I wonder who he is.

486
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,239
He's from the Eastern Palace.

487
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:30,399
His ranking must be higher than eighth.

488
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,040
Tegin Sun, you're omniscient.

489
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,399
Speaking of which,

490
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,199
I brought up the marriage contract today

491
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,360
and Li Jiancheng really took the bait.

492
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,360
But shall we give Great Khan a notice in advance?

493
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,439
No need.

494
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,000
They're so eager to sue for peace.

495
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,280
I suppose their forces must be weak.

496
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,199
Great Khan has nothing to worry about.

497
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,199
Our convoy was expected to leave Changan tomorrow.

498
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,800
Shall we change the schedule?

499
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:56,959
No.

500
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,239
Leave as scheduled.

501
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,560
Leave as scheduled...

502
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,520
Second Uncle!

503
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:23,639
It hurts, Second Uncle!

504
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,399
Let me go!

505
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,959
Troublemaker.

506
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,239
Isn't the public dazzle you get today enough for you?

507
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:33,199
Why are you here?

508
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,120
Uncle,

509
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,120
I'm here today

510
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,719
because I got you a gift.

511
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,639
Gift?

512
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,600
Show me, then.

513
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,000
You've just won it.

514
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,959
Why are you giving it to me?

515
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,840
Since I was seven,

516
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,800
I started horse riding and swordplay with you.

517
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,479
You taught me martial arts and warcraft.

518
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,479
That's why I could pitch into the Cuju game.

519
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,639
I can never repay your kindness.

520
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,120
I won this dagger myself.

521
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,800
Of course I should give it to you, Uncle.

522
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,159
Yongning, you've grown up.

523
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,560
Today you managed to apply warcraft to Cuju

524
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:14,040
and set the formation for players.

525
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,199
Good job.

526
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,600
Nice dagger.

527
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,399
It's this dress.

528
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,879
If it wasn't for this suit,

529
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,199
I'd definitely win over you, Uncle.

530
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,040
You're wrong.

531
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,840
That loophole was the bait I left.

532
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,120
You were too eager to win.

533
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,639
That's why you'd fall into my trap.

534
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:59,080
But you're more powerful than me.

535
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,439
If I don't take the opportunity

536
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,120
and make a surprise attack,

537
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,520
how am I gonna win?

538
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,439
The strong attack while the weak defend.

539
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,919
If you aren't strong enough,

540
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,679
all you can do is to draw in your claws

541
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,639
and bide your time before you gain the strength

542
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,320
and can finally launch the attack instead.

543
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,040
Sounds depressing.

544
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,760
This is the price the weak ones must pay.

545
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,000
It's not easy but you must struggle through it.

546
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,800
It's the only way to survive.

547
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:19,959
Lie low and work hard.

548
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:22,239
Whatever you're fighting for, someone or the world,

549
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,560
it's always the case.

550
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:26,120
Changge,

551
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:27,280
remember this.

552
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,280
Okay.

553
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,560
I'll keep it in mind, Uncle.

554
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,159
Alright.

555
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,080
You should go home now.

556
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,000
I have business to attend to.

557
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,360
Okay.

558
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,399
Then I'll come to visit you next time.

559
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:44,320
Changge,

560
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,679
send my regards to your mom.

561
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,040
Got it.

562
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,940
[Du Ruhui]

563
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:17,000
Your Highness,

564
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,560
I'm sorry I'm late.

565
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,280
I got so many eyes on me lately.

566
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,120
Changge.

567
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,399
Father.

568
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:47,439
That "lad" who reversed the game today.

569
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,399
It was you, right?

570
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,280
I didn't mean to break into the stadium.

571
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
But we were on a losing streak at that time.

572
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,040
So,

573
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,159
I had to...

574
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,080
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

575
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,399
♫ gradually revives, ♫

576
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,679
♫ gradually swims towards you. ♫

577
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,239
♫ Before bidding farewell, ♫

578
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,560
♫ we expect an encounter. ♫

579
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:40,719
♫ Entwist your figure, ♫

580
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,479
♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫

581
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,479
♫ Before the daybreak, ♫

582
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:51,080
♫ through the obsession of love, ♫

583
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,159
♫ the longing flows. ♫

584
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,360
♫ There’s always a moment ♫

585
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,959
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

586
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,719
♫ There’s always solicitude ♫

587
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:14,479
♫ which frozes everything between you and me. ♫

588
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,840
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

589
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:19,198
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

590
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,679
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

591
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,120
♫ layer after layer. ♫

592
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,479
♫ it turns into eternity. ♫

593
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,439
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

594
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,600
♫ There’s always a moment ♫

595
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,159
♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫

596
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:51,760
♫ There’s always solicitude ♫

597
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:58,398
♫ which frozes everything between you and me. ♫

598
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:00,958
♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫

599
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:03,319
♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫

600
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,799
♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫

601
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,520
♫ layer after layer. ♫

602
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:12,678
♫ it turns into eternity. ♫

603
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:19,080
♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫

604
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,250
♫ It is sleepless. ♫

605
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:41,380
The Long Ballad
