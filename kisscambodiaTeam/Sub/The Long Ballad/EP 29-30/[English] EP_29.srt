The Long Ballad

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,760
Episode 29

22
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:50,865
Well.

23
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:53,776
He's really strong.

24
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:56,021
Come on, buddies!

25
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:57,154
We have nearly defeated him!

26
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:58,354
Bet is a bet.

27
00:01:58,355 --> 00:01:59,590
You win.

28
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,930
You're more powerful than I thought.

29
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,832
You're now the winner.

30
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,410
You don't need to taunt us.

31
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:28,365
If we had been powerful,

32
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:31,360
why would our governor have sacrificed himself?

33
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,899
Gongsun Heng is a hero.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,110
You know nothing!

35
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,210
I just... I just envy him

36
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:55,432
having bros like you to fight for him.

37
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,600
His sacrifice is worthwhile.

38
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:14,943
Why are you laughing?

39
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,579
At that time,

40
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,832
I was drinking with Changge like this.

41
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,276
We later became brothers.

42
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:21,787
Brothers?

43
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:24,854
How can you be her brother?

44
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:26,040
Can't I?

45
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,921
You're really an interesting guy.

46
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:33,490
Come on. Let's drink!

47
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,040
Don't you drink?

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,210
Ask someone to clean up here

49
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,200
otherwise we might be driven away.

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,721
Cheers!

51
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:02,970
Come on!

52
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,599
Just set it here.

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay.

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
Come with me.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,919
Your Highness.

56
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,476
Mr. Wei, you're here.

57
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:50,521
See.

58
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:51,869
It's grand here.

59
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,076
When I saw the palace,

60
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:55,519
I knew that as long as it was lightened,

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,139
even the palaces in Changan would be overshadowed.

62
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,379
Your Highness, the curfew is in force

63
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,432
so how could you do such an absurd thing?

64
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,676
Oh, yes.

65
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:06,009
There's a curfew here.

66
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,089
So there's no high buildings with lights along this road, right?

67
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,276
Your Highness.

68
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,209
It's the routine.

69
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,150
Please do not let others get the goods on you.

70
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,632
If you keep it secret, who else knows it?

71
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:21,730
Can Father monitor me far from here?

72
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,339
Have you thought

73
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,321
how many people could notice the brilliant lights here?

74
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:29,049
Could they all keep it secret?

75
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,765
Do you want to be impeached by the officials?

76
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,299
It's enough!

77
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,965
As long as you can keep it secret,

78
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:36,450
nobody else will care about it!

79
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,369
Curfew...

80
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,019
The rest of Luoyang is all under curfew.

81
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,938
By the way, what I've done

82
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,730
is all to pray for the refugees.

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,919
<i>[The Grandest]</i>

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,920
From now on, Ziwei Palace will be out of the darkness.

85
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,620
Your Highness...

86
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:09,020
<i>[Luoyang Office]</i>

87
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:15,379
Princess, what about telling Mr. Hao first?

88
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,099
If he finds out I let you leave alone,

89
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,339
he might kill me.

90
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,410
He looks scary but he won't hurt you.

91
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:24,499
What are you afraid of?

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,610
Just tell him I've gone to South Hill

93
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,721
and he won't press about it.

94
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,209
I'll make an early return.

95
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,820
- Princess!
- Do what I've told you.

96
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,550
Are you going to South Hill again?

97
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,069
Mr. Hao.

98
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,165
She hopes you can accompany her to streets and markets.

99
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,829
Though she's been in Luoyang for long,

100
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,010
she has no time to wander around here

101
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,930
for worrying about the crown prince.

102
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,489
Weren't you going to walk around?

103
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,640
Let's go.

104
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,254
Is he an old hand at flattering kids?

105
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:39,890
Yuan really likes him.

106
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,459
We fail to get Young Master's news as we're in Luoyang.

107
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,499
Mr. Qin might be sad about it.

108
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,499
Though Yuan is a kid, she's sensible.

109
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,810
We're not sure about whether

110
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:55,570
Mr. Qin plays with her or Yuan makes him happy?

111
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,854
Miser.

112
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,743
Whom are you calling?

113
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,232
You're envying him.

114
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,489
I'm not.

115
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,060
Need another fight.

116
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,579
Good!

117
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,019
Pretty nice!

118
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,529
I want to go there.

119
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,538
- Okay.
- Awesome!

120
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,209
Once again!

121
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,510
Nice!

122
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,730
I want to go there!

123
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,858
Colored umbrellas!

124
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,360
Colored umbrellas here!

125
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,079
I want it!

126
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,899
One, please.
<i>[Cheese Zhang]</i>

127
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,919
I want one!
<i>[Cheese Zhang]</i>

128
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,365
So do I!

129
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,660
Don't be crowded!

130
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,854
Don't jostle!

131
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:57,579
Hao Du.

132
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,521
As the shop is quite popular,

133
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:01,840
the food here must be delicious.

134
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,076
Please give me one!

135
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:06,209
Two, please!

136
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,765
So many people there stop me getting inside.

137
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:10,609
Could you buy it for me?

138
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,876
Mind out.

139
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:14,210
Don't push!

140
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,565
I want to buy it as well.

141
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:16,765
Fine.

142
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,276
Then stay here.

143
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:19,449
Don't leave here.

144
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,060
- One more, please!
- Hold on.

145
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,899
Here's the money.

146
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,280
I have the money for it.

147
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,019
Princess!

148
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,654
Ready or not?

149
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:33,040
Is it my turn?

150
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:36,676
I want to buy some!

151
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,770
Which taste do you want?

152
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,669
Sweet.

153
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,699
- Sir! Ready or not?
- I want it, too!

154
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,099
Hurry up! Two, please!

155
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,770
Excuse me.

156
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,721
Changge.

157
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,882
So many people here. Let's find another place to talk.

158
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,276
Leyan.

159
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:13,460
You have changed a lot.

160
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,943
How dare you come out like this in the past?

161
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,410
You're the same. Always make fun of me.

162
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:20,899
I don't.

163
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,365
I'm just happy for you.

164
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:26,365
You always hid behind others.

165
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,943
You were too timid and needed protection.

166
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:30,676
You're quite different now.

167
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:32,570
I know what I want.

168
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,376
I want to be the princess of Tang.

169
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:36,870
A real princess.

170
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:40,665
I don't want to see people starving

171
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,230
or kids having no rice to eat.

172
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:46,465
I want to be like you.

173
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:48,470
I want to be a girl fearing nothing.

174
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,300
Leyan, you're really different.

175
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,243
Someone told me

176
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:59,369
I could walk around for I was a man.

177
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,720
But I still can walk around as I'm a girl.

178
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:06,329
No matter who you're,

179
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,754
the one who likes rabbits or the one who wants to be a princess,

180
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:11,790
you can be whoever you want.

181
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,154
- And mine!
- Don't push!

182
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:17,665
Don't push me!

183
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,087
Is mind ready?

184
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,239
<i>[Cheese Zhang]</i>

185
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,790

Leyan!

187
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,154
Don't push!

188
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:29,350
Ready or not, Sir?

189
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:40,629
I've experienced so many things all the way here.

190
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,465
I thought I would embrace you

191
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:46,332
and cry bitterly after I met you.

192
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:51,399
Well, now for me, it's not a big deal.

193
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,509
Quite right.

194
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,830
We've all grown up.

195
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,629
Changge.

196
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,821
Where do you live?

197
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,132
How can I find you later on?

198
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,710
I'm now in Liuyun Taoist Temple.

199
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,732
You don't need to find me specially

200
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:09,065
for I'll sometimes come to South Hill.

201
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:13,354
It means we can meet again.

202
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:16,621
By the way, Hao Du is now in the town.

203
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,754
You need to be careful when you're out.

204
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,110
He'll catch you as soon as he sees you.

205
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,532
Hao... Hao Du... Changge, I have to go now.

206
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,900
Be cautious.

207
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,910
Watch out!

208
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,230
Oh, come on.

209
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:22,129
<i>♫ My fate brings me nothing ♫</i>

210
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,720
<i>♫ but loneliness. ♫</i>

211
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:31,419
I... saw someone was selling sugar figurines

212
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,487
so I went to buy one for I was greedy...

213
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:37,643
I wasn't on purpose to leave...

214
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,718
I know I'm wrong. Sorry about that.

215
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,599
I won't do that again.

216
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,270
Here you are.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,599
<i>♫ Love you at our first meeting. ♫</i>

218
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,259
<i>♫ It's a lifelong matter for me. ♫</i>

219
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,109
<i>♫ What is love? ♫</i>

220
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,720
<i>♫ It's our common instinct. ♫</i>

221
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:07,030
I... I thought I lost you.

222
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:09,510
You didn't.

223
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:10,810
I...

224
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,030
You said it's for me.

225
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:32,850
Not mad now?

226
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,309
Hao Du.

227
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,532
You're not as cold as your look.

228
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:40,670
Is that right?

229
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,021
Hao Du.

230
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:48,799
Where are my desserts?

231
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,510
- I've eaten them.
- Eaten?

232
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:52,554
I didn't ask you to do so.

233
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,021
Nothing left?

234
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,665
Answer my question.

235
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,287
Hao Du.

236
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,390
Hao Du!

237
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:06,250
Mr. Du.

238
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,732
Greet to your Highness.

239
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,621
Mr. Du.

240
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:13,799
Why are you here?

241
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,221
His Majesty has gotten the news of Princess's arrival in Luoyang

242
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:19,776
but he is still worried about you.

243
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:23,354
That's why I'm here personally

244
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,790
to see whether you're fine or not.

245
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,110
You... His Majesty could be at ease now.

246
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:35,221
Never mind.

247
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:37,532
Thanks for your care.

248
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:38,710
As it's getting dark,

249
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:41,350
you'd better have an early rest.

250
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:59,799
You didn't let his Majesty down at last.

251
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,210
As you've found her, I could be at ease now.

252
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:05,954
Father.

253
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:07,176
We haven't seen for just a few days.

254
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:08,399
What's the matter...

255
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,465
As I'm old,

256
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,154
it's easier for me to get sick.

257
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,310
But it doesn't matter.

258
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,349
Place what's in your hand properly.

259
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,932
Let's have a talk in the main hall.

260
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,050
Yes.

261
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,265
Father.

262
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,243
You're not only to visit Princess here, right?

263
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:49,599
Yes. But also to deal with my privacy.

264
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,799
Tell me what she has experienced.

265
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,239
I finally found her as I was in Luoyang.

266
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,910
She's suffered a lot.

267
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,470
She walked from the border to Luoyang all the way.

268
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:03,532
Well, it's good that you've found her.

269
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,154
It's not peaceful here.

270
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:09,180
Escort her back to Changan early next morning.

271
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:13,776
What?

272
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:15,354
Any problems?

273
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:16,910
No.

274
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,576
But...

275
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:22,021
Don't beat around the bush. Get to the point.

276
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,243
Letting her stay in Luoyang to appease people

277
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:27,132
is better than asking her to go back.

278
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,399
Someone told me that his Highness...

279
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,843
As Princess is here,

280
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,554
the refugees could be under the control.

281
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:33,932
What's wrong with Crown Prince?

282
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,110
He...

283
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,239
He's felt unwell for a long time

284
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,354
and everything about the disaster relief

285
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:42,332
is all up to Princess.

286
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,999
People here trust Princess more.

287
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,176
In order to stabilize the situation,

288
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:49,710
please allow her to stay in Luoyang

289
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,180
and do what she likes.

290
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,532
I will give her a close supervision.

291
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:56,870
Nothing will go amiss.

292
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,532
Hao Du.

293
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:02,976
You really take her into consideration.

294
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:04,932
Of course.

295
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,754
She's the princess after all.

296
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:08,870
Is it the only reason?

297
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:14,265
When I was as young as you,

298
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:17,265
I always failed to know

299
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:21,954
my mind or the mind of others.

300
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,354
Father.

301
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:25,776
- I didn't.
- You don't need to explain.

302
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:29,399
I won't interfere in young people's matters.

303
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,590
Have some tea.

304
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,700
<i>Princess?</i>

305
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,230
<i>Or Leyan?</i>

306
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:23,990
<i>What do I want?</i>

307
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:46,110
Good!

308
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,599
Nice job!

309
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,750
Come here.

310
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,810
Here you are.

311
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,410
You... It's you!

312
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,870
Your Highness, we meet again.

313
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:12,821
Your Highness.

314
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:13,920
Mr. Wei is here again.

315
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,459
I'm chatting with my old friend.

316
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,687
Why is he here?

317
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:19,554
Sorry for hindering your time.

318
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,030
Farewell, your Highness.

319
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,210
Don't leave!

320
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:27,865
Your Highness!

321
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,918
Your Highness!

322
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,940
I see!

323
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,954
Your Highness!

324
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,710
If you're free,

325
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:39,540
why not go to South Hill to help my sister?

326
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:45,199
How can a man like you let a lady zoom around in South Hill?

327
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,821
I'm ashamed of you!

328
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,030
Your Highness!

329
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,990
Madam.

330
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,390
Greet to Madam.

331
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:55,740
Madam.

332
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:59,754
Here's what's sent from Ziwei Palace.

333
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,740
<i>[The Book of Songs]</i>

334
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,720
As I've seen you, what else should I complain?

335
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:21,132
It seems to be a good choice

336
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,560
to ask Sheng Xin go to meet him.

337
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,176
Cui Tong.

338
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:26,243
Yes.

339
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:31,087
Everything in Luoyang is dry recently.

340
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:35,020
I'm afraid it'll have a blazing fire.

341
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:37,780
Yes, Madam.

342
00:23:46,155 --> 00:23:47,954
My girl,

343
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:51,354
I don't think you should always come to see me.

344
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:54,110
Don't worry. Hao Du won't know it.

345
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,471
Changge.

346
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:04,320
Minister Du is now in Luoyang. Be cautious as you're out.

347
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,293
I think you'd better stay here

348
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:08,950
rather than go out.

349
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,071
I could do nothing with the past.

350
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:16,169
But from now on,

351
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,200
I'll keep you safe at all costs.

352
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,471
I'll look after myself.

353
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:26,770
You too.

354
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:36,515
Here you are. Be careful.

355
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,671
Slow down.

356
00:24:38,672 --> 00:24:40,230
Thank you, sister.

357
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,760
You need to have a good rest.

358
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,360
- Your wound can't be delayed anymore.
- Okay.

359
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:13,693
Have a try.

360
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:15,515
It won't hinder your action.

361
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:16,840
Thank you so much.

362
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:21,179
My wound is almost healed.

363
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,826
It's said you're a noble from Changan.

364
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:25,979
I don't think you're a noble.

365
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,715
I think you're a Bodhisattva.

366
00:25:27,716 --> 00:25:32,404
Oh, my wife. She's a princess. How noble she is!

367
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,271
The heavens bless our nation!

368
00:25:34,272 --> 00:25:37,360
Your Highness is as kindhearted as a Bodhisattva!

369
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,471
Don't be like this.

370
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:42,799
It is said those from Liuyun Temple are very kind.

371
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,359
I think there's still a Bodhisattva here!

372
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,071
He's right!

373
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:48,204
That's it!

374
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,515
We've seen all the nobles from Luoyang

375
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:54,040
only except the crown prince...

376
00:25:57,894 --> 00:26:00,360
Actually, he cares for you.

377
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:02,320
That's why I'm here to look after you.

378
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,199
That's why it's said

379
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,382
his Highness stays in Ziwei Palace in seclusion

380
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:13,382
with the lights on all night.

381
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:15,382
Well, he's praying for us.

382
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:17,249
But it's a palace of the former dynasty...

383
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,069
Is it really a blessing for us?

384
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,604
Forget it. Just remember he's praying for us.

385
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:22,959
- He's right!
- I agree!

386
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,329
His Highness must do it for the good of us!

387
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,410
Thanks, Bodhisattva!

388
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,249
Ms. Quan, what are you doing?

389
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,493
It's said there's an abnormal astronomical phenomena in Luoyang

390
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:43,537
and a conflagration will break out in three days.

391
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:47,210
Though it's hearsay, we still need to be on guard for many people here.

392
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:53,937
Changge.

393
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:55,869
About the conflagration...

394
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,249
Don't be too worried.

395
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,990
It's just a hearsay.

396
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,582
These refugees have left their hometown

397
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,493
and now they can have an unclaimed field to farm.

398
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,204
It's a way of living for them.

399
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:13,004
Here's not the unclaimed lands.

400
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:14,950
It's Liuyun Taoist Temple's fields.

401
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:21,337
The rich in Luoyang are worried about their unknown backgrounds

402
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:22,693
so they dare not let them farm.

403
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:24,471
But Master cares nothing about it.

404
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:25,849
She lends them not only fields

405
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,880
but also grains and foods.

406
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:31,590
She's really a Bodhisattva of Luoyang.

407
00:27:48,761 --> 00:27:50,040
Changge.

408
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,440
Brother Shuyu.

409
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,004
Last time, we parted in Weishui.

410
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:05,049
How are you these days?

411
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm fine.

412
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:07,582
Everything is okay.

413
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,350
I'll be fine as long as you're okay.

414
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,915
When did you come back?

415
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,893
Why hadn't you told me?

416
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:17,115
And why are you now with Yan?

417
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:19,419
Where had you gone?

418
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,915
- And...
- Wei Shuyu.

419
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,680
You have too many questions.

420
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:27,737
Fine. I'll ask nothing.

421
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:29,368
I won't ask you.

422
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:31,426
Everything will be fine as long as you're okay.

423
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:34,800
As you're here, will you leave again?

424
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,849
I don't know.

425
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,848
It's not my home.

426
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:41,400
I can go nowhere.

427
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:44,471
You can come with us!

428
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,589
After the things here are settled,

429
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,049
we can return to Changan together.

430
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,315
You, Yan and I can stay together like before.

431
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:52,410
Changge.

432
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,750
Li Changge has died.

433
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,350
You can call me A'Li.

434
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,915
No matter what you are called,

435
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,382
you are always my Changge.

436
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm really glad to see

437
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,560
you're the same as before,

438
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:17,770
staying together and looking after each other.

439
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:20,900
Chang...

440
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,640
A'Li.

441
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:27,049
Can we have a private conversation?

442
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,293
I still have many refugees to nurse

443
00:29:29,294 --> 00:29:31,449
so I can't chat with you.

444
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,360
As you come with Crown Prince,

445
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:35,249
you must have many things to do.

446
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,404
But...

447
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:37,582
Anyway,

448
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,337
I won't leave here at once.

449
00:29:40,338 --> 00:29:41,990
You can take Leyan out of here first.

450
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,950
We still have chances to chat later on.

451
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:04,449
Master.

452
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,737
Luoyang became rife with rumors these days.

453
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,760
It's said there must be a conflagration in three days.

454
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:11,671
As the good and the bad mix up together,

455
00:30:11,672 --> 00:30:14,782
if someone wants to make a trouble,

456
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,449
I'm afraid it'll do harm to us.

457
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,115
I hope you could have an early plan.

458
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:21,128
Don't worry.

459
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,350
Everything has its own fate.

460
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:26,849
It's good for you to know what to do.

461
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,360
No.

462
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,449
I don't know what to do.

463
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,737
A'Li.

464
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:35,426
Even if it's a fish, I dare not tell you

465
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:38,289
I can control all its actions.

466
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,119
So how can I control humans?

467
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,329
Reckoning accurately or finding a foolproof way

468
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,728
all depends on one's skills.

469
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:50,409
The Tao should be the core.

470
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,360
What does it mean?

471
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:56,693
How can't you save someone in need right in front of you?

472
00:30:56,694 --> 00:30:59,804
If you decide to save, it means you can't plan for the future.

473
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:01,320
Then so what?

474
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:14,008
Tao only depends on your heart.

475
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,920
Take the consequences.

476
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:21,400
Everyone in the world should obey it.

477
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,630
<i>[Luoyang Office]</i>

478
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,560
Brother Shuyu.

479
00:31:49,694 --> 00:31:50,990
Brother Shuyu?

480
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,849
What are you thinking?

481
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,249
Nothing.

482
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,289
By the way,

483
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,604
Crown Prince parties in Ziwei Palace everyday.

484
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:01,640
If he keeps on doing so, things will go wrong.

485
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:05,315
He's spoiled.

486
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:06,680
If you...

487
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:10,289
If you don't know what to do, go to tell Minister Du.

488
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,960
He fears them the most.

489
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:15,093
Nowadays,

490
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:18,293
the refugees in South Hill start to discuss it.

491
00:32:18,294 --> 00:32:20,360
If he keeps acting recklessly,

492
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:22,693
what should we do?

493
00:32:22,694 --> 00:32:25,649
Does Changge know he's here?

494
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,110
Are you worried she will make troubles with him?

495
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,671
You don't believe her!

496
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:36,680
I promise she won't do such things.

497
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:40,320
I know.

498
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,315
Your Highness.

499
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:57,293
Have you found him?

500
00:32:57,294 --> 00:32:58,759
Report to Your Highness.

501
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,982
He says that you need to pick him out first

502
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,900
and then he will come to meet you.

503
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:18,804
Okay.

504
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:20,409
Nice.

505
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,360
It's so interesting.

506
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,626
Tell me! What are the rules?

507
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,049
You can do whatever you want

508
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,870
except getting close or talking to them.

509
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:31,700
Can't get close...

510
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,826
Fine.

511
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:40,271
Watch what I do, then you try!

512
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:41,520
Yes.

513
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:47,240
Do it.

514
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,920
It's you! You're the one I want!

515
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,826
Your Highness is so smart.

516
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:31,115
Sheng Xin greets to your Highness.

517
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,440
Stand up.

518
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:35,288
Nice.

519
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,440
I want you to stay with me!

520
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,293
Your Highness, please let us all stay with you.

521
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:43,030
More people, more fun.

522
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,109
You're right.

523
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,288
Okay. You can all stay.

524
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,350
Thanks, Your Highness.

525
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,260
Minister Du.

526
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,582
<i>[East of the city; South and North street]</i>

527
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:04,782
Thank you.

528
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:07,160
Do you want to find Mr. Li?

529
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:10,079
Well, maybe he isn't at home.

530
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,426
He isn't in Luoyang?

531
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,449
Yes, he is.

532
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,826
Maybe he's at the tea-house in West Market

533
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:16,680
or at the tavern in the South Market.

534
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:21,937
He could be anywhere in Luoyang except his home.

535
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:25,729
He's in Luoyang but out of home all the time?

536
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,226
No one can tell whether he'll return during the curfew.

537
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,493
I've heard that he married a shrewish woman.

538
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:31,960
How can't he hide outside?

539
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:39,520
Minister.

540
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,626
Mr. Wei.

541
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:44,849
Why do you come in a hurry?

542
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,159
Report to Minister Du.

543
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,360
I've already dealt out all the relief funds and materials.

544
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:51,915
Now the situation here is getting better.

545
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,649
But...

546
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,519
Go ahead.

547
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,179
But Crown Prince hasn't come out since he moved to Ziwei Palace.

548
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,671
It's Princess Yongan who's in charge of everything.

549
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:03,560
People are starting to gossip about it.

550
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,840
And...

551
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,200
And he mixes with a group of jugglers all day...

552
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:11,680
Absurd!

553
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:33,100
Your Highness.

554
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:35,382
Your Highness!

555
00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:36,500
Your Highness!

556
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:45,160
Your Highness.

557
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,337
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

558
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,409
What about you, Sheng Xin?

559
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,640
It's glad to hear that.

560
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,026
Unfortunately, I forgot to bring a recorder with me;

561
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:03,226
otherwise I would let him record all that you've done for the people

562
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:05,510
and report to his Majesty.

563
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:10,982
Minister Du.

564
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,649
My father is busy with affairs everyday.

565
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,271
It's unnecessary to let him know such a trifle.

566
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:17,671
There's a hearsay

567
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:21,382
your Highness indulges in the lavish lifestyle everyday.

568
00:37:21,383 --> 00:37:26,782
At this rate, his Majesty will finally know it.

569
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:30,160
Minister Du, I feel grateful to listen to your advice.

570
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:31,480
Thanks for the trouble.

571
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,404
He's my friend in Luoyang.

572
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:39,426
If you're unsatisfied with it,

573
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:42,720
I'll ask him to go back where he comes.

574
00:37:45,116 --> 00:37:47,830
I hope you can behave yourself.

575
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,515
Your Highness.

576
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:57,160
If you want me to leave,

577
00:37:57,161 --> 00:37:59,026
you can tell me straight.

578
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,550
As I've seen you, what else should I complain about?

579
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,160
It's my great honor

580
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:09,240
to see such a brilliant person like your Highness.

581
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,426
I've told him that

582
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:21,026
I'll ask you to go back where you come.

583
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:24,315
As you're a young musician of Taichang Temple in Changan,

584
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:27,871
where else should you go back except Changan?

585
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,610
Thanks, your Highness!

586
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:43,849
I've already searched there and here.

587
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,293
Where's Ashile Sun? Aren't we going to find her?

588
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:48,071
He went out before dawn.

589
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,826
He has a map of Luoyang.

590
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,909
He goes to find and then crosses out one by one.

591
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,729
As he finished, he'll then start a new round.

592
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,019
How can he find her by the aimless search?

593
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,460
Everything depends on us.

594
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:08,937
Sorry.

595
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:10,370
Unaware.

596
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:13,759
You smart girl.

597
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,582
Wait for my good news!

598
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,770
Let's go.

599
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,950
<i>[Great virtues match heaven and earth.]</i>

600
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:51,700
A'Li, do you like the dishes today?

601
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:57,249
A'Li, it's no good for you to stay here all day.

602
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,204
Let's go to buy some medicines and you can limber up.

603
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:03,760
I think it's pretty nice to stay here. A self-cultivation.

604
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,160
Then it'll be good.

605
00:40:15,094 --> 00:40:16,382
That's it.

606
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:17,915
Sit well, please.

607
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,440
- Okay.
- A'Li...

608
00:40:24,272 --> 00:40:26,370
<i>[Liuyun Taoist Temple]</i>

609
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:43,819
Don't be narrow-minded.

610
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,950
Do you know what I've learned today?

611
00:40:54,294 --> 00:40:56,426
I feel tired after walking all day.

612
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:59,260
Well, massage my legs and then I'll tell you.

613
00:41:01,694 --> 00:41:03,493
Are you unwilling?

614
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,315
I think you're really pert.

615
00:41:05,316 --> 00:41:08,599
We rent the house and asked for news.

616
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,950
So don't you think...

617
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,337
Cut them.

618
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,510
Then you won't be tired.

619
00:41:17,383 --> 00:41:18,880
Any clues?

620
00:41:20,805 --> 00:41:22,030
I'll let you off this time.

621
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,999
Yes. There's one.

622
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,871
It's said a Taoist called Sun Simiao

623
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:28,493
came from the grasslands

624
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:31,070
and saved a young lady at pains.

625
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:34,760
Isn't Commandant Li a young lady?

626
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,471
What else?

627
00:41:38,472 --> 00:41:40,426
Why are you not surprised?

628
00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:42,226
I don't think you know it.

629
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:43,449
Cut the crap!

630
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,071
Any other news?

631
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:47,182
His whereabouts are always unknown.

632
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:48,960
It's known he will diagnose refugees

633
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:52,093
but no one knows where he's now.

634
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:54,271
Any shelters for the refugees in Luoyang

635
00:41:54,272 --> 00:41:57,640
A place called Liuyun Taoist Temple in South Hill.

636
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,680
Liuyun Taoist Temple?

637
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:18,550
Why did he run away again?

638
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:38,100
Anyone's here?

639
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:42,782
Sir.

640
00:42:42,783 --> 00:42:44,309
There's no visit today.

641
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,893
Only people with acute diseases are allowed in.

642
00:42:46,894 --> 00:42:49,379
Could you do me a favor? I'm here to find a lady.

643
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,115
Is there anyone called Li Changge?

644
00:42:51,116 --> 00:42:52,493
Or Li Shisi?

645
00:42:52,494 --> 00:42:54,426
Li Changge?

646
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:56,449
There's no Li Changge here.

647
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,893
I think you've come to the wrong place.

648
00:42:57,894 --> 00:42:58,959
Please leave at once.

649
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,689
What about Sun Simiao? Is Sun Simiao here?

650
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,826
How can you call Taoist Sun's name?

651
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:04,093
That's it! Taoist Sun!

652
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:05,419
Has he saved a lady?

653
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,337
He's saved innumerable people

654
00:43:07,338 --> 00:43:09,515
so how can I remember all of them?

655
00:43:09,516 --> 00:43:11,071
Please forgive my offense.

656
00:43:11,072 --> 00:43:12,115
Changge!

657
00:43:12,116 --> 00:43:14,110
You intruder! I'll call others to catch you!

658
00:43:19,272 --> 00:43:20,660
Changge!

659
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:24,604
Changge!

660
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:25,720
Changge!

661
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,120
Changge!

662
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:38,860
Changge!
