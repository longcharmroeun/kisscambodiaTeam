The Long Ballad

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,700
Episode 30

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,960
<i>[Non-interference]</i>

23
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,338
Let me see, which brat dares crash into Liuyun Taoist Temple?

24
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:08,579
Boy.

25
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,580
Come out!

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,019
For a hundred years, you are the first one

27
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,998
who broke into the Liuyun Taoist Temple without permission.

28
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,579
Don't you think it is not good for a man

29
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,438
to break into a temple for nuns?

30
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,839
Sorry, I just want to look for an old friend.

31
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,519
I told you that nobody here is called Li Changge or Li Shisi.

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,839
<i>My name is Li Changge.</i>

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,000
<i>Mr. Situ, thank you for teaching me the swordsmanship.</i>

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,679
You're too arrogant.

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,839
Come and leave as you like?

36
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,998
I told you that I didn't mean to provoke here.

37
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,239
I'm just looking for someone.

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,438
Do you want to fight with me?

39
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,199
Do you think you can win?

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,078
You can have a try.

41
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,479
Both of you should stop.

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,959
The temple is a quiet and peaceful place,

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,798
don't disturb the rest of Taoists.

44
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:08,238
Mr. Situ, don't irritate him.

45
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
Let him get out of here quickly.

46
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,158
Boring.

47
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,759
My apology.

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,878
I want to find my friend so much.

49
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
I'm so eager that...

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,078
I've already told you that Taoist Sun saved countless girls.

51
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,359
You'd better leave soon.

52
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Excuse me.

53
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,060
<i>[Sun]</i>

54
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,559
Does my apprentice Li Changge have another name called Li Shisi?

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,229
Doesn't she feel troublesome to have so many names?

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,560
But things get more interesting when she meets her friend.

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Li Changge,

58
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,159
where are you?

59
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,799
Let's take a break and drink a cup of tea.

60
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Okay.

61
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,239
Ladies, what do you want to drink?

62
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,199
Tea, thank you.

63
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,380
Okay, please wait a minute.

64
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,039
It's said that there will be a heavy fire in Luoyang within three days.

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,579
The drought is serious recently,

66
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,958
we don't have even enough water to drink, if it is true,

67
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,759
where should we get the water to put out the fire?

68
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,759
What should we do?

69
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,319
What are you worrying about?

70
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,800
I've heard that the fire won't be here.

71
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,240
Why?

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,718
Liu, do you know any secret?

73
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,239
Say it.

74
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,519
Luoyang suffers from both drought and fire.

75
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Just wait.

76
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,099
The heaven would let us know

77
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,640
who's brought the disasters to Luoyang in two days.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
A'Li?

79
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,670
Enjoy the tea.

80
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,059
Look at you, what are you thinking about?

81
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
The tea is not ready.

82
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,678
Enjoy your tea.

83
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,479
Bye.

84
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,919
You didn't finish your talk!

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,000
- You just said a half.
- I'm going to buy something.

86
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,158
Sachet on sell!

87
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,200
Have a look!

88
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,398
Where did you go?

89
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,558
Why are you so improper and impolite?

90
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,639
At least we are taking action together now.

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,920
But you ignore our Yanxing Sect's rules.

92
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,479
Tell us.

93
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,479
What's wrong?

94
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,700
I went to Liuyun Taoist Temple that harbors refugees.

95
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,869
Sun Simiao has saved too many girls.

96
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,670
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

97
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,639
I even went in to search in person.

98
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,440
If she's there, she won't refuse to come out.

99
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,619
I was wrong.

100
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,539
You didn't say it all.

101
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,199
Come on.

102
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,919
Don't be anxious.

103
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,159
We can definitely find our young master.

104
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:31,479
Xu Feng was right just now.

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,398
We'd better inform each other before taking any action

106
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,319
in case of any trouble.

107
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,838
Besides, Mr. Qin's identity is special.

108
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,718
You should be more careful before taking any action.

109
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:48,679
As far as I think, you should let us search for the young master.

110
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,199
Finally, you're back.

111
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,398
You know what?

112
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,718
Shortly after your leaving,

113
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:12,359
a gentleman rushed in and said he was looking for someone.

114
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,359
He kept messing up.

115
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,709
It is Mr. Situ that drove him away finally.

116
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,118
What?

117
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:20,079
If I were here, I'd scold him bitterly.

118
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,239
How can we allow him to do that in Liuyun Taoist Temple?

119
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,079
By the way, A'Li, he's been to your room.

120
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,118
Go and check if you have lost anything.

121
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:29,718
It's okay.

122
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,998
I have nothing important.

123
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,079
<i>Luoyang suffers from both drought and fire.</i>

124
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,878
<i>Just wait.</i>

125
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,278
<i>The heaven would let us know</i>

126
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,999
<i>who's brought the disasters to Luoyang in two days.</i>

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,599
<i>The rumor about the fire in Luoyang is not that simple.</i>

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,839
<i>Who did that man want to indicate?</i>

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,119
Prince and princess, do you know

130
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,239
that the rumor about Luoyang is spreading out?

131
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,680
It is said that Luoyang must catch on fire within three days.

132
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,799
Princess Yongan, your appearance shows

133
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,278
that you must have known it before.

134
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,198
But Haodu heard another rumor in the liquor shop today.

135
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,559
They said the crown prince never showed up

136
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,799
because he's addicted to having fun.

137
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,479
What's more, the candles are always lighted in the Ziwei Palace,

138
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,100
which seems to be the hidden danger of the fire.

139
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,439
Sister, I didn't.

140
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,480
It's not true.

141
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,259
Who spread this nonsense first?

142
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,359
Hao Du, where did you hear this?

143
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,799
Capture all these villains who spread rumors to deceive people.

144
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,919
The rumors usually comes out from the whorehouses.

145
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,078
But now it is discussed even in the normal shops of liquor.

146
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,959
It seems hard to stop it now.

147
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,919
What to do then?

148
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,278
Put off the candles and pick up an auspicious day.

149
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,119
Dress in the formal clothes with the crown to pray happiness to the heaven.

150
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,879
Your Highness,

151
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,278
you also should visit the refugees' shelters in person,

152
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,559
wearing in plain clothes without golden belts.

153
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,440
Therefore, your Highness's sincerity could be seen.

154
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
<i>[Qianyang Hall]</i>

155
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,279
Mr. Du, please wait.

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,398
Minister Du,

157
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,479
the rumor just said that there would be a heavy fire in Luoyang.

158
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,758
But I think someone must bring this gossip

159
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,078
and the crown prince together on purpose.

160
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,439
Your Highness, I see you in a totally new light after a few days.

161
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,638
What you said is absolutely right.

162
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,239
But your Highness, please be assured,

163
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,999
I will definitely deal with it properly.

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,399
Good job, Minister Du.

165
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,829
Chunfeng,

166
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,960
have you leaked the news about the abnormal astronomical phenomena to others?

167
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:34,599
Your Majesty, the armillary sphere shows

168
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,838
that there might be a disaster of fire in Luoyang within three days

169
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,718
and the crown prince is in Luoyang.

170
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:44,559
I just told these facts to Minister Du objectively.

171
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,959
I asked him to take good care of his Highness.

172
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,318
Look at my unfilial son.

173
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,559
I'd punish him when he's back.

174
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,599
Do you know what did Du said in the letter?

175
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,958
I let him investigate the situation of the disaster in Luoyang

176
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,239
while he kept having fun in the Ziwei Palace.

177
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,799
None of his action is like a crown prince.

178
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,919
But to my delight, Du told me that Yan kept helping this brat

179
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,278
resettle the refugees in Luoyang.

180
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,600
She's got the spirit of a princess of our great Tang.

181
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,719
I realize Yan has grown up by her change.

182
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,639
But the price of growing up is always suffering.

183
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,838
This daughter of mine

184
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,278
makes me take pity on her but feel happy at the same time.

185
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,479
Her Highness considers about the sorrow of the people,

186
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,679
which is the bliss of Tang.

187
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,158
The crown prince is still young.

188
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,059
I believe he can share the burden and problems

189
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,119
for your Majesty after abundant experiences.

190
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,318
Chunfeng, you don't need to speak for him,

191
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:58,069
he should learn the lessons.

192
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,140
He might be more sober in this way.

193
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,239
Your Majesty.

194
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,958
This is Hexagram Shi, which means success after danger.

195
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:22,959
The story in Luoyang

196
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,639
might be very interesting.

197
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,279
Hold on.

198
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,319
Have patience.

199
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,198
It's not serious.

200
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,638
The muscles and bones are not injured.

201
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,879
But do not get in touch with filthy water when you're back.

202
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,119
Understood?

203
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,679
Okay?

204
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,999
Bind up over there.

205
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Thank you.

206
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,078
Do not get in touch with the water these days.

207
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,079
Okay.

208
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,758
Why are you here?

209
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,759
I'm worried about you.

210
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,999
Just in case, you'd better hide outside the city.

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,799
Both Minister Du and Hao Du are in Luoyang now.

212
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,039
What if...

213
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,759
Done, you can get the medicine.

214
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,439
Thank you.

215
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Thanks.

216
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,039
Didn't you say that his Majesty would not kill me?

217
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,799
His Majesty's favor is grand so he didn't mind it long before.

218
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,400
But you're afraid that Du Ruhui disobeys the order.

219
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,999
Wei Shuyu, why are you still such vacillating?

220
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,459
After enduring great danger for several times,

221
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,799
I'm not fearful of these any more.

222
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,958
I'm not vacillating.

223
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,120
I dare not to make you take risk any more.

224
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,838
You don't fear for death.

225
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,159
But I'm afraid of your death.

226
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,559
These days are the peak season of Liuyun Taoist Temple.

227
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,440
I'm busy, or else I won't leave, either.

228
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:39,239
Let me help you.

229
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Thank you.

230
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,958
Father, you never believe in the God or Buddha,

231
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,158
why do you come to this temple today?

232
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,958
It's not unbelief.

233
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,040
I'm just not persistent or superstitious.

234
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,638
One day before we set off from Changan,

235
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,638
Li Chunfeng gave me a bag with a tip.

236
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,959
It's written that I have to come here when I arrive at Luoyang.

237
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,559
<i>Hurry.</i>

238
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,939
<i>I see your head is dim while the feet are cold.</i>

239
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,958
<i>It seems that you can't live longer than a year.</i>

240
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,159
<i>You are dying within this period.</i>

241
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,859
<i>I know it clearly.</i>

242
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,659
<i>I observed your fortune just now.</i>

243
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,518
<i>The result is positive.</i>

244
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,999
<i>Take this tip.</i>

245
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,679
<i>Open it after you arrive in Luoyang.</i>

246
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,679
<i>Go there on the seventh day of the lunar calendar.</i>

247
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,880
<i>Probably, you will encounter some chances there.</i>

248
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,439
<i>[Find the doctor in temple.]</i>

249
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,559
This fortune teller always indicates something behind his words.

250
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,400
Now that we're in Luoyang, why not come and have a look?

251
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,479
Gentlemen, it seems that you aren't visiting Taoist Sun for your disease.

252
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,119
May I know what's your purpose?

253
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,859
Is Taoist Sun called as Sun Simiao?

254
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,678
Sure.

255
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,599
Anyone else called Taoist Sun

256
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,198
can treat such many patients for free in this world?

257
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,639
Assistant Minister Li asked you to come here

258
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,559
so that Taoist Sun can treat your disease.

259
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,159
Taoist lady, please help to report

260
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,558
that Minister of War, Du Ruhui wants to see Taoist Sun.

261
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,078
How can you see him as you like?

262
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,838
How do I know if you are telling the truth?

263
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,039
Someone has just messed up in Liuyun Taoist Temple yesterday.

264
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,760
All kinds of people can be here now, right?

265
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Look at this clearly.

266
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,198
Anyway, I don't know what is this.

267
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:11,318
But no matter you are the Minister of War or World,

268
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,859
the sole rule of Liuyun Taoist Temple is first-come, first-served.

269
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,190
Please follow the rule and wait in line.

270
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,879
Changge, it is about your safety.

271
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,318
We can't take it randomly.

272
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,319
A'Li.

273
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,799
Yes?

274
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,579
Go and get ten cicada sloughs from the pharmacy outside now.

275
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,120
Okay, wait me for some minutes.

276
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,359
Taoist Sun.

277
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,038
There are two people in decent clothes outside,

278
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,479
called as ministers of something.

279
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,239
They are asking to see you.

280
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,678
Ministry of what? War? World?

281
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,318
Forget it, let them wait outside in line.

282
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,319
Okay.

283
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,958
Gentlemen, please wait in line.

284
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:06,959
Thank you.

285
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,039
Wei Shuyu, what...

286
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,198
What are you looking at?

287
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,918
Father.

288
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,360
I think I've seen an old friend.

289
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,239
I'll be back soon.

290
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Okay.

291
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,319
Sir, are you interested in the pharmacy of our Taoist temple?

292
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,599
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,479
I just saw someone sneak into the pharmacy.

294
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,078
Sneak?

295
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,279
Liuyun Taoist Temple is an open and upright place,

296
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,699
we save people and benefit the society.

297
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,159
How could it be any sneaky person here?

298
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,759
You must be Minister Du.

299
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,239
Hello, madam.

300
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,078
This young gentleman entered Liuyun Taoist Temple

301
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,958
and went straight towards my pharmacy.

302
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:23,479
May I know if there is anything wrong with my pharmacy?

303
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,259
Nowadays, the refugees are everywhere in Luoyang,

304
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,438
mixed up with nice and evil paople.

305
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,419
Hao Du is afraid that

306
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,879
some hostile people take chance to carry on misdeeds.

307
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,318
That would disturb you and the Taoist priests.

308
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,678
Thanks for concerning.

309
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,759
However, Liuyun Taoist Temple is pure and poor as water.

310
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,838
It's unnecessary for the gangsters to consider us.

311
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,319
You might see it wrong.

312
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,319
Please.

313
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,479
Why is Du Ruhui here?

314
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,678
Changge, it is too dangerous here.

315
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,678
You'd better leave with me.

316
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,519
Leave with you?

317
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,198
And then?

318
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,520
I'll manage ways to protect you.

319
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,558
Changge, I really want to keep you safe.

320
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,600
Can you trust me for the last time?

321
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,879
I don't distrust you.

322
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,078
But if I had any other idea, I wouldn't stay here now.

323
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,280
What's more, I haven't got the answer I want.

324
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
What's that?

325
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,119
Shuyu.

326
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,078
I believe that you must have your own business in Luoyang Office.

327
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,198
Just go.

328
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,019
I don't really fear for them.

329
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,798
I just have no time to deal with it.

330
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,558
So I'd manage to avoid them.

331
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,958
Just be assured.

332
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,838
Changge.

333
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,839
Changge.

334
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,360
Since you're introduced by Chunfeng, I'd be straightforward.

335
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,199
Minister Du, the rest of your life is limited.

336
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,318
If you want to extend your life,

337
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,599
the only way is to retire at the peak of your career.

338
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,759
But as far as I can see,

339
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,039
you're reluctant to give up your current business.

340
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:53,438
At present, I can't, dare not and also don't want to give up.

341
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:59,879
If you have got no way to cure my disease, let's just forget it.

342
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,120
If you're so worried about it.

343
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:11,198
I can just extend your life for three years within my power.

344
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:14,038
But after this,

345
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:20,400
you may be quite miserable when you meet your death in the future.

346
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,958
Three years are enough for me.

347
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,069
Taoist priest, please help me.

348
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,678
Are you sure it is worthy?

349
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,479
Taoist priests, when you two help the poor and miserable in Liuyun Taoist Temple,

350
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,829
have you ever thought about where poverty and sorrow come from?

351
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,789
Heaven and Earth are ruthless while everything has its fate.

352
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,999
These are their doomed disaster.

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,179
Taoist priest, you are the hermit, but there are millions of people

354
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,919
bothered by the human society.

355
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,838
They have nowhere to hide and can only struggle for survival.

356
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:54,038
I read many books and work for the emperor.

357
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:56,918
So I don't want to watch it without doing anything.

358
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,479
His Majesty aims to build a prosperous society,

359
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,359
how can I make his Majesty go alone on this road?

360
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,199
Three years are enough.

361
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,159
I'm willing to spare no effort to assist his Majesty.

362
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,480
Let's see if we can create a peaceful and prosperous era.

363
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,318
Sister.

364
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,999
What are they doing?

365
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,599
Miniser Du has said that tomorrow is the right time.

366
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,200
Your Highness should take people to pray in White Horse Temple.

367
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,399
Tomorrow?

368
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,198
What's wrong?

369
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:44,479
Nothing.

370
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,918
Brother, from now on, you can't be childlike anymore.

371
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,119
Our father is the emperor of the country now.

372
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,038
So you can't be a good-for-nothing idler.

373
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,159
- From today...
- Sister.

374
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,280
What's wrong with you?

375
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,999
After you got lost last time, you become verbose now.

376
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,499
You loved me the best.

377
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,819
But why do you stand for the people like Minister Du?

378
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,958
No matter how reluctant you are.

379
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:13,558
You must follow the principle and show up tomorrow.

380
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,199
I will play with you when it is finished.

381
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,078
Taoist priest, thank you for helping me.

382
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,799
I knew you went out for stopping Minister Du on purpose.

383
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,379
But I didn't get...

384
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,520
It's a pity for you two to fight against each other.

385
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,918
You know who I am, do you?

386
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,439
If you are not willing to say it, I won't ask more.

387
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:51,839
But do you know what is Minister Du's Tao?

388
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,639
He's not afraid of burning the candle at both ends,

389
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,599
but he's worried that he can't see the prosperous Tang.

390
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,159
<i>His majesty aims to build a prosperous society,</i>

391
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,918
<i>how can I make his Majesty go alone on this road?</i>

392
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,718
<i>Three years are enough.</i>

393
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:14,558
<i>I'm willing to spare no effort to assist his Majesty.</i>

394
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,279
<i>Let's see if we can create a peaceful and prosperous era.</i>

395
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:26,838
Maybe you two have got the similar Tao, but different strategies.

396
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:30,038
Do you know what is my Tao?

397
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,519
I can't say I know it.

398
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,069
But I think your intention is about governing

399
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,900
but I heard the method you selected tend to havoc.

400
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:47,099
What if I disobey the instruction and take my own way?

401
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,399
For a river,

402
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,438
roes, deer, tigers, or wolves drinking the water makes no difference.

403
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,599
What's more, the tigers and wolves have their own Tao.

404
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,958
The one who should terminate them is the hunters.

405
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,719
What are they to the river?

406
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,160
Don't breach the natural Tao.

407
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,740
Go with the flow.

408
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,558
Just like the refugees in Luoyang, once they get an acre of farmland,

409
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,479
they can live their life through self-reliance and build their new homes.

410
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,558
They want a peaceful and steady life instead of endless killings.

411
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,798
You've got a strong power of understanding.

412
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:26,438
I want you to stay in our temple now.

413
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:30,558
Madam, where can the heavenly Tao be found?

414
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,399
Nature created everything, the human is just one of them.

415
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,459
You find even your true intention,

416
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,640
not to mention finding the heavenly Tao.

417
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,600
I see.

418
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:49,279
Now, can you tell me what your true intention is?

419
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,640
I thought I could recapture what I lost.

420
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,480
But I didn't realize what I was withstanding until just now.

421
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm not willing to give up,

422
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,719
but I don't want to wait, either.

423
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,199
I want to see the prosperous Tang in my lifetime.

424
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,558
I will end the trouble times by myself and counterattack brutally.

425
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,999
Are you clear about what you are saying?

426
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,440
Don't breach the original intention.

427
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,599
Right.

428
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,039
I misjudged.

429
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,799
How could you be content with living a peaceful life?

430
00:28:57,199 --> 00:29:00,359
Madam, Sheng Xin has arranged well.

431
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,359
Is Du Ruhui responsible for the security of Luoyang?

432
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,318
Yes.

433
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,198
But for the ceremony in White Horse Temple tomorrow,

434
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:10,159
Du Tuhui has called up some of his people from the Ziwei Palace

435
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,678
to the east suburb.

436
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,678
Our people will watch their movement at all times.

437
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,199
Watch out another person for me as well.

438
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,640
The one who destroyed Liang of Xiao,

439
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,919
Li Jing.

440
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,318
Have a look here!

441
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,279
Baubles.

442
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,300
Come and have a look!

443
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,799
Attention please.

444
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,159
Wait, wait.

445
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I think

446
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,160
you should select this move called "relieving a state by besieging the other" to win.

447
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,160
Do you know "a real master won't speak when seeing the game"?
<i>[Li Jing]</i>

448
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,958
I help you with kindness win a game doomed to lost

449
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,318
but you don't accept it.

450
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,429
Come on.

451
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,920
Just play by himself if he's capable.

452
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,559
Where is the chilly wind from?

453
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,798
Honey?

454
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,239
Honey.

455
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,958
Why are you here?

456
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,838
Darling, you worked so hard.

457
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,519
An important guest came to visit us

458
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,639
while you have no time to receive him.

459
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,699
You were playing a chess game here.

460
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,918
What a fun day for you!

461
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,639
I'm just afraid that you may be tired so I'm here to have a look.

462
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,239
No, I'm not tired.

463
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I'm not.

464
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,359
Yes, right.

465
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,909
I'm very tired.

466
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,038
I will go back home with you right now.

467
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,120
Please, my honey.

468
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,719
Honey, is the important guest at our home that person again?

469
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,599
Mr. Du came to our home again.

470
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,838
He wanted you to take over the Ministry of War for him.

471
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,439
I have refused for you.

472
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:16,919
Having a considerate wife like you is my best luck.

473
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,099
Got it.

474
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,078
I'll wash my hands, burn the incense and kneel down tamely.

475
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,120
Practice my knees.

476
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,318
You know what?

477
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,279
Because the crown prince is immoral, Luoyang will suffer the heavy fire.

478
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,838
Really?

479
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,399
Absolutely.

480
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,879
Think about it, who brought us the current bitter life?

481
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,159
- Right.
- Yes.

482
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,779
That's right.

483
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,519
- It's the crown prince's misconduct.
- That's right.

484
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,159
Or else we wouldn't be like this.

485
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,838
Right.

486
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,718
Can't agree more.

487
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:48,078
Nowadays, even the heaven can't bear him.

488
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,599
He will receive his consequence!

489
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,519
Perfect!

490
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,438
Great!

491
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,279
Nice.

492
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,760
Good, so nice!

493
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,109
Don't miss the dinner

494
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,229
or you have to be on your knees for two hours more.

495
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,230
Okay.

496
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:04,668
Don't move.

497
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:05,749
Who are you.

498
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:08,829
You brat.

499
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,988
How dare you spread the flour toward me?

500
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,379
I'm warning you.

501
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,549
You'd better be honest.

502
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,549
Or you will be killed here, I'm serious.

503
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,779
Who on earth are you?

504
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,489
You tailed after me and want me to speak by myself?

505
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,659
What should I say?

506
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,020
- Who asked you to spread the rumor?
- Where is that person?

507
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,110
You know who spread the rumor, do you?

508
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:31,470
Who are you?

509
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,908
Tell us the truth.

510
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:51,909
Where is she?

511
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,350
He is a man of sacrifice.

512
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,909
It's not her arrangement.

513
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,190
Wait.

514
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:14,029
Who is it?

515
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,830
You often visit our home during the meal time, don't you?

516
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,630
What a pity, my husband is not at home again.

517
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:57,789
Mr. Du,

518
00:34:58,789 --> 00:35:00,788
my husband has said for many times

519
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:02,469
that he has no intention to go to Changan.

520
00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:05,748
Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Li.

521
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:11,188
But I still hope to have a talk with Mr. Li before I give up.

522
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:13,629
It's up to you.

523
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,870
Please enjoy it.

524
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:32,309
He missed the dinner again.

525
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,589
What's worse, he left me to deal with those boring men.

526
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,188
Nice.

527
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:40,589
A'Ning, prepare more washboards.

528
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,590
Yes.

529
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,570
<i>[Non-interference]</i>

530
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,070
Changge.

531
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,419
Changge.

532
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,769
My brother promised me to be obedient

533
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,709
and attend the praying ceremony tomorrow.

534
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,469
But the rumor said there would be a disaster of fire tonight.

535
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,069
I still feel upset.

536
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,268
Don't be worried.

537
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:15,788
The rumor will collapse without explaining tomorrow.

538
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:19,988
By the way, have you found anything strange in the Ziwei Palace?

539
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:21,229
Strange?

540
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,869
He's just addicted to having fun.

541
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,028
Nothing strange can be found.

542
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:30,550
Can you find a way to bring me into the Ziwei Palace?

543
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:41,468
Your Highness, it's better to try the garment for the ceremony.

544
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:43,589
If there is anything you are unsatisfied with,

545
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,188
it would be too late to adjust before the praying ceremony tomorrow.

546
00:36:46,189 --> 00:36:50,149
I'm unsatisfied with everything especially you!

547
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,109
I told you.

548
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,259
The old-school Minister Du is not here.

549
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,629
Why don't you listen to the Hu-music and visit the markets and communities with me?

550
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,788
If you don't want to go with me,

551
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,829
why did you tell me the fun in the Xunfang Pavilion?

552
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,629
You made me so anxious and curious.

553
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,489
It's all my fault.

554
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,428
Once your Highness can be obedient tonight,

555
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,870
I swear I will manage to sneak out with you later.

556
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,948
Fine.

557
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:17,228
You may leave now.

558
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:18,229
Yes.

559
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,629
Don't be nervous.

560
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:52,028
Remember, I'm a Taoist priest who pray and tell the fortune with you.

561
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,709
I won't be found once we stay calm.

562
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,909
Move faster.

563
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,109
Tie Li Chengqian up.

564
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,110
Over there!

565
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,110
So, Mr. Qin, you're looking for an old friend.

566
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,389
Even though you are not his companion,

567
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,309
you are not here for some kind purpose.

568
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,789
It's a past story long before.

569
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,309
My friend would not have arranged the man of sacrifice,

570
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:22,188
so I believe she didn't get involved in this case.

571
00:39:22,189 --> 00:39:24,468
Who is this friend of yours?

572
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:28,389
Why did you think she spread the negative news about the crown prince?

573
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,869
Does she know the crown prince with each other?

574
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,909
I'm willing to drink the tea with you

575
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,268
just because I think you're a gentleman as well.

576
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:37,509
Please don't ask too much about others' privacy.

577
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:45,748
My friend will never do harm to Tang.

578
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:49,069
If you persist in investigating, I have to say goodbye.

579
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,349
Fine.

580
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,789
I won't ask more.

581
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:56,389
Do you know the Ziwei Palace?

582
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,508
The Ziwei Palace?

583
00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:00,869
If your friend is acquainted with the crown prince,

584
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,829
it is very likely to meet your old friend there.

585
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,268
Fire!

586
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:07,188
The fire is really here!

587
00:40:07,189 --> 00:40:09,268
- Does it catch on fire?
- The fire disaster comes.

588
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:09,869
The Ziwei Palace.

589
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,309
The Ziwei Palace really catches on fire.

590
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,589
It's on fire!

591
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,468
The fire disaster comes. It comes true!

592
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:15,708
Fire!

593
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:17,788
Come and put off the fire!

594
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:18,389
Put off the fire!

595
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,788
Hurry, water!

596
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:20,948
Quickly!

597
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:22,150
Help!

598
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,590
The fire is too big!

599
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,549
The prediction about the fire comes true.

600
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,670
Such a heavy fire!

601
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:38,428
What's going on?

602
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:41,069
Your Highness, the Ziwei Palace has caught on fire.

603
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,389
Where is the crown prince? How is he?

604
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:43,948
Well...

605
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:44,909
I don't know.

606
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,988
Get into the palace and save the people there.

607
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:47,589
Hurry.

608
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,590
Yes.

609
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,109
Go.

610
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,110
Go.

611
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,508
Why are you following me?

612
00:40:58,509 --> 00:40:59,309
Go and save the people.

613
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,589
You are not allowed to go there.

614
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,699
More people, more we can do.

615
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,508
You want to look for your old friend, do you?

616
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:06,550
Right, but I want to save them as well.

617
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,268
Fine, I'd trust you for now.

618
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:12,508
But you must follow me or I won't show mercy.

619
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:13,789
Let's go by the shortcut.

620
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,550
Where is the crown prince?

621
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,829
Has the crown prince been saved?

622
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,468
Your Highness, His Highness should be still inside.

623
00:41:57,469 --> 00:42:01,069
Our people are searching but haven't found him.

624
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,508
Stop!

625
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:03,109
Your Highness.

626
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,110
Your Highness, don't go.

627
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,110
Let's go.

628
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:47,349
Changge.

629
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,489
Have you found my brother?

630
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,149
No.

631
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,909
But I saw a jackstraw in the crown prince's garment.

632
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:52,748
What?

633
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:54,499
He'll attend the praying ceremony tomorrow,

634
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,028
he wouldn't leave his room.

635
00:42:56,029 --> 00:42:57,268
No idea.

636
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:59,948
This seems like a well planed movement for long.

637
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:00,669
Leyan.

638
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,869
Someone saw me.

639
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,909
I can't be here for long.

640
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,549
I'm going back.

641
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,269
Find me in Liuyun Temple at any time if necessary.

642
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,669
Okay, be careful.

643
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,670
You too.

The Long Ballad
