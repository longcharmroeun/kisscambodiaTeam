The Long Ballad Episode 28

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,080
An Rou, is the carriage ready?

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Mr. Hao has been waiting here for a long time.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,400
Come on, I'd better go on my own.

24
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,079
You should stay here.

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,838
If his Highness really feels uncomfortable,

26
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:03,118
look for doctors as soon as possible.

27
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,519
Princess, don't you need me with you?

28
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,680
Since Mr. Hao is with me, nothing should be worried.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,159
Stay here and look after his Highness.

30
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,840
You trust Mr. Hao a lot.

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,959
No kidding at this moment.

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,919
Yes.

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,720
Go.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,840
Go!

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,760
Go!

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,839
Don't take away my little brother!

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,039
Ms. Wu!

38
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,718
Don't take away my little brother!

39
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,759
- He's still alive!
- Ms. Wu!

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,839
Don't cremate him!

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,078
- Don't cremate him!
- Ms. Wu!

42
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,559
He's my younger brother!

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,199
Don't cremate him!

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,759
What are you doing? Let her go!

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,479
Save him!

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,518
They want to cremate my brother!

47
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,759
He'll die!

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,878
He has a plague.

49
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,399
My brother!

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,479
Ms. Wu!

51
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,839
Stop her!

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,319
My brother!

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,399
Don't cremate him!

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,199
He's really my younger brother!

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,399
Miss. Mister.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,039
One by one, people die of the plague.

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,479
The corpses must be cremated.

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,839
It can't be delayed.

59
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,640
Princess.

60
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,998
Brother!

61
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:14,718
Ms. Wu!

62
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,519
Ms. Wu!

63
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,839
I know.

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,759
Don't cremate him.

65
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,560
I know you can't believe it.

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,840
But your brother is seriously ill.

67
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,519
Don't chase him.

68
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,279
But now he's not painful anymore.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,400
Last night,

70
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,279
I hummed a ditty

71
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,480
to put him to sleep.

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Suddenly, he had a high fever

73
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,480
and black spots on his skin.

74
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:54,480
Then his body became cold.

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,920
Slowly.

76
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,039
I rubbed his hands, feet and face.

77
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,719
But he became totally cold.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,079
I can do nothing.

79
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,839
He died.

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,640
Ms. Wu.

81
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,238
Your brother became bereaved after birth.

82
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,519
It's already hard for you to raise him up.

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,959
It's lucky that you're sister and brother.

84
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:27,719
Granny.

85
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,040
He's not had enough rice and steamed buns.

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,200
<i>He came to this world</i>

87
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,878
<i>but left as if he had never existed, why?</i>

88
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,759
<i>When we arrive in Luoyang, I can give you anything you want.</i>

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,240
<i>I want you to give me a lot of rice.</i>

90
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,959
<i>I've never tasted rice.</i>

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,079
I know your brother went to see your parents in the nether world.

92
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,640
Let him go.

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,439
I hope he won't be born into a family like ours in the next life.

94
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,999
He went to see our parents.

95
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,439
But I'm not happy at all.

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,879
I don't want him to see our parents.

97
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,600
I know.

98
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Ms. Wu.

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,719
You can miss him.

100
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,279
You can feel sad.

101
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,279
But you should continue your life.

102
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:41,399
Lead a good life with the hope of your brother.

103
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,239
Sun.

104
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,959
A'Li, you had a nightmare.

105
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,839
You repeatedly called Sun.

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
Who is he?

107
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,398
Nothing.

108
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,239
You shouldn't shut yourself up in your room every day.

109
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,838
One will think too much if staying alone for a long time.

110
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,800
What you dream about at night reflects what you think about in day.

111
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,320
A' Bi.

112
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,558
Thank you.

113
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,519
You're welcome.

114
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,158
I don't read many books.

115
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,599
Thanks to Ms. Quan, I have the very basic knowledge.

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,718
But when I was little, my mom always told me that

117
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,838
one can always lead a good life

118
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,158
if he combs his hair, brushes teeth, cleans his face with tissues

119
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:28,079
and has three full meals everyday.

120
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,039
I think Master is right.

121
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,360
You're so clever that you always think too much.

122
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,559
What you just said reflects real wisdom.

123
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,639
Yes.

124
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Master always says my vague manner conceals a brilliant mind.

125
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,998
By the way, did you call a man A' Sun?

126
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,159
Or it's a monkey you raise?

127
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,959
It's Sun.

128
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,158
Sun?

129
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,719
So it's a bird you raise?

130
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,200
He's my former companion.

131
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:02,479
Since he's your companion, why doesn't he look for you?

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,799
I don't think so.

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I did something that hurt him.

134
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,080
If he doesn't look for and hate me,

135
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,159
I'll feel a bit relieved.

136
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Go!

137
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,639
Stop!

138
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,959
Any information of Changge?

139
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,919
Mr. Qin. I have the news.

140
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,718
We found a person similar to Young Master.

141
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,680
She went to Luoyang with a doctor and a young man in a donkey cart.

142
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,718
Who are the doctor and the man?

143
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,079
Is Changge safe with them?

144
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,439
Stop pretending to care about her.

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,239
We'll find Commander Li.

146
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,239
None of your business!

147
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Xu Feng.

148
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,039
He's impetuous.

149
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,838
He never cares about what he says.

150
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,078
But he's always loyal to Young Master.

151
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,480
Don't think too much.

152
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:11,519
So we should speed up and arrive in Luoyang as soon as possible.

153
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,479
Since we're all for Young Master's good,

154
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,880
why do you always embarrass him?

155
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,439
During these days,

156
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,759
haven't you found that he really cares about Young Master?

157
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,919
Even if he really cares about Young Master,

158
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,879
I'll never forget the hatred in Shuozhou.

159
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,480
I know how you're feeling.

160
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,719
Since we are consistent in our goals, we should work together.

161
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,079
No need to quarrel with him without thinking twice.

162
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,958
Well.

163
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,599
Don't think too much.

164
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,879
Brother A'Zhun, water.

165
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,599
Have a rest.

166
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,839
Set out early tomorrow.

167
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
Hug me.

168
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,519
Come here.

169
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,879
Brother A'Zhun.

170
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,318
Throw me high.

171
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:14,240
One more time.

172
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
Stop!

173
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,799
Yuan is naive.

174
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,879
Are you naive, too?

175
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,999
Too dangerous!

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,079
What's your purpose?

177
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,958
You frighten her.

178
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,759
Yuan.

179
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,360
Don't play with him.

180
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,840
Play with me.

181
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,919
No.

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,198
Yuan.

183
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:36,239
You can play with any other person, except him.

184
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,439
He's not called Zhun.

185
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,758
He's Ashile Sun.

186
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,679
He put your parents...

187
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,480
Xu Feng.

188
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,799
A'Zhun, it's late at night.

189
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,120
Take Yuan to sleep.

190
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,719
Yuan, behave yourself.

191
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,958
Yuan.

192
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,360
Shall we play together elsewhere?

193
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,440
You have gone too far!

194
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,149
She scolded me!

195
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,028
What did I do?

196
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,229
Why don't you understand?

197
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,829
Do you want Yuan to be the second Young Master

198
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,708
who always lives in hatred?

199
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:23,189
You witnessed Young Master's pain and sorrow.

200
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,269
Don't you know the cost of hatred?

201
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,070
Did you see how happy she was just now?

202
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,588
Governor and his wife hoped that

203
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,909
their daughter could grow up lightheartedly

204
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,619
instead of suffering from hatred.

205
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
<i>[Luoyang Office]</i>

206
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,019
Princess.

207
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:01,099
The supplies of South Hill are ready.

208
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,179
Princess.

209
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,058
What's the matter?

210
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,819
His Highness went out.

211
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,379
Did he go to South Hill?

212
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,939
Of course not.

213
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,219
He went to the street.

214
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,380
When will he grow up?

215
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:57,618
Well.

216
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:01,580
Seeing the miserable condition of the people, he may be touched.

217
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,020
Hope he won't make any trouble.

218
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,340
Princess, now you behave more and more like a sister.

219
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,738
Colored umbrella!

220
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:13,178
Look at these umbrellas!

221
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:14,259
Fresh cabbage!

222
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,899
Fan!

223
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,978
Look at the fans!

224
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:16,779
Little tiger!

225
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,098
Come and have a look!

226
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:19,899
All home-made!

227
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:24,459
Shengxin.

228
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:29,659
Since Madam selects you, you should behave yourself.

229
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:40,899
Good!

230
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,139
Great!

231
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,978
Come on!

232
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:44,019
Good!

233
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,899
Wrestle!

234
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,538
Move out of my way!

235
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,019
Wrestle!

236
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,899
Move out of my way!

237
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,738
Great!

238
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:48,298
Wrestle!

239
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,339
Great!

240
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,579
Good! Wrestle!

241
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,058
Good!

242
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:55,098
Good!

243
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,178
Good!

244
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,538
Good!

245
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,779
Again!

246
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,658
Good. Go on!

247
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:00,459
Come on!

248
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:02,459
Go on!

249
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,940
Come on!

250
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,178
Wrestle!

251
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,260
Go on!

252
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,019
Go! Get him down!

253
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,418
Good!

254
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,259
Roll logs for us!

255
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,098
Good!

256
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:16,899
Money!

257
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:18,460
Money!

258
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,500
Don't grab!

259
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:21,859
Mine!

260
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,538
Don't squeeze! Don't grab!

261
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:24,779
- Don't squeeze!
- Mine!

262
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,260
Don't grab!

263
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,059
Move out of my way!

264
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:32,779
Don't squeeze!

265
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,580
Back off!

266
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:36,058
Back off!

267
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,339
Mine!

268
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,658
Don't squeeze! Back off!

269
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:39,459
Beat!

270
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,219
Don't grab!

271
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,700
Don't squeeze!

272
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:53,019
Come on.

273
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:08,820
Don't grab!

274
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,740
Painful.

275
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,738
Painful.

276
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:13,819
Don't move.

277
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,098
Let me apply the ointment to you.

278
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:15,899
Don't move.

279
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,140
Don't move.

280
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:27,019
Painful.

281
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,820
Still painful?

282
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,099
Thank you for saving me.

283
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,299
Tell me your name.

284
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,500
I'll give you money.

285
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,099
I'll repay you.

286
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,940
You're welcome.

287
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:49,899
Mister!

288
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,700
Mister!

289
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:52,859
Here you are.

290
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,099
Back!

291
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,699
Back!

292
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,538
Mister, are you OK?

293
00:15:58,539 --> 00:15:59,298
Come back!

294
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,099
Are you OK?

295
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:03,260
Back!

296
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:20,779
Give me a pie.

297
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,580
Here you are.

298
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:26,260
Brother A'Zhun.

299
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,979
Do you like this song?

300
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,180
Lazy bone!

301
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,419
Xu Feng is right.

302
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:59,298
You shouldn't get too close to me.

303
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:00,500
Why?

304
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,300
Yuan.

305
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,339
It's a wolf whistle.

306
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,619
It's our specialty.

307
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,540
I have nothing else to compensate you.

308
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,619
Blow it when in need.

309
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,859
I'll protect you on behalf of your parents.

310
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:26,779
In this way?

311
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,580
Very good.

312
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,400
<i>[Sun]</i>

313
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,739
What am I thinking about?

314
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,698
New trouble arose as soon as His Highness came here, why?

315
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:05,739
His Highness?

316
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,699
I'll finish.

317
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:21,899
More ointment.

318
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,060
Don't touch water.

319
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,860
Bear the pain.

320
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:29,059
A' Bi!

321
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,458
What happened?

322
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,738
His Highness secretly watched juggling and spread money

323
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:35,938
on the street instead of comforting the refugees after he came to Luoyang.

324
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:38,979
But the street was so crowded that many people were trampled on.

325
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,420
His Highness is here?

326
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,900
He never did anything right.

327
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:48,899
My apprentice.

328
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,858
Let me bandage it for you.

329
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:55,499
If you have spare time to care about the official affairs,

330
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,420
you'd better work with me in South Hill.

331
00:18:58,979 --> 00:18:59,779
Let's go!

332
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:10,218
Your Highness.

333
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,299
Mr. Wei, finally you come!

334
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,169
People outside seem to be mad.

335
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,179
I want to return to Chang'an!

336
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,159
Get the carriage ready!

337
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,320
I want to return to Chang'an!

338
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,339
You're injured.

339
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,420
How did you protect him?

340
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,938
They're a bunch of thugs!

341
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:27,539
I spread money to them out of kindness.

342
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,139
But the outcome is terrible.

343
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,858
Some people were trampled to death.

344
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:31,939
Too terrible!

345
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,659
I want to go back to Chang'an!

346
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,420
What trouble did you make?

347
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:37,818
Sister.

348
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,019
I'm injured.

349
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,500
But why don't you care about me?

350
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,779
You show no kindness to me at all!

351
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,580
Let me see.

352
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:47,539
Chengqian!

353
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:49,618
Brother Shuyu.

354
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:50,779
Look around with me.

355
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,580
- Go.
- Princess.

356
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,099
It's my duty.

357
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,660
Keep an eye on His Highness lest he wants to go back to Chang'an.

358
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:00,979
Okay. Thank you.

359
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,700
Move out of my way!

360
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,698
- Commander!
- Go!

361
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:15,659
Be lenient on me!

362
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,349
Commander!

363
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,299
- Stand up!
- Commander!

364
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,499
Please be lenient on me!

365
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,660
Hurry up!

366
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:23,899
Commander.

367
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,419
It's these beggars who made troubles.

368
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,899
Commander, please be lenient on me!

369
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,059
We're not on purpose.

370
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,499
We've been hungry for days.

371
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,978
A rich man spread money in the street.

372
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,659
We just picked several more coppers.

373
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,338
We didn't expect things should go wrong.

374
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:35,219
Commander.

375
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:43,698
<i>I know very well the people outside.</i>

376
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,219
<i>They're just too hungry.</i>

377
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,779
<i>Some people are kind on the surface, but vicious inside.</i>

378
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,500
<i>Some people look indifferent but are warmhearted, like you.</i>

379
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,698
Take them back and let Magistrate deal with them.

380
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:00,858
Yes.

381
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,659
Go!

382
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,499
Commander!

383
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,659
Be lenient on me!

384
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,698
Commander, show mercy on me!

385
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:06,499
Hurry up!

386
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:29,260
Slow down.

387
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,300
Slow down.

388
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,380
Are you feeling better?

389
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:16,019
Bear the pain.

390
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:26,060
Why are there so many refugees?

391
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,540
They used to be ordinary people.

392
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,780
In the face of disaster and war, they became refugees.

393
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,140
As long as society is not stable, there will be more refugees.

394
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,459
Feel uncomfortable at the sight of that?

395
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,738
They are more fortunate than those who have no place to live

396
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,780
and no food to eat.

397
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,259
Some of those who have not escaped the disaster and war

398
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,020
are still wandering and struggling,

399
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,618
while some of them have been buried in the earth

400
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,180
and have no chance to live.

401
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,140
My friend.

402
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:04,900
Here you come.

403
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,060
Master.

404
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,820
Master.

405
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:13,660
Here you come.

406
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,060
Ms. Wu.

407
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:18,738
Master, who's this sister?

408
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:20,939
Is she new here to cultivate herself?

409
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,379
Ms. Wu.

410
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,698
She's A' Li.

411
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:27,659
She's been cultivating herself in the temple.

412
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,499
I'm busy today.

413
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,219
Can you take her to go outside tomorrow?

414
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,580
My apprentice.

415
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,019
Aren't you called Li Changge?

416
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,260
When did you change your name?

417
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,060
What I'm called doesn't matter.

418
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,259
Okay.

419
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,619
Change your name and restart your life.

420
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,200
<i>[Luoyang]</i>

421
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,739
Have you found her?

422
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,499
No.

423
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,299
I searched there but in vain.

424
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,578
Search in all directions!

425
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:18,379
Yes!

426
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:22,978
What happened?

427
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:24,300
Yuan is missing.

428
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:26,539
Yuan is missing!

429
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,818
You're the only one out there.

430
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:29,179
Didn't you see anyone running out?

431
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,938
Stop!

432
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:34,739
Xu Feng.

433
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,618
Listen.

434
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:38,218
If there's anything wrong with Yuan,

435
00:24:38,219 --> 00:24:40,419
I'll get even with you for all the matters.

436
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,260
I'll kill you for Gongsun family.

437
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,500
First, find her.

438
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:46,060
Then it's up to you.

439
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:56,619
Where to go?

440
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:20,139
Yuan!

441
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,100
Yuan!

442
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:29,539
Are you OK?

443
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,340
I'm fine.

444
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,458
Let me take you out.

445
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:33,259
OK?

446
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:36,619
Come on.

447
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,618
Yuan.

448
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,899
Why are you here?

449
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,698
Tomorrow is mom's birthday.

450
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:55,338
I want to pick some flowers for her.

451
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:59,539
I saw flowers on the tree, but I couldn't reach them.

452
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,260
I didn't expect to fall into the pit.

453
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,458
What a good girl!

454
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,140
You are filial.

455
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:14,859
Gongsun's greatest wish is that you can be safe and happy.

456
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:19,639
It's a pity that he can help all people in his life

457
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,140
but can't protect his family.

458
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:28,699
Well, let's go back.

459
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:34,779
Nothing serious.

460
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,540
You can't do this again.

461
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,019
Painful?

462
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,938
I will immediately count the number of injured and the registered residence of each household.

463
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:53,660
Please come with me to comfort them and give them subsidies.

464
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,020
Mr. Wei, you can do it alone.

465
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,458
Or I wouldn't have brought you here.

466
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:03,059
How can you talk to Brother Shuyu like that?

467
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,139
It's all your fault.

468
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,779
You should comfort those people.

469
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,539
Sister.

470
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,698
My kindness is not rewarded.

471
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:10,139
I gave them money but was hurt.

472
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,019
I'm sad.

473
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,458
Leave me alone!

474
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:13,779
You're Crown Prince.

475
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,219
If you don't go, should I go?

476
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,659
So you said you would go.

477
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,059
I...

478
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,938
You're Princess of Tang.

479
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,019
You should do that.

480
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:28,140
Last time you comforted those refugees in person.

481
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:30,619
Sister.

482
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,179
I've already been injured.

483
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,339
Let me have a rest for a few days.

484
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,779
Let me see how long you can be so willful.

485
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,900
Sister.

486
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,300
Come on.

487
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,098
I'll go on your behalf.

488
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:52,180
But just this once.

489
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,700
Mr. Wei.

490
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:04,299
Mr. Wei.

491
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,859
I dare not go into the street again.

492
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,339
Anywhere else can I go?

493
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:12,218
I heard that Ziwei Palace of Sui Dynasty is here.

494
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:14,179
Can you go with me?

495
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,139
Your Highness.

496
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,978
It was built by Emperor Yang. It's a sheer waste of energy and money.

497
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:20,818
I think you'd better go to visit common people.

498
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,419
Anyway, his Majesty appointed you...

499
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,019
Yes.

500
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,379
I think you're right.

501
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,618
You should watch Luoyang carefully, especially Ziwei Palace.

502
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:30,618
Emperor Yang was quite extravagant.

503
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:34,179
I have to see the palace
in detail as a reminder.

504
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,939
Get the carriage ready!

505
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:45,179
Wound healing unguent. Blood recovering pills.

506
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,619
Medicine is ready.

507
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,618
Princess, why not go with Mr. Hao?

508
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:51,620
<i>[Anti-plague pills]</i>

509
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,339
No need.

510
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:57,979
It's not the case in Chang'an.

511
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:00,338
There are many refugees.

512
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,819
They came from many different places.

513
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,738
Mr. Wei will take care of his Highness.

514
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:06,140
So he can't accompany you.

515
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,939
But I'm afraid if Mr. Hao isn't here, either.

516
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,419
I'm either in the mansion or in South Hill.

517
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,819
He'll find me for sure.

518
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,500
By the way,

519
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,578
it's impossible that he follows me all his life.

520
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,180
We should be able to protect ourselves.

521
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,899
Princess, you really change a lot.

522
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,818
It's better that Mr. Hao doesn't follow you.

523
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:30,619
Sometimes I'm scared at the sight of him.

524
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,578
Yes.

525
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:36,380
I was also afraid of him before.

526
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,218
Before?

527
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:40,300
Now you're not afraid of him?

528
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,060
Now...

529
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,060
<i>Princess!</i>

530
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,380
<i>I finally find you!</i>

531
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,260
<i>Let me take you home.</i>

532
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:02,098
Yesterday, Master asked me

533
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,380
to take you to South Hill today to look around.

534
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,180
Sister A' Li.

535
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:12,819
Do you have anything in mind?

536
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,300
You looked blue yesterday.

537
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,578
Why do you live in the temple?

538
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:20,660
Where's your family?

539
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:23,380
They all died.

540
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
Sister A' Li.

541
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,098
Here you are.

542
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,499
The candy was given from Master.

543
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,019
I haven't had it.

544
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,939
Here you are.

545
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,819
You want to give it to me?

546
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,978
Sister A' Li.

547
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,020
Don't be sad.

548
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:45,819
In fact, my family also died.

549
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:49,059
The people I met yesterday are not your family?

550
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,260
I used to live in Yunzhou.

551
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,139
When winter is approaching,

552
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,540
people from the grassland will come to loot.

553
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,619
Later, in the year of disaster,

554
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,020
no one could survive.

555
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:05,660
Our parents took us out.

556
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:10,140
They said we could survive in the south.

557
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:18,979
But later, my dad died of disease.

558
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,739
Then my mom also fell ill.

559
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,899
She said that ordinary people like us

560
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,739
can only depend on heaven for food;

561
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,939
if God wants to take back your life,

562
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,699
you can only accept such fate.

563
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,338
It shouldn't be the case.

564
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:41,699
But I can do nothing.

565
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:43,738
My parents died.

566
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:46,219
I took my little brother all the way to Liuyun Taoist Temple.

567
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,780
A few days ago, my brother died, too.

568
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,459
I miss him very much.

569
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,979
But I was told that people won't feel pain after death.

570
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:01,140
So he won't suffer anymore.

571
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,059
Is that true?

572
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,300
Sister A' Li.

573
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,459
Yes.

574
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:10,339
He won't suffer anymore.

575
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,219
Now he's with your parents.

576
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,900
But I'm still not happy at all.

577
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,180
Granny Chen told me that

578
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:25,619
my brother won't suffer in a family like ours.

579
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,219
But...

580
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,420
But I'm still sad.

581
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,859
Sister A' Li.

582
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,259
What sins have we done?

583
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,619
Why does God just refuse to treat us well?

584
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,458
You has done nothing wrong.

585
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:50,140
It's the fault of endless war.

586
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:53,020
I was born in a wealthy family.

587
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,539
We swam in luxury.

588
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,300
We went out by beautiful carriage.

589
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,020
We lived in a fantastic mansion.

590
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,579
But everyone wanted more.

591
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:10,780
I have thought that if I were born into a peasant family,

592
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,900
I would have been able to live in peace.

593
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,979
But I'm wrong.

594
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,830
I should understand earlier that

595
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,319
in troubled times,

596
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,280
if death can make my wish realized,

597
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,959
that will be much easier.

598
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,839
Here you are.

599
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,400
Have a taste.

600
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Let's go.

601
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,399
A' Li.

602
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,480
Did Ms. Wu take you to see anything?

603
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,438
Taoist.

604
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:55,600
Could you teach me how to save these refugees?

605
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,350
Why do you have that thought?

606
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:01,550
I hope we can lead a peaceful life.

607
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,830
I go with the flow, like duckweed.

608
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:07,429
You can see heaven and earth, and all living creatures in the world.

609
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,869
It seems that your heart has been cured.

610
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,550
<i>[Dapu Inn]</i>

611
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:19,630
We're in Luoyang now.

612
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,389
Let's settle down here.

613
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,190
Mr. Qin.

614
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:26,349
Is Changge really in Luoyang?

615
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,188
If you don't believe my intelligence, you'd better find her alone.

616
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:30,310
Xu Feng.

617
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:37,188
Grandpa Qin.

618
00:34:37,189 --> 00:34:38,870
What's wrong with Brother Azhun?

619
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:42,309
Nothing wrong with him.

620
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,590
He's afraid he won't find your Brother Li.

621
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,630
Thank you for your kindness.

622
00:35:19,189 --> 00:35:20,149
Sister A' Li.

623
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,549
You're quite a fast learner.

624
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,350
You are more skillful in pounding herbs.

625
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:27,829
Come here, everyone!

626
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,070
Someone donates some medicine to us.

627
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,910
Princess.

628
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:35,910
Princess!

629
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,789
Princess!

630
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:49,110
Princess, here you come!

631
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:19,150
Changge.

632
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,149
You don't hate me?

633
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,070
I was so stubborn that

634
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,429
I always refused you.

635
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:28,469
Leyan.

636
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:30,709
Can you forgive me?

637
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,269
I've never blamed you.

638
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:43,070
Thanks to God, we can meet again.

639
00:36:43,949 --> 00:36:48,268
I really thought I'd never see you again.

640
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:50,830
The fate has brought us together again.

641
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,550
Don't cry.

642
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,830
How about you?

643
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,029
Are you Ookay?

644
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,228
Where did you go after we farewell in a hurry in Youzhou?

645
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:06,029
Did you go directly to Luoyang?

646
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,469
After leaving Youzhou, I went all the way north.

647
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,150
Then I met Taoist Sun.

648
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:17,590
It's a long story.

649
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:21,949
You must have suffered a lot.

650
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,670
You went through many difficulties, right?

651
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:28,189
Let bygones be bygones.

652
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,670
Don't mention it.

653
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,910
By the way, we almost met each other before.

654
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:37,590
What do you mean?

655
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,228
Do you remember the purse I gave you?

656
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:42,029
I embroiled a new one which is exactly alike.

657
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,310
I remember that.

658
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,708
I was confused that why someone knew

659
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:49,749
what the purse you gave me was like.

660
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,988
Why didn't you see me?

661
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:53,469
I went to see you.

662
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,468
But Hao Du arrived in advance.

663
00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:01,709
Although Hao Du is not a good man, he can protect you.

664
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:06,269
By the way, why were you in Yunzhou then?

665
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,070
Commandant.

666
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,349
Where's Princess?

667
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,350
Her Highness is ahead.

668
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,508
Princess.

669
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:33,508
Princess!

670
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:34,428
Princess!

671
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:35,590
Mr. Hao is here.

672
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,670
Hao Du?

673
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:39,550
Changge.

674
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:41,629
Changge.

675
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,589
I have a lot to tell you.

676
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,069
Wait for me in the market between 3 to 5 pm.

677
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,149
Go. Hurry up.

678
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,028
Be careful.

679
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:47,949
Hurry up!

680
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,110
Hao Du!

681
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,708
I've finished my business.

682
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:01,188
Let's go back.

683
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:01,989
Wait a minute.

684
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:06,070
What's wrong, Princess?

685
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:08,869
I have a stomachache.

686
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,909
We have doctors here.

687
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,589
Doctor!

688
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,229
No need. It's just my period.

689
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,870
An Rou.

690
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:26,309
Let me do that.

691
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,110
Take it.

692
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:38,428
Hold on.

693
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:39,709
The carriage is over there.

694
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,110
3 to 5 p.m, market.

695
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:56,670
<i>What happened to them?</i>

696
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,310
<i>[Spring Breeze and Evening Water]</i>

697
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:05,549
Just now someone reported that his Highness came to Luoyang

698
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,189
to inspect the victims affected by the spring drought.

699
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,708
There's a lot of trouble in the city.

700
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,070
Considering the chaos,

701
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,909
I hope that all of you can put aside personal contradiction

702
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,350
and work together.

703
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,909
Mr. Qin.

704
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,309
We don't need to rely on others.

705
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,150
We can find Young Master on our own.

706
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:27,870
But why haven't we found Li Changge?

707
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:30,309
Well.

708
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,589
The situation in Luoyang is not clear.

709
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,829
The sooner we find her, the more reassuring we are.

710
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:42,508
Now that we work together, don't always quarrel.

711
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:43,508
Cooperation?

712
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:44,829
I don't want to work with him!

713
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,590
I don't know what he is thinking about.

714
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,269
Do you want to fight against me?

715
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,708
Okay.

716
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,508
I think all of us has put up with you for a long time.

717
00:40:54,509 --> 00:40:58,229
If Mr. Qin didn't stop me, I would have beat you up!

718
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:03,788
Okay.

719
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:05,029
Have a try.

720
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,748
I'm old.

721
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:17,948
If the young men want to fight, go outside.

722
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,509
Don't tear down the house.

723
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,269
Go!

724
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,110
Upstairs!

725
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,789
The view upstairs is good.

726
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,230
On the battlefield, I won in an open and aboveboard manner.

727
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,830
If you're not convinced,

728
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,350
defeat me now.

729
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:44,029
Close the door!

730
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,630
These young men!

731
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,830
I asked them to fight outside.

732
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,870
We should compensate the owner here tomorrow.

733
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:59,188
If you had told them just now, they wouldn't have got into a fight.

734
00:42:59,189 --> 00:43:00,110
For young people,

735
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:04,069
everything can be settled by a fight.

736
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,948
If he can't settle down such a little matter,

737
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:09,469
he won't be a dependable man.

738
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:26,189
This guy is really strong.

739
00:43:27,749 --> 00:43:28,508
Bros!

740
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:29,669
Go on!

741
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,669
He's going to the limit!

742
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,790
I'm willing to admit defeat.

743
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,269
You win!

00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,289
<i>♫ Entwist your figure, ♫</i>

750
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:12,720
<i>♫ and lock it into my tender dream. ♫</i>

751
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,119
<i>♫ Before the daybreak, ♫</i>

752
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,609
<i>♫ through the obsession of love, ♫</i>

753
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:22,439
<i>♫ the longing flows. ♫</i>

754
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,809
<i>♫ There's always a moment ♫</i>

755
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:31,609
<i>♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫</i>

756
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,049
<i>♫ There's always solicitude ♫</i>

757
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:41,769
<i>♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫</i>

758
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,159
<i>♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫</i>

759
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,439
<i>♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫</i>

760
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,009
<i>♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫</i>

761
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,769
<i>♫ layer after layer. ♫</i>

762
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,809
<i>♫ It turns into eternity. ♫</i>

763
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:01,680
<i>♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫</i>

764
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:10,089
<i>♫ There's always a moment ♫</i>

765
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:15,719
<i>♫ which burns down the wastelands in my heart. ♫</i>

766
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,329
<i>♫ There's always solicitude ♫</i>

767
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:25,639
<i>♫ which freezes everything between you and me. ♫</i>

768
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,199
<i>♫ Meet each other in different time. ♫</i>

769
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,569
<i>♫ Encourage each other in different worlds. ♫</i>

770
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:35,049
<i>♫ My longings become a cocoon, ♫</i>

771
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,919
<i>♫ layer after layer. ♫</i>

772
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,919
<i>♫ It turns into eternity. ♫</i>

773
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,330
<i>♫ The cocoon in the dark night. ♫</i>

774
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,500
<i>♫ It is sleepless. ♫</i>
