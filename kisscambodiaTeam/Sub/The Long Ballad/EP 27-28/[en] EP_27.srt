I've ordered them to bury Xiao Wu.

36

Please rest at ease.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,040
I just had a dream.

38
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,320
In the dream, Xiao Wu is still alive.

39
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,998
But I don't know why he's running.

40
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:17,840
He keeps running and doesn't want to come back to me.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,279
Hao Du,

42
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:27,040
is he still blaming me?

43
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,480
If not for me,

44
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,840
he wouldn't have been wounded and sick for long.

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
He'd have lived well.

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,599
I promised to give him a cart of rice.

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,159
I would take him to Chang'an

48
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,320
to see the blooming spring and picturesque landscape.

49
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,799
Now it's all gone.

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,519
He didn't blame you.

53
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,519
Don't be sad.

54
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,320
See him with me tomorrow.

55
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,119

Aren't you scared of me now?

58

After all these things,

59

I'm not scared of death.

You? I'm no scared.

61
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:43,719
I was scared of many things in the past.

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,640
How ridiculous I was.

63
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,240
Heaven rewards the good.

64
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,639
I've been guided to you by this amulet.

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,958
Now I return it to you.

Wish it a blessing to you.

67
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,958
Why do you have it?

68
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,839
It's a long story.

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,279
I found it in Hongyi Palace.

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,679
Maybe it's God's will.

71
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,640

Take care of yourself.

187
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,950
Please rest assured.

188
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,070
Yes.

189
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,559
Forgive me, please.

190
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,190
I forgot you're...

191
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,949
I'll send some guards for you tomorrow.

192
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,040
To protect you.

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,240
I came here for...

194
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,599
I'll come tomorrow.

195
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,400
Wait.

196
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,999
It's late now.

197
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,799
You must come here for an emergency.

198
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,600
Yes.

199
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,069
I just received a handwritten letter from his Majesty from Chang'an.

200
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,270
Please have a look.

201
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,839
His Highness has left Chang'an to inspect the damage

202
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,510
to show grace on behalf of His Majesty.

203
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,239
He'd arrive in a few days.

204
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,749
Thank you for delivering the letter, Mr. Hao.

205
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,040
I'll read it latter.

206
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
In that case,

207
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,830
I won't hurry to go back.

208
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,750
The crown prince is young and naughty.

209
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,479
I have to look after him.

210
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,269
I can help you with that.

211
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,950
But... I've decided it.

212
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,390
You have to stay with me in Luoyang for a while, Mr. Hao.

213
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,600
Princess, you've changed a lot.

214
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,280
What happened is a mixed blessing.

215
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,310
I lost, I gained.

216
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,070
Now I know what Father often said to me.

217
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,550
People live hard. How can we stand by?

218
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,600
I'm his daughter.

219
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,760
How can I stay ignorant?

220
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,430
You've suffered a great deal, haven't you?

221
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,880
I met many difficulties,

222
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,550
and many people to express my gratitude as well.

223
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,950
Difficulties will be gone,

224
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,000
but the gratitude will be< cherished in heart forever.

225
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,950
In the past, I only saw people's appearance.

226
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,240
Now I know I need to see what's in their mind.

227
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Someone seems kind but hides a malicious heart.

228
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,670
Someone has a cold face but a kind heart.

229
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,400
Just like you, Mr. Hao.

230
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,679
Why can't I master it?

231
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,038
Your Tao is different.

232
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,079
You can't do it.

233
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,918
Give up now.

234
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:25,880
Different Tao?

235
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,520
Where's the difference?

236
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,120
<i>In your opinion, what's my reason to defend Shuozhou?</i>

237
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,280
<i>Fights or surrenders are just the means</i>

238
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,678
<i>to guarantee the citizens stay away from war and live a happy life.</i>

239
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,000
<i>These are the most important.</i>

240
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,760
<i>This is the Tao I stick to.</i>

241
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,919
What's exactly my Tao is?

242
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,798
Senior Qin.

243
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,599
Did Yuan fall asleep?

244
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,159
Yes.

245
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,960
Okay.

246
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,599
We asked Luo Shiba to share messages with us.

247
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,838
But when we sent the message, she never wrote back.

248
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,678
Now she suddenly wanted to see us and would bring a friend to us.

249
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,760
A friend?

250
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,678
We have no progress so far.

251
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,839
Maybe this friend can bring some messages of Young Master.

252
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,600
Luo Shiba, here you are.

253
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,839
Your friend is...

254
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,558
Luo Shiba.

255
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,120
This is your friend?

256
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,240
Everyone listen, kill Ashile Sun to take revenge on the governor.

257
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:04,999
Wait.

258
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,640
About Gongsun Heng, I have a clear conscience.

259
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,279
Now Changge is missing.

260
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,239
I come here only to find her.

261
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
Find her?

262
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,718
It's you who took her to the grassland

263
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,439
where she encountered the misery, isn't it?

264
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,798
Luo Shiba.

265
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,399
You don't know what Ashile Tribe means to us, do you?

266
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,838
How can you bring him to Tang?

267
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,880
I only want to find her.

268
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,879
I'll find a way to find her even without your help.

269
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,680
You...

270
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,198
Ashile Sun.

271
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,120
Answer me.

272
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,038
Did you provoke to post up the notice

273
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,958
that Commandant Li sacrificed for the country?

274
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:47,759
It's me.

275
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,799
It's the best way to defend Commandant Li.

276
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,159
So what's your purpose to find her?

277
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,079
I have no purpose.

278
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,760
Only because... she's my friend.

279
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,120
Friend?

280
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,280
Commandant Li is your friend?

281
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:10,838
Senior Qin.

282
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,880
You're confused by him.

283
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,918
Do you believe he's a friend of Commandant Li's?

284
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,879
You should know how the whole city reviled Commandant Li.

285
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,839
It's Ashile Tribe's notice that subsided their rage.

286
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,558
Ashile Sun from Eagle Division is a master in archery.

287
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,318
Commandant Li was shot by him that day but survived.

288
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,039
I felt strange at that time.

289
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,038
Now I know why.

290
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,719
You're old friends.

291
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,480
So you put Commandant Li first.

292
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,399
How about the revenge for governor and his wife?

293
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,439
The war always cause many casualties.

294
00:22:53,439 --> 00:23:00,999
Ashile Sun granted governor's wish to save those citizens.

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,919
It's his mercy.

296
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,479
Xu Feng.

297
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,279
It's not the moment for rash actions.

298
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,079
Now our goal is to find Young Master.

299
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,119
She has a special status. We can only search her stealthily.

300
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,280
More hands, more power.

301
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,319
Get prepared, Xu Feng.

302
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,919
Let's go to the city together.

303
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,599
Please.

304
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,519
Thanks a lot.

305
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,918
There's no need for that.

306
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:35,719
This way, please.

307
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,919
Where's the magistrate of Luoyang?

308
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,120
Why hasn't he welcomed me by now?

309
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,480
He ignored me.

310
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,759
Stop.

311
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,560
Stop.

312
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:05,359
Mr. Wei, the refugees are disturbing the order outside the office.

313
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,918
They have enclosed the office.

314
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,999
The people inside can't get out, and we can't get in.

315
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,038
Let's change the route.

316
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,318
Don't catch their eyes.

317
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,558
Yes.

318
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,359
Wait.

319
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,919
Your Highness.

320
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:22,038
Father asked me to inspect Luoyang.

321
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,360
He wanted me to observe what people suffer.

322
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,879
Now I go to observe it and get in charge.

323
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,038
Mr. Wei.

324
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,038
Go with me to the office.

325
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:40,198
I'll let people know their crown prince is the best one.

326
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,360
Your Highness.

327
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,879
Food!

328
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,799
Food!

329
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,558
Out! Get out now!

330
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,359
Food!

331
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,718
We want food!

332
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:53,399
Give us food!

333
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,239
Out now! Give us food!

334
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,838
Get out!

335
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,479
Food!

336
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,519
We want food!

337
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,320
Get out!

338
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,119
Food! Get out!

339
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,479
Give us food!

340
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,399
Food!

341
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,159
Get out!

342
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,359
We want food!

343
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,879
Food!

344
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,159
Everyone listen to me!

345
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,798
Get out!

346
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,359
I'm the crown prince of this country.

347
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,279
Food!

348
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Give us food!

349
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,798
We want food!

350
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,838
Stop shouting!

351
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm the crown prince!

352
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,399
We want food! Food!

353
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,200
We want food!

354
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,718
Prince.

355
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,999
Are you really the crown prince?

356
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,680
You want us to die of hunger.

357
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,038
Everyone!

358
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,958
Come here!

359
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,239
Crown Prince is here!

360
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,119
Everyone!

361
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,279
Come here! It's the crown prince!

362
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,119
Protect his Highness!

363
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,678
Crown Prince is here.

364
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,639
Come here. It's the crown prince.

365
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,239
Prince is here.

366
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,999
Give me food.

367
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,798
Wei Shuyu.

368
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,879
Stop them!

369
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,958
Don't let them get close to me.

370
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:41,759
Back off!

371
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,599
Don't hurt anyone.

372
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,798
They're all ordinary people without any weapon.

373
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,918
We want food!

374
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:47,839
We want food! Food!

375
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,760
We want food!

376
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,798
Prince.

377
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,038
Prince.

378
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,719
Give some food to us.

379
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,800
Blood.

380
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,159
Blood.

381
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,359
It's bleeding.

382
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,958
They're killing us.

383
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,798
It's bleeding.

384
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,479
He hit us.

385
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,438
I'm scared.

386
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,558
Protect prince and retreat.

387
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,760
Prince can't be hurt. Retreat.

388
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,918
The guards beat us.

389
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,678
Back off.

390
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,718
He beat me.

391
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:12,519
They're killing us.

392
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,558
Crown Prince killed a man.

393
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,359
Back off.

394
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,439
What happened?

395
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,479
Princess, some refugees are creating a disturbance.

396
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,558
No need to worry, Princess.

397
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,078
Will my brother arrive today?

398
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,319
It should be today.

399
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,038
Open the door.

400
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:30,839
Princess.

401
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,520
It's a mess out there, so please don't go out.

402
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
I know them well.

403
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,838
They come from Yunzhou.

404
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,559
I was one of them.

405
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,199
They're just too hungry.

406
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,879
Besides, my brother is coming.

407
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,359
It's okay if they know His Majesty sent prince here to console them.

408
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,479
But it's dangerous...

409
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,000
Besides, you're with me, aren't you?

410
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,198
Princess, Mr. Hao.

411
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,678
Prince has arrived. His Highness is outside the door.

412
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,759
Open the door.

413
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,560
But...

414
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,279
- If...
- If the prince gets hurt, nobody can take the responsibility.

415
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,438
I'll take care of her Highness.

416
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,239
Open it.

417
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,040
Yes.

418
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
It's killing.

419
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,558
Police are killing.

420
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,000
Police are killing.

421
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,399
People are dying.

422
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,399
Mr. Wei, what should we do?

423
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,198
His Highness left us behind.

424
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,678
We'll die of hunger in Luoyang.

425
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,078
Nobody cares about us.

426
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:32,519
He's right.

427
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,239
Nobody cares.

428
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,159
Please calm down and listen to me.

429
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,520
His Highness will never leave you behind.

430
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:40,959
Is it true?

431
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,438
Really?

432
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,639
You're talking nonsense.

433
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,519
His Highness does not care about us.

434
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,239
He's right.

435
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,400
He doesn't care.

436
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:51,958
We want food!

437
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:52,958
He doesn't care!

438
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,120
He doesn't care!

439
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
We want food!

440
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,600
Give food to us.

441
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,198
<i>[Luoyang Office]</i>

442
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,120
The noble who can save you is coming.

443
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,558
Tell us what you want.

444
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,639
Why do you make a disturbance outside the office?

445
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,159
Who are you?

446
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,078
His Highness doesn't care about us.

447
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,999
How can you keep your word?

448
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,678
Yes. He's right.

449
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,119
His Highness doesn't care about us.

450
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,359
What can you do?

451
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,239
Am I right?

452
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,958
Yes. Yes.

453
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:44,759
Please listen to me.

454
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,958
What can you do?

455
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,559
I'm Princess Yongan of Tang.

456
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,119
You have my words.

457
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
This country will never leave you alone.

458
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,318
Please don't worry.

459
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,279
Food, water, clothes and beds, you'll have them all.

460
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,480
We have to face the difficulties of Luoyang together.

461
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,199
Really?

462
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,438
We won't die of hunger.

463
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,239
Yes.

464
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:20,719
What are you doing?

465
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,679
Your wound will fester if the bleeding doesn't stop.

466
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,718
Don't move.

467
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:28,519
I don't need it!

468
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:31,479
Hao Du.

469
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,479
You pretend to be injured and agitate these people.

470
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,520
What's your purpose?

471
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:45,999
Answer me.

472
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,279
Very good.

473
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,199
You don't answer me.

474
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,239
Never answer me.

475
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,239
Hao Du.

476
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,999
He did that because of starvation and fear.

477
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,919
Don't hurt him.

478
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,240
Do you see that?

479
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,759
Her Highness sympathizes with this kind of people.

480
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,520
How can her Highness leave you alone?

481
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,520
Yes. He's right. Yes.

482
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,719
<i>Brother Shuyu.</i>

483
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,679
Leyan, it's you.

484
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Thank God you're here.

485
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,718
I've been looking for you for such a long time.

486
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,678
I almost missed no relevant inch in the north land.

487
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,919
I'm afraid of losing you.

488
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:06,559
Sorry, it's all my fault.

489
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,760
I lost you and made you suffer a lot.

490
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,079
Brother Shuyu, it's not your fault.

491
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,000
No one predicts good or bad fortune.

492
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:20,240
See? I'm fine.

493
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,799
You're losing weight.

494
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,240
I dare not pile on pounds without finding you.

495
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,799
Leyan, tell me what happened from Youzhou to Luoyang.

496
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,239
Many things happened during the journey.

497
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,400
If I haven't experienced it,

498
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,360
I'd never know so much of the world,

499
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,999
and only be a canary in the cage.

500
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,800
Please rest assured.

501
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,520
I won't let you suffer anymore in the future.

502
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,280
What's wrong?

503
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,359
Princess.

504
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,760
Please go to see the prince.

505
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,359
Your Highness.

506
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,798
His Highness asked me to tell your Highness

507
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,879
his Highness is scared and has a fever suddenly.

508
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,718
I'm afraid his Highness can't meet refugees

509
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,918
in South Hill with your Highness.

510
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,279
He's ill?

511
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,080
Yes.

512
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,040
Your Highness.

513
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:49,119
His Highness was afraid of passing it to your Highness.

514
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,558
Her Highness visits younger brother.

515
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,558
How dare you arrogate to stop?

516
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,639
If his Highness's condition is delayed,

517
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,439
you won't survive even with ten lives.

518
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,320
Don't pretend in front of me.

519
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,000
Sister.

520
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,038
Father sent you to Luoyang

521
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:44,759
to console the people who suffered from the drought,

522
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,918
and build your image as a crown prince.

523
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,279
You're pretending to be ill.

524
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,719
How could you do that?

525
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,279
Sister, you've seen that.

526
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,519
These people are not some poor men but some gangsters.

527
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,519
Look at them.

528
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,159
With blood all over their faces, they're making threatening gestures.

529
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,359
They've scared me to death.

530
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,039
Just thinking of them, my head is aching.

531
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,160
I'm not going anywhere.

532
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:11,599
Brother.

533
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:16,798
I know that as a child, when you're facing such situations,

534
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,279
you'll be scared.

535
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,998
But you need to know that sooner or later,

536
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,160
we have to take on the responsibilities on our own,

537
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,039
especially for you.

538
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,838
I know, sister.

539
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,159
I really understand.

540
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,558
But I just arrived here.

541
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,519
Can you just give me a break?

542
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,400
I know what you're talking about.

543
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,159
Please be assured.

544
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,879
I'll grow up and be a man.

545
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,039
I'm the son of our father.

546
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,279
I heard you.

547
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,519
You need to do what you say.

548
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,600
I've experienced a lot in the past few months.

549
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,478
I've some new understandings.

550
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,838
Since we're taking from people in our land, in return,

551
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,559
we should give them a stable life.

552
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:09,880
Brother, do you know what is a crown prince?

553
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,440
It means you're the future of the country.

554
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,559
And you'll be the leader of our people.

555
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,839
Be a man, brother,

556
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,838
like our father.

557
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,120
Win the trust from our people.

558
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,160
And be a wise emperor.

559
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,160
Hao Du.

560
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,998
You found Leyan first.

561
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:55,799
Thank you.

562
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:00,600
Have you accompanied her all the time?

563
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,680
What do you mean?

564
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:04,559
Nothing.

565
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,239
I just felt regretful.

566
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:08,838
If I hadn't been recalled by his Majesty,

567
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,799
I might have been the one who found Leyan.

568
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,679
Does that matter?

569
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,880
It matters between you and me.

570
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,759
Is this because of Li Changge?

571
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,439
Protect the crown prince.

572
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,359
Don't lose his Highness again.

573
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,160
Hao Du.

574
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,640
Leyan wouldn't been left alone in the stage

575
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,200
if you didn't insist hunting Li Changge.

576
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,119
Are you finding yourself some excuses?

577
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,519
I can take the responsibility.

578
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,798
I just want you to know those who are obsessed with something

579
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,999
will easily get lost.

580
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,879
A'Bi.

581
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Mr. Situ.

582
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,239
What's wrong?

583
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,600
What has Changge done to you?

584
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,558
Not really.

585
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,679
Ever since she came into the house,

586
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,679
she hasn't slept or eaten anything.

587
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,879
I've checked her for several times, but she kept staring

588
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,959
at the writing on the wall.

589
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,479
She hasn't moved at all.

590
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,700
Is there something wrong with her?

591
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:24,919
Look at her.

592
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,200
She is just so stubborn.

593
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,199
I've told her she couldn't make it, she just didn't listen.

594
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,039
I'll check her out.

595
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,519
Good to see you, Mr. Situ.

596
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:37,599
Master.

597
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,759
Can I talk to her?

598
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:52,460
<i>[Non-interference]</i>

599
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,720
The night you came,

600
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,200
I was just passing by.

601
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,839
I saw you practicing swordsmanship in the middle of the night.

602
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:19,680
You've stayed in the silence room ever since you came to our temple.

603
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,479
Do you have any thoughts?

604
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,720
I've been taught by my teacher since childhood.

605
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,799
I've read books from all classes of authors.

606
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,520
I've never liked the thought of non-interference of Taoism.

607
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,920
To struggle with people, you can find your refuge.

608
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,319
To struggle with people, you can achieve your pursuit.

609
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,360
For all these years,

610
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,799
I've held a strong belief in it.

611
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,880
But in these few days,

612
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,200
I started to realize that

613
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,120
I was wrong.

614
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,519
If I hadn't struggled,

615
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,500
someone like my real brother wouldn't have died for me.

616
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:08,720
If I hadn't struggled,

617
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:10,679
someone who has treated me like his daughter

618
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,800
wouldn't have been died for me.

619
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,200
If I hadn't struggled,

620
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,750
someone who has given all he got to me wouldn't have been in danger,

621
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,400
while his dear family

622
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,319
wouldn't have died for me as well.

623
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,720
One senior saved my life,

624
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,079
and taught me to find my own Tao.

625
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,479
Non-interference.

626
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,279
This is the way.

627
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,440
God bless us all.

628
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,479
If you really think in this way, you've spent some good time

629
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:57,278
in this silence room.

630
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:58,759
What about now?

631
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,279
Dead people are gone forever.

632
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,160
I've wasted so much time on this.

633
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,719
It's really precious for us to be enlightened.

634
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,199
There are lots of refugees in Luoyang.

635
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,559
We're busy in helping those in need.

636
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,039
If you have time,

637
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,239
you can help me and Taoist Sun.

638
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,319
Everything in Taoism is about people.

639
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:29,120
We should appreciate the world we live in.

640
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,200
Dwelling in the past

641
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,079
will only bring you more troubles.

642
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,420
<i>[Non-interference]</i>

643
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:15,078
From the way she talks, master must know that

644
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:15,798
she is not an ordinary person.

645
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:19,519
Do you want to hear more about her story?

646
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,838
What are you talking about?

647
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,119
Things come and go.

648
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,600
People come and go too.

649
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,680
I've never asked.

650
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,078
But I do miss the old times.

651
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,440
When I was in her age,

652
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,799
I also regarded myself as the smartest person in the world.

653
00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:44,120
It seems that you and she have some connections.

654
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,719
Tell me about it.

655
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,318
In this world, we all come and go.

656
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,999
We share the same fate.

657
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,278
Will you come to South Hill with me tomorrow?

658
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:00,800
I heard that there are more refugees than we have here.

659
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,159
Sure.

660
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,440
If we can encounter some rare diseases, that'll be worth trying.

661
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:10,559
Have some tea.

662
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,359
I'm so glad to see you eat something.

663
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,838
I've been worried about you.

664
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,478
I heard that Taoist Sun has tried so hard to save you.

665
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,839
Would you like to get changed now?

666
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:50,159
Isn't it beautiful?

667
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,119
Liuyun Taoist Temple is the most beautiful place in Luoyang.

668
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,038
The one you just talked to is our master, Taoist Jingdan.

669
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,199
She has sheltered many refugees suffering from the drought.

670
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,440
She is such a nice person.

671
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,038
She wants to know your plan for the future.

672
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,399
Taoist Sun is going to stay in Luoyang for some days.

673
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,640
Are you going back to your hometown or staying here?

674
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,239
My hometown is somewhere I can never go back.

675
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,959
I'll stay.

676
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,078
That'll be great.

677
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,478
I've got a mate.

678
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:27,038
Except for us, Tian Jing and Liu'er also live here.

679
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,360
We're about the same age.

680
00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:30,759
We can be good friends.

681
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,599
I'm A'Bi from Family Wang.

682
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,559
What's your name?

683
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,999
Since Changge is no longer in Tang,

684
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,600
I'd avoid some troubles.

685
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,440
I've no family name.

686
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:48,759
Call me A'Li.
