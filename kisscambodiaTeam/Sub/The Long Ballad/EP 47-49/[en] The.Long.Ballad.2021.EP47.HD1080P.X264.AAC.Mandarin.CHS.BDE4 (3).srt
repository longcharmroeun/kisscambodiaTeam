00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,480
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,260
Episode 49

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,430
Shuyu

4
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,950
This way

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,190
Sometimes I will be impulsive and reckless

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,350
Sometimes misunderstanding you

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,510
Fortunately you have always been tolerant

8
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,270
And helping

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,550
I know what you don’t like to listen to

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,430
Polite words

11
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,070
But I really want to tell you

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,190
Thank you

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,030
Farewell today

14
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,350
I don’t know when we will meet

15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,470
Changge

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,710
Take care

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,750
Take care

18
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,510
Take good care of Changge

19
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,950
Wish you happiness

20
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,190
Brother Wei

21
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,790
Thanks a lot

22
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,590
A’Sun

23
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,510
You do think Mimi

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,750
Would she like it here

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,870
What if she don’t like it

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,950
When you dream of her

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,910
You can ask her

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,430
This place is beautiful, filled with greenery and water.

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,910
I think she will like it

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,270
Changge

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,870
When you went to save me in the royal city,

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,830
did you ever think that you would not be coming back?

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,310
Did you think about your life or dying
when trying to save me in Chang’an?

34
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,390
Actually

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,110
I saw the marriage proposal letter you wrote my mother.

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,030
Then...

37
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,270
What do you think

38
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,670
I think

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,030
I think

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,350
that between us there is no need for formal words on paper. 

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,030
As long as I have you in this lifetime, that’s enough.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,630
Me too

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,390
Having you in this life is more than enough.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,630
Right

45
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,190
How do you know General Li Jing?

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,710
Did you perhaps keep in contact with him after being brought to Dianxiang?

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,590
Actually

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,350
Before leaving Chang’an,
I made a promise with him

49
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,870
Brother Li

50
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,950
No

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,950
General Li

52
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,030
Brother Qin

53
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,750
We meet again

54
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,070
I’m afraid now

55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,310
I am inconvenient to get together with you

56
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,270
Brother

57
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,910
No harm no harm

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,390
Brother Qin

59
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,310
Do you remember

60
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,070
When parting in Luoyang

61
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,950
Did I give you a word?

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,750
A benevolent heart is invincible.

63
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,350
Not bad

64
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,430
But now Princess Yicheng

65
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,710
Coerce Khan

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,350
Ordered all tribes

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,070
Of the grassland and the desert

68
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,510
Playing in the palm of your hand

69
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,510
Abandon the people like a shoe

70
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,430
That the war is spreading

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,190
Life has been charcoal for a long time

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,670
You and I are in different camps

73
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,510
Grassland and the customs of the Central Plains

74
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,230
Also different

75
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,990
But the people are equally afraid of war

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,510
Desire to rise

77
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,350
I want to know

78
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,670
Can Brother Qin do it for

79
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,910
Common people

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,830
Abandon the opinion of the state

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,830
Xie Min Yu Hang Upside Down

82
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,830
I have a condition

83
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,870
Please tell me

84
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,430
I want to invite Great Tang

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,670
Help me rescue Khan Yanli

86
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,390
Good

87
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,030
I promise you

88
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,990
Although Ashile Chubi

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,990
Is strong and belligerent

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,190
Repeated confession

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,990
But after Wei River, we can still keep our promises

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,990
Not dying

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,110
Thank you Brother Li for being righteousness

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,870
Just now

95
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,310
I’m behind bars

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,710
Whether in Dingxiang

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,550
Or in the central plains

98
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,350
Have broken their way

99
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,710
Don’t know

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,350
How can I help the general

101
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,150
A hand

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,310
I need you back to Dingxiang

103
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,470
Command Eagle Division

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,830
But this matter will die forever

105
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,950
If you want to succeed

106
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,350
I’m afraid it’s harder than climbing to the sky

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,510
Ashile Sun

108
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,430
You tricked me and are still keeping secrets from me. 

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,750
Didn’t you learn anything? How dare you!

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,270
I don’t dare! I don’t dare! 

111
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,470
I won’t dare again in the future.

112
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,910
A’Sun

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,350
Do you like Chang’an?

114
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,670
Do you want to return to Chang’an?

115
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,070
It’s better not to,

116
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,710
there’s too many familiar people and it would be inconvenient.

117
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,950
Where do you want to go in the future?

118
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,870
Haven’t thought about it yet

119
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,710
A’Sun

120
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,470
Sorry

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,470
Originally I told you that I wanted to go far away from conflict,

122
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,310
live a free life without burdens

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,350
and see all the rivers and mountains under the heavens together.

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,070
However with the current problems before us

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,510
I do not think I could just let go and leave without regrets. 

126
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,990
The promise between us,
unfortunately will have to be delayed a little.

127
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,870
Changge

128
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,590
I have thought of the second promise I want.

129
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,030
Are you still bringing up those promises?

130
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,750
You should stop talking about it,

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,590
I think you should not bring up these promises.

132
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,030
Last time you told me your first wish and then got immediately shot by an arrow.

133
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,270
These promises are not lucky.

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,430
You should forget about them.

135
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,270
Trying to get out of what you promised originally. 

136
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,670
This is the first time I’ve seen you act this way.

137
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,470
I’m not trying to get out of our bargain.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,110
Okay fine, tell me.

139
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,630
This second promise

140
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,030
In the future I never want you to say sorry or thank you to me. 

141
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,310
Between us there are no need for words like these.

142
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,550
That’s it

143
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,110
This second promise

144
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,710
Isn’t this a bit too easy.

145
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,270
As long as you can do this,
then it’s fine.

146
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,870
Well then since we’re on the topic,
you may as well tell me your third promise.

147
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,710
The third promise

148
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,550
I’ll tell you in the future. 

149
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,110
The days ahead of us are still long.

150
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,990
Hao Du

151
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,110
Why are you here

152
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,510
The princess’s order cannot be violated

153
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,510
Isn’t your wedding coming soon?

154
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,670
Already worshipped

155
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,030
That’s good

156
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,350
Not right

157
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,070
Then you shouldn’t be here

158
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,230
I have to do this for Leyan

159
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,510
Protect the people she wants to protect

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,670
Alright alright

161
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,150
Prince Consort came

162
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,670
It’s also like a tiger with wings

163
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,390
Report

164
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,790
Speak

165
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,390
The East Road scout came to report

166
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,350
Bai Dao found traces of the Dingxiang Army

167
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,310
It seems that Yicheng

168
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,670
I want to break through the white road through the breach

169
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,870
Send a letter to Li Ji immediately

170
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,670
Block the enemy from the front

171
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,350
Flanking me back and forth

172
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,750
General Li

173
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,270
You sent two scouts to scout

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,390
But this other way

175
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,110
Not returned so far

176
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,030
Is it possible

177
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,590
What’s possible

178
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,670
The scout did not send a letter

179
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,630
Does not represent this direction

180
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,790
There must be no enemy

181
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,710
It’s also possible that the scout is attacked

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,910
Can’t come back

183
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,230
Like this

184
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,910
I will take Eagle Division to see

185
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,030
So you don’t have to

186
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,190
Delayed the army’s strength

187
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,110
I’ll let you go

188
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,430
No way

189
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,430
This is just my guess

190
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,150
May return without success

191
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,190
Maybe

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,110
Will you be in danger

193
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,990
You stay

194
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,830
By General Li’s side

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,230
Advise him

196
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,830
But

197
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,830
Princess

198
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,670
I’m afraid I can’t let you go

199
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,390
I wait to lead the army away

200
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,710
No one left in the main camp

201
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,190
Important news

202
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,590
Must be handled

203
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,510
Otherwise I can’t deal with it

204
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,990
For fear of losing the military opportunity

205
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,430
Prince Consort is brave and good at fighting

206
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,750
I don’t know if I can stay

207
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,430
Stay with the princess in the main camp

208
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,430
Handle everything

209
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,270
If there is an emergency

210
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,990
You two can work together

211
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,350
Act in a mechanistic manner

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,990
Changge will live up to the General’s entrustment

213
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,990
Will live up to the General’s trust

214
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,350
Did not expect

215
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,830
The horse riots back then

216
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,550
The arrogant little princess

217
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,990
Now carry the banner

218
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,270
Guarding the country

219
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,590
Along the way

220
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,350
The princess has worked hard

221
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,590
General flatter me

222
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,270
I just want to do it all

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,070
Meager force

224
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,430
Help the world peace

225
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,950
Yicheng is very cunning

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,310
Be very careful

227
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,310
Rest assured

228
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,430
She is the end of the war

229
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,830
This time

230
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,790
We must do it for Great Tang

231
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,390
And the whole grassland

232
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,830
Eliminate evil

233
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,030
Sun

234
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,070
I will go with you

235
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,390
Mu Jin

236
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,470
You just...

237
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,310
I am your brother

238
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,790
Am also the Eagle Division’s Military Counselor

239
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,390
How can a coach meet the enemy

240
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,830
The truth of warfare

241
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,390
There are chasers

242
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,030
There are still a lot of people

243
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,950
Turuk

244
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,550
Take Young Khan and go first

245
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,830
I’ll take care of the rest

246
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,390
Wait

247
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,270
Resolution

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,070
Kill more people?

249
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,910
Young Khan can’t kill people

250
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,710
Can live

251
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,590
After all by us

252
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,550
These subordinates do it for you

253
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,230
I will do the wicked

254
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,910
Be a good person

255
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,590
If you really do it for Mother

256
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,790
Stop here

257
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,390
Reduce sin

258
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,270
Your mother is really in vain

259
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,230
Your son

260
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,110
Scram

261
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,630
Turuk

262
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,950
Let’s go, Young Khan

263
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,470
Our good luck

264
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,950
It seems Heaven

265
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,990
Still on our side

266
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,430
What luck

267
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,510
I’m afraid you don’t count today

268
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,750
God has eyes

269
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,110
Let you wait here

270
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,710
Want revenge

271
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,630
Show your skills

272
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,950
Sun

273
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,790
You go first

274
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,950
This person

275
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,110
Leave him to me

276
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,630
Okay

277
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,910
Stop them

278
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,430
Go

279
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,470
She’er

280
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,190
A’Sun

281
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,630
I said

282
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,710
I won’t go with you

283
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,910
And never

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,350
Surrender to you Ashile Sun

285
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,710
Like you

286
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,990
Won’t surrender to me

287
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,870
Everyone back down

288
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,510
Don’t understand

289
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,910
Yes

290
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,470
You won’t understand

291
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,270
Why did Mimi die?

292
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,470
Not because of your arrow

293
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,310
But for freedom

294
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,870
Someone like you

295
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,950
Only knows to obey orders

296
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,910
Trample on human life

297
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,830
Even one’s own life

298
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,230
Don’t even know who I cherish

299
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,950
Don’t understand

300
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,430
Not an order

301
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,590
Entrusted by others

302
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,750
Keep promise

303
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,150
She’er

304
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,270
Must this be the case

305
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,270
What

306
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,710
I released you in Dingxiang

307
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,790
You are moved

308
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,510
Tens of millions in a while

309
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,470
Don’t show mercy

310
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,150
Admit it

311
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,150
You are the one with a soft heart

312
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,030
You

313
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,470
Why

314
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,110
I’m tired

315
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,990
There is only your knife in this world

316
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,470
To be worthy of my blood

317
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,510
She’er

318
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,150
Don’t be because of other people’s fault

319
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,950
Punish yourself

320
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,070
You are innocent

321
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,750
I’ll pay for Mother’s sin

322
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,550
Sun promised me

323
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,030
Let go of the brothers of Wolf Division

324
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,310
They are the fighters of Ashile Tribe

325
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,590
Shouldn’t fight for Dingxiang

326
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,790
You are Young Khan

327
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,430
Take them with you

328
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,590
Have lived a free life

329
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,590
A’Sun

330
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,310
I still want to fight you

331
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,350
Drink wine together

332
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,750
I don’t know if there is any chance

333
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,310
There will be

334
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,870
Wait till the war subsides

335
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,430
The grassland re-grows new shoots

336
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,310
We will definitely see you again

337
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,910
Go west

338
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,950
The farther the better

339
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,750
Wolf Division

340
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,630
Release Wolf Division

341
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,390
Go

342
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,110
General Du

343
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,630
The enemy set up an ambush at Qikou and blocked the mountain

344
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,750
Has been broken by General Li

345
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,790
Now the two armies are fighting

346
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,990
Scout again

347
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,790
Yes

348
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,030
General Li is so fast

349
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,910
Sui Dynasty

350
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,670
My second uncle hits the world

351
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,150
What is seeking is a rule of word

352
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,630
The history of Governor Gongsun has been like a day for decades

353
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,750
Guarding Liuzhou

354
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,390
What is asking for is a keeping word

355
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,630
But this General Li is different

356
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,590
Zhan Guiqisu

357
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,350
He used a word for illness

358
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,030
Kill

359
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,710
General Du

360
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,430
The heads of the various ministries accompany the felt carts

361
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,670
Escape from the west’ side mountain road

362
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,350
General Li couldn’t get out for a while

363
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,190
Need cavalry support

364
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,110
Let me go

365
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,390
Never let Yicheng get away

366
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,870
Bring more people and be careful

367
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,390
How about Eagle Division

368
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,910
Eagle Division is in Wudu Valley

369
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,030
Catch up with the enemy branch

370
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,750
The enemy leader Lei Meng has died

371
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,550
Tegin of Eagle Division has bypassed the besieged

372
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,630
Ashle Young Khan

373
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,070
Good. Explore again

374
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,670
Yes

375
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,870
Not good, go!

376
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,150
Everybody

377
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,150
Great Tang alliances with various tribes

378
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,750
For common prosperity

379
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,590
For long-term well-being

380
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,870
Yicheng encumbers you

381
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,150
It’s just her own selfish desires

382
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,830
Are you guys

383
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,070
Want to continue working for her?

384
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,750
I have no intention of being an enemy of you

385
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,990
If you stop the war here

386
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,550
You can disarm and return to the field

387
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,710
Go home to take care of his wife, children and parents

388
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,390
You can also make your tribe

389
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,670
Continue to live in herds of cattle and sheep

390
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,670
Living by the water and grass

391
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,750
If you are stubborn

392
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,110
Continue to ignite this border war

393
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,710
We, Great Tang

394
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,270
Vow not to give in

395
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,910
Vow not to give in

396
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,750
Vow not to give in

397
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,630
Vow not to give in

398
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,270
Vow not to give in

399
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,150
Vow not to give in

400
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,310
Vow not to give in

401
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,470
Vow not to give in

402
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,150
Going home to raise a child

403
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,310
Whoever wants to fight

404
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,630
Go

405
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,110
Then we won’t fight anymore

406
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,670
Report

407
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,190
Our army wins

408
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,310
General Li returns to camp

409
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,830
Congratulations to the general for breaking the enemy

410
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,110
General please rest assured

411
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,470
Hao Du has gone to arrest someone

412
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,910
He will never let Yicheng get away

413
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,030
Well done

414
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,350
Hao Du

415
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,830
Did you catch her?

416
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,030
All the leaders have surrendered

417
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,710
But Yicheng is not in the carriage at all

418
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,990
Not in position

419
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,710
Don’t flee by carriage

420
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,510
Where is she

421
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,870
Maybe she even thought of fleeing

422
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,110
Are you here to laugh at me

423
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,310
I’m just scared

424
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,030
I almost walked on

425
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,030
The same path as you

426
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,990
Useless

427
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,550
In order to achieve one’s own purpose

428
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,470
The agency is exhausted

429
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,270
Killed countless people

430
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,950
If so

431
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,070
I would rather be a waste

432
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,470
You won’t understand

433
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,990
You will never understand

434
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,150
I am the princess of Great Sui

435
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,630
I was born and grew up in the Great Sui

436
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,150
That is my homeland

437
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,910
I have to save it

438
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,550
It’s still there in your hometown

439
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,630
It didn’t disappear

440
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,630
Its land is still

441
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,190
Its people are still there

442
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,190
Besides you hurt

443
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,350
All its people

444
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,630
Just disappeared

445
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,990
The glory of the royal family

446
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,630
Are these honors so important?

447
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,670
Royal family

448
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,950
What a royal family

449
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,510
I’m just a clan girl

450
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,110
I am born

451
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,790
The most glorious day

452
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,470
I was made a princess

453
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,590
That day

454
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,070
I have never been in the palace

455
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,070
Never wore

456
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,030
Such a gorgeous dress

457
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,750
Praised by thousands

458
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,750
A hundred officials welcome

459
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,870
They said from today

460
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,750
I am the princess of Great Sui

461
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,670
Great Sui

462
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,070
Need me to go to the grassland and marry

463
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,030
Today

464
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,030
You are your company

465
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,910
Lei Meng

466
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,190
I will do my best

467
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,470
To guard Her Highness

468
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,710
Until death

469
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,310
I promised

470
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,750
This is my glory

471
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,950
Also my destiny

472
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,950
I am the princess of Great Sui

473
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,030
I am willing to dedicate everything for it

474
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,990
I am willing to dedicate everything for Yi

475
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,030
I don’t need your sympathy

476
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,590
I don’t need anyone’s mercy

477
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,790
Those so-called royal ladies

478
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,150
Even the princes

479
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,670
Not as good as me

480
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,030
They knelt down and begged for mercy

481
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,630
Begging for mercy

482
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,270
In order to survive

483
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,790
Leave the country behind

484
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,110
Only me

485
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,990
Thirty years

486
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,630
Only me

487
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,870
I am trapped on the grassland

488
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,790
Haven’t abandoned Great Sui yet

489
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,150
Come back

490
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,150
Great Sui is gone

491
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,950
Where can I go back

492
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,750
Hometown is still there

493
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,830
Chang’an is still there

494
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,750
Daxing Palace is still there

495
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,750
Fuli’s Tree

496
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,270
Was planted during the reign of Emperor Kaihuang in the Great Sui Dynasty

497
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,950
When I was young, my friends and I

498
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,150
Climb trees often

499
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,110
Rely on it to skip class

500
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,950
As long as you are willing to come back

501
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,990
Owned to Chang’an

502
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,950
I understand what the second uncle is like

503
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,590
He won’t kill you

504
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,990
If I am willing to bend my knees to survive

505
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,710
How can you go this way

506
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,790
Even if it’s you Li Changge

507
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,270
Will you return to Chang’an?

508
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,430
Yes

509
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,270
I thought wrong

510
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,110
This life

511
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,750
Just a humiliating joke

512
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,790
I won’t ask anyone for forgiveness

513
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,470
But I still want to thank you

514
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,830
Staying with me on this last journey

515
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,550
Grandmother

516
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,070
This is Chang’an

517
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,270
Yes

518
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,070
We are home

519
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,630
Father

520
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,750
Father

521
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,470
Dingxiang won

522
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,390
Yinshan won

523
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,590
Father

524
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,390
Rest assured

525
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,790
I will take good care of Leyan

526
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,670
Father

527
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,790
Both Hao Du and I will be fine

528
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,150
You can have a good rest now

529
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,550
Condolences, Your Majesty

530
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,470
Was she in pain

531
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,550
Does Your Majesty mean Li Changge?

532
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,750
The princess has aspirations

533
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,390
Under the Nine Springs

534
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,590
Enough to rest assured

535
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,990
Good

536
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,950
Did she say anything

537
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,710
She said

538
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,390
She is very grateful to Your Majesty

539
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,510
What else did she say

540
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,110
She also said

541
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,590
She likes to read

542
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,110
In the future every year during the Cold Food Festival

543
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,950
Burn more books for her

544
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,630
I watched Princess Yongning grow up

545
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,110
I didn’t know

546
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,390
She actually likes reading

547
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,110
She doesn’t like reading

548
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,950
Doesn’t look like it

549
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,670
Li Yaoshi

550
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,230
Do you know what the crime of deceiving the emperor is

551
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,150
This minister knows he is guilty

552
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,350
But Li Changge, that girl

553
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,590
This minister was forced to be helpless too

554
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,350
Get up

555
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,390
What happened

556
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,710
Changge

557
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,790
Changge

558
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,270
Didn’t you promise me?

559
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,310
No more

560
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,990
No more trespassing alone

561
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,910
Know that I’m not waiting for my return

562
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,670
Just rush in

563
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,990
I know it’s wrong

564
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,350
Don’t be angry

565
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,310
Princess

566
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,550
The princess really doesn’t to follow me

567
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,870
To return to Chang’an?

568
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,470
General Li, what are you talking about?

569
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,630
Everything is already

570
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,070
Disappeared with the fire

571
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,950
Where did the princess come from?

572
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,150
Really determined

573
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,990
I am really

574
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,030
I lost my apprentice and broke down

575
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,110
General Li

576
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,870
If His Majesty asks after going back

577
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,510
You just let him

578
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,910
Erased my name from history books

579
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,270
Since then, there will be no more Li Changge

580
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,910
General Li

581
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,070
I don’t know anything

582
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,430
Then where are you two planning to go

583
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,470
General don’t ask where

584
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,950
Come and go anyway

585
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,110
All under this world

586
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,390
No one can escape

587
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,150
If His Majesty asks

588
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,670
Just tell him

589
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,310
Do whatever we want

590
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,950
Good

591
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,830
Maybe

592
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,350
We will meet again someday

593
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,830
Changge

594
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,870
This way, Great Tang

595
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,630
Is what you want in your heart

596
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,790
To

597
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,550
Then more I understand

598
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,030
Country’s peace

599
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,710
Thousands of common families live, work in peace and contentment

600
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,590
Country’s rich and power

601
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,830
Common people have no fear

602
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,950
Past honors and disgrace belong to the ego

603
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,590
Till now

604
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,830
Finally able to let go

605
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,790
Now politics

606
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,350
Favor people’s livelihood

607
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,830
Chang

608
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,150
The whole world

609
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,030
Big. Look at the Zun of the Prosperous Age

610
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:28,950
Thank you

611
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,470
Lives up to Great Tang

612
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,630
Live up to the common people
