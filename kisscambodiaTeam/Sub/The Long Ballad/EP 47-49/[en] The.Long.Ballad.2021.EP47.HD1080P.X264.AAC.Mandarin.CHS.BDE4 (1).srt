00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,480
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,260
Episode 47

3
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,919
Your appetite is not small

4
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,839
I can promise you the first one

5
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,039
Of curing Mu Jin

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,359
As for your Father Khan

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,679
Then wait for the Eagle Division

8
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,079
To win the battle for me

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,519
I will naturally let

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,039
You father and son are reunited

11
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,039
You finally admitted

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,999
Father Khan’s illness is caused by you

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,679
Saying all this

14
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,919
Does it make any sense?

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,439
He is responsible for all this

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,999
I want him to sit on the throne

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,159
I had blood on my hands

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,879
Could it be that

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,439
During that time, Khan Shule

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,479
Was also your doing?

21
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,319
As a married woman

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,759
There is not much way I can walk

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,039
You killed She’er father

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,079
Have you considered his feelings

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,759
When have you cared about She’er so much

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,959
My son’s business

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,559
No need to worry about you

28
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,959
Mother

29
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,039
Mother

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,239
You clearly told me

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,839
Father had an illness

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,039
Why are you here

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,039
You tell me

34
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,439
As long as I am sincere

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,999
And pray to Sirius

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,919
Sirius will not take Father

37
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,559
I kneel by the river every day

38
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,719
Secretly pray to the Sirius God

39
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,039
To make Father get better

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,639
Let Father not leave us behind

41
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,119
Mother, speak up

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,239
I remember when I was young

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,679
Father always told me

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,479
We are men

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,279
We want to protect Mother

46
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,439
Be good to Mother

47
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,999
It’s you

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,119
If want the stars in the sky

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,359
He will also pick it for you

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,359
Mother

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,679
Why

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,999
With your father

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,039
There is Khan Yanli

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,679
I can’t

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,879
Come back to my homeland

56
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,959
Impossible to revive the Great Sui

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,839
But the grassland is also your home

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,679
Great Sui is gone

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,759
Shut up

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,799
The grassland is your home

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,719
But it’s just my cage

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,079
I am Great Sui’s daughter

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,039
As long as I’m alive

64
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,879
It can’t die

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,199
I have been away for so long

66
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,599
Walked so far

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,199
Our Great Sui

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,919
Will rebirth soon

69
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,919
Just around the corner

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,839
You are crazy

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,399
You are crazy

72
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,599
You are crazy

73
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,479
So you have been lying to me

74
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,159
Keep lying to me

75
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,839
Why

76
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,719
Someone

77
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,199
Yes

78
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,279
Send Young Khan back to his room

79
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,279
Carefully watch him

80
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,799
Don’t understand what you are doing?

81
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,559
Yes

82
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,559
Congratulations, Prince Consort Du

83
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,719
Don’t be so polite

84
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,919
Call me Hao Du

85
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,959
Hao Du, where’s Princess?

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,799
Brother Shuyu

87
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,079
Why are you here

88
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,239
I thought it was Changge

89
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,359
I’m here to you give things from Changge

90
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,279
This fan is from Changge

91
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,879
Embroidered by hand day and night

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,039
Is for you

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,599
And Prince Consort’s wedding gift

94
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,319
Where is Changge

95
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,839
Gone

96
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,319
She is afraid to say goodbye

97
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,519
Especially with you

98
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,479
So ask me to pass this gift

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,919
She told me

100
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,999
To her, you will always be

101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,119
A bunny in heart

102
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,159
You must be happy

103
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,399
This mandarin duck is from me

104
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,519
Hao Du

105
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,679
Leyan is my forever sister

106
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,119
You can’t bully her

107
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,559
If she is unhappy

108
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,599
I will take her away

109
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,319
Rest assured

110
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,239
You won’t have this chance

111
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,519
Hao Du

112
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,159
I’m so scared

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,599
I will never see Changge again

114
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,479
Rest assured

115
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,359
I have inquired about

116
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,359
You father dispatched Li Jing

117
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,599
To led troops to Dingxiang

118
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,359
He is the one my father recommend

119
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,599
Plus Changge’s shrewdness

120
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,279
They will be fine

121
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,639
Leyan

122
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,079
I have a request

123
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,959
Between you and me

124
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,479
No need to say this

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,919
My father’s body

126
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,239
Is getting worse day by day

127
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,719
His greatest wish

128
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,519
Is to see us get married

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,999
If he can’t hold on to that day

130
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,399
I understand

131
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,319
Let’s go to Du Manor first

132
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,079
Hold a small ceremony

133
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,719
No princes and nobles

134
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,879
Only you and me

135
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,439
And Father

136
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,359
But I’m afraid I wronged you

137
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,759
Not wronged

138
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,119
To fulfill Father’s wish

139
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,999
Leyan thinks it’s worth it

140
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,799
Li Shimin has appointed

141
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,839
Minister of War, Li Jing

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,439
Head of the march for Dingxiang

143
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,999
General Li Jing

144
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,679
As the general manager of Tonghan Road

145
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,199
Huazhou Governor Chai Shao

146
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,839
Chief of the March of Jinhe Road

147
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,719
Lingzhou Governor Xue Wanche

148
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,519
As the Chief of Chang Budo Marching

149
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,239
All generals belong to Li Jing’s temperance

150
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,079
Arrived at Yang Mountain yesterday

151
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,599
How many soldiers and horses are there?

152
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,639
More than a hundred thousand people

153
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,479
There are many subordinate tribes in the Ashile Tribe

154
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,319
If you recruit all the troops and horses

155
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,359
We may not necessarily lose to that Li Jing

156
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,039
How was the war on the western front?

157
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,239
Yesterday Ashile Yugu

158
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,119
Defeated by the leader of Mobei

159
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,479
Monan Chief Yinan

160
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,759
Has united the ministries of the desert

161
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,679
Defeated so far

162
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,079
Ashile Tribe’s four armies

163
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,959
Four generals were captured alive

164
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,959
Although several other units promised to send troops

165
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,639
There is still no movement

166
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,159
I guess

167
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,679
Guess what

168
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,319
They have been bribed

169
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,679
How’s Mu Jin injury?

170
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,679
As the princess ordered

171
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,199
Mu Jin is healing

172
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,039
He can get out of bed without a serious problem

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,399
Good

174
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,839
Can let the master and servant meet

175
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,079
You go to prison

176
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,399
Bring Ashile Sun

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,679
Before letting him see Mu Jin

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,679
Let him see Yanli first

179
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,039
Princess

180
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,879
Yanli looks like this now

181
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,439
If Ashile Sun see this

182
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,759
Will it be bad?

183
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,239
In Dingxiang

184
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,199
Ashile Sun is most concerned about

185
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,919
is Mu Jin

186
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,039
and Yanli

187
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,039
If I don’t let him see

188
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,119
How could he be willing to use by me

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,719
No problem

190
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,719
I just want him to see

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,199
His Father Khan

192
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,559
How to master

193
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,039
In the palm of my hand

194
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,599
Yes

195
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,399
Father Khan, I’m late

196
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,519
Father

197
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,839
It’s me A’Sun

198
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,719
Father wait for me to get you

199
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,039
Don’t look at him anymore

200
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,399
Don’t worry

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,639
I won’t kill him

202
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,399
Remember what you said

203
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,399
Otherwise

204
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,959
I’ll take the Eagle Division to level Dingxiang

205
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,559
Then trouble A’Sun

206
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,239
To write a military order

207
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,439
Give it to Mu Jin

208
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,199
I only give you five days

209
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,399
Five days later

210
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,599
I want Eagle Division

211
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,279
In front of the Chengqi Gate of the royal palace

212
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,159
All assembled and obeyed

213
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,039
I will then cure

214
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,239
Your Father Khan

215
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,439
Careful

216
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,479
Sun

217
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,799
I knew it was you

218
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,959
Mu Jin

219
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,919
I’m late

220
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,079
How can they treat you this way

221
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,559
These are not important anymore

222
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,679
I’m still alive

223
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,519
They actually sent Commander Lei to monitor

224
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,839
You suffer

225
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,599
Brothers don’t talk about this

226
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,399
Sun, why are you here

227
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,279
You and Father Khan are in Dingxiang

228
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,719
How could I

229
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,639
Stay alone in Great Tang

230
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,999
What about Mimi

231
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,199
Mimi is here too

232
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,279
But she still can’t see us

233
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,799
I have seen Buzhen

234
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,559
Ashile Sun

235
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,279
Khatun sent you here

236
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,119
For business purposes

237
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,959
Mu Jin

238
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,119
This is a military order written by me

239
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,319
Bring it

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,119
Assemble Eagle Division

241
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,319
What

242
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,639
She’er

243
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,839
It’s so late

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,239
Why are you coming to me

245
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,239
You say

246
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,959
Am I the whole world

247
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,319
Stupidest fool

248
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,879
I’ll help you go back since you drank too much

249
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,119
You

250
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,679
You say

251
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,159
Am I the most stupid fool

252
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,919
My mother killed my father

253
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,519
Uncle Khan deliberately killed my wolf

254
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,199
To separate me and Sun

255
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,119
Now Mother poisoned Uncle Khan

256
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,239
And I just found out all this now

257
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,759
What

258
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,799
What do they dare to do

259
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,279
Don’t let me talk

260
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,679
All liars are liars

261
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,839
They all lie to me

262
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,319
Take care

263
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:12,999
Go

264
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,919
You woke up

265
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,279
Why am I here

266
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,319
You drank too much last night

267
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,999
Come and drink some water

268
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,799
Thank you

269
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,039
What do you look at me

270
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,919
You

271
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,519
You are so nice

272
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,799
She’er

273
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,079
I know you keep taking me

274
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,999
Be friends

275
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,279
But after all, our identities are very different

276
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,599
If khatun knew

277
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,279
Last night you were here

278
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,919
I’m going to be scolded again

279
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,479
Sorry I’m leaving now

280
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,119
I don’t know why

281
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,039
I came to you suddenly

282
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,199
Maybe I think you are safest here

283
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,079
So

284
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,159
If you are in a bad mood

285
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,639
You can still come to me

286
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,959
Thank you

287
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,039
Do you remember me telling you

288
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,439
To wait for me to become a Khan

289
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,999
I would marry you and be my Khatun

290
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,199
She’er

291
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,279
But now

292
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,319
I don’t want to be a Great Khan

293
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,719
Are you afraid of me dying?

294
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,479
No

295
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,759
Father will definitely be happy

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,719
It’s getting worse and worse

297
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,479
Acting on one’s own initiative

298
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,999
You hurriedly manage the marriage in advance

299
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,119
I’m not afraid of wronging the princess

300
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,239
Leyan said she would not be wrong

301
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,479
And I have already pleaded with His Majesty

302
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,879
His Majesty has approved

303
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,039
Keep everything simple

304
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,319
The princess is afraid of your embarrassment

305
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,839
To marry such a caring wife

306
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,159
Blessing

307
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,799
Yes

308
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,919
I must treat the princess well

309
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,079
Be loyal to His Majesty

310
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,999
Then, Father

311
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,479
Do you have any relatives or friends

312
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,719
I want to watch the ceremony together

313
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,039
Since you have decided to keep everything simple

314
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,439
Then our own family

315
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,159
Reunion is enough

316
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,439
Besides, my sick body

317
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,679
You don’t have to let your relatives and friends add obstacles

318
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,399
Nothing more

319
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,959
Father

320
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,919
You will get better

321
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,839
I know my body

322
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,679
But you

323
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,679
Follow Li Jing to attack Dingxiang

324
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,879
How good is it

325
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,599
Opportunities to make contributions

326
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,919
But you gave it up for me

327
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,559
Don’t think I don’t know

328
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,079
There is only one Father

329
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,319
There are many more opportunities to make contributions

330
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,679
I just don’t want to let myself

331
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,639
To

332
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,319
And said I’m not afraid of my death

333
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,839
I heard that Li Changge also went to Dingxiang

334
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,999
Yes

335
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,679
After the wedding

336
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,199
You leave for Dingxiang immediately

337
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,839
If Li Changge is dead

338
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,719
How do you explain to the princess

339
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,519
But Father, your body

340
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,999
You don’t have to worry about me

341
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,519
You arrange the marriage ahead of time

342
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,959
It’s already considered filial piety

343
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,359
Now is the extraordinary period

344
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,479
You must be loyal to His Majesty

345
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,079
Also the princess

346
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,879
Protect the people she cares about

347
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,479
This is what you should do as a husband

348
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,999
I understand

349
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,439
Then, Father

350
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,679
You must wait for me to come back

351
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,999
Dingxiang has no results

352
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,079
Father will not die

353
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,479
You never thought about

354
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,639
Letting me lead my troops

355
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,959
You just want to borrow my hand

356
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,119
To assemble Eagle Divisio

357
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,279
Great method Khatun

358
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,999
All’s fair in war

359
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,039
Tegin is a person who has been on the battlefield for a long time

360
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,479
Naturally should understand this

361
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,279
Wait until the battle is over

362
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,639
I will allow you

363
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,799
To personally meet the Eagle Division’s triumph

364
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,559
If you are a man

365
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,839
Not afraid of the consequences

366
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,799
Listen

367
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,039
The army should be here

368
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,399
They gathering at the gate of the palace

369
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,119
Take a guess

370
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,599
Who will swear the oath?

371
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,559
You make my father sick

372
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,639
Too sick to speak

373
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,959
How would he issue the order

374
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,039
As long as he is there

375
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,839
I am your Father Khan’s mouth

376
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,959
Why don’t we see Tegin coming out?

377
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,399
What’s wrong with Great Khan

378
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,319
This should be ask of Khatun

379
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,319
Wait a while

380
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,119
Everything goes according to plan

381
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,919
Roast over fire

382
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,039
Save Khan and seek Li Jing

383
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,239
Don’t worry about me

384
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,839
Where are we going?

385
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,999
Go to meet a general of Tang

386
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,759
Go

387
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,479
Go

388
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,079
Go

389
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,919
Princess

390
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,079
Why is it noisy outside

391
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,239
What happened

392
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,479
The Eagle Division defected and rescued Great Khan

393
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,119
They have gone out of town

394
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,119
What

395
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,879
Ashile Sun

396
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,359
It’s you

397
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,639
All’s fair in war

398
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,679
Princess

399
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,079
I was blinded by an eagle after all

400
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,279
You pretend to be tricked

401
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,879
To save Yanli

402
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,239
You are a woman

403
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,319
Naturally unable to show up to the oath

404
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,599
You won’t let She’er go

405
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,159
Won’t let me go

406
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,279
So

407
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,119
You can only show Great Khan

408
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,239
Good for Ashile Sun

409
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,039
He really is not afraid of death

410
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,719
Even if I don’t do these

411
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,879
Will you still let me go

412
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,319
Here

413
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,599
Pass on my order

414
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,759
Notify the grassland tribes

415
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,799
Eagle Division rebelled

416
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,919
Kidnapped Great Khan

417
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,519
Dingxiang cavalry can’t catch up

418
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,479
Great Khan died at the hands of Eagle Division

419
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,879
The token of Great Khan

420
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,559
Is in my hands

421
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,999
Order on my behalf

422
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,479
Yes

423
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,359
Also

424
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,519
Notify Ashile Tribe

425
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,119
Leaders of the subordinates

426
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,239
To depart for Dingxiang now

427
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,879
To arrive three days later at noon

428
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,239
Other I will kill a hundred

429
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,079
Obey

430
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,399
It’s a good one to kill a hundred

431
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,159
But since I came to Dingxiang

432
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,999
I never wanted to live

433
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,799
Even if you slander and suppress

434
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,879
That’s better than

435
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,079
Being your lackey

436
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,359
Rest assured

437
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,439
I won’t let you die in vain

438
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,239
I want to show each tribe

439
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,399
What is the end result of betraying me

440
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,199
Changge

441
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,799
If I could

442
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,839
I really want to stay forever

443
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,999
Always with you

444
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,479
But

445
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,239
I’m going to have to break my promise

446
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,799
Xixin Tribe is here

447
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,119
The people from various tribes are here too

448
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,199
Young Master

449
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,799
Why do you hit someone when you meet?

450
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,039
Why are you here

451
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,359
I told him

452
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,879
Don’t scold me

453
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,319
If it wasn’t for you

454
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,159
Leaving without notice

455
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,719
I won’t be like this

456
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,279
I think about it

457
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,399
I just can’t rest easy

458
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,959
That’s why I told him

459
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,319
Princess Tuja did the right thing

460
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,319
Young Master

461
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,159
Why are you alone

462
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,919
Come here to take a risk

463
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,839
I was so anxious to receive the news

464
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,079
I left the brothers of Yanxing Sect

465
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,959
And went ahead

466
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,679
Shiba is with Situ Langlang

467
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,679
They should be here soon

468
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,479
Shuyu

469
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,079
General Li and I

470
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,399
I want to help you

471
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,039
I didn’t expect to meet your friend

472
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,159
Know you are here

473
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,199
That’s great

474
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,719
We can advance and retreat together

475
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,679
Same tribulation

476
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,799
Of course

477
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,799
Friends should share blessings and difficulties

478
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,679
Don’t worry

479
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,079
This time we are all on your side

480
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,039
Will definitely help you

481
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,319
Saved your beloved one

482
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,039
Thank you all

483
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,159
So what do we do now

484
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,279
The first thing we need to do is the city gate

485
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,559
And with so many of us

486
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,479
We have to think of

487
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,439
A better way

488
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,599
Isn’t it just entering a city?

489
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,639
I’m good at this

490
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,119
This

491
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,639
Once upon orders

492
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,919
The Ashile Tribes

493
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,799
Will award one

494
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,559
Such token

495
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,319
To show allegiance

496
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,319
Just by this

497
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,519
You can also get in and out of the Khan’s Tent

498
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,839
You stole your Father’s token

499
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,839
Without it

500
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,159
How can I take you to the city?

501
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,039
Say it again

502
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,639
I take my father’s things

503
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,479
Why is it called stealing?

504
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,239
I just borrow it

505
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,919
Anyway, I won’t need it anymore

506
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,039
A piece of scrap iron

507
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,719
Everyone, let’s go

508
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,439
Kowtow

509
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,639
Get up

510
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,359
Rise

511
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,319
I

512
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,158
Right now

513
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,399
I feel as if

514
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,678
I’m dreaming

515
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,999
I can’t believe it

516
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,839
It’s true

517
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,919
From now on

518
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,239
I’m your wife

519
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,439
The two of us will never part

520
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,599
Until death

521
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,198
Then, wife

522
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,879
I swear too

523
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,479
Wedding night

524
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,039
Don’t say such unlucky words

525
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,759
I believe you

526
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,799
But

527
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,879
After tonight

528
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,519
I’m going to Dingxiang

529
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,479
You must go

530
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,039
But you must promise me

531
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,359
Protect yourself

532
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,239
Protect Changge

533
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,039
Assist Duke Li

534
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,799
Eradicate Yicheng

535
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,519
Father and I are waiting for you to come back

536
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,599
I will listen to everything you say

537
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,279
Where’s Xu Feng

538
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,439
He went to find out the news

539
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,039
No matter where he is

540
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,119
The city will have news

541
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,319
I have the most important thing

542
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,919
To give to you

543
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,199
And you have to do it

544
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,159
What’s the matter

545
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,959
You go buy some flour

546
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,959
Fruit kernel butter

547
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,239
All the materials for the moon cakes

548
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,199
Buy some more Kongming lanterns

549
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,639
This is the most important thing

550
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,479
Changge, what are you doing

551
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,079
Secret contact

552
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,279
Young Master

553
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,479
I know why the leaders

554
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,439
Are called into the city

555
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,719
Mimi

556
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,719
She’er, why are you here?

557
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,319
It’s bad

558
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,759
Khatun summoned the leaders of various tribes into the city

559
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,919
Tomorrow noon

560
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,399
To behead Ashile Sun

561
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,999
As a warning to others

562
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,079
What

563
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,919
No way

564
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,599
I will never let Sun die

565
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,399
What do you think

566
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,319
Khatun’s temper

567
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,039
Don’t you know

568
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,999
The decision she made

569
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,399
Who can change it

570
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,959
Who is so unlucky

571
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,639
Why Kongming lantern is lit on non-festivals

572
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,439
Mimi

573
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,559
Does She’er want to eat Yuetuan?

574
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,439
What

575
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,119
Great Khan is entrusted to General

576
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,079
Rest assured

577
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,359
I have a gentleman’s appointment with Brother Qin

578
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,799
Surely Khan’s life will be saved

579
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,159
Thanks a lot

580
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,599
Young Master won’t stay

581
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,399
Where else are you going?

582
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,519
The task is completed

583
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,919
I still have a personal matter to deal with

584
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,239
You guys

585
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,359
Mu Jin, you are too interesting

586
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,399
We’re brothers

587
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,999
You didn’t tell us

588
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,599
You are the only one who can save Tegin?

589
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,839
Just

590
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,559
Are you

591
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,719
Look down on your brothers?

592
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,199
Go

593
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,799
There are orders

594
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,879
Palace members are not allowed to go out

595
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,039
Misters

596
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,879
I’m Young Khan’s maid

597
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,119
Young Khan has a bad appetite recently

598
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,919
Always clamoring about eating moon cakes

599
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,439
I don’t know Misters

600
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,439
Can you go out and buy a few?

601
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,039
It’s not Mid-Autumn Festival

602
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,639
Where can I buy the moon cakes

603
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,159
You’ll know if you go out and have a look

604
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,439
If Young Khan feels satisfy

605
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,719
Khatun naturally will feel a lot more comfortable

606
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,359
The remaining money

607
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,599
Mister can go buy wine and drink

608
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,239
Okay, wait for me to change

609
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,399
I’ll go to the city to find it for you

610
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,719
If I can’t buy it

611
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,479
Hope Young Khan won’t blame me

612
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,519
Thank you, Mister

613
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,439
You take a look

614
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,519
My pot is pretty good

615
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,839
Five cents for Yuetuan

616
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,359
Selling ​​moon cakes

617
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,199
Five cents for Yuetuan

618
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,319
Selling ​​moon cakes

619
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,639
Five Ren Yuetuan

620
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,719
Get me these two packs

621
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,599
Alright sir.

622
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,119
Here

623
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,479
Master

624
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,599
How about it?

625
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,319
Being a teacher is better than you think

626
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,319
Shiba and I running quickly for days and nights

627
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,999
With several horses

628
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,959
We just arrived here

629
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,199
Let me say

630
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,319
How can a master like myself

631
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,599
Have such a stupid disciple

632
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,119
You possess remarkable abilities

633
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,079
Still invulnerable

634
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,119
Alone

635
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,119
Dare to break into Dingxiang

636
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,519
Master

637
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,959
Everyone else and Shiba is already at the inn

638
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,039
Let’s rendezvous with them

639
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,959
What do I need to do

640
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,279
Tell me quickly

641
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,799
At noon

642
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,719
In less than three hours

643
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,759
Take someone first

644
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,159
To meet with Wei Shuyu’s group

645
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,519
Then follow the plan

646
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,759
Then you be careful

647
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,039
You have to think it over

648
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,639
It’s too late to leave now

649
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,959
You just don’t know anything

650
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,999
Where is Li Changge’s letter hidden

651
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,039
Time is running out to save A’Sun

652
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,919
You really sure

653
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,959
You want to be enemies with your mother

654
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,599
No

655
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,399
She will always be my mother

656
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,119
What I’m doing

657
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,479
Is mitigating her sin

658
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,119
She’er

659
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,439
Leave it to me

660
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,759
I’m Young Khan

661
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,799
This is not difficult for me

662
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,759
She’er

663
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,039
Thank you

664
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,239
I said

665
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,319
I’m making atonement for my mother

666
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,359
And I don’t want A’Sun to die

667
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,439
Not right, Young Master

668
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,039
What are we waiting for

669
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,959
Ashile Sun

670
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,159
Will be executed right away

671
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,759
We are waiting for the map

672
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,919
Waiting for the execution stage

673
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,719
The residence of the young Sui Emperor

674
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,199
Empress Xiao’s residence

675
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,079
Where is Mimi’s brother?

676
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,399
Convenient escape path from the palace

677
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,439
A few more things

678
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,359
Guard the weak gate

679
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,279
Location

680
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,599
These places we have to

681
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,879
Know well in advance

682
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,919
How could it be so detailed

683
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,639
Unless

684
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,439
You arranged a detailed work in the palace

685
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,119
Could it be that Mimi?

686
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,519
Don’t say that it’s Mimi

687
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,359
Not right

688
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,279
It’s really her

689
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,239
Then...

690
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,239
Did I wrongfully accuse her

691
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,239
Yicheng has been threatening Mimi

692
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,879
Not only did she not succumb

693
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,519
On the contrary

694
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,439
She’s helping us
