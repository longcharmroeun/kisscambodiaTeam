<i>The Long Ballad</i>

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,110
<i>Episode 14</i>

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,769
Assemble the Bear Division now!

24
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,769
Quickly!

25
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,089
But Mu Jin found me.

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,090
This is from him.

27
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,169
You can leave.

28
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,970
Yes.

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,390
<i>Anyone who takes reckless actions would be killed. By Great Khan</i>

30
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,328
How dare he command me by the order of Great Khan!

31
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,608
But Tegin!

32
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,769
If it was really from Great Khan,

33
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,089
our dispatch would mess up Great Khan's plan.

34
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,688
I'm afraid of...

35
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:07,569
Of what?

36
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:09,888
If you don't march now,

37
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,889
we will be despised by the Eagle Division forever!

38
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,850
Dispatch now! Assemble Bear Division!

39
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,608
Tegin.

40
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,049
What are you laughing at?

41
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,728
Are you done with your life?

42
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:38,770
I'm laughing that the famous Tegin of Bear Division is actually a coward!

43
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,409
Really?

44
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,088
Tegin!

45
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:42,808
You are killing him!

46
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:44,529
Yes, I am!

47
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:46,490
Calm down, Tegin!

48
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,528
If you kill me,

49
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:56,289
then you would lose the last chance to defeat Eagle Division.

50
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,808
You'd better understand the situation.

51
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,608
If you want to say anything, say it now.

52
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,328
Don't waste Tegin's time!

53
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,449
Commandant Li, the defender, is my brother.

54
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,850
I'm the best chip for you to negotiate with him.

55
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,289
How much are you worth?

56
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,130
At least I am worth a half of Shuozhou in my brother's eyes.

57
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,569
Are you telling me the truth?

58
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,770
If I'm not, you can kill me at any time you want.

59
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,850
Stop!

60
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,088
Didn't we arrange to meet under the city.

61
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,369
I just received the message.

62
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,608
Tu Kashe and Ibukan was heading to Shuozhou with a man from central plains.

63
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:43,808
We have to be quick.

64
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:45,608
We have to arrive before they take reckless moves.

65
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,248
Or all our plans would be destroyed.

66
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:49,009
Dress up Tegin!

67
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,810
Yes!

68
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,529
Commandant Li, Bear Division has arrived.

69
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,049
How dare they come again?

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,968
Just a few of them.

71
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,330
But strangely, a man from central plains is with them.

72
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,430
Go!

73
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,510
Go!

74
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,550
<i>Shuozhou</i>

75
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,050
Li!

76
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,810
Look who he is.

77
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,969
A'Dou!

78
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,770
A'Dou...

79
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,329
Speak, ask them to open the gate!

80
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:43,930
Speak!

81
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,129
Ask them to open the gate!

82
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,608
Speak!

83
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:55,970
Ask them to open the gate!

84
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,409
If you beat him once again, I'll smash your bones!

85
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:05,329
Commandant Li!

86
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,448
As long as you open your gate, and come to negotiate with us,

87
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,650
I will let go of him.

88
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,009
Or, I will beat him to death in front of you.

89
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:37,049
Commandant Li!

90
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,128
- Leave me alone!
 - Commandant Li!

91
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,168
Leave me alone!

92
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,728
They are too close to our gate!

93
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,969
Even if we just open a little, they can rush in immediately!

94
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,369
The consequence is horrible!

95
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,449
Yes! Commandant Li!

96
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,969
You are such a beast!

97
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,329
You even beat a child!

98
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,310
<i>Shuozhou</i>

99
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,770
I will be a general!

100
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,610
A'Dou!

101
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:44,969
No!

102
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,448
Wait! I'm saving you now!

103
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:50,249
Commandant Li!

104
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,408
Commandant Li!

105
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:51,969
No!

106
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,489
Leave me alone!

107
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,008
You can't!

108
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,089
Commandant!

109
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:54,649
Commandant Li!

110
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,209
Set me free!

111
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,210
You can't put the whole Shuozhou in danger just for him!

112
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:20,089
I will be a general!

113
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:22,729
A'Dou is saying something?

114
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:33,649
I will be... will be a general!

115
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,289
A'Dou knelt down not to ask us to save him,

116
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,810
he is saying...

117
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,200
♫ We get separated. ♫

118
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,550
♫ The grits through the fingers. ♫

119
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,510
♫ The moment I clench, ♫

120
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,525
♫ I've lost them. ♫

121
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,010
Don't be silly!

122
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,810
A'Dou!

123
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,299
♫ Forget it. Forget it. ♫

124
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,750
♫ I'm the only one left. ♫

Don't be silly, A'Dou!

126
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:41,449
Stand up!

127
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,528
You stand up!

128
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,570
Stand up, A'Dou!

129
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,009
Master.

130
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,728
I... finally I can be a general!

131
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:53,169
I finally become your subordinate!

132
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:57,049
A'Dou! You will be a general when you grow up.

133
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,689
I will take you away from here.

134
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,249
You can't die here, A'Dou!

135
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,169
I take you away from here!

136
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,370
Master.

137
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,529
I can do it.

138
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,088
I can!

139
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,009
No, you can't!

140
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,689
A'Dou! No!

141
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,490
A'Dou! Stand up!

142
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,010
Daizhou is lost, no reinforcements!

143
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,570
Liar!

144
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,050
I will kill you!

145
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,169
A'Dou!

146
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,129
He said no reinforcement!

147
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,608
Who are they?

148
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,329
They are from Ashile Tribe who are in the disguise of reinforcements.

149
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,169
Use semaphore, 10000 soldiers.

150
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,649
These people from Ashile Tribe cannot approach Shuozhou!

151
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:28,329
Commandant Li, Commandant Li!

152
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,889
Use semaphore! Quickly!

153
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,929
Be quick!

154
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,169
Reinforce Commandant Li!

155
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,130
Hurry up!

156
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,528
Tegin!

157
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,889
The plan of Ashile Sun is ruined by that boy.

158
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,009
What can we do?

159
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,529
Why not take the lead?

160
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:46,329
The best hostage is killed by you.

161
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,129
What a good plan!

162
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,848
Take the lead?

163
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:50,569
With such a few soldiers?

164
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,728
Pullout first.

165
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,969
Wait until they arrive.

166
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:54,968
Yes.

167
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:55,769
Retreat!

168
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,250
Stop!

169
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:24,050
Kill them!

170
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,729
Bear Division! Retreat!

171
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,009
Retreat!

172
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,810
Retreat!

173
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:50,209
Retreat!

174
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:56,968
Tu Kashe is such a bastard!

175
00:14:56,969 --> 00:14:58,289
He escaped!

176
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,889
Sun, they are giving no thought to death now!

177
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,570
This is bad for us.

178
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,968
This is for A'Dou.

179
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,330
Don't... don't kill me.

180
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,969
This is for people of Shuozhou.

181
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,208
The oppressed will rise to win.

182
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,890
Tu Kashe made us lose our chance.

183
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:12,649
Let's go.

184
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:32,769
Go.

185
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:47,329
The last is for my dead men!

186
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,330
None of my business.

187
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:50,529
No, don't kill me.

190
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,889
Although I have no idea who you are, you are not an ordinary man.

191
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,008
I live a poor life and no one cares about me.

192
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:39,409
I'm afraid that no one would care when I die.

193
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,169
If I can fight with master, it's worthy even if I would die.

194
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,049
Master, you are my future.

195
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,810
I will be with you no matter life or death.

196
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,369
Since you take me as your master, we have to obey the ritual.

197
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:01,529
From now on, you are my apprentice.

198
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,610
We will never betray each other.

199
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,289
After I make contributions, you will call me General Dou!

200
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,610
I will be a general!

210
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,528
Master, we are fighting with each other now.

211
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,648
Ashile Sun is their Tegin.

212
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:07,529
Why would you write this?

213
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,010
What?

214
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,649
Are you afraid of me colluding with the enemy?

215
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:14,169
I don't dare.

216
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:17,730
Just kidding.

217
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:20,768
You have been with me for so many years.

218
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:23,449
Have I ever done anything with no assurance?

219
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,368
I have thought about all the possible consequences.

220
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,810
Everything is under control.

221
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:32,930
Just hand him this letter.

222
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:34,569
Yes.

223
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,770
Governor.

224
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,930
Governor. I have a plan.

225
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,809
Go ahead.

226
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,768
Governor.

227
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,488
It becomes cooler and windy in September.

228
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:49,008
We can pretend to retreat,

229
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,089
and let Eagle Division take charge of Shuozhou.

230
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,248
And set dried firewood in town.

231
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,929
As soon as Ashile Sun's division comes, we set on fire.

232
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,210
Take advantage of the north wind, they would be burnt to nothing.

233
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,128
If their division keeps encircling the town,

234
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:10,409
the food left in town can only supply for three days.

235
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,249
According to your plan, jade and stone will be burned together.

236
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,970
All the people in Shuozhou would become refugees.

237
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:26,570
Commandant Li, you think the latter is worthy in this dilemma?

238
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,850
I...

239
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:47,489
So in your opinion, why do I want to defend Shuozhou?

240
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,029
What I'm defending is not just a fortress,

241
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,689
but the people here and their good life.

242
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,810
If not,

243
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,930
I wouldn't have surrendered to Tang right after Li Yuan's revolt.

244
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,529
Now I think,

245
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:13,089
Battle or surrender, just strategies.

246
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,809
People live a stable life without being suffered from battles.

247
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,249
That's the most important.

248
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:24,330
These are what I have stuck to.

249
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,410
Governor.

250
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:31,050
Are you thinking of surrendering to Ashile Tribe?

251
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,450
Did A'Dou and those dead soldiers die in vain?

252
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:44,008
Commandant Li.

253
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:45,450
Calm down.

254
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,489
It's just an analogy.

255
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:53,330
It's my fault.

256
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,089
Fine, Commandant Li.

257
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,169
It's late now.

258
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,169
As for the strategy, I already have made a plan.

259
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,129
We can discuss tomorrow.

260
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,490
Yes.

261
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,769
You dare to come yourself.

262
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,690
I admire your courage.

263
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,809
I'm very pleased to meet you, governor of Shuozhou, Gongsun Heng.

264
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,090
Since you invited me here,

265
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,889
you wouldn't set any traps.

266
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:07,329
Besides,

267
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,249
you are the same.

268
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,009
What are you going to discuss with me?

269
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,610
Just go ahead.

270
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,169
If you take charge of Shuozhou,

271
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:24,129
would you guarantee never harming the people here?

272
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,570
If I take advantage of the north wind to burn the city,

273
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,249
though I won't expect Eagle Division to die with me,

274
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:46,768
all you get would be ashes of Shuozhou at that time.

275
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:50,769
I think, Tegin won't be satisfied with this, right?

276
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:56,090
If you wanted to do that, you wouldn't have waited till today.

277
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,369
Nor would you threaten me like this.

278
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:00,769
This is not a menace.

279
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,850
It's just a request.

280
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,850
I'm really curious why you would ask me this.

281
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,648
We have been in battles for so long,

282
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:15,809
the casualties of Shouzhou army are heavy.

283
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,930
Am I a softhearted man in your eyes?

284
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,409
When you Eagle Division burnt the granary,

285
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,730
you could have burnt the surrounding houses together.

286
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,330
I could only save people first.

287
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,889
But you didn't do that.

288
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,489
You spared their lives,

289
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,369
and informed me so that I could come in time.

290
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,850
That meant you didn't want to kill innocent people.

291
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,569
These years, you led Eagle Division fighting in many battlefields.

292
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,970
I have already heard about some of your styles.

293
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:58,330
I believe that you have the ability,

294
00:26:58,889 --> 00:27:01,409
and the aspiration to save their lives.

295
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,810
But,

296
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:12,169
these years I have fought with Ashile Tribe for so many times.

297
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,050
Ashile Tribe hates me and Shuozhou so much.

298
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,090
Now, since I am going to give Shuozhou to you,

299
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,529
then I have to be sincere.

300
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:35,610
I will give you a gift which will satisfy all the soldiers of Ashile Tribe.

301
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,169
I won't make you embarrassed, Tegin.

302
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,409
Are you sure?

303
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,248
You burnt yourself out.

304
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,050
Is it worthy?

305
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,090
You can't go back on your promise.

306
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,129
Just a gift.

307
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,610
Comparing to the safety of people in Shuozhou,

308
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,210
it's nothing.

309
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:04,569
I,

310
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,730
Have no regrets.

311
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:19,129
I finally know how you get the name Tribune Gongsun Heng.

312
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:21,450
No worries, governor.

313
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,169
I promise what you asked for.

314
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:28,009
I won't go back on my words.

315
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,888
Okay.

316
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:35,289
Then I will say thank you for all my people in Shuozhou here.

317
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,590
<i>Governor Mansion</i>

318
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,809
These days we are in so many battles,

319
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,008
we have defended for so many days.

320
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,129
It's been hard for everyone.

321
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,248
It's not that serious, governor.

322
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,970
You've done your best for the people here, It's much harder for you.

323
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:05,809
Yes.

324
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,729
Master is like our backbone.

325
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,789
As long as master is here,

326
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,109
people of Shuozhou won't be afraid of the enemy

327
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,670
will unite together to defend the city.

328
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,368
This time we lost too much.

329
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,008
For all the casualties,

330
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,008
we have to do well in comfort and compensation.

331
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,128
As soon as we get our chance,

332
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:25,809
we have to send someone to Chang'an to report our situation.

333
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,810
And ask for support.

334
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,249
These years, Shuozhou's harvest has been not good enough.

335
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,889
Now our granary got burnt and the fields got damaged,

336
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,168
one disaster after another.

337
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:39,169
How can we get through this spring festival?

338
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:41,889
What about the livelihood next year?

339
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,649
You have to consider these things carefully.

340
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:56,129
There is still a long way for us to go.

341
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:01,570
Here, I would like to say thank you on behalf of the army and the people in Shuozhou.

342
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,449
It's not that serious, governor.

343
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,368
These are our duties.

344
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:06,529
No need to say thanks.

345
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,989
This is on behalf of the army and the people

346
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,489
to express their gratitude to your deep affection.

347
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:16,049
Commandant Li,

348
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,248
it's hard to turn down the warm-hearted offer of governor.

349
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:23,529
Drink it.

350
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:30,969
Cheers.

351
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:40,729
It's Millet Wine made by madam.

352
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,408
It's so sweet and mellow!

353
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:43,528
It's hard for you to have rest.

354
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:45,169
Drink more if you like.

355
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:46,929
Today is our family feast.

356
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,050
Make yourself at home.

357
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:50,769
Yuan.

358
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:53,248
Put that wooden sword down.

359
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:55,168
Can you play after lunch?

360
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:56,009
Okay.

361
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:59,648
Yuan just got this wooden sword today.

362
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,089
She refuses to put it down.

363
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,488
I asked her why.

364
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:06,368
She said that she wants to be like brother Li, brother Dou and her father,

365
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,849
to defend people and help the weak.

366
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,248
Then Yuan has to grow up faster.

367
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:14,409
As soon as you grow up, you can punish the evils with your brother Li.

368
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,408
That would be so good!

369
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,730
Yuan, say thanks to brother Li.

370
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:26,330
If Yuan really likes this, practices some martial arts.

371
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:30,730
If one day father cannot be with you,

372
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:35,129
you can protect yourself, and won't be bullied by bad people.

373
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,649
Why can't father be with me?

374
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,529
Silly girl,

375
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:49,288
Don't you get married this life?

376
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:52,129
Do you want to stay with me, and be an old maid?

377
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,450
Madam, a toast to you too.

378
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,369
These years, I've focused on my job.

379
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:09,169
Thanks for your hard work at home, taking care of the wounded,

380
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,409
and all the rear services,

381
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,008
as well as comforting bereaved families.

382
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:16,570
You've been working hard.

383
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:25,169
Even our Yuan, has been looked after and educated by you.

384
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:32,050
I really don't know how to pay back for all these you have done for me.

385
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,930
We have the same goal, we share the same feeling.

386
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,930
No need to say thanks.

387
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,249
You have your way,

388
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,529
and that would be my choice too.

389
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:58,888
I said you could do anything you want.

390
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:01,289
Although I am just a woman at home,

391
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:04,409
but I will keep my pace with you,

392
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:08,610
and walk on the same road with you.

393
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:27,329
Madam,

394
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,289
you have to take care of yourself.

395
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,450
Now autumn comes,

396
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,970
take good care of yourself.

397
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:38,570
Or when it comes to winter,

398
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,169
your hands and feet would be cold again,

399
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,529
and also suffer from insomnia.

400
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,970
Don't worry about me.

401
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,929
Winter is hard, but the spring will come.

402
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,090
The spring will come.

403
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:44,489
Come on.

404
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:46,810
Let's drink.

405
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,130
This one is for Shuozhou.

406
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,069
Wish our Shuozhou a good weather and harvest

407
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:57,130
just like before after this war.

408
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,090
We have you, so we will.

409
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,450
Come on.

410
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,630
<i>Protect territory and rehabilitate people</i>

411
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:29,129
Governor, you kept me here.

412
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,650
Anything else for me?

413
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:38,170
Commandant Li, please sit down.

414
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,650
Please.

415
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,050
This is the defense map of Shuozhou.

416
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:01,850
All the inventory material, grain depots and treasury are indicated here.

417
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:06,610
And this token,

418
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,249
you can deploy all the defenders of Shuozhou with this,

419
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,050
as well as all the people in my mansion.

420
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,650
Why are you handing me these?

421
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,688
Defenders of Shuozhou can only deployed by you.

422
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,570
Why are you handing me this token?

423
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,890
Defenders of Shuozhou only listen to governor,

424
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:30,810
that because I am here.

425
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:33,289
Governor,

426
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:35,090
what do you mean?

427
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:40,769
I have determined to surrender tomorrow.

428
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:49,170
Ashile Sun also promised me that he would keep my people safe.

429
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:52,969
The cost...

430
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,529
What's the cost?

431
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:57,330
Cost...

432
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,729
The cost is my head.

433
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,809
Governor!

434
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,409
Please give me some more time.

435
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,330
I can come up with a wonderful plan!

436
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,768
This is already a wonderful plan.

437
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:16,649
Governor!

438
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,050
For these years, Ashile Tribe never occupied Shuozhou once.

439
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,309
So, to defenders of Shuozhou, as long as I am here,

440
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,729
they would never surrender even if they have only one left.

441
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:34,330
But to Ashile Tribe, I have defended the border for so many years,

442
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,569
their Great Khan has been defeated by me for many times.

443
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,370
He has hated my guts.

444
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,330
Now only by giving him my head,

445
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,689
can I eliminate his doubt and piled-up grievances.

446
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,330
And only in this way,

447
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:54,170
can I get people's lives back.

448
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,609
No! I don't agree.

449
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,969
We must have other choices.

450
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:11,129
If I can hand over people's life to the princess of Tang,

451
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,529
that will be my best end.

452
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,928
Princess Yongning is clever and smart,

453
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,890
you have many things to do next,

454
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,529
and still have a long way to go.

455
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,209
You can't die now.

456
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:30,289
You know who I am, Governor?

457
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:36,089
The guy who chased you called you Princess Yongning.

458
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,209
Princess Yongning,

459
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,370
any last words?

460
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,248
I fought with him before.

461
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:49,969
From his kungfu skill, I knew he must be a guard from the court.

462
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:54,248
He traveled so far to Shuozhou just for killing you.

463
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,249
But he had no official document for arrest.

464
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,248
Apart from the former crown prince's subordinate,

465
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:01,449
who else would you be?

466
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:10,050
Actually to me, it's not important who you are.

467
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,949
For the first time when we met,

468
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,810
you saved my wife and Yuan with a trick,

469
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,810
I knew that you are not an ordinary person.

470
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:25,449
No matter what you wanted from me from the beginning,

471
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:32,009
I was sure that you meant no bad to me and Shuozhou.

472
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:36,929
So I would like to keep you beside me.

473
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,209
But,

474
00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:47,810
I can't wait till the day you achieve your goal.

475
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:54,689
Governor, my name is Li Changge.

476
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,289
I'm the daughter of prince Li Jiancheng.

477
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,130
I have not been Princess Yongning since a long time ago.

478
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,890
Now I just want to fight by your side.

479
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:06,569
Please recall your order!

480
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,490
Changge will spare no effort to defend Shuozhou!

481
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,688
Princess!

482
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:13,929
Princess! No.

483
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,610
Princess!

484
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,129
I've been loyal for my whole life.

485
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,810
At this moment,

486
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:22,289
I can't arrogate.

487
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:26,249
It's me who should kneel down now.

488
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,850
Princess,

489
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,050
you have such a deep affection towards the people in Shuozhou,

490
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,130
please receive my worship.

491
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,288
Governor!

492
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:38,449
Please stand up, governor.

493
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:41,169
How can I receive this?

494
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,009
Stand up please.

495
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:44,009
Please.

496
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,009
Princess,

497
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,650
I still have something to ask for your help.

498
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:55,529
Till now, only this issue worries me.

499
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,969
My Yuan is still a little girl.

500
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,089
I know.

501
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,610
After I die,

502
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,009
my wife would not marry others.

503
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,768
So princess, please.

504
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:24,570
Try your best to take care of them.

505
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:33,769
I will say thanks for them here.

506
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:38,249
Governor,

507
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,009
you should watch Yuan growing up.

508
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:42,570
Governor!

509
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:45,729
Recall your order!

510
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,890
Recall your order! Governor!

511
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:54,410
I will bless them to be safe and sound in Heaven.

512
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,489
Senior Qin.

513
00:41:58,529 --> 00:41:59,969
Take princess down to have a rest.

514
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,569
Governor!

515
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,370
Governor!

516
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:05,090
Governor!
