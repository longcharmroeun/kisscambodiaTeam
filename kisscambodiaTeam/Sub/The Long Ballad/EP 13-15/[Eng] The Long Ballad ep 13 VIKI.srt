<i>The Long Ballad</i>

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,430
<i>Episode 13</i>

23
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,368
Governor, this is all my fault.

24
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,248
I capitalize on terrain too much, moving our troops from east to west.

25
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:43,489
I want to atone for my faults.

26
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,450
Please let me handle them.

27
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,328
Fine.

28
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,968
The war is all about the wit and moral courage.

29
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,369
It's not entirely your fault.

30
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:53,489
I just didn't know

31
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,450
the elite squad of Ashile Tribe could be this cunning.

32
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,450
Xu Feng, summon all our people

33
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,129
to meet me and Commandant Li

34
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,888
at the East Gate and confront the enemies.

35
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,689
Yes.

36
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,849
But Governor, they were constantly on the run

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,209
before they attacked our barn.

38
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,209
Now they're at the east gate, miles apart from the barn.

39
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,168
How could they be so quick?

40
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:15,969
Shisi,

41
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,529
you should know that

42
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,009
from now on,

43
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,689
you're facing the most elite and powerful cavalry of Ashile Tribe.

44
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,130
On my order.

45
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,130
Shoot!

46
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:56,969
Master!

47
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,128
Governor!

48
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:00,608
Master!

49
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:01,008
Governor!

50
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,809
Governor!

51
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:05,929
I'm fine.

52
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,169
Put a bandage on it and it'll do.

53
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,850
Governor!

54
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,349
Governor, you should go back.

55
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,469
I'll be here.

56
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,249
You need to lead the troops

57
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,408
and defend the east side.

58
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,209
Yes!

59
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,408
Take Governor back, now!

60
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:30,209
Yes.

61
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,130
This isn't good. They've got reinforcements.

62
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:50,969
Yaro has destroyed all the state owned land

63
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,049
according to your plan.

64
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,849
Gongsun Heng shall find out about it soon.

65
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,050
Wear this.

66
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,689
Come on, I'm so handsome.

67
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,889
Why would I wear this?

68
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:05,129
Alright, then.

69
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,609
I should've picked a prettier one.

70
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:14,579
How about it?

71
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,380
Do I look good?

72
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,720
<i>Shuozhou</i>

73
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,379
Isn't that Shisi?

74
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,899
You're afraid that he'll recognize us.

75
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,338
So you've both hidden your real identites.

76
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,139
Shut up.

77
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,608
So you're not real friends.

78
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:35,888
Well, that just makes everything fine.

79
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:36,929
I'll kill him.

80
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,089
Destroy the leader and the gang will collapse.

81
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,169
Shut up!

82
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:48,809
Give out my order.

83
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,249
Go all the way to attack the city.

84
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,728
Attention, Eagle Division!

85
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:54,689
Kill!

86
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,690
Kill!

87
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:09,569
Kill!

88
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,728
Registrar, the east gate has always been the least defended area.

89
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,008
I've sent people to get lookout towers and catapults from elsewhere.

90
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,250
Do we have any more javelins?

91
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,090
The remaining iron caltrops are less than 50 kilos.

92
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,689
We can only lay one line of defense

93
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,929
with the iron caltrops now available.

94
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,689
And the Eagle Division can easily avoid it.

95
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,728
We should do whatever we can

96
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,848
to make the best use of the existing iron caltrops.

97
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:45,649
Yes!

98
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,608
Whoever they are, Eagle Divison or reinforcements.

99
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:54,489
They must've been on the run the entire night.

100
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,608
They wouldn't have enough time

101
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,249
to feed their horses with food and water.

102
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,690
Don't eat that!

103
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:16,490
Don't eat that!

104
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,930
Stop eating!

105
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:20,289
Stop it!

106
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,490
Rein up!

107
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:45,009
Nice!

108
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,929
It's him again!

109
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,168
Sun, we must kill him.

110
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,329
If we get defeated,

111
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,050
Great Khan would be so mad at us!

112
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,730
Sun!

113
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:02,729
What are you hesitating about?

114
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,570
Tegin Sun!

115
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,408
Registrar!

116
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,330
Master!

117
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,528
Master!

118
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:17,648
Master!

119
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:18,449
Registrar!

120
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,409
Help!

121
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:25,570
Help!

122
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,449
Master!

123
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,728
Master!

124
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,690
Master!

125
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,249
Your commander is now dead.

126
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,529
Surrender now, get disarmed

127
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,329
and we won't kill you.

128
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,129
Surrender! Surrender!

129
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,929
Surrender! Surrender!

130
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,050
Surrender! Surrender! Surrender!

131
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,050
Surrender! Surrender! Surrender!

132
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,209
Surrender!

133
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:57,608
Surrender!

134
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,050
Surrender!

135
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,649
Surrender!

136
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,289
Surrender!

137
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,009
Commandant Li stood up!

138
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,408
Commandant Li didn't die!

139
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,768
Commandant Li didn't die!

140
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:52,849
Commandant Li stood up!

141
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,409
How could it be?

142
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,088
Sun.

143
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,129
You're the best warrior on the plains.

144
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,768
You never miss the targets!

145
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:05,528
Great!

146
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:06,968
Great! Great!

147
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,249
Great!

148
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,408
No way, Sun.

149
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:10,689
The chief commander of Shuozhou didn't die.

150
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,088
It boosted their morale.

151
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,049
It's not a great time for us to launch an attack.

152
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,130
Well...

153
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,490
Withdraw.

154
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:27,209
Encamp outside the walls.

155
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:30,409
Withdraw now!

156
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:35,449
We won!

157
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,250
We won!

158
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,129
We won! We won! We won!

159
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,450
We won! We won! We won!

160
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,050
Master!

161
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:09,889
Master.

162
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,050
Why are you up?

163
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,768
How's Governor doing?

164
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,809
Master, you're seriously injured.

165
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,728
I can't believe you're still worring about others.

166
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:18,529
I'm fine.

167
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,649
It's just minor bruising.

168
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,489
Not to mention that the doctor has changed my dressing.

169
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,049
Right now,

170
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,209
what really matters is our war against Ashile Tribe.

171
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,929
Governor is also wounded.

172
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,289
How could I rest?

173
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:33,489
Governor's new injury triggered his old wounds.

174
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,930
He's at his bedroom now.

175
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,649
A'Dou, You should go to bed now.

176
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,449
I'll go talk to Governor

177
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,608
- and see what we can do.
 - Master!

178
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:43,608
Don't forget that your target is not Shuozhou,

179
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:44,968
but Changan.

180
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:46,968
Your health is everything.

181
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:47,769
A'Dou,

182
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,930
compared to this war in Shuozhou,

183
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:53,849
the personal hatred between me and Li Shimin is nothing.

184
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,370
Right now,

185
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,410
the situation in Shuozhou is grim.

186
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,330
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

187
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,969
Well,

188
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,050
you'll change my dressing on time, right?

189
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,490
I'm just worried about your health.

190
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:19,969
Look,

191
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:21,449
I'm fine.

192
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,889
Wolf Division is targeting Yunzhou and Daizhou.

193
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,689
Great Khan ordered you

194
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,009
to take Shuozhou in ten days.

195
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,450
Or, he'll lead the troops himself.

196
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,249
If we just camp outside the city like this,

197
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,169
I doubt if we can take Shuozhou in 10 days.

198
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:03,929
By that time,

199
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,009
Eagle Division will be an object of universal derision.

200
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,450
A trapped beast will still struggle.

201
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,529
But it won't last long.

202
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:11,930
Fair enough.

203
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:14,408
We've burned their barns,

204
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:15,450
and destroyed their lands.

205
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:17,089
They'll be starved to death.

206
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,009
Mu Jin,

207
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:23,489
what do you think of my archery?

208
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,450
You never miss a target.

209
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,168
Sun, don't tell me you're sneaking into Shuozhou

210
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,450
at a time like this.

211
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,088
No way.

212
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:39,088
I won't permit that.

213
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:40,369
I was wrong.

214
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,608
Your archery is just great.

215
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,209
Li Shisi must be alright.

216
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,409
Really.

217
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,769
Take the reports.

218
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:52,729
Let's go to see Tu Kashe.

219
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,289
I need to get rid of him.

220
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:57,849
Eagle Division must be the one

221
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,849
to take over Shuozhou.

222
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:08,728
Tegin, there's no need to be angry.

223
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:10,288
If you want to surpass Eagle Division,

224
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:11,849
I have another plan.

225
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,970
What are you doing here?

226
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,130
Bear Division was badly injured.

227
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,089
What are you going to do?

228
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,009
Tegin.

229
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,449
Tegin, have mercy on me.

230
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,329
I swear, I promise!

231
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,689
I will kill Registrar Li.

232
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,889
Please, Tegin, give me another chance.

233
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,768
You missed your chance

234
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,169
and that's it. You lost it forever.

235
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:53,648
It was your trick

236
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,849
that rendered half of the Bear Division dead.

237
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,209
If we give you another chance,

238
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,529
maybe even Eagle Division couldn't save you.

239
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,408
Tegin, god knows how eager I am

240
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,330
to serve Bear Division.

241
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,810
You think you can just kill him

242
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,129
and get things over with Great Khan?

243
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,129
Bear Division was misled by a treacherous minister.

244
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:46,649
I will explain it to Great Khan myself.

245
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,850
No need.

246
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,570
I have received Khan's order.

247
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:01,008
Now you're taking it to me.

248
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:01,850
What?

249
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,888
Are you trying to humiliate me?

250
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:07,209
We just want you to stop being reckless.

251
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,329
We don't want to take credit for occupying Shuozhou.

252
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,570
We just want you to stop holding us Eagle Division back.

253
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:16,689
You just can't wait to tread Bear Division underfoot, right?

254
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,210
Why the rush?

255
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,690
Then you leave us no choice but to report the truth to Great Khan.

256
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,489
That Tu Kashe defied his intructions openly.

257
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,329
Tegin Sun,

258
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,730
Tegin of Bear Division has received your order.

259
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:43,169
Now please.

260
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,889
Ibukan.

261
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,129
Ibukan!

262
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,050
Ibukan!

263
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,049
Isn't there anyone who'd guard the entrance for me?

264
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,128
This is the camp of Bear Division.

265
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:00,769
Do your job and guard the damn door!

266
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,288
Eagle Division changed their camp site.

267
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,128
They must be up to something.

268
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:11,209
Keep an eye on him.

269
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,209
Keep an eye on him!

270
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,010
Understand?

271
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,370
Yes!

272
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:17,570
And guard the damn door!

273
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,330
Just say it.

274
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:30,209
You could've just bought over that counsellor.

275
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,050
Why did you provoke Tu Kashe into killing him?

276
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:34,570
I don't like traitors.

277
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,049
But he was right.

278
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,729
Gongsun Heng got a brave general all of a sudden.

279
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,248
Things would be much easier

280
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:41,809
if we kill Li Shisi first.

281
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,128
You know it better than anyone that

282
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,089
what will happen if Great Khan leads the troops himself.

283
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,850
Why are you just laying siege to this city?

284
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,330
Sher's Wolf Division will soon take Daizhou.

285
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,529
Great Khan ordered us to assist them.

286
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:55,408
I'll send you there.

287
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:56,330
Me?

288
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,768
Ashile Sun, yes, I am a bit talktive.

289
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,008
But that doesn't mean you've got to throw me to the wolves.

290
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,489
Once this war ends, you'll leave.

291
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,449
Remember, when you're in Daizhou,

292
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,368
save some clothes of Tang defenders,

293
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:09,610
and don't hassle common people.

294
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,889
You don't have to tell these to Great Khan.

295
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,089
That's it?

296
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,010
Shouldn't you set things straight before you go?

297
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:38,809
Hurry!

298
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,610
Run!

299
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:41,648
Run! Run!

300
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:42,689
Run!

301
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,769
Hurry! Hurry!

302
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,569
Run!

303
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,850
Hurry! Run!

304
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:49,329
Hurry!

305
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,130
Run!

306
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,768
Help!

307
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:07,248
Help!

308
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,449
What's going on?

309
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,209
What are you doing?

310
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:09,809
- Help!
 - You can't come in.

311
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,610
Help!

312
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:12,008
Open the door.

313
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:12,849
Open the door! Help!

314
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,609
What happened?

315
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,930
The enemies are breaking in.

316
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,969
Close the door.

317
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,128
Please, I'm begging you.

318
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:19,049
Come on.

319
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:19,768
Help me close the door.

320
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:20,930
Just take my kid in, okay?

321
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,449
I'm begging you!

322
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,330
Please!

323
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,449
Open the door! Open it!

324
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,768
Please!

325
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,888
Just let my kid in!

326
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,369
Please help us!

327
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,090
I'm begging you!

328
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:40,809
Let my kid in!

329
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,730
Please!

330
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,810
What are you doing?

331
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:47,209
Let them in.

332
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,010
Are you nuts?

333
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,449
Who the hell do you think you are?

334
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,888
How dare you point the scissors at me?

335
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:54,889
You're seeking your doom.

Help me!

338
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,970
Where did she go?

339
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,209
What are you doing here?

340
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,488
Great Khan sent us to chase after

341
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,408
the Daizhou Force that has fled from the city.

342
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:40,209
Hurry up!

343
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,890
Come on!

344
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,368
Master, where are we going now?

345
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,648
Let's go and take a look at the east side.

346
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,089
Right now, the east side is under siege by the Eagle Division.

347
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,929
But outside the east gate, there're towering and forested mountains.

348
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,168
We don't have our forces garrisoned there.

349
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:26,528
So might the Eagle Division.

350
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,288
However tight their defense might be,

351
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:29,128
I don't think they can find us

352
00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:30,129
among so many mountains.

353
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:32,809
A'Dou,

354
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,930
you've really grown up.

355
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:46,128
Go now!

356
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:47,809
Master, let's go together!

357
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,610
Get someone here!

358
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,850
You followed me the whole way here.

359
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,049
I guess you want more than the Seal of Crown Prince.

360
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,369
You also want to kill me.

361
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,128
So what?

362
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:27,168
Right now, Governor Gongsun is seriously wounded.

363
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,128
Shuozhou is surrounded by enemies.

364
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,209
Do you really have to kill me right now?

365
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,330
Cut the nonsense.

366
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:35,249
It's my duty to execute you here.

367
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,810
Princess Yongning, any last words?

368
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:49,649
Even if I were to die,

369
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,169
I wouldn't be killed by a pawn.

370
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,730
Master, are you okay?

371
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,330
Do you know who she is?

372
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,248
If you help her,

373
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:13,569
you'll regret it later, for sure.

374
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:19,168
All I know is that she's the commandant

375
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:21,810
who's protecting Shuozhou.

376
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:27,248
Young man, you must've sneaked into Shuozhou

377
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:28,929
before the siege by Eagle Division, right?

378
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:31,488
Then you must be clear

379
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,768
about what's going on here.

380
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:34,050
Governor is wounded.

381
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:39,009
Everyone in Shuozhou rely on Commandant Li.

382
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,210
So I won't let you hurt her.

383
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:44,570
If you insist on helping her,

384
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:48,450
we'll wait and see.

385
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,330
Senior Qin, thank you.

386
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:09,969
Senior Qin,

387
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:11,970
I have an idea.

388
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:13,570
We can get out of here.

389
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,969
Back then when we flooded Tu Kashe,

390
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,329
we pumped the stone canal dry

391
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,129
that once drained into Wuding River.

392
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,929
Master, just leave it to me.

393
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,850
You're still injured...

394
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,689
I'll go.

395
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,809
I might be a bit more familiar

396
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,210
with this place than you.

397
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,089
Commandant Li.

398
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:42,569
Commandant Li.

399
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,370
Governor?

400
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:47,209
Help Senior Qin out.

401
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,689
Governor.

402
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,729
- Commandant Li.
 - Why are you here?

403
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,488
Senior Qin told me that you found a stone canal

404
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:53,089
that might lead out of Shuozhou.

405
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,729
Seeing you dressed like this,

406
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,769
are you going to deliver the message yourself?

407
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,049
The stone canal in the city leads straight to Wuding River.

408
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,288
Shuozhou is now under siege by the Eagle Division.

409
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,369
Wuding River is the only area with no garrison.

410
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:08,488
If we don't spread the message now,

411
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:09,528
I'm afraid we're running out of time.

412
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,609
I plan to get out of here

413
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,330
and deliver the message while it's still dark.

414
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,969
You've already been seriously injured.

415
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,449
And today you were almost assassinated,

416
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,009
which just made things even worse.

417
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,970
How could I let you risk your life?

418
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,809
Yeah, Commandant Li.

419
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,050
That guy hit you real hard.

420
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,329
Commandant Li, let me do it.

421
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,210
Shuozhou need you and Master.

422
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,849
You're the hope of Shuozhou.

423
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,768
Also, I'm Master's bodyguard.

424
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:40,610
This is my duty.

425
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,248
No.

426
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:44,849
The stone canal was built for drainage.

427
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,610
It's too small for you to get through.

428
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,488
Governor, Iet me do it.

429
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:52,330
I can get through it.

430
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:53,809
A'Dou!

431
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,449
Master, I know you're worried about me.

432
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,689
You don't want to put me at risk.

433
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,809
But you're already badly injured.

434
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,929
If you don't get a good rest,

435
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,250
you wouldn't be able to carry on.

436
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,329
You don't want to pass out halfway

437
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,250
and cause delay in reinforcement request, right?

438
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,128
So I'm the best choice for this task.

439
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,449
Governor, please place your trust in me.

440
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,008
I won't let you down.

441
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:14,488
Enough of this nonsense.

442
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:15,969
You're just a kid.

443
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,809
How could I put you at risk?

444
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,248
Yes, I'm too young,

445
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,489
and that's why I won't attract their attention.

446
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,368
Besides, Master accepted me as a disciple

447
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:27,929
because I'm smart.

448
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,609
I've been learning from Master for a long time.

449
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,408
I've commanded so many tricks.

450
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:33,329
But, when I'm back,

451
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,889
Governor, would you award me some titles?

452
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:44,210
Master, stop hesitating.

453
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,729
We've been through so much.

454
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,169
You don't think I can handle it, do you?

455
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,410
Fine.

456
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:05,329
Take this baggage with you and don't lose it.

457
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,689
You'll find an escape route map in it

458
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,008
and some pocket crossbows

459
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,648
with which you can beat off the enemies.

460
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:11,368
Master, nice choice.

461
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:12,528
And when I'm back in glory,

462
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:15,450
you'll all call me General Dou.

463
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:20,809
A'Dou,

464
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,649
take care of yourself.

465
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:25,408
I will, Master.

466
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:26,609
Tell everyone to hang in there

467
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,490
and wait for me.

468
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,850
Commandant Li,

469
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,769
you have a great disciple.

470
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,090
I didn't teach him anything.

471
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,090
In fact, I'm the lucky one to meet him.

472
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:01,809
Tegin.

473
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,648
I sent people to spy on Mu Jin.

474
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:08,690
But he managed to get rid of them halfway.

475
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:12,049
He seemed to be leaving for Daizhou.

476
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:12,850
Daizhou?

477
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,889
What does that mean?

478
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:21,289
Great Khan has taken Daizhou?

479
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:24,769
What's happening?

480
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:26,450
Why?

481
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:29,849
I know nothing at all!

482
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,209
What? Do they take our Bear Division seriously?

483
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,689
Tegin, don't be anxious.

484
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,488
I will lead a team to keep an eye on Ashile Sun.

485
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:37,449
I won't let him fool Great Khan

486
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,128
and take all the credit for occupying Shuozhou.

487
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,090
Enough.

488
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,969
Cut that nonsense.

489
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,168
Get lost!

490
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:43,969
Now!

491
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:55,929
Yuan.

492
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,690
You're finally back.

493
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,689
People sent food here just now.

494
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,888
They said they'd eat chaff and herbs

495
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,648
as long as you and the soldiers are well fed.

496
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:06,969
And I had people to send it back.

497
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,049
They saved their own food.

498
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,489
I couldn't accept it, really.

499
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,810
Madam, you are right.

500
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,369
Father.

501
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,849
Everyone is saying that

502
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,409
you're the one who's defending Shuozhou.

503
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:28,249
Your mom must have praised me again, right?

504
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:37,009
But I think, they're the reason Shuozhou exists,

505
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,049
not me.

506
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,450
I can't take the credit.

507
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,049
Check all the food provisions

508
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,768
and the grains we have.

509
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,369
Distribute it to the common people.

510
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,529
We must hold out till A'Dou comes back.

511
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:56,049
Yes.

512
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:34,888
Tegin,

513
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:36,689
we've killed all the Tang soldiers around Daizhou

514
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,648
on Great Khan's command.

515
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:38,768
What about those who fled Daizhou?

516
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,128
They were all killed.

517
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:41,008
Good.

518
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,049
Tegin of Eagle Division has sent someone here from Shuozhou.

519
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,008
Great Khan ordered us to meet him.

520
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:45,849
Let's go back to Daizhou.

521
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,248
Don't keep that messenger waiting.

522
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:48,049
Yes.

523
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:57,729
Damn it.

524
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,969
The post road was blocked.

525
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,609
I can't send message to Changan.

526
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,488
And Daizhou fell to the enemies, too.

527
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:02,969
We won't be able to get any reinforcements.

528
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,810
What should I do now?

529
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,130
I must go back

530
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,730
and inform Master of this.

531
00:34:18,529 --> 00:34:20,209
Stop.

532
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,410
You guys.

533
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,968
Find some clothes of Tang soldiers

534
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,488
and get changed on our way out of Daizhou.

535
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,289
Yes!

536
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:01,409
Come on.

537
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,129
Come on.

538
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:02,930
Get up.

539
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,889
Have mercy on us.

540
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,249
Don't kill us!

541
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:18,009
Please spare us!

542
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,409
Come on, kneel down.

543
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,529
Why should I?

544
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,370
They are the real culprits, the offenders.

545
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,810
Just kneel down.

546
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,209
Have mercy on us! Don't kill us! Please!

547
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,330
Please don't kill us!

548
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:01,769
Stop.

549
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:03,289
Stop.

550
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:05,889
Stop it.

551
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:06,728
Who are you?

552
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,089
You don't know me. That's fine.

553
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,010
But I'm sure you can recognize this spike arrow.

554
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:17,248
Since when does Eagle Division get to tell us what to do?

555
00:36:17,249 --> 00:36:18,649
If you're smart, you'd get lost now.

556
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,929
You know well what Eagle Division is capable of.

557
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,008
I suppose you wouldn't want to die

558
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:25,289
for these refugees.

559
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,450
Let's go!

560
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:37,849
Go!

561
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,488
Go!

562
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,289
Go!

563
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:45,729
You should go now.

564
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,008
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

565
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:50,409
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

566
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,049
We must get back to Shuozhou as soon as possible.

567
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,129
- Yes!
 - Yes!

568
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:53,930
Go!

569
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:56,369
Thank you!

570
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,249
Thank you! Thank you!

571
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,288
Let's go home.

572
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:10,008
Great!

573
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:10,810
Father.

574
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,089
Isn't he that... That...

575
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,330
That guy's apprentice?

576
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,248
Yes!

577
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:56,049
I know you.

578
00:37:57,729 --> 00:37:59,249
Kill him. Just kill him. Now.

579
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,208
Wait!

580
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:02,009
My lord! Lord!

581
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,249
I've got an update for you.

582
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,448
Lord?

583
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:07,249
He's our Tegin.

584
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,849
Yeah, okay. Tegin! Tegin!

585
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,008
You got my title wrong.

586
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,448
Kill him. Kill him. Just kill him.

587
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:14,809
Tegin, right now you must be desperate

588
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,570
to know what's going on in Shuozhou.

589
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,489
Spare my life and I'll prove myself useful to you.

590
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,130
Then tell me how you might be helpful to us.

591
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,009
Or, I will kill you myself.

592
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,649
Tegin, you know that

593
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,008
I'm Registrar Li's trusted follower.

594
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:52,528
I know his tricks better than anyone.

595
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:53,688
During the battle around Wuding River,

596
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:55,248
you lost so many soldiers.

597
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,049
The situation for you is grim.

598
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,688
I also heard that

599
00:38:57,689 --> 00:38:59,728
now it's the Eagle Division that's leading the attack.

600
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:01,089
Screw you.

601
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,689
I don't want to hear any of these.

602
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:05,169
Did you take him to me just to piss me off?

603
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,208
Kill him. Just kill him. Kill him.

604
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:07,768
If you were still able to manage the battle,

605
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:08,609
how come you know nothing

606
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,330
about Li's promotion to Commandant?

607
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:14,688
Tegin, spare my life.

608
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,089
Let me talk to the generals in Shuozhou.

609
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,169
I'll make Commandant Li

610
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,689
to offer up Shuozhou submissively.

611
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:39,209
Now even a cute little cub dares to cheat me.

612
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,890
Do I look like a fool to you?

613
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:44,928
Do I?

614
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,688
Sima Jian, that liar, he cheated you.

615
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:47,609
Tegin, you don't know it.

616
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,369
Commandant Li and Governor Gongsun are dying at this moment.

617
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,728
The Eagle Division hit them real hard.

618
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,968
This is the best time for negotiation.

619
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,288
I know them quite well.

620
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:56,449
I'd be the best one for this task.

621
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,768
It's been so long since the Eagle Division laid siege to Shuozhou

622
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,768
and people there are still closely united with high morale.

623
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:10,448
Even if I fail, which is highly unlikely,

624
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,968
it'll demoralize them greatly.

625
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:15,729
That's something Eagle Division can never do.

626
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,449
Let's take his words for the moment.

627
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:29,208
Tie him to my horse.

628
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,689
He'll be going into a battle with me.

629
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,330
Don't kill him yet.

630
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:35,289
Yes.

631
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,528
Great Khan ordered that

632
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:04,569
any one who makes a rash act will be executed.

633
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,370
Come on!

634
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,650
- Hang on.
 - I'm too tired.

635
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:35,289
Miss, I can't take it, Miss.

636
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:38,410
Wear these.

637
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,330
Miss, you're so kind.

638
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,209
Thank you for saving my life.

639
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,050
I wish someone could save my daughter.

640
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,968
You must survive.

641
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:57,809
Maybe you'll get to see your daughter one day.

642
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,248
Tegin, the Eagle Division collected many clothes of the soldiers

643
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,609
defending Daizhou while cleaning up the battlefield.

644
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,409
And later on their way back,

645
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,930
Mu Jin ordered the Eagle Division to change into Tang uniforms.

646
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,330
They want to grab the credit from us.

647
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:37,008
Gather Bear Division now!

648
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:37,809
Hurry! Come on!

649
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:47,833
