[Episode 13]

22
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,168
Governor, this is all my fault.

23
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,048
I capitalize on terrain too much, moving our troops from east to west.

24
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,289
I want to atone for my faults.

25
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,250
Please let me handle them.

26
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,128
Fine.

27
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,768
The war is all about the wit and moral courage.

28
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:57,169
It's not entirely your fault.

29
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,289
I just didn't know

30
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,250
the elite squad of Ashile Tribe could be this cunning.

31
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:05,250
Xu Feng, summon all our people

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,929
to meet me and Commandant Li

33
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,688
at the East Gate and confront the enemies.

34
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:09,489
Yes.

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,649
But Governor, they were constantly on the run

36
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,009
before they attacked our barn.

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,009
Now they're at the east gate, miles apart from the barn.

38
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,968
How could they be so quick?

39
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:21,769
Shisi,

40
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,329
you should know that

41
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:24,809
from now on,

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,489
you're facing the most elite and powerful cavalry of Ashile Tribe.

43
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:05,930
On my order.

44
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:08,930
Shoot!

45
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:02,769
Master!

46
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,928
Governor!

47
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:06,408
Master!

48
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:06,808
Governor!

49
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:07,609
Governor!

50
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:11,729
I'm fine.

51
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,969
Put a bandage on it and it'll do.

52
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,650
Governor!

53
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,149
Governor, you should go back.

54
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,269
I'll be here.

55
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,049
You need to lead the troops

56
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,208
and defend the east side.

57
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,009
Yes!

58
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,208
Take Governor back, now!

59
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,009
Yes.

60
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,930
This isn't good. They've got reinforcements.

61
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:56,769
Yaro has destroyed all the state owned land

62
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,849
according to your plan.

63
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,649
Gongsun Heng shall find out about it soon.

64
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,850
Wear this.

65
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,489
Come on, I'm so handsome.

66
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,689
Why would I wear this?

67
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:10,929
Alright, then.

68
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,409
I should've picked a prettier one.

69
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,379
How about it?

70
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,180
Do I look good?

71
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,520
[Shuozhou]

72
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,179
Isn't that Shisi?

73
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,699
You're afraid that he'll recognize us.

74
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,138
So you've both hidden your real identites.

75
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:36,939
Shut up.

76
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,408
So you're not real friends.

77
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,688
Well, that just makes everything fine.

78
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:42,729
I'll kill him.

79
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,889
Destroy the leader and the gang will collapse.

80
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,969
Shut up!

81
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:54,609
Give out my order.

82
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,049
Go all the way to attack the city.

83
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,528
Attention, Eagle Division!

84
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:00,489
Kill!

85
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,490
Kill!

86
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,369
Kill!

87
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,528
Registrar, the east gate has always been the least defended area.

88
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,808
I've sent people to get lookout towers and catapults from elsewhere.

89
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,050
Do we have any more javelins?

90
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,890
The remaining iron caltrops are less than 50 kilos.

91
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,489
We can only lay one line of defense

92
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,729
with the iron caltrops now available.

93
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,489
And the Eagle Division can easily avoid it.

94
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,528
We should do whatever we can

95
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:50,648
to make the best use of the existing iron caltrops.

96
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:51,449
Yes!

97
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,408
Whoever they are, Eagle Divison or reinforcements.

98
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,289
They must've been on the run the entire night.

99
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,408
They wouldn't have enough time

100
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,049
to feed their horses with food and water.

101
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:20,490
Don't eat that!

102
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:22,290
Don't eat that!

103
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,730
Stop eating!

104
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,089
Stop it!

105
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,290
Rein up!

106
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:50,809
Nice!

107
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,729
It's him again!

108
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,968
Sun, we must kill him.

109
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,129
If we get defeated,

110
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,850
Great Khan would be so mad at us!

111
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,530
Sun!

112
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,529
What are you hesitating about?

113
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,370
Tegin Sun!

119
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,209
Help!

120
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,370
Help!

121
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,249

122
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,528
Master!

123

Master!

124
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:43,049
Your commander is now dead.

125
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,329
Surrender now, get disarmed

126
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:46,129
and we won't kill you.

127
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,929
Surrender! Surrender!

128
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,729
Surrender! Surrender!

129
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,850
Surrender! Surrender! Surrender!

00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,850
Surrender! Surrender! Surrender!

131
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,009
Surrender!

132
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:03,408
Surrender!

133
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:04,850
Surrender!

134
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,449
Surrender!

135
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,089
Surrender!

136
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,809
Commandant Li stood up!

137
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,208
Commandant Li didn't die!

138
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,568
Commandant Li didn't die!

139
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:58,649
Commandant Li stood up!

140
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,209
How could it be?

141
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,888
Sun.

142
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,929
You're the best warrior on the plains.

143
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,568
You never miss the targets!

144
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:11,328
Great!

145
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:12,768
Great! Great!

146
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,049
Great!

147
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,208
No way, Sun.

148
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,489
The chief commander of Shuozhou didn't die.

149
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,888
It boosted their morale.

150
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:19,849
It's not a great time for us to launch an attack.

151
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,930
Well...

152
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,290
Withdraw.

153
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,009
Encamp outside the walls.

154
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:36,209
Withdraw now!

155
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,249
We won!

156
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,050
We won!

157
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,929
We won! We won! We won!

158
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,250
We won! We won! We won!

159
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,850
Master!

160
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:15,689
Master.

161
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,850
Why are you up?

162
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,568
How's Governor doing?

163
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:21,609
Master, you're seriously injured.

164
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,528
I can't believe you're still worring about others.

165
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:24,329
I'm fine.

166
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,449
It's just minor bruising.

167
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:29,289
Not to mention that the doctor has changed my dressing.

168
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,849
Right now,

169
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,009
what really matters is our war against Ashile Tribe.

170
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,729
Governor is also wounded.

171
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,089
How could I rest?

172
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,289
Governor's new injury triggered his old wounds.

173
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,730
He's at his bedroom now.

174
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,449
A'Dou, You should go to bed now.

175
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,249
I'll go talk to Governor

176
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,408
- and see what we can do.
- Master!

177
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,408
Don't forget that your target is not Shuozhou,

178
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:50,768
but Changan.

179
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,768
Your health is everything.

180
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:53,569
A'Dou,

181
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:56,730
compared to this war in Shuozhou,

182
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:59,649
the personal hatred between me and Li Shimin is nothing.

183
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,170
Right now,

184
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,210
the situation in Shuozhou is grim.

185
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,130
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

186
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,769
Well,

187
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,850
you'll change my dressing on time, right?

188
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,290
I'm just worried about your health.

189
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:25,769
Look,

190
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,249
I'm fine.

191
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,689
Wolf Division is targeting Yunzhou and Daizhou.

192
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,489
Great Khan ordered you

193
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,809
to take Shuozhou in ten days.

194
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,250
Or, he'll lead the troops himself.

195
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,049
If we just camp outside the city like this,

196
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,969
I doubt if we can take Shuozhou in 10 days.

197
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,729
By that time,

198
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,809
Eagle Division will be an object of universal derision.

199
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,250
A trapped beast will still struggle.

200
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,329
But it won't last long.

201
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,730
Fair enough.

202
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,208
We've burned their barns,

203
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:21,250
and destroyed their lands.

204
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:22,889
They'll be starved to death.

205
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:24,809
Mu Jin,

206
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,289
what do you think of my archery?

207
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,250
You never miss a target.

208
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,968
Sun, don't tell me you're sneaking into Shuozhou

209
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,250
at a time like this.

210
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:43,888
No way.

211
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:44,888
I won't permit that.

212
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,169
I was wrong.

213
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,408
Your archery is just great.

214
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:49,009
Li Shisi must be alright.

215
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,209
Really.

216
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:56,569
Take the reports.

217
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:58,529
Let's go to see Tu Kashe.

218
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,089
I need to get rid of him.

219
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:03,649
Eagle Division must be the one

220
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,649
to take over Shuozhou.

221
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,528
Tegin, there's no need to be angry.

222
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:16,088
If you want to surpass Eagle Division,

223
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,649
I have another plan.

224
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,770
What are you doing here?

225
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:31,930
Bear Division was badly injured.

226
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:33,889
What are you going to do?

227
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,809
Tegin.

228
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,249
Tegin, have mercy on me.

229
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,129
I swear, I promise!

230
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,489
I will kill Registrar Li.

231
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,689
Please, Tegin, give me another chance.

232
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,568
You missed your chance

233
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:57,969
and that's it. You lost it forever.

234
00:16:58,529 --> 00:16:59,448
It was your trick

235
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,649
that rendered half of the Bear Division dead.

236
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:04,009
If we give you another chance,

237
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:08,329
maybe even Eagle Division couldn't save you.

238
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,208
Tegin, god knows how eager I am

239
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,130
to serve Bear Division.

240
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,610
You think you can just kill him

241
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,929
and get things over with Great Khan?

242
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,929
Bear Division was misled by a treacherous minister.

243
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:52,449
I will explain it to Great Khan myself.

244
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,650
No need.

245
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,370
I have received Khan's order.

246
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:06,808
Now you're taking it to me.

247
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:07,650
What?

248
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,688
Are you trying to humiliate me?

249
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,009
We just want you to stop being reckless.

250
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,129
We don't want to take credit for occupying Shuozhou.

251
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,370
We just want you to stop holding us Eagle Division back.

252
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:22,489
You just can't wait to tread Bear Division underfoot, right?

253
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,010
Why the rush?

254
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,490
Then you leave us no choice but to report the truth to Great Khan.

255
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:30,289
That Tu Kashe defied his intructions openly.

256
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,129
Tegin Sun,

257
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,530
Tegin of Bear Division has received your order.

258
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:48,969
Now please.

259
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,689
Ibukan.

260
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:56,929
Ibukan!

261
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,850
Ibukan!

262
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,849
Isn't there anyone who'd guard the entrance for me?

263
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,928
This is the camp of Bear Division.

264
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,569
Do your job and guard the damn door!

265
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:14,088
Eagle Division changed their camp site.

266
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:15,928
They must be up to something.

267
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:17,009
Keep an eye on him.

268
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,009
Keep an eye on him!

269
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,810
Understand?

270
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,170
Yes!

271
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,370
And guard the damn door!

272
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,130
Just say it.

273
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:36,009
You could've just bought over that counsellor.

274
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,850
Why did you provoke Tu Kashe into killing him?

275
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:40,370
I don't like traitors.

276
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,849
But he was right.

277
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,529
Gongsun Heng got a brave general all of a sudden.

278
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,048
Things would be much easier

279
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,609
if we kill Li Shisi first.

280
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,928
You know it better than anyone that

281
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:50,889
what will happen if Great Khan leads the troops himself.

282
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,650
Why are you just laying siege to this city?

283
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,130
Sher's Wolf Division will soon take Daizhou.

284
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,329
Great Khan ordered us to assist them.

285
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:01,208
I'll send you there.

286
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:02,130
Me?

287
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,568
Ashile Sun, yes, I am a bit talktive.

288
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,808
But that doesn't mean you've got to throw me to the wolves.

289
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,289
Once this war ends, you'll leave.

290
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,249
Remember, when you're in Daizhou,

291
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,168
save some clothes of Tang defenders,

292
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,410
and don't hassle common people.

293
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,689
You don't have to tell these to Great Khan.

294
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:22,889
That's it?

295
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,810
Shouldn't you set things straight before you go?

296
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,609
Hurry!

297
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,410
Run!

298
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,448
Run! Run!

299
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:48,489
Run!

300
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,569
Hurry! Hurry!

301
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,369
Run!

302
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,650
Hurry! Run!

303
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:55,129
Hurry!

304
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,930
Run!

305
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:12,568
Help!

306
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:13,048
Help!

307
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:14,249
What's going on?

308
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,009
What are you doing?

309
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,609
- Help!
- You can't come in.

310
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,410
Help!

311
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:17,808
Open the door.

312
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,649
Open the door! Help!

313
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,409
What happened?

314
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,730
The enemies are breaking in.

315
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,769
Close the door.

316
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,928
Please, I'm begging you.

317
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:24,849
Come on.

318
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,568
Help me close the door.

319
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:26,730
Just take my kid in, okay?

320
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,249
I'm begging you!

321
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,130
Please!

322
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,249
Open the door! Open it!

323
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,568
Please!

324
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:36,688
Just let my kid in!

325
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:38,169
Please help us!

326
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,890
I'm begging you!

327
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:46,609
Let my kid in!

328
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,530
Please!

329
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,610
What are you doing?

330
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:53,009
Let them in.

331
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,810
Are you nuts?

332
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,249
Who the hell do you think you are?

333
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,688
How dare you point the scissors at me?

334
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:00,689
You're seeking your doom.

335
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:35,610
Help me!

336
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,770
Where did she go?

337
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:42,009
What are you doing here?

338
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,288
Great Khan sent us to chase after

339
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,208
the Daizhou Force that has fled from the city.

340
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:46,009
Hurry up!

341
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,690
Come on!

342
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,168
Master, where are we going now?

343
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,448
Let's go and take a look at the east side.

344
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:26,889
Right now, the east side is under siege by the Eagle Division.

345
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,729
But outside the east gate, there're towering and forested mountains.

346
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,968
We don't have our forces garrisoned there.

347
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,328
So might the Eagle Division.

348
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,088
However tight their defense might be,

349
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:34,928
I don't think they can find us

350
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:35,929
among so many mountains.

351
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,609
A'Dou,

352
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:40,730
you've really grown up.

353
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:51,928
Go now!

354
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:53,609
Master, let's go together!

355
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,410
Get someone here!

356
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,650
You followed me the whole way here.

357
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,849
I guess you want more than the Seal of Crown Prince.

358
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,169
You also want to kill me.

359
00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:30,928
So what?

360
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,968
Right now, Governor Gongsun is seriously wounded.

361
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:34,928
Shuozhou is surrounded by enemies.

362
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:37,009
Do you really have to kill me right now?

363
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,130
Cut the nonsense.

364
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:41,049
It's my duty to execute you here.

365
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,610
Princess Yongning, any last words?

366
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:55,449
Even if I were to die,

367
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,969
I wouldn't be killed by a pawn.

368
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,530
Master, are you okay?

369
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,130
Do you know who she is?

370
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,048
If you help her,

371
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:19,369
you'll regret it later, for sure.

372
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:24,968
All I know is that she's the commandant

373
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:27,610
who's protecting Shuozhou.

374
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:33,048
Young man, you must've sneaked into Shuozhou

375
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,729
before the siege by Eagle Division, right?

376
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:37,288
Then you must be clear

377
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:38,568
about what's going on here.

378
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:39,850
Governor is wounded.

379
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,809
Everyone in Shuozhou rely on Commandant Li.

380
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,010
So I won't let you hurt her.

381
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:50,370
If you insist on helping her,

382
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:54,250
we'll wait and see.

383
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,130
Senior Qin, thank you.

384
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:15,769
Senior Qin,

385
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:17,770
I have an idea.

386
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:19,370
We can get out of here.

387
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,769
Back then when we flooded Tu Kashe,

388
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,129
we pumped the stone canal dry

389
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,929
that once drained into Wuding River.

390
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,729
Master, just leave it to me.

391
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,650
You're still injured...

392
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,489
I'll go.

393
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,609
I might be a bit more familiar

394
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,010
with this place than you.

395
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:42,889
Commandant Li.

396
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:48,369
Commandant Li.

397
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,170
Governor?

398
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:53,009
Help Senior Qin out.

399
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,489
Governor.

400
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,529
- Commandant Li.
- Why are you here?

401
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,288
Senior Qin told me that you found a stone canal

402
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:58,889
that might lead out of Shuozhou.

403
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,529
Seeing you dressed like this,

404
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,569
are you going to deliver the message yourself?

405
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,849
The stone canal in the city leads straight to Wuding River.

406
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,088
Shuozhou is now under siege by the Eagle Division.

407
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,169
Wuding River is the only area with no garrison.

408
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,288
If we don't spread the message now,

409
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:15,328
I'm afraid we're running out of time.

410
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,409
I plan to get out of here

411
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,130
and deliver the message while it's still dark.

412
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,769
You've already been seriously injured.

413
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,249
And today you were almost assassinated,

414
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,809
which just made things even worse.

415
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,770
How could I let you risk your life?

416
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:31,609
Yeah, Commandant Li.

417
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,850
That guy hit you real hard.

418
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:39,129
Commandant Li, let me do it.

419
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,010
Shuozhou need you and Master.

420
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,649
You're the hope of Shuozhou.

421
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,568
Also, I'm Master's bodyguard.

422
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:46,410
This is my duty.

423
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:49,048
No.

424
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:50,649
The stone canal was built for drainage.

425
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,410
It's too small for you to get through.

426
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,288
Governor, Iet me do it.

427
00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:58,130
I can get through it.

428
00:28:58,809 --> 00:28:59,609
A'Dou!

429
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:02,249
Master, I know you're worried about me.

430
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,489
You don't want to put me at risk.

431
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,609
But you're already badly injured.

432
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,729
If you don't get a good rest,

433
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,050
you wouldn't be able to carry on.

434
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,129
You don't want to pass out halfway

435
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,050
and cause delay in reinforcement request, right?

436
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,928
So I'm the best choice for this task.

437
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,249
Governor, please place your trust in me.

438
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,808
I won't let you down.

439
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,288
Enough of this nonsense.

440
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:21,769
You're just a kid.

441
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,609
How could I put you at risk?

442
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,048
Yes, I'm too young,

443
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:27,289
and that's why I won't attract their attention.

444
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:32,168
Besides, Master accepted me as a disciple

445
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:33,729
because I'm smart.

446
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,409
I've been learning from Master for a long time.

447
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,208
I've commanded so many tricks.

448
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,129
But, when I'm back,

449
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,689
Governor, would you award me some titles?

450
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:50,010
Master, stop hesitating.

451
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,529
We've been through so much.

452
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,969
You don't think I can handle it, do you?

453
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,210
Fine.

454
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,129
Take this baggage with you and don't lose it.

455
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,489
You'll find an escape route map in it

456
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,808
and some pocket crossbows

457
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:15,448
with which you can beat off the enemies.

458
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,168
Master, nice choice.

459
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:18,328
And when I'm back in glory,

460
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:21,250
you'll all call me General Dou.

461
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:26,609
A'Dou,

462
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,449
take care of yourself.

463
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:31,208
I will, Master.

464
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:32,409
Tell everyone to hang in there

465
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,290
and wait for me.

466
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,650
Commandant Li,

467
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,569
you have a great disciple.

468
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,890
I didn't teach him anything.

469
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,890
In fact, I'm the lucky one to meet him.

470
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:07,609
Tegin.

471
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,448
I sent people to spy on Mu Jin.

472
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:14,490
But he managed to get rid of them halfway.

473
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:17,849
He seemed to be leaving for Daizhou.

474
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,650
Daizhou?

475
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,689
What does that mean?

476
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:27,089
Great Khan has taken Daizhou?

477
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,569
What's happening?

478
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:32,250
Why?

479
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,649
I know nothing at all!

480
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,009
What? Do they take our Bear Division seriously?

481
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,489
Tegin, don't be anxious.

482
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,288
I will lead a team to keep an eye on Ashile Sun.

483
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:43,249
I won't let him fool Great Khan

484
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,928
and take all the credit for occupying Shuozhou.

485
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:45,890
Enough.

486
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,769
Cut that nonsense.

487
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,968
Get lost!

488
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:49,769
Now!

489
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:01,729
Yuan.

490
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,490
You're finally back.

491
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,489
People sent food here just now.

492
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,688
They said they'd eat chaff and herbs

493
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:11,448
as long as you and the soldiers are well fed.

494
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:12,769
And I had people to send it back.

495
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,849
They saved their own food.

496
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,289
I couldn't accept it, really.

497
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,610
Madam, you are right.

498
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,169
Father.

499
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,649
Everyone is saying that

500
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,209
you're the one who's defending Shuozhou.

501
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:34,049
Your mom must have praised me again, right?

502
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:42,809
But I think, they're the reason Shuozhou exists,

503
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,849
not me.

504
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,250
I can't take the credit.

505
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,849
Check all the food provisions

506
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,568
and the grains we have.

507
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:57,169
Distribute it to the common people.

508
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,329
We must hold out till A'Dou comes back.

509
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:01,849
Yes.

510
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:40,688
Tegin,

511
00:33:40,689 --> 00:33:42,489
we've killed all the Tang soldiers around Daizhou

512
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,448
on Great Khan's command.

513
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:44,568
What about those who fled Daizhou?

514
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:45,928
They were all killed.

515
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:46,808
Good.

516
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,849
Tegin of Eagle Division has sent someone here from Shuozhou.

517
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,808
Great Khan ordered us to meet him.

518
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:51,649
Let's go back to Daizhou.

519
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,048
Don't keep that messenger waiting.

520
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:53,849
Yes.

521
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:03,529
Damn it.

522
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,769
The post road was blocked.

523
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,409
I can't send message to Changan.

524
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,288
And Daizhou fell to the enemies, too.

525
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:08,769
We won't be able to get any reinforcements.

526
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,610
What should I do now?

527
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:10,930
I must go back

528
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,530
and inform Master of this.

529
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,009
Stop.

530
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,210
You guys.

531
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,768
Find some clothes of Tang soldiers

532
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:36,288
and get changed on our way out of Daizhou.

533
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:37,089
Yes!

534
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:07,209
Come on.

535
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:07,929
Come on.

536
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,730
Get up.

537
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:20,689
Have mercy on us.

538
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,049
Don't kill us!

539
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:23,809
Please spare us!

540
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,209
Come on, kneel down.

541
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,329
Why should I?

542
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,170
They are the real culprits, the offenders.

543
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,610
Just kneel down.

544
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,009
Have mercy on us! Don't kill us! Please!

545
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:06,130
Please don't kill us!

546
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:07,569
Stop.

547
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:09,089
Stop.

548
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:11,689
Stop it.

549
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,528
Who are you?

550
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:13,889
You don't know me. That's fine.

551
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,810
But I'm sure you can recognize this spike arrow.

552
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:23,048
Since when does Eagle Division get to tell us what to do?

553
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:24,449
If you're smart, you'd get lost now.

554
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,729
You know well what Eagle Division is capable of.

555
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:28,808
I suppose you wouldn't want to die

556
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:31,089
for these refugees.

557
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,250
Let's go!

558
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,649
Go!

559
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,288
Go!

560
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,089
Go!

561
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:51,529
You should go now.

562
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,808
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

563
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:56,209
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

564
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,849
We must get back to Shuozhou as soon as possible.

565
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,929
- Yes!
- Yes!

566
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,730
Go!

567
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:02,169
Thank you!

568
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,049
Thank you! Thank you!

569
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,088
Let's go home.

570
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:15,808
Great!

571
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:16,610
Father.

572
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,889
Isn't he that... That...

573
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,130
That guy's apprentice?

574
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,048
Yes!

575
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:01,849
I know you.

576
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:05,049
Kill him. Just kill him. Now.

577
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,008
Wait!

578
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:07,809
My lord! Lord!

579
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,049
I've got an update for you.

580
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,248
Lord?

581
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,049
He's our Tegin.

582
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,649
Yeah, okay. Tegin! Tegin!

583
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,808
You got my title wrong.

584
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:19,248
Kill him. Kill him. Just kill him.

585
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:20,609
Tegin, right now you must be desperate

586
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,370
to know what's going on in Shuozhou.

587
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,289
Spare my life and I'll prove myself useful to you.

588
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,930
Then tell me how you might be helpful to us.

589
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,809
Or, I will kill you myself.

590
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,449
Tegin, you know that

591
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,808
I'm Registrar Li's trusted follower.

592
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,328
I know his tricks better than anyone.

593
00:38:58,329 --> 00:38:59,488
During the battle around Wuding River,

594
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:01,048
you lost so many soldiers.

595
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,849
The situation for you is grim.

596
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,488
I also heard that

597
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:05,528
now it's the Eagle Division that's leading the attack.

598
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:06,889
Screw you.

599
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,489
I don't want to hear any of these.

600
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,969
Did you take him to me just to piss me off?

601
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,008
Kill him. Just kill him. Kill him.

602
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:13,568
If you were still able to manage the battle,

603
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:14,409
how come you know nothing

604
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,130
about Li's promotion to Commandant?

605
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:20,488
Tegin, spare my life.

606
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:21,889
Let me talk to the generals in Shuozhou.

607
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,969
I'll make Commandant Li

608
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,489
to offer up Shuozhou submissively.

609
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:45,009
Now even a cute little cub dares to cheat me.

610
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,690
Do I look like a fool to you?

611
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:50,728
Do I?

612
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,488
Sima Jian, that liar, he cheated you.

613
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:53,409
Tegin, you don't know it.

614
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,169
Commandant Li and Governor Gongsun are dying at this moment.

615
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,528
The Eagle Division hit them real hard.

616
00:39:56,529 --> 00:39:58,768
This is the best time for negotiation.

617
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,088
I know them quite well.

618
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:02,249
I'd be the best one for this task.

619
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,568
It's been so long since the Eagle Division laid siege to Shuozhou

620
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:13,568
and people there are still closely united with high morale.

621
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:16,248
Even if I fail, which is highly unlikely,

622
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,768
it'll demoralize them greatly.

623
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:21,529
That's something Eagle Division can never do.

624
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:32,249
Let's take his words for the moment.

625
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:35,008
Tie him to my horse.

626
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:36,489
He'll be going into a battle with me.

627
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,130
Don't kill him yet.

628
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:41,089
Yes.

629
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,328
Great Khan ordered that

630
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,369
any one who makes a rash act will be executed.

631
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,170
Come on!

632
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,450
- Hang on.
- I'm too tired.

633
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:41,089
Miss, I can't take it, Miss.

634
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:44,210
Wear these.

635
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,130
Miss, you're so kind.

636
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,009
Thank you for saving my life.

637
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,850
I wish someone could save my daughter.

638
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,768
You must survive.

639
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,609
Maybe you'll get to see your daughter one day.

640
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,048
Tegin, the Eagle Division collected many clothes of the soldiers

641
00:42:26,049 --> 00:42:27,409
defending Daizhou while cleaning up the battlefield.

642
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,209
And later on their way back,

643
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,730
Mu Jin ordered the Eagle Division to change into Tang uniforms.

644
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,130
They want to grab the credit from us.

645
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,808
Gather Bear Division now!

646
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:43,609
Hurry! Come on!

647
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,959
♫ The heart gradually responds, ♫

648
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,439
♫ gradually revives, ♫

649
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,759

[The Long Ballad]
