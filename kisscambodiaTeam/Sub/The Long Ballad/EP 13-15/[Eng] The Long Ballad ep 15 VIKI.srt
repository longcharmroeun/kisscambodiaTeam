<i>The Long Ballad</i>

22

<i>Episode 15</i>

23
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:37,719
Governor!

24
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,440
Governor!

25
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:42,419
I promise you.

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,699
I'll protect Madam and Yuan.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,860
Princess.

28
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,059
Then I'm feeling relieved.

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,060
Senior Qin.

30
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,820
You can work for Changge in the future.

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,979
Senior Qin and Xu Feng have worked for me for many years.

32
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,540
If you have any difficulty,

33
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,060
they'll surely help you.

34
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,340
Senior Qin!

35
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,828
Do you want to witness governor's death because of the trade?

36
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,629
I...

37
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,628
Master.

38
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:29,349
You want me to watch you die, isn't it too cruel?

39
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,189
Senior Qin,

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,230
you always say I'm stubborn.

41
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,190
And you?

42
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,709
You're stubborn, too.

43
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,709
Work for Changge.

44
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,110
Maybe she'll realize your belief.

45
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,310
In this city,

46
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,989
at this moment not a single family has escaped.

47
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,829
They trust me so much.

48
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:31,989
I can't let them down.

49
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,510
However, I'll fail my wife and daughter.

50
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:42,509
Look.

51
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:46,030
This Dimi flower blooms beautifully.

52
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,349
We planted it together when I first met my wife.

53
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:56,510
I know it.

54
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,349
My wife likes to plant flowers.

55
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,390
But I don't have time to accompany her.

56
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,310
Honey.

57
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,190
Let's meet in our next life.

58
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,429
I'll accompany you more.

59
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:39,190
Ride a quick horse and gallop.

60
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,629
Governor!

61
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,430
Master!

62
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,109
On the way to death,

63
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:53,150
I choose to go first!

64
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,379
♫ The past can't blow away the moon light. I shall never forget ♫

65
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,134
♫ Go somewhere else and look back ♫

66
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,470
Why don't you save him?

67
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,310
Why don't you save him?

68
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,988
How could I save him?

69
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:31,388
Why don't you save him?

70
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,709
Tell me.

71
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,870
How could I save him?

72
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,949
Does it deserve?

73
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,229
He did so,

74
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,269
after thousands of years, who will remember Gongsun Heng?

75
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,109
Who will thank him?

76
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:58,750
Does it deserve?

77
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,030
He doesn't care whether he will be remembered.

78
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,590
Even if everyone blames him, so what?

79
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,350
He never cares about this.

80
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,989
What he defends with his life is just caring about people.

81
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,470
Madam.

82
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,070
Everyone will die.

83
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,350
He died for what he wants.

84
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,429
It's not his sacrifice.

85
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,549
But as the guard army leader, it's the highest glory for him.

86
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,429
He died suddenly.

87
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,549
Please give me some time.

88
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,108
I want to accompany him.

89
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:50,949
Yes, madam.

90
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,870
Commandant.

91
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,190
When did you have this idea?

92
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,389
Is it three days ago,

93
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,429
five days ago,

94
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:34,949
or everyday?

95
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,989
But you never told me.

96
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,989
We've been married for so many years.

97
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,150
How could I not know what you thought?

98
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,300
You never changed.

99
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,140
That year,

100
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,740
you married me with a bride-price of wild geese.

101
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,378
I asked you what your ambition was.

102
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:08,218
You said even if people's life was hard,

103
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:10,059
you would overcome difficulties,

104
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,059
settle the chaos

105
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,059
and protect people.

106
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,939
I thought you were bragging.

107
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:22,379
However,

108
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:29,260
you sacrificed your life for this promise.

109
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:35,980
Rest assured.

110
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,579
We've prepared winter coats for soldiers and people.

111
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,899
And we stocked seeds for next spring.

112
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,698
After everything is settled,

113
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:53,899
Shuozhou will be safe and sound as you wish.

114
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,420
We were born in this turbulent world.

115
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,459
I hope I can live a peaceful life and spend every day with you.

116
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,060
It's just a wild wish now.

117
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:12,459
Forget it.

118
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,338
You died to defend this city.

119
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:37,899
You died as you wish.

120
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:40,860
But as a mother,

121
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,860
I'm a little selfish.

122
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,699
Yuan may suffer in the future.

123
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,060
Fool!

124
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
You two fools!

125
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,819
Governor and his wife died for people.

126
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,779
They died in glory.

127
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,139
But, Princess,

128
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:52,379
do you understand what the home is, what the country is,

129
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,819
what the people are, what the world is?

130
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,740
Governor asked me to work for you.

131
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,620
But what do you believe in?

132
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,940
And what is your belief?

133
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,220
Belief...

134
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,860
My belief...

135
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,779
What is my belief?

136
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,429
♫ Your shadow left here ♫

137
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,769
♫ I wish to see you one more time ♫

138
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,339
♫ Don't ask the falling sand ♫

139
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,084
♫ does it ever miss you? ♫

140
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:09,259
I didn't expect Gongsun Heng would surrender so easily.

141
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,540
And you agreed on his conditions so easily.

142
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:14,779
Gongsun Heng is a hero.

143
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,139
He deserves our worship with wine.

144
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,739
Our brothers don't know you promised Gongsun Heng that

145
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,860
you wouldn't enslave or kill the people in Shuozhou.

146
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,698
They respect you.

147
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,060
You can just tell them.

148
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,819
But how do you explain to Great Khan?

149
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,420
You wanted to defy Great Khan's order at the beginning?

150
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:56,940
So you risked your life to meet Gongsun Heng.

151
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,420
I thought you just wanted to check if that Shisi was fine.

152
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,220
Sun.

153
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,060
Are you crazy?

154
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,860
I only care if we can get Shuozhou or not.

155
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,099
I don't want to kill all people there.

156
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,900
You!

157
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,379
You are not what you used to be.

158
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,819
When did you become so merciful?

159
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,219
There's another thing.

160
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:21,139
Ibukan is dead.

161
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,099
Tu Kashe suffered much losses.

162
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,740
When Shuozhou surrenders tomorrow,

163
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,819
make sure Tu Kashe won't cause us any trouble.

164
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,540
Do you think Shuozhou will pretend to surrender tomorrow?

165
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:35,139
You don't know them.

166
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,940
They won't.

167
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,659
They?

168
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,540
You shall go back.

169
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,330
<i>Shuozhou</i>

170
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,139
Governor.

171
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,579
Let me accompany you to see Shuozhou again.

172
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:50,899
I think I understand the reason why you wanted to guard this place.

173
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:56,699
You chose the hardest way.

174
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,980
After you died, you become god.

175
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,940
Even in hell, your soul will still be a hero.

176
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,138
Although I'm not as kind and brave as you are,

177
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,939
I'll guard this place and the people here for you!

178
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,459
Even if there're difficulties and enemies,

179
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,819
I'm not afraid.

180
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,452
<i>Shuozhou</i>

181
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,720
<i>Shuozhou</i>

182
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,018
Why did no one come out?

183
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,459
Did they pretend to surrender again?

184
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,540
We can't trust what they said.

185
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,900
Wait.

186
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,539
Why isn't Commandant Li here?

187
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,899
Has he left here?

188
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,338
I'll find him.

189
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,139
Wait.

190
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,259
He'll surely come.

191
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,148
<i>Memorial Tablet of Gongsun</i>

192
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,899
Gongsun Heng has died.

193
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,219
Shuozhou will surrender.

194
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,780
It's useless to let you live now.

195
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,780
It's not settled yet.

196
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,100
As a Princess of Tang Dynasty,

197
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,939
I'll fight for my people this time.

198
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,939
If you try to stop me, you'll be the enemy of Tang.

199
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,699
My beloved ones were all killed like dogs.

200
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,660
I was expelled from where I was born.

201
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,620
I'd rather die everyday.

202
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,140
After I settled this,

203
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,780
you can kill me.

204
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,604
<i>Shuozhou Governor Gongsun Heng</i>

205
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,819
As a princess,

206
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,539
you knelt down to the surrendered general of Sui.

207
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,900
He deserves it.

208
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,140
Because in Shuozhou,

209
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,980
because of Gongsun Heng,

210
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,179
I've found I have my own belief now.

211
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,020
I don't want to give it up.

212
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,860
He sacrificed his life to defend this city.

213
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,699
He deserves it than anyone else.

215
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,899
Did you remake the accounts of treasury and ordnance?

216
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,058
Yes.

217
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:06,938
We hid over 70 percent.

218
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:09,179
When Ashile Sun comes in with pleasure,

219
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,159
you'll send Yuan out of the city.

220
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,120
At the same time, we'll transport these things secretly.

221
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,880
Without my message,

222
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,039
no one shall come back.

223
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:23,879
You don't have confidence in this surrender, Commandant Li?

224
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,919
The cities in the north have belonged to Ashile Tribe.

225
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,439
Chang'an didn't come to rescue.

226
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,438
It seems the war in the north

227
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:34,919
is not important than Li Shimin's throne.

228
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,200
No one knows what will happen after we surrender.

229
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,160
Governor left his daughter and these property with us.

230
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
I can feel relieved after I entrust you with that.

231
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,439
He sacrificed his life to protect Shuozhou.

232
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,240
I'll protect this place for him.

233
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,468
I, Qin Gu, am just a normal person.

234
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:06,468
I'm more than 60 years old.

235
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:10,149
I worked for five masters as their adviser.

236
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,628
They're all great men.

237
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:14,429
Some of them even can be emperors.

238
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,550
But they didn't defeat Family Li and died.

239
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,580
A person like me,

240
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,220
do you really want me to work for you?

241
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,899
Although I still don't know what belief I have,

242
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:35,290
But I know one thing clearly.

243
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:38,329
I've lost my home.

244
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,480
I don't want to lose Tang.

245
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,670
Please help me.

246
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:52,628
Okay.

247
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:57,269
Whatever you do, I'll support you.

248
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,468
Okay.

249
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:00,030
We need to try our best.

250
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:02,429
Okay.

251
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:07,349
You don't need to follow me.

252
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,109
I'll go alone.

253
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:21,069
♫  Nowhere to escape. No one to rely on  ♫

254
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,958
♫  Withdrawing smiles  ♫

255
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:35,670
♫  Never give in. Forget about one's youth  ♫

256
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,049
♫  I've never been afraid of loneliness when
 embarking on this journey  ♫

257
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,971
♫  Tears and regrets go hand in hand  ♫

258
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:48,789
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. To the distance ♫

259
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,019
♫ The miserable past is like a dagger ♫

260
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,924
♫ Though my wings are broken ♫

261
00:23:54,925 --> 00:24:01,475
♫ I will keep flying ♫

262
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,819
♫ Following the direction of the light, I'll forget you ♫

263
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:15,519
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness ♫

264
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,606
♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night ♫

265
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:21,599
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad ♫

266
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:29,207
♫ The river of life is under my feet. I don't regret my craziness ♫

267
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:43,459
♫ Following the direction of the light, I'll forget you ♫

268
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,749
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness ♫

269
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,799
♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night ♫

270
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,369
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad ♫

271
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:02,816
♫ The river of life is under my feet. I don't regret my craziness ♫

272
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:33,550
Isn't this Shisi?

273
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,868
On behalf of troops and people in Shuozhou,

274
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,349
I, Commandant Li Shisi, open the gate and surrender.

275
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:45,190
Shuozhou Governor, Gongsun Heng has committed suicide due to his guilt.

276
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,729
He hoped to use his death to release the anger of Tegin.

277
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,569
His head is here.

278
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,369
Please have a look, Tegin.

279
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,760
Go.

280
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,599
Tegin.

281
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,919
This is Gongsun Heng's head.

282
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,398
You knew he's hurt?

283
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,398
I bound it up for him.

284
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:51,399
Of course I knew.

285
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,559
You're that veterinarian!

286
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:24,868
My surname is Qin and last name is Zhun.

287
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:25,669
A'Zhun?

288
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,589
Are you really A'Zhun?

289
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,989
We fought against you.

290
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,269
We knew we're sinful.

291
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:53,430
The criminal Gongsun Heng asked me to give you treasury and food.

292
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:57,030
Now we've counted it.

293
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,469
Please go inside and check, Tegin.

294
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,790
Now we'll open the gate.

295
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:10,269
Tegin and the soldiers of Ashile Tribe can take treasures in the city.

296
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:16,670
As a criminal,

297
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:29,629
I hope Tegin can spare the lives of people in Shuozhou.

298
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,438
If you had known it, why hadn't you surrendered earlier?

299
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:36,239
Now many of our brothers have died.

300
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,359
Let you go?

301
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,240
Nonsense!

302
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,199
- We can't let him go.
 - Kill him!

303
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,678
Kill him!

304
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,278
Revenge for our brothers!

305
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,798
Kill him!

306
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,479
Kill them!

307
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,438
We can't let him go!

308
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,398
We can't let him go!

309
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,239
Kill him!

310
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,918
Kill him! Kill him!

311
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:52,398
Kill him!

312
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,518
We can't let him go!

313
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,359
Kill him!

314
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,158
We can't let him go!

315
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:56,959
Kill him!

316
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,760
Why do you think I'll promise you?

317
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,839
If you want to kill me, I have nothing to say.

318
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,240
But, if you want all people in this city to die, it's impossible.

319
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:20,919
If so, I'd choose to die together.

320
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,038
You loser.

321
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,558
Why don't you surrender?

322
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,200
Loser, just surrender!

323
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,748
I can kill you now!

324
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,030
Surrender! Surrender!

325
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,630
So,

326
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,959
you think you can still fight with me now?

327
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,240
I'm not bragging.

328
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,719
But there're woods and potassium nitrate in the city.

329
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,799
If you promise not to kill us, we won't choose to die with you.

330
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,120
If you insist on killing all the people in the city,

331
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,000
we'll choose to die together with your troop.

332
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,080
I should have warned you,

333
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,000
I hate to be threatened.

334
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,880
It's not like that, Tegin.

335
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,600
This is just a trade.

336
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay.

337
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,640
I promise you.

338
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:52,798
The snow has stopped.

339
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,359
Right.

340
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,479
It's sunny again.

341
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,280
That's right.

342
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,360
Thank you for your mercy, Tegin.

343
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,840
I hope you can fulfill your promise.

344
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,519
Don't kill the people here.

345
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,360
But I have a condition.

346
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,639
I want you to be my servant.

347
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,360
I'm your master and you should work for me.

348
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,879
Good!

349
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,719
Such a good idea!

350
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,279
Now that Gongsun Heng died, he'll be the commandant of Shuozhou.

351
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,798
Let them see how their commandant became our slave now.

352
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,759
Good idea!

353
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,799
Good idea!

354
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:39,550
If you agree,

355
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,100
I won't kill the people in Shuozhou.

356
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,180
You...

357
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:47,699
You want me to be your slave?

358
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,099
Right.

359
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:51,219
My slave.

360
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,860
Now everyone in Shuozhou has known that

361
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:56,659
you betrayed your master and become a traitor.

362
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,419
You can't stay here now.

363
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:06,660
Don't make me wait.

364
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,740
I don't have patience.

365
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,260
I can withdraw my promise at anytime.

366
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:32,140
I'll be your servant.

367
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:11,660
Yuan, you're awake.

368
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,699
Where's Brother Li?

369
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,019
Brother Li said he wanted you to behave well.

370
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,900
After a while, he'll come to play with you.

371
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,218
I'll behave well.

372
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:32,500
I want to see Brother Li soon.

373
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,418
Yuan is a good girl.

374
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,380
You're such a good girl.

375
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,099
Move!

376
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,980
Step aside!

377
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:09,779
Step aside!

378
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,660
Step aside!

379
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,539
Step aside!

380
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,460
Step aside!

381
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:19,259
Just go! Be quick.

382
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:22,339
Step aside!

383
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,379
Look, what happened?

384
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,180
I don't know.

385
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:32,019
There're so many people.

386
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:01,578
Traitor! Traitor!

387
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:02,298
Traitor!

388
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:03,379
Traitor!

389
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,859
Traitor! Traitor!

390
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,139
You betrayed your master!

391
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,140
Why are you still alive?

392
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,139
Traitor!

393
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,978
You traitor!

394
00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:15,099
Governor and his wife died all because of you!

395
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,139
You traitor!

396
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,538
Why didn't you die?

397
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:18,298
You villain!

398
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:19,699
Traitor! Traitor!

399
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,049
Traitor! Traitor!

400
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,850
Why didn't you die?

401
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,420
Shameless!

402
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,460
Traitor!

403
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,498
Traitor!

404
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:31,579
It's all because of you!

405
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,498
Villain!

406
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:34,979
It's all because of you!

407
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:39,140
Just go to hell!

408
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,899
Go to hell!

409
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,738
He didn't even explain.

410
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,620
Explain?

411
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:00,900
Will it work?

412
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:05,339
People will only believe what they want to believe.

413
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:17,459
Step aside! Step aside!

414
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:17,939
Shameless!

415
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,018
Step aside!

416
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:19,819
Step aside!

417
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,539
The Governor of Shuozhou has died.

418
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,059
Great Khan admires his courage,

419
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:35,739
so he'll pardon Shuozhou.

420
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,899
Pardon us?

421
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,939
Pardon us?

422
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,498
Great.

423
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:41,058
Right.

424
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,058
Right.

425
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:43,939
We won't be killed.

426
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,818
Great.

427
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:45,978
We're pardoned.

428
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:47,018
We're pardoned.

429
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:48,499
We don't need to die.

430
00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:00,219
Tegin Sun won't betray his promise.

431
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,700
Do you feel relived now?

432
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:10,620
Look at them.

433
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,100
None of them understands your sacrifice.

434
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,259
They hate you.

435
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,339
Does it deserve?

436
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,019
Who will thank him?

437
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,180
Does it deserve?

438
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:44,900
What he defends with his life is just caring about people.

439
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,980
Yes, it does.

440
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:48,338
Sun, you really don't need to watch them packing?

441
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:51,259
What if someone can't tolerate it and kill some of our brothers?

442
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:53,380
If you are worried,

443
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,420
go to check yourself.

444
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:56,859
Where is he?

445
00:38:58,739 --> 00:38:59,738
Tu Kashe.

446
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:01,578
You're so shameless.

447
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:03,298
This is not the area of Bear Division.

448
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,778
Did we ask you to come in?

449
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:07,619
I never had defeat during these years.

450
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,978
But I has never won since I came here.

451
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,539
I have already been shameless!

452
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,259
Let me ask you, why did you let the defenders go secretly?

453
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,139
It's none of your business.

454
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,258
I asked this for Great Khan.

455
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,738
The young men in the city are either dead or injured.

456
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,219
The rest are some elders and women.

457
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,659
If we take them back, who will take care of them?

458
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,338
We can kill them and bring their heads back.

459
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:32,139
Many soldiers in Bear Division died.

460
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,299
How could I explain to them?

461
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:36,059
Many brothers in Eagle Division died as well!

462
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:39,460
If you didn't plunge into action,

463
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,660
how could we fail in camouflage?

464
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,660
Tu Kashe.

465
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,539
You ruined the plan Great Khan made.

466
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,539
Now you want to blame me on behalf of Great Khan?

467
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,420
Are you qualified?

468
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:56,219
I'm not!

469
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,139
But you can't let them go!

470
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,339
If I were you,

471
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:02,339
I'd choose to shut up.

472
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:05,140
If so,

473
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:09,620
maybe I can share some profit with you.

474
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,539
Otherwise,

475
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:15,380
I don't know what I'll write on my battle report.

476
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,779
Let's wait and see.

477
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,019
You really want to report this to Great Khan?

478
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:40,258
In the past, we were merciful to people in Tang.

479
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:41,619
No other people will know it.

480
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,249
But this time, Bear Division saw what we did.

481
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,619
They'll surely take the chance to defame us in front of Great Khan.

482
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,420
Mu Jin.

483
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,460
Remember,

484
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:54,460
It's my decision. It's not related to Eagle Division.

485
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,258
You...

486
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:57,059
Also,

487
00:40:57,979 --> 00:40:58,940
do me a favor.

488
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,578
Have a look.

489
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:07,379
What is this?

490
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,859
Here.

491
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,419
Come on.

492
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,139
What is it?

493
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,940
Have a look.

494
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,978
<i>Notice: Commandant Li Shisi was killed.</i>

495
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:20,379
If he knew this, why would he do that?

496
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,139
He must have felt guilty.

497
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,140
Since he's dead, it's all over now.

498
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,619
Commandant Li has made contributions to Shuozhou.

499
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,859
That's right.

500
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,338
He paid for it.

501
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:33,899
He has paid for it!

502
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,578
Come on, let's go.

503
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,298
Let's go.

504
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:37,539
He paid for it.

505
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,940
If you die,

506
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,660
I won't let the people here go.

507
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,380
What do you want to do?

508
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,420
Don't forget.

509
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:37,779
I've made Ashile Tribe suffer a great loss.

510
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,259
If you want me to work for you,

511
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,420
what will Tu Kashe do?

512
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:46,979
What will other tribes and Great Khan think of it?

513
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,180
What a pity!

514
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:51,900
Commandant Li has died.

515
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:54,900
From now on,

516
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,100
you'll just be a slave in Eagle Division.
