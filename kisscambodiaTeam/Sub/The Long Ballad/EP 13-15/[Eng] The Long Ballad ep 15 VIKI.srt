<i>The Long Ballad</i>

22

<i>Episode 15</i>

23
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:43,619
Governor!

24
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,340
Governor!

25
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,319
I promise you.

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,599
I'll protect Madam and Yuan.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Princess.

28
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,959
Then I'm feeling relieved.

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,960
Senior Qin.

30
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,720
You can work for Changge in the future.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,879
Senior Qin and Xu Feng have worked for me for many years.

32
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,440
If you have any difficulty,

33
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,960
they'll surely help you.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,240
Senior Qin!

35
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,728
Do you want to witness governor's death because of the trade?

36
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:28,529
I...

37
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,528
Master.

38
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:35,249
You want me to watch you die, isn't it too cruel?

39
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,089
Senior Qin,

40
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,130
you always say I'm stubborn.

41
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,090
And you?

42
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:11,609
You're stubborn, too.

43
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,609
Work for Changge.

44
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,010
Maybe she'll realize your belief.

45
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,210
In this city,

46
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:30,889
at this moment not a single family has escaped.

47
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,729
They trust me so much.

48
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,889
I can't let them down.

49
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,410
However, I'll fail my wife and daughter.

50
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:48,409
Look.

51
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,930
This Dimi flower blooms beautifully.

52
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,249
We planted it together when I first met my wife.

53
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:02,410
I know it.

54
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,249
My wife likes to plant flowers.

55
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:12,290
But I don't have time to accompany her.

56
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,210
Honey.

57
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,090
Let's meet in our next life.

58
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,329
I'll accompany you more.

59
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,090
Ride a quick horse and gallop.

60
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,529
Governor!

61
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,330
Master!

62
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,009
On the way to death,

63
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,050
I choose to go first!

64
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,279
♫ The past can't blow away the moon light. I shall never forget ♫

65
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,034
♫ Go somewhere else and look back ♫

66
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,370
Why don't you save him?

67
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,210
Why don't you save him?

68
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,888
How could I save him?

69
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:37,288
Why don't you save him?

70
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:38,609
Tell me.

71
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,770
How could I save him?

72
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,849
Does it deserve?

73
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,129
He did so,

74
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,169
after thousands of years, who will remember Gongsun Heng?

75
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,009
Who will thank him?

76
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,650
Does it deserve?

77
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,930
He doesn't care whether he will be remembered.

78
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,490
Even if everyone blames him, so what?

79
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,250
He never cares about this.

80
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,889
What he defends with his life is just caring about people.

81
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,370
Madam.

82
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,970
Everyone will die.

83
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,250
He died for what he wants.

84
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,329
It's not his sacrifice.

85
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,449
But as the guard army leader, it's the highest glory for him.

86
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,329
He died suddenly.

87
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,449
Please give me some time.

88
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,008
I want to accompany him.

89
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:56,849
Yes, madam.

90
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,770
Commandant.

91
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,090
When did you have this idea?

92
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,289
Is it three days ago,

93
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,329
five days ago,

94
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,849
or everyday?

95
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,889
But you never told me.

96
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,889
We've been married for so many years.

97
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:52,050
How could I not know what you thought?

98
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,200
You never changed.

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
That year,

100
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,640
you married me with a bride-price of wild geese.

101
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:11,278
I asked you what your ambition was.

102
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,118
You said even if people's life was hard,

103
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,959
you would overcome difficulties,

104
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,959
settle the chaos

105
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,959
and protect people.

106
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,839
I thought you were bragging.

107
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,279
However,

108
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,160
you sacrificed your life for this promise.

109
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,880
Rest assured.

110
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:46,479
We've prepared winter coats for soldiers and people.

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,799
And we stocked seeds for next spring.

112
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,598
After everything is settled,

113
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:59,799
Shuozhou will be safe and sound as you wish.

114
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,320
We were born in this turbulent world.

115
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,359
I hope I can live a peaceful life and spend every day with you.

116
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,960
It's just a wild wish now.

117
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,359
Forget it.

118
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,238
You died to defend this city.

119
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,799
You died as you wish.

120
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,760
But as a mother,

121
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,760
I'm a little selfish.

122
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,599
Yuan may suffer in the future.

123
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,960
Fool!

124
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
You two fools!

125
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:46,719
Governor and his wife died for people.

126
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,679
They died in glory.

127
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,039
But, Princess,

128
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,279
do you understand what the home is, what the country is,

129
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,719
what the people are, what the world is?

130
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,640
Governor asked me to work for you.

131
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,520
But what do you believe in?

132
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,840
And what is your belief?

133
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,120
Belief...

134
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,760
My belief...

135
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,679
What is my belief?

136
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,329
♫ Your shadow left here ♫

137
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,669
♫ I wish to see you one more time ♫

138
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,239
♫ Don't ask the falling sand ♫

139
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,984
♫ does it ever miss you? ♫

140
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:15,159
I didn't expect Gongsun Heng would surrender so easily.

141
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,440
And you agreed on his conditions so easily.

142
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,679
Gongsun Heng is a hero.

143
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,039
He deserves our worship with wine.

144
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,639
Our brothers don't know you promised Gongsun Heng that

145
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,760
you wouldn't enslave or kill the people in Shuozhou.

146
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,598
They respect you.

147
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,960
You can just tell them.

148
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,719
But how do you explain to Great Khan?

149
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,320
You wanted to defy Great Khan's order at the beginning?

150
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,840
So you risked your life to meet Gongsun Heng.

151
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,320
I thought you just wanted to check if that Shisi was fine.

152
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,120
Sun.

153
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
Are you crazy?

154
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,760
I only care if we can get Shuozhou or not.

155
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,999
I don't want to kill all people there.

156
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,800
You!

157
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,279
You are not what you used to be.

158
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,719
When did you become so merciful?

159
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,119
There's another thing.

160
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,039
Ibukan is dead.

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,999
Tu Kashe suffered much losses.

162
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,640
When Shuozhou surrenders tomorrow,

163
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,719
make sure Tu Kashe won't cause us any trouble.

164
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
Do you think Shuozhou will pretend to surrender tomorrow?

165
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,039
You don't know them.

166
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,840
They won't.

167
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,559
They?

168
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,440
You shall go back.

169
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,230
<i>Shuozhou</i>

170
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,039
Governor.

171
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,479
Let me accompany you to see Shuozhou again.

172
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:56,799
I think I understand the reason why you wanted to guard this place.

173
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:02,599
You chose the hardest way.

174
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,880
After you died, you become god.

175
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,840
Even in hell, your soul will still be a hero.

176
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,038
Although I'm not as kind and brave as you are,

177
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:16,839
I'll guard this place and the people here for you!

178
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,359
Even if there're difficulties and enemies,

179
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,719
I'm not afraid.

180
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,352
<i>Shuozhou</i>

181
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:03,620
<i>Shuozhou</i>

182
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,918
Why did no one come out?

183
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,359
Did they pretend to surrender again?

184
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,440
We can't trust what they said.

185
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,800
Wait.

186
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,439
Why isn't Commandant Li here?

187
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,799
Has he left here?

188
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,238
I'll find him.

189
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,039
Wait.

190
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,159
He'll surely come.

191
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,048
<i>Memorial Tablet of Gongsun</i>

192
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,799
Gongsun Heng has died.

193
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,119
Shuozhou will surrender.

194
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,680
It's useless to let you live now.

195
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,680
It's not settled yet.

196
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,000
As a Princess of Tang Dynasty,

197
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,839
I'll fight for my people this time.

198
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,839
If you try to stop me, you'll be the enemy of Tang.

199
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,599
My beloved ones were all killed like dogs.

200
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,560
I was expelled from where I was born.

201
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,520
I'd rather die everyday.

202
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,040
After I settled this,

203
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,680
you can kill me.

204
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,504
<i>Shuozhou Governor Gongsun Heng</i>

205
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,719
As a princess,

206
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,439
you knelt down to the surrendered general of Sui.

207
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,800
He deserves it.

208
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,040
Because in Shuozhou,

209
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,880
because of Gongsun Heng,

210
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,079
I've found I have my own belief now.

211
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,920
I don't want to give it up.

212
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
He sacrificed his life to defend this city.

213
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,599
He deserves it than anyone else.

215
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,799
Did you remake the accounts of treasury and ordnance?

216
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,958
Yes.

217
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,838
We hid over 70 percent.

218
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,079
When Ashile Sun comes in with pleasure,

219
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,059
you'll send Yuan out of the city.

220
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,020
At the same time, we'll transport these things secretly.

221
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:22,780
Without my message,

222
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:24,939
no one shall come back.

223
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:29,779
You don't have confidence in this surrender, Commandant Li?

224
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,819
The cities in the north have belonged to Ashile Tribe.

225
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,339
Chang'an didn't come to rescue.

226
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,338
It seems the war in the north

227
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,819
is not important than Li Shimin's throne.

228
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,100
No one knows what will happen after we surrender.

229
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,060
Governor left his daughter and these property with us.

230
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,660
I can feel relieved after I entrust you with that.

231
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,339
He sacrificed his life to protect Shuozhou.

232
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,140
I'll protect this place for him.

233
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,368
I, Qin Gu, am just a normal person.

234
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,368
I'm more than 60 years old.

235
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:16,049
I worked for five masters as their adviser.

236
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,528
They're all great men.

237
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:20,329
Some of them even can be emperors.

238
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,450
But they didn't defeat Family Li and died.

239
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,480
A person like me,

240
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,120
do you really want me to work for you?

241
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,799
Although I still don't know what belief I have,

242
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:41,190
But I know one thing clearly.

243
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:44,229
I've lost my home.

244
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:47,380
I don't want to lose Tang.

245
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,570
Please help me.

246
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:58,528
Okay.

247
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:03,169
Whatever you do, I'll support you.

248
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,368
Okay.

249
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:05,930
We need to try our best.

250
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:08,329
Okay.

251
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,249
You don't need to follow me.

252
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,009
I'll go alone.

253
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,969
♫  Nowhere to escape. No one to rely on  ♫

254
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,858
♫  Withdrawing smiles  ♫

255
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:41,570
♫  Never give in. Forget about one's youth  ♫

256
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,949
♫  I've never been afraid of loneliness when
embarking on this journey  ♫

257
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,871
♫  Tears and regrets go hand in hand  ♫

258
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:54,689
♫ But my heart is still fiery-hot. To the distance ♫

259
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,919
♫ The miserable past is like a dagger ♫

260
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,824
♫ Though my wings are broken ♫

261
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:07,375
♫ I will keep flying ♫

262
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,719
♫ Following the direction of the light, I'll forget you ♫

263
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,419
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness ♫

264
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,506
♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night ♫

265
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:27,499
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad ♫

266
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:35,107
♫ The river of life is under my feet. I don't regret my craziness ♫

267
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:49,359
♫ Following the direction of the light, I'll forget you ♫

268
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,649
♫ The memory shaped my stubbornness ♫

269
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,699
♫ By virtue of the light in the dark night ♫

270
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,269
♫ I'll return it with a long ballad ♫

271
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:08,716
♫ The river of life is under my feet. I don't regret my craziness ♫

272
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:39,450
Isn't this Shisi?

273
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,768
On behalf of troops and people in Shuozhou,

274
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:46,249
I, Commandant Li Shisi, open the gate and surrender.

275
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:51,090
Shuozhou Governor, Gongsun Heng has committed suicide due to his guilt.

276
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:56,629
He hoped to use his death to release the anger of Tegin.

277
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,469
His head is here.

278
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,269
Please have a look, Tegin.

279
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,660
Go.

280
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:42,499
Tegin.

281
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,819
This is Gongsun Heng's head.

282
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,298
You knew he's hurt?

283
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:56,298
I bound it up for him.

284
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:57,299
Of course I knew.

285
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,459
You're that veterinarian!

286
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,768
My surname is Qin and last name is Zhun.

287
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:31,569
A'Zhun?

288
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,489
Are you really A'Zhun?

289
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,889
We fought against you.

290
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,169
We knew we're sinful.

291
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:59,330
The criminal Gongsun Heng asked me to give you treasury and food.

292
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,930
Now we've counted it.

293
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,369
Please go inside and check, Tegin.

294
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,690
Now we'll open the gate.

295
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:16,169
Tegin and the soldiers of Ashile Tribe can take treasures in the city.

296
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:22,570
As a criminal,

297
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:35,529
I hope Tegin can spare the lives of people in Shuozhou.

298
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,338
If you had known it, why hadn't you surrendered earlier?

299
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,139
Now many of our brothers have died.

300
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,259
Let you go?

301
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,140
Nonsense!

302
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,099
- We can't let him go.
- Kill him!

303
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,578
Kill him!

304
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:49,178
Revenge for our brothers!

305
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,698
Kill him!

306
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,379
Kill them!

307
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,338
We can't let him go!

308
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,298
We can't let him go!

309
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,139
Kill him!

310
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,818
Kill him! Kill him!

311
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,298
Kill him!

312
00:28:58,299 --> 00:28:59,418
We can't let him go!

313
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:00,259
Kill him!

314
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,058
We can't let him go!

315
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:02,859
Kill him!

316
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,660
Why do you think I'll promise you?

317
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,739
If you want to kill me, I have nothing to say.

318
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:23,140
But, if you want all people in this city to die, it's impossible.

319
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:26,819
If so, I'd choose to die together.

320
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,938
You loser.

321
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,458
Why don't you surrender?

322
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:35,100
Loser, just surrender!

323
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,648
I can kill you now!

324
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:38,930
Surrender! Surrender!

325
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,530
So,

326
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,859
you think you can still fight with me now?

327
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,140
I'm not bragging.

328
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,619
But there're woods and potassium nitrate in the city.

329
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,699
If you promise not to kill us, we won't choose to die with you.

330
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,020
If you insist on killing all the people in the city,

331
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,900
we'll choose to die together with your troop.

332
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,980
I should have warned you,

333
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:22,900
I hate to be threatened.

334
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,780
It's not like that, Tegin.

335
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:27,500
This is just a trade.

336
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,900
Okay.

337
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,540
I promise you.

338
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,698
The snow has stopped.

339
00:30:58,699 --> 00:30:59,259
Right.

340
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,379
It's sunny again.

341
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,180
That's right.

342
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:04,260
Thank you for your mercy, Tegin.

343
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,740
I hope you can fulfill your promise.

344
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:09,419
Don't kill the people here.

345
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,260
But I have a condition.

346
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,539
I want you to be my servant.

347
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:17,260
I'm your master and you should work for me.

348
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:28,779
Good!

349
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,619
Such a good idea!

350
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,179
Now that Gongsun Heng died, he'll be the commandant of Shuozhou.

351
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,698
Let them see how their commandant became our slave now.

352
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:40,659
Good idea!

353
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,699
Good idea!

354
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:45,450
If you agree,

355
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,000
I won't kill the people in Shuozhou.

356
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,080
You...

357
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,599
You want me to be your slave?

358
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:54,999
Right.

359
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,119
My slave.

360
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,760
Now everyone in Shuozhou has known that

361
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,559
you betrayed your master and become a traitor.

362
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,319
You can't stay here now.

363
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,560
Don't make me wait.

364
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,640
I don't have patience.

365
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,160
I can withdraw my promise at anytime.

366
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,040
I'll be your servant.

367
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,560
Yuan, you're awake.

368
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,599
Where's Brother Li?

369
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,919
Brother Li said he wanted you to behave well.

370
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,800
After a while, he'll come to play with you.

371
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:35,118
I'll behave well.

372
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,400
I want to see Brother Li soon.

373
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,318
Yuan is a good girl.

374
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,280
You're such a good girl.

375
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,999
Move!

376
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,880
Step aside!

377
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,679
Step aside!

378
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,560
Step aside!

379
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,439
Step aside!

380
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,360
Step aside!

381
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,159
Just go! Be quick.

382
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,239
Step aside!

383
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,279
Look, what happened?

384
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,080
I don't know.

385
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:37,919
There're so many people.

386
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,478
Traitor! Traitor!

387
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,198
Traitor!

388
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,279
Traitor!

389
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,759
Traitor! Traitor!

390
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,039
You betrayed your master!

391
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Why are you still alive?

392
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,039
Traitor!

393
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,878
You traitor!

394
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:20,999
Governor and his wife died all because of you!

395
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,039
You traitor!

396
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,438
Why didn't you die?

397
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,198
You villain!

398
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,599
Traitor! Traitor!

399
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,949
Traitor! Traitor!

400
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,750
Why didn't you die?

401
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:30,320
Shameless!

402
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,360
Traitor!

403
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,398
Traitor!

404
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,479
It's all because of you!

405
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,398
Villain!

406
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:40,879
It's all because of you!

407
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:45,040
Just go to hell!

408
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,799
Go to hell!

409
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,638
He didn't even explain.

410
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,520
Explain?

411
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,800
Will it work?

412
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:11,239
People will only believe what they want to believe.

413
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,359
Step aside! Step aside!

414
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,839
Shameless!

415
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,918
Step aside!

416
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:25,719
Step aside!

417
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,439
The Governor of Shuozhou has died.

418
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,959
Great Khan admires his courage,

419
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:41,639
so he'll pardon Shuozhou.

420
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,799
Pardon us?

421
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,839
Pardon us?

422
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,398
Great.

423
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:46,958
Right.

424
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:47,958
Right.

425
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,839
We won't be killed.

426
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,718
Great.

427
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,878
We're pardoned.

428
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:52,918
We're pardoned.

429
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,399
We don't need to die.

430
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:06,119
Tegin Sun won't betray his promise.

431
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,600
Do you feel relived now?

432
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,520
Look at them.

433
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,000
None of them understands your sacrifice.

434
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,159
They hate you.

435
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,239
Does it deserve?

436
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,919
Who will thank him?

437
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,080
Does it deserve?

438
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,800
What he defends with his life is just caring about people.

439
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,880
Yes, it does.

440
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:54,238
Sun, you really don't need to watch them packing?

441
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,159
What if someone can't tolerate it and kill some of our brothers?

442
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,280
If you are worried,

443
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,320
go to check yourself.

444
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:02,759
Where is he?

445
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,638
Tu Kashe.

446
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,478
You're so shameless.

447
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,198
This is not the area of Bear Division.

448
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,678
Did we ask you to come in?

449
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,519
I never had defeat during these years.

450
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,878
But I has never won since I came here.

451
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:16,439
I have already been shameless!

452
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,159
Let me ask you, why did you let the defenders go secretly?

453
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,039
It's none of your business.

454
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,158
I asked this for Great Khan.

455
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,638
The young men in the city are either dead or injured.

456
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,119
The rest are some elders and women.

457
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,559
If we take them back, who will take care of them?

458
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,238
We can kill them and bring their heads back.

459
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,039
Many soldiers in Bear Division died.

460
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,199
How could I explain to them?

461
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:41,959
Many brothers in Eagle Division died as well!

462
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,360
If you didn't plunge into action,

463
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,560
how could we fail in camouflage?

464
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,560
Tu Kashe.

465
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,439
You ruined the plan Great Khan made.

466
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:55,439
Now you want to blame me on behalf of Great Khan?

467
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,320
Are you qualified?

468
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,119
I'm not!

469
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,039
But you can't let them go!

470
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,239
If I were you,

471
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:08,239
I'd choose to shut up.

472
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,040
If so,

473
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:15,520
maybe I can share some profit with you.

474
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,439
Otherwise,

475
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,280
I don't know what I'll write on my battle report.

476
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,679
Let's wait and see.

477
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,919
You really want to report this to Great Khan?

478
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:46,158
In the past, we were merciful to people in Tang.

479
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,519
No other people will know it.

480
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,149
But this time, Bear Division saw what we did.

481
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,519
They'll surely take the chance to defame us in front of Great Khan.

482
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,320
Mu Jin.

483
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Remember,

484
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:00,360
It's my decision. It's not related to Eagle Division.

485
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,158
You...

486
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:02,959
Also,

487
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:04,840
do me a favor.

488
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,478
Have a look.

489
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:13,279
What is this?

490
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,759
Here.

491
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,319
Come on.

492
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,039
What is it?

493
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,840
Have a look.

494
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,878
<i>Notice: Commandant Li Shisi was killed.</i>

495
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:26,279
If he knew this, why would he do that?

496
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,039
He must have felt guilty.

497
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Since he's dead, it's all over now.

498
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,519
Commandant Li has made contributions to Shuozhou.

499
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,759
That's right.

500
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,238
He paid for it.

501
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,799
He has paid for it!

502
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,478
Come on, let's go.

503
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:42,198
Let's go.

504
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,439
He paid for it.

505
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,840
If you die,

506
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,560
I won't let the people here go.

507
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,280
What do you want to do?

508
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Don't forget.

509
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,679
I've made Ashile Tribe suffer a great loss.

510
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,159
If you want me to work for you,

511
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,320
what will Tu Kashe do?

512
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:52,879
What will other tribes and Great Khan think of it?

513
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,080
What a pity!

514
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,800
Commandant Li has died.

515
00:42:59,919 --> 00:43:00,800
From now on,

516
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
you'll just be a slave in Eagle Division.
