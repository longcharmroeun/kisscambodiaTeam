<i>The Long Ballad</i>

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,400
<i>This is a work of fiction.</i>

4
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,159
<i>Episode 14</i>

5
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,280
Hurry and gather the Bear Army!

6
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,519
Quick!

7
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,920
But Mu Jin discovered me.

8
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,040
This is from him.

9
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
- Go. - Yes.

10
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,879
<i>Anyone who acts rashly will be killed.</i>

11
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,879
<i>As ordered by Great Khan.</i>

12
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,840
Don't try to use Great Khan to pressure me!

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,159
But Your Highness,

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,319
if this is truly Great Khan's instruction,

15
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
won't we be messing up Great Khan's plan...

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,719
if we send out our troops now?

17
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,519
- I'm afraid... - Afraid of what?

18
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,719
If you don't send the troops now,

19
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,719
we'll always be at the Eagle Army's feet.

20
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,810
Send out the troops and gather the Bear Army now!

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,439
Your Highness.

22
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,560
Why are you laughing?

23
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,199
Do you want to die?

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,039
I'm laughing at the fact that the mighty prince...

25
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,719
of the Eagle Army is actually such a coward.

26
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,439
Is that so?

27
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,759
Your Highness, you'll choke him to death.

28
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,479
That's what I want to do!

29
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,439
Calm down, Your Highness.

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,199
If you kill me,

31
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,759
you'll lose your last chance...

32
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,000
to bring down the Eagle Army.

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,360
You'd better behave.

34
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,080
Just say what you want to say.

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
Don't waste His Highness's time.

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
Commandant Li, the one who is protecting the city,

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
is my brother.

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm the best bargaining chip you have to negotiate with him.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
How much are you worth?

40
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
To my brother,

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm worth at least half of Shuozhou City.

42
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,919
You're not lying, are you?

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,840
If I'm not worth it,

44
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,719
you can kill me anytime you want.

45
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,759
Stop.

46
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,800
Didn't we agree to meet at the city wall?

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,080
We just received news...

48
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,840
that Tu Ka She and Yi Bu Kan are heading towards Shuozhou...

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,039
with someone from the Central Plain.

50
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,639
We must move as fast as we can...

51
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,199
and get there before they do something stupid.

52
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,840
Otherwise, all our plans will go to waste.

53
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,719
Bring the disguise to His Highness!

54
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,719
Yes.

55
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,479
Commandant Li, the Bear Army is here.

56
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,680
How dare they still come here?

57
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,479
There aren't many of them, but the strange thing is...

58
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,719
there's someone from the Central Plain with them.

59

<i>Auspicious clouds in the sky</i>

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mr. Li.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,759
Look who's here.

64
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,959
<i>Shuozhou</i>

65
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,759
Dou.

66
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,759
Dou.

67
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,879
<i>Shuozhou</i>

68
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,279
Speak! Ask them to open the gate!

69
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,879
I told you to speak!

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,079
Ask them to open the gate!

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
I said talk!

72
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,920
Ask them to open the city gate.

73
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,639
If you touch him again,

74
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,360
I'll break your bones.

75
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,279
Mr. Li.

76
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,439
As long as you open the gate...

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
and come out to talk to us,

78
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,600
I'll let him go.

79
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,079
Or else,

80
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,959
I'll beat him to death right in front of you.

81
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,959
Commandant Li.

82
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,959
- Commandant Li! - Let go of me!

83
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,000
Let me go!

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,560
The Bear Army is too close to the gate.

85
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,680
If we open the gate even just a crack,

86
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,920
they can barge right in.

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,279
The consequences would be unthinkable.

88
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,399
That's right, Commandant Li.

89
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
You're a monster.

90
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,279
You're even hitting a kid.

to be a general.

95
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Dou.

96
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,000
No.

97
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,040
Hold on, I'm coming to save you.

98
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,079
Commandant Li!

99
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,120
Commandant Li.

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,360
- You can't. - Let go!

101
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,680
- You can't go. - Commandant!

102
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,920
- Commandant Li. - Let go!

103
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,079
We can't put...

104
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,160
the entire Shuozhou in jeopardy just for Dou.

a general.

111
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,679
I think Dou is saying something.

112
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
I am...

113
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,960
going to be...

114
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
a general.

115
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,000
Dou isn't kneeling...

116
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,240
because he's begging us to open the gate to save him.

117
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,559
He's saying...

118
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,000
<i>Auspicious clouds in the sky</i>

119
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Don't be silly.

120
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,799
Dou.

121
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,559
Don't be silly, Dou.

122
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,159
Get up.

123
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,360
Hurry and get up.

124
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,519
Get up, Dou.

125
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,960
Master.

126
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,799
I...

127
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,330
I can finally be a general.

128
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,120
I can finally become your subordinate.

129
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,759
Dou, you can be a general after you've grown up.

130
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,200
I'll take you away.

131
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,080
You can't die here, Dou.

132
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,120
I'll take you away.

133
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Master.

134
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,360
I can do it.

135
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,679
I can do it.

136
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,799
No.

137
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,399
Dou, you can't.

138
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,440
Dou, get up!

139
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,919
Daizhou has been occupied.

140
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,960
There are no reinforcements!

141
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,519
You little liar!

142
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll kill you.

143
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,120
Dou!

144
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,639
I thought he said there are no reinforcements.

145
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,159
What's this then?

146
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,039
They're the Ashina Tribe disguised as reinforcements.

147
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,399
Send a signal with the flag!

148
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,240
Dispatch 10,000 soldiers!

149
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,159
We can't let these Ashina Tribe people...

150
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,000
disguised as reinforcements...

151
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
take even a step closer to Shuozhou City!

152
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
- Commandant Li! - Commandant Li!

153
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Send a signal with the flag! Now!

154
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,879
Quick!

155
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,120
Reinforce Commandant Li!

156
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Quick!

157
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,519
Your Highness.

158
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,559
Ashina Sun's plans...

159
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,720
have all been ruined by that boy.

160
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,840
What should we do?

161
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Why don't we seize the opportunity and lead the attack?

162
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,039
You killed our most valuable hostage.

163
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,840
You sure arranged this well.

164
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Attack?

165
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,279
How are we supposed to attack with such a few people?

166
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,559
Let's step back first.

167
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,919
We'll see how things are when they get here.

168
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,679
Yes.

169
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,679
Retreat!

170
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,159
Stop.

171
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,519
- Kill! - Kill!

172
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,000
- Kill! - Kill!

173
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,679
Bear Army, retreat!

174
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,600
- Retreat! - Retreat!

175
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,000
Retreat!

176
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,679
Tu Ka She, that dirtbag!

177
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,240
He chickened out at the last minute.

178
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,440
Ashina Sun, they're determined to fight to the death.

179
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,559
At this rate, things won't look good for us.

180
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,879
This stab...

181
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,679
is for Dou.

182
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,279
Don't kill me.

183
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,240
This kick...

184
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,919
is for the people of Shuozhou.

185
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,720
An army burning with indignation is bound to win.

186
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,960
Tu Ka She has already caused us to lose our advantage.

187
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Let's retreat for now.

188
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,639
Come on.

This last slash...

190
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,039
is for the warriors who died in battle.

191
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,279
It's not my fault.

192
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,480
No! Don't kill me!

<i>General Dou's Tomb</i>

195
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,890
I don't know who you are,

196
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,839
but I'm sure you're not a lowly person.

197
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,720
I live a hard life.

198
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,039
I'm afraid no one would even know...

199
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,359
if I died in a canal.

200
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,359
If I can follow you and live a spectacular life,

201
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,119
it would be worth it even if I die.

202
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,890
Master, you're my future.

203
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,759
I'll follow you, no matter if I'll live or die.

204
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,039
Since I'm going to be your master,

205
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,319
of course we must have a formal ceremony.

206
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,359
From now on,

207
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,480
you're my disciple.

208
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,559
The two of us won't fail each other.

209
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,279
When I return with glory,

210
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,839
you'll have to call me...

211
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,170
General Dou.

212
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
I am going to be a general.

213
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,170

214
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,039

Congratulations on your triumphant return, General Dou.

216
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,039
Congratulations on your triumphant return, General Dou.

Master, our two armies are at battle right now.

223
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,279
Ashina Sun is their prince.

224
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,359
Why did you write this letter?

225
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,890
What's the matter?

226
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,480
Are you worried that I might collude with the enemy?

227
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,000
I wouldn't dare.

228
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,559
I was only joking.

229
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,170
You've been with me for years.

230
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,799
When have I ever done anything I have no confidence in?

231
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,960
I have a plan for everything.

232
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,650
Everything is under my control.

233
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,319
You just need to make sure...

234
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,759
to hand this letter to him.

235
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,359
Yes.

236
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,599
Governor Gongsun.

237
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,759
Governor Gongsun, I have a plan.

238
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,200
- Tell me. - Governor Gongsun.

239
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,319
When the weather turns cold in the seventh month,

240
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,319
the north wind will rise.

241
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,799
We can pretend to retreat...

242
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,680
and give up Shuozhou City to the Eagle Army.

243
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,079
Then, we can set up potassium nitrate...

244
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,079
and dry wood in the city.

245
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,680
Once Ashina Sun's army enters the city,

246
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,720
we'll start a fire.

247
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
With the advantage of the north wind,

248
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,039
we'll surely burn every single one of them.

249
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,559
What if Ashina Sun's army continues to besiege the city?

250
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,200
The provisions in the city...

251
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,240
can only feed our people for three days.

252
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,359
But if we go with your plan,

253
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:14,079
both the evil and the innocent will be destroyed together.

254
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:17,799
All the civilians of Shuozhou will become refugees.

255
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,119
Commandant Li.

256
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,279
Between these two difficult choices,

257
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,960
do you think the price we have to pay for the latter...

258
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
is more worthwhile?

259
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,599
I...

260
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,160
Why do you think...

261
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,319
I want to protect Shuozhou?

262
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,880
What I want to protect...

263
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,799
is not a fortress...

264
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,319
but the thriving city of Shuozhou...

265
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,400
where tens of thousands of citizens are settled.

266
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
If it weren't for this,

267
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,680
I wouldn't have surrendered to the Li family...

268
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,759
after the rise of the Tang Dynasty in Jinyang.

269
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,359
Thinking about it now,

270
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,440
fighting or surrendering...

271
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,519
is merely a means to an end.

272
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,359
Keeping the people in peace and away from war...

273
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,079
is the most important thing.

274
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,680
These are also the principles I've been holding onto it...

275
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,160
in my heart.

276
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Governor Gongsun.

277
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,240
You're not thinking...

278
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,880
of surrendering to the Ashina Tribe, are you?

279
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,079
Did Dou and all the warriors that sacrificed in battle...

280
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,279
all die in vain?

281
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,359
Commandant Li.

282
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,279
Calm down.

283
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,319
I was just drawing an analogy.

284
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,160
Sorry for being rude.

285
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,640
All right, Commandant Li.

286
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,000
It's late.

287
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,160
I've already secured a plan...

288
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,000
to repulse the enemy.

289
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,960
Let's discuss the rest tomorrow.

290
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Yes.

291
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,599
Your Highness really came here alone.

292
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,519
I'm impressed.

293
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,839
I've heard a lot about you.

294
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,920
Since you invited me here,

295
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,720
you wouldn't set up an ambush.

296
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Besides,

297
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,200
aren't you the same?

298
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,839
What do you want to discuss with me?

299
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
You can just cut to the chase.

300
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,000
If Shuozhou surrenders to you,

301
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,319
can you guarantee...

302
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,200
not to take the lives of the civilians?

303
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,759
What if...

304
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,400
I take advantage of this north wind and incinerate the city?

305
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,079
Although I don't expect the Eagle Army to die with me,

306
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,400
all you'll end up getting are the ashes of Shuozhou City.

307
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm sure...

308
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,599
this isn't the ending Your Highness would want.

309
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,759
If that is your plan,

310
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,039
you wouldn't have put it off until now,

311
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,200
nor would you threaten me with it.

312
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,599
It's not a threat.

313
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,680
I'm asking you a favor.

314
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,519
I'm curious.

315
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,680
Why are you asking me this?

316
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,160
I've been attacking the city with my troops for days.

317
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,000
Shuozhou's defending troops suffered heavy casualties.

318
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,799
In your eyes,

319
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,759
am I the type of person who is soft-hearted?

320
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,880
When the troops of the Eagle Army...

321
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,240
burned down the granary,

322
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,480
you could've also burned...

323
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,720
the civilians nearby along with it.

324
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,160
Then I would've been forced to do anything to save the people.

325
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,720
But you didn't do that.

326
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,440
Instead, you let them live...

327
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,200
and informed me to come quickly.

328
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,319
This proves...

329
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,799
you don't want to do any unnecessary killing.

330
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,960
All these years,

331
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,079
you've been leading the Eagle Army to fight battles everywhere.

332
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,799
I've long heard about your way of doing things.

333
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,240
I believe...

334
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,160
you have the capability...

335
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,880
and the will...

336
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,240
to save their lives.

337
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
However,

338
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,920
all these years,

339
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,599
I've fought...

340
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,240
with the Ashina Tribe many times.

341
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,680
All of the Ashina Tribe people...

342
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,880
have a lot of resentment towards me and Shuozhou City.

343
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,519
Now,

344
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,920
if I'm going to give away my city,

345
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,359
then I should be very sincere.

346
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,359
I will give you...

347
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,079
a gift that will satisfy,

348
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,839
relieve, and appease...

349
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,440
all of the soldiers in the Ashina army.

350
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,000
I won't put Your Highness in a difficult position.

351
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,359
Have you thought it through?

352
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,119
Is it really worth it to give everything up like this?

353
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,079
When it comes to certain things,

354
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,920
there's no turning back.

355
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:54,960
It's just a gift.

356
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,440
Compared to the safety of the people in Shuozhou,

357
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,039
this is nothing.

358
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
I have...

359
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,680
no regrets.

360
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,279
I finally know...

361
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,960
how you got the name "the protector of the people".

362
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,279
Don't worry, Governor Gongsun.

363
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,519
I agree...

364
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,000
with your proposal.

365
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,759
I will surely keep my promise.

366
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Okay.

367
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Right here,

368
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,559
on behalf of the people of Shuozhou,

369
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
I thank you.

370
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,440
<i>Prefectural Governor's Manor</i>

371
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,279
We've been in battle after battle recently.

372
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,799
You've all worked hard guarding the city day and night.

373
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,640
Don't say that, Governor Gongsun.

374
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,279
You've been doing everything you can...

375
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,799
for all the civilians. It's even harder on you.

376
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,599
Yes.

377
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,079
You are our backbone.

378
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,960
It's all thanks to you...

379
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,079
that all the people of Shuozhou are united and protecting the city,

380
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,200
with no fear of death.

381
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,759
This battle has been tragic.

382
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
We must appropriately arrange...

383
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
the bereavement compensation for the soldiers who sacrificed.

384
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,880
When it's the right timing,

385
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,359
we must also send someone to Chang'an...

386
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,400
to report the situation here in Shuozhou...

387
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,640
and ask for help.

388
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,480
Over the recent years,

389
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,079
Shuozhou has been suffering from poor harvests.

390
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,319
Now, the granary has been burnt down...

391
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,720
and our military colony fields are destroyed.

392
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,519
This makes our situation even worse.

393
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
How are we going to get through this winter?

394
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
What will we do about the livelihood of our people in the coming year?

395
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,480
You'll need to think about these problems carefully.

396
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,440
In the future, there will be a lot to take care of in Shuozhou.

397
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,960
I hope all of you will do your best.

398
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I hereby...

399
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,680
thank everyone in advance...

400
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,400
on behalf of the soldiers and civilians of Shuozhou.

401
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,319
There's no need for that, Governor Gongsun.

402
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,079
It's our duty.

403
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,359
You don't need to thank us.

404
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,079
I am thanking you...

405
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,799
for your deep kindness...

406
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,319
on behalf of the Shuozhou soldiers and citizens.

407
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Commandant Li.

408
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,359
It's difficult to turn down such gratitude.

409
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,200
Just accept it...

410
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,279
and drink this cup of wine.

411
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Here.

412
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,160
Madam's millet wine is indeed the best.

413
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,839
It's so sweet and rich.

414
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,319
It's been a while since you've had a break.

415
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,000
Drink more if you like it.

416
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,720
This is a family meal.

417
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,880
Just relax yourselves.

418
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,599
Be good, Yuan Er.

419
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
Put the wooden sword down first.

420
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,759
We'll play after dinner, okay?

421
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Okay.

422
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,440
Yuan Er got this wooden sword today...

423
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,799
and wouldn't let go of it.

424
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,119
I asked her why.

425
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,960
She said she wants to protect the people and help the weak,

426
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,240
just like Shi Si, Dou, and her father.

427
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
You must grow up quickly then, Yuan Er.

428
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,119
When you grow up,

429
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,240
we'll eliminate evil together.

430
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,880
That's great.

431
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,000
Yuan Niang,

432
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,680
hurry and say thank you to Shi Si.

433
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,880
If that's really what you aspire to do,

434
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,160
then learn some martial arts to protect yourself.

435
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,640
If one day,

436
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,559
Father isn't with you anymore,

437
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,359
you'll be able to protect yourself...

438
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,079
and you won't be bullied by bad people.

439
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,480
Why won't Father be here?

440
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,359
Silly girl.

441
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,920
Are you never going to get married?

442
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,720
Are you going to stay by my side...

443
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,960
until you become an old lady?

444
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,279
Honey, let me drink to you too.

445
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,759
All these years,

446
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,200
I put all my focus on fighting on the frontlines.

447
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,920
I have to thank you...

448
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,279
for giving me support,

449
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,000
looking after the wounded,

450
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,240
taking care of the logistics,

451
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,519
and pacifying the people.

452
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,400
You had to take on all those burdens alone.

453
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,240
You even took care...

454
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,839
and taught our Yuan Er...

455
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,000
by yourself.

456
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,599
I really don't know...

457
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,000
how I can repay you for everything you've done for me.

458
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,880
We complement each other...

459
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,759
and understand one another.

460
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,759
You don't need to repay me.

461
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,079
You have your principles.

462
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,359
This is also my choice.

463
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,960
I told you this before.

464
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,319
If there's something you want to do, just do it.

465
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,119
Even though I'm just the madam of this back courtyard,

466
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,240
I'll keep up with you...

467
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,440
and walk your path with you.

468
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,119
Honey.

469
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,119
You have to take care of your health.

470
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,279
It's autumn now.

471
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,799
You need to nourish your health.

472
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,400
Otherwise, when the winter comes,

473
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,000
you'll feel the cold...

474
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,359
and have trouble sleeping again.

475
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,799
You don't have to worry about me.

476
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,079
The winter is rough,

477
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,769
but spring will eventually come.

478
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:36,920
Spring will eventually come.

479
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Here.

480
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,639
We need another drink.

481
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,239
This drink...

482
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,079
is a toast to Shuozhou.

483
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,769
After experiencing this calamity, I hope Shuozhou will be blessed...

484
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,559
with good weather,

485
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,960
have good harvests, just like things used to be.

486
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,920
With you here, it will definitely happen.

487
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,239
Come on.

488
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:24,440
<i>Protect the frontier to bring peace to the people</i>

489
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:28,880
Governor Gongsun, did you ask me to stay behind...

490
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
because you have other orders?

491
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:38,000
Commandant Li, please have a seat.

492
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Please.

493
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,880
Inside is Shuozhou City's defense map.

494
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,199
All our supplies,

495
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,559
grain depots, and the treasury...

496
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,679
are all clearly marked on it.

497
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,440
As for this command token...

498
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:08,289
With this,

499
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:11,079
you can mobilize Shuozhou's defending troops...

500
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
and the people in this manor.

501
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,480
Why are you giving me these?

502
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,039
All the troops of Shuozhou listen to your orders.

503
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,400
Why are you giving me the command token?

504
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,719
Shuozhou's defending troops only listened to my orders...

505
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,639
because I've always been here.

506
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,079
Governor Gongsun.

507
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,039
What do you mean?

508
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:38,199
I've made up my mind.

509
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,599
Tomorrow, we'll open the city gates and surrender.

510
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,480
Ashina Sun has also already promised me...

511
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,000
that he'll make sure all the civilians will live.

512
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
At what cost?

513
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
What's the price we have to pay?

514
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,199
The price?

515
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,440
The price is...

516
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,559
my life.

517
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,199
Governor Gongsun.

518
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,920
Please give me a little more time.

519
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:13,159
I'll definitely come up with a foolproof plan.

520
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:15,440
This is already the best option we have.

521
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
Governor Gongsun.

522
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,559
All these years,

523
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,880
the Ashina Tribe has never occupied Shuozhou City.

524
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,639
So to the troops of Shuozhou,

525
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,400
as long as I'm still alive,

526
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,079
they'll never surrender...

527
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,559
even if they're down to their last stand.

528
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,840
But to the Ashina Tribe,

529
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,159
I've guarded the frontier for years.

530
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,159
Their Great Khan has lost countless battles against me.

531
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,199
He hates me to the core.

532
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:42,159
Now, I can only offer up my life...

533
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,519
in order to dispel his doubts and resentment.

534
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,159
This is also the only way...

535
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,000
to get the people in the city a chance of survival.

536
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,079
No, I won't allow it.

537
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,809
There must be another way.

538
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:07,289
Being able to entrust the lives of the civilians in Shuozhou City...

539
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:09,119
to a Tang princess...

540
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,039
and commit an act of benevolence...

541
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,480
is considered a happy ending for me.

542
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,559
Princess Yongning is very smart.

543
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:21,719
You still have a lot to do in the future...

544
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,360
and a long journey ahead of you.

545
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,039
You can't break down here.

546
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:30,119
You know who I am.

547
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,599
The man who chased you that day...

548
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,719
called you Princess Yongning.

549
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,039
Princess Yongning,

550
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,199
do you have any last words?

551
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,599
I fought him before.

552
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,159
Based on his martial arts techniques,

553
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,809
I deduced that he must be an imperial guard in the palace.

554
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,039
He chased you all the way to Shuozhou to kill you,

555
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,079
yet he didn't have an official arrest warrant on him.

556
00:38:58,289 --> 00:38:59,960
Other than the former Crown Prince's old subordinate,

557
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,289
who else could it be?

558
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:05,289
Actually,

559
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,400
to me,

560
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,880
it doesn't matter who you really are.

561
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,840
Ever since the first time you pulled that little trick...

562
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,639
and saved my wife and Yuan Er,

563
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,639
I knew you were no ordinary person.

564
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,289
No matter what intentions you had at the start,

565
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,199
I knew one thing for sure.

566
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,840
You had no ill intentions towards me or Shuozhou City.

567
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,679
That's why I was willing...

568
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,769
to keep you by my side.

569
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,039
Unfortunately,

570
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,639
I won't be able to see the day...

571
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,639
you walk to the end of the path in your heart.

572
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:54,519
Governor Gongsun, my name is Li Chang Ge.

573
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,119
I'm the daughter of Crown Prince Li Jian Cheng.

574
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,519
I'm not Princess Yongning anymore.

575
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Now,

576
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,719
I just want to fight the enemy with you.

577
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,360
Please revoke your command.

578
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,329
I'll definitely do all I can to protect Shuozhou.

579
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Your Highness.

580
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,880
Your Highness, don't do this.

581
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Your Highness.

582
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
I have been loyal and righteous all my life.

583
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,639
Especially at a time like this,

584
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:22,119
I cannot overstep my bounds.

585
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,079
I'm the one who should be on my knees right now.

586
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:28,880
Your Highness,

587
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,880
you have such kind affection for the civilians of Shuozhou City.

588
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,960
Please accept my gratitude.

589
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,159
Governor Gongsun.

590
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,289
Please rise, Governor Gongsun.

591
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,559
I don't deserve this.

592
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Please get up.

593
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:43,809
Please get up.

594
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
Your Highness.

595
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,289
I have one more favor to ask.

596
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,239
At this point,

597
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
this is the only thing I can't let go of.

598
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,360
My dear Yuan Er...

599
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,809
hasn't grown up yet.

600
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
I know...

601
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,440
that after my death,

602
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,840
my wife won't be willing to remarry.

603
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,400
So I'd like to ask Your Highness...

604
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,440
to take care of her...

605
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:24,400
and my daughter, when possible.

606
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:29,289
I hereby...

607
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,239
thank you...

608
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,599
on behalf of the two of them.

609
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,039
Governor Gongsun.

610
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,840
You should be watching Yuan Er grow up.

611
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Governor Gongsun.

612
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:45,559
Please take back your command.

613
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,719
Please, Governor Gongsun.

614
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,679
I'll watch over them...

615
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,239
and pray for their safety from up above.

616
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:57,329
Elder Qin.

617
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,809
Take Her Highness to get some rest.

618
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,239
Governor Gongsun.

619
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,239
Governor Gongsun.

620
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Governor Gongsun!
