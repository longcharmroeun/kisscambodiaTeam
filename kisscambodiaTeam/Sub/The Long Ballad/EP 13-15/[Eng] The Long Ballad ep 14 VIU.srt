<i>The Long Ballad</i>

3
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,300
<i>This is a work of fiction.</i>

4
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:42,059
<i>Episode 14</i>

5
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,180
Hurry and gather the Bear Army!

6
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,419
Quick!

7
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,820
But Mu Jin discovered me.

8
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,940
This is from him.

9
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,380
- Go. - Yes.

10
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,779
<i>Anyone who acts rashly will be killed.</i>

11
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:00,779
<i>As ordered by Great Khan.</i>

12
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:04,740
Don't try to use Great Khan to pressure me!

13
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,059
But Your Highness,

14
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,219
if this is truly Great Khan's instruction,

15
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,460
won't we be messing up Great Khan's plan...

16
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,619
if we send out our troops now?

17
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,419
- I'm afraid... - Afraid of what?

18
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,619
If you don't send the troops now,

19
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,619
we'll always be at the Eagle Army's feet.

20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,710
Send out the troops and gather the Bear Army now!

21
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,339
Your Highness.

22
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,460
Why are you laughing?

23
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,099
Do you want to die?

24
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,939
I'm laughing at the fact that the mighty prince...

25
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:44,619
of the Eagle Army is actually such a coward.

26
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:47,339
Is that so?

27
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:48,659
Your Highness, you'll choke him to death.

28
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,379
That's what I want to do!

29
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,339
Calm down, Your Highness.

30
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,099
If you kill me,

31
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,659
you'll lose your last chance...

32
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:01,900
to bring down the Eagle Army.

33
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,260
You'd better behave.

34
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,980
Just say what you want to say.

35
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,740
Don't waste His Highness's time.

36
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,300
Commandant Li, the one who is protecting the city,

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
is my brother.

38
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,700
I'm the best bargaining chip you have to negotiate with him.

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,980
How much are you worth?

40
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,460
To my brother,

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,980
I'm worth at least half of Shuozhou City.

42
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,819
You're not lying, are you?

43
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,740
If I'm not worth it,

44
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,619
you can kill me anytime you want.

45
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,659
Stop.

46
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,700
Didn't we agree to meet at the city wall?

47
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,980
We just received news...

48
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,740
that Tu Ka She and Yi Bu Kan are heading towards Shuozhou...

49
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,939
with someone from the Central Plain.

50
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:49,539
We must move as fast as we can...

51
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,099
and get there before they do something stupid.

52
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,740
Otherwise, all our plans will go to waste.

53
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,619
Bring the disguise to His Highness!

54
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,619
Yes.

55
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,379
Commandant Li, the Bear Army is here.

56
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:06,580
How dare they still come here?

57
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,379
There aren't many of them, but the strange thing is...

58
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,619
there's someone from the Central Plain with them.

59

<i>Auspicious clouds in the sky</i>

62
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Mr. Li.

63
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,659
Look who's here.

64
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,859
<i>Shuozhou</i>

65
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:22,659
Dou.

66
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:23,659
Dou.

67
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,779
<i>Shuozhou</i>

68
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,179
Speak! Ask them to open the gate!

69
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,779
I told you to speak!

70
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,979
Ask them to open the gate!

71
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,020
I said talk!

72
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,820
Ask them to open the city gate.

73
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,539
If you touch him again,

74
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,260
I'll break your bones.

75
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,179
Mr. Li.

76
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,339
As long as you open the gate...

77
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,020
and come out to talk to us,

78
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,500
I'll let him go.

79
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:17,979
Or else,

80
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,859
I'll beat him to death right in front of you.

81
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,859
Commandant Li.

82
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:43,859
- Commandant Li! - Let go of me!

83
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:44,900
Let me go!

84
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,460
The Bear Army is too close to the gate.

85
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,580
If we open the gate even just a crack,

86
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,820
they can barge right in.

87
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,179
The consequences would be unthinkable.

88
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,299
That's right, Commandant Li.

89
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,700
You're a monster.

90
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,179
You're even hitting a kid.

to be a general.

95
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,460
Dou.

96
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:50,900
No.

97
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,940
Hold on, I'm coming to save you.

98
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,979
Commandant Li!

99
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,020
Commandant Li.

100
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,260
- You can't. - Let go!

101
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,580
- You can't go. - Commandant!

102
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,820
- Commandant Li. - Let go!

103
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,979
We can't put...

104
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,060
the entire Shuozhou in jeopardy just for Dou.

a general.

111
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,579
I think Dou is saying something.

112
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,860
I am...

113
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,860
going to be...

114
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
a general.

115
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,900
Dou isn't kneeling...

116
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:46,140
because he's begging us to open the gate to save him.

117
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,459
He's saying...

118
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,900
<i>Auspicious clouds in the sky</i>

119
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Don't be silly.

120
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:30,699
Dou.

121
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,459
Don't be silly, Dou.

122
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,059
Get up.

123
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,260
Hurry and get up.

124
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,419
Get up, Dou.

125
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:51,860
Master.

126
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,699
I...

127
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,230
I can finally be a general.

128
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,020
I can finally become your subordinate.

129
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:02,659
Dou, you can be a general after you've grown up.

130
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,100
I'll take you away.

131
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,980
You can't die here, Dou.

132
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,020
I'll take you away.

133
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
Master.

134
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,260
I can do it.

135
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,579
I can do it.

136
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:19,699
No.

137
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:21,299
Dou, you can't.

138
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,340
Dou, get up!

139
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,819
Daizhou has been occupied.

140
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,860
There are no reinforcements!

141
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:34,419
You little liar!

142
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,900
I'll kill you.

143
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:42,020
Dou!

144
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:17,539
I thought he said there are no reinforcements.

145
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,059
What's this then?

146
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,939
They're the Ashina Tribe disguised as reinforcements.

147
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,299
Send a signal with the flag!

148
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,140
Dispatch 10,000 soldiers!

149
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,059
We can't let these Ashina Tribe people...

150
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:29,900
disguised as reinforcements...

151
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,500
take even a step closer to Shuozhou City!

152
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,100
- Commandant Li! - Commandant Li!

153
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,620
Send a signal with the flag! Now!

154
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,779
Quick!

155
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,020
Reinforce Commandant Li!

156
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
Quick!

157
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:44,419
Your Highness.

158
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:45,459
Ashina Sun's plans...

159
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,620
have all been ruined by that boy.

160
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,740
What should we do?

161
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,380
Why don't we seize the opportunity and lead the attack?

162
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,939
You killed our most valuable hostage.

163
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,740
You sure arranged this well.

164
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Attack?

165
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,179
How are we supposed to attack with such a few people?

166
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:57,459
Let's step back first.

167
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,819
We'll see how things are when they get here.

168
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,579
Yes.

169
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,579
Retreat!

170
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,059
Stop.

171
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,419
- Kill! - Kill!

172
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:29,900
- Kill! - Kill!

173
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:51,579
Bear Army, retreat!

174
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,500
- Retreat! - Retreat!

175
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:55,900
Retreat!

176
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,579
Tu Ka She, that dirtbag!

177
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,140
He chickened out at the last minute.

178
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,340
Ashina Sun, they're determined to fight to the death.

179
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,459
At this rate, things won't look good for us.

180
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:50,779
This stab...

181
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,579
is for Dou.

182
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,179
Don't kill me.

183
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,140
This kick...

184
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,819
is for the people of Shuozhou.

185
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,620
An army burning with indignation is bound to win.

186
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,860
Tu Ka She has already caused us to lose our advantage.

187
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Let's retreat for now.

188
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,539
Come on.

This last slash...

190
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,939
is for the warriors who died in battle.

191
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:54,179
It's not my fault.

192
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,380
No! Don't kill me!

<i>General Dou's Tomb</i>

195
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:38,790
I don't know who you are,

196
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,739
but I'm sure you're not a lowly person.

197
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,620
I live a hard life.

198
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,939
I'm afraid no one would even know...

199
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,259
if I died in a canal.

200
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,259
If I can follow you and live a spectacular life,

201
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:50,019
it would be worth it even if I die.

202
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,790
Master, you're my future.

203
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,659
I'll follow you, no matter if I'll live or die.

204
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:01,939
Since I'm going to be your master,

205
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:04,219
of course we must have a formal ceremony.

206
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,259
From now on,

207
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:07,380
you're my disciple.

208
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,459
The two of us won't fail each other.

209
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,179
When I return with glory,

210
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:20,739
you'll have to call me...

211
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:22,070
General Dou.

212
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,459
I am going to be a general.

213
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,070

214
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,939

Congratulations on your triumphant return, General Dou.

216
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:16,939
Congratulations on your triumphant return, General Dou.

Master, our two armies are at battle right now.

223
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,179
Ashina Sun is their prince.

224
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,259
Why did you write this letter?

225
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,790
What's the matter?

226
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,380
Are you worried that I might collude with the enemy?

227
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,900
I wouldn't dare.

228
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,459
I was only joking.

229
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,070
You've been with me for years.

230
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:28,699
When have I ever done anything I have no confidence in?

231
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:30,860
I have a plan for everything.

232
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,550
Everything is under my control.

233
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:36,219
You just need to make sure...

234
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,659
to hand this letter to him.

235
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:40,259
Yes.

236
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:45,499
Governor Gongsun.

237
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,659
Governor Gongsun, I have a plan.

238
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,100
- Tell me. - Governor Gongsun.

239
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:52,219
When the weather turns cold in the seventh month,

240
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:53,219
the north wind will rise.

241
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:54,699
We can pretend to retreat...

242
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,580
and give up Shuozhou City to the Eagle Army.

243
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,979
Then, we can set up potassium nitrate...

244
00:21:57,979 --> 00:21:58,979
and dry wood in the city.

245
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:00,580
Once Ashina Sun's army enters the city,

246
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,620
we'll start a fire.

247
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,620
With the advantage of the north wind,

248
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,939
we'll surely burn every single one of them.

249
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,459
What if Ashina Sun's army continues to besiege the city?

250
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,100
The provisions in the city...

251
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:16,140
can only feed our people for three days.

252
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,259
But if we go with your plan,

253
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:19,979
both the evil and the innocent will be destroyed together.

254
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:23,699
All the civilians of Shuozhou will become refugees.

255
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:27,019
Commandant Li.

256
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,179
Between these two difficult choices,

257
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:30,860
do you think the price we have to pay for the latter...

258
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,300
is more worthwhile?

259
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:34,499
I...

260
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:48,060
Why do you think...

261
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:53,219
I want to protect Shuozhou?

262
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,780
What I want to protect...

263
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,699
is not a fortress...

264
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,219
but the thriving city of Shuozhou...

265
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:02,300
where tens of thousands of citizens are settled.

266
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,540
If it weren't for this,

267
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:07,580
I wouldn't have surrendered to the Li family...

268
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:10,659
after the rise of the Tang Dynasty in Jinyang.

269
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,259
Thinking about it now,

270
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,340
fighting or surrendering...

271
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,419
is merely a means to an end.

272
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,259
Keeping the people in peace and away from war...

273
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,979
is the most important thing.

274
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,580
These are also the principles I've been holding onto it...

275
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,060
in my heart.

276
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Governor Gongsun.

277
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:35,140
You're not thinking...

278
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,780
of surrendering to the Ashina Tribe, are you?

279
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,979
Did Dou and all the warriors that sacrificed in battle...

280
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:43,179
all die in vain?

281
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,259
Commandant Li.

282
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:51,179
Calm down.

283
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:55,219
I was just drawing an analogy.

284
00:23:57,739 --> 00:23:59,060
Sorry for being rude.

285
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,540
All right, Commandant Li.

286
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,900
It's late.

287
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,060
I've already secured a plan...

288
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:06,900
to repulse the enemy.

289
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,860
Let's discuss the rest tomorrow.

290
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
Yes.

291
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,499
Your Highness really came here alone.

292
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,419
I'm impressed.

293
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:06,739
I've heard a lot about you.

294
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,820
Since you invited me here,

295
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,620
you wouldn't set up an ambush.

296
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Besides,

297
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:16,100
aren't you the same?

298
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,739
What do you want to discuss with me?

299
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,380
You can just cut to the chase.

300
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,900
If Shuozhou surrenders to you,

301
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,219
can you guarantee...

302
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,100
not to take the lives of the civilians?

303
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,659
What if...

304
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,300
I take advantage of this north wind and incinerate the city?

305
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:46,979
Although I don't expect the Eagle Army to die with me,

306
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,300
all you'll end up getting are the ashes of Shuozhou City.

307
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
I'm sure...

308
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,499
this isn't the ending Your Highness would want.

309
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,659
If that is your plan,

310
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,939
you wouldn't have put it off until now,

311
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,100
nor would you threaten me with it.

312
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,499
It's not a threat.

313
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:10,580
I'm asking you a favor.

314
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:12,419
I'm curious.

315
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,580
Why are you asking me this?

316
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,060
I've been attacking the city with my troops for days.

317
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,900
Shuozhou's defending troops suffered heavy casualties.

318
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,699
In your eyes,

319
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,659
am I the type of person who is soft-hearted?

320
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,780
When the troops of the Eagle Army...

321
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,140
burned down the granary,

322
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,380
you could've also burned...

323
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,620
the civilians nearby along with it.

324
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,060
Then I would've been forced to do anything to save the people.

325
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,620
But you didn't do that.

326
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,340
Instead, you let them live...

327
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,100
and informed me to come quickly.

328
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:47,219
This proves...

329
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:49,699
you don't want to do any unnecessary killing.

330
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,860
All these years,

331
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,979
you've been leading the Eagle Army to fight battles everywhere.

332
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,699
I've long heard about your way of doing things.

333
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,140
I believe...

334
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,060
you have the capability...

335
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,780
and the will...

336
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,140
to save their lives.

337
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,540
However,

338
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:13,820
all these years,

339
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,499
I've fought...

340
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:18,140
with the Ashina Tribe many times.

341
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,580
All of the Ashina Tribe people...

342
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,780
have a lot of resentment towards me and Shuozhou City.

343
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:24,419
Now,

344
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:26,820
if I'm going to give away my city,

345
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,259
then I should be very sincere.

346
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,259
I will give you...

347
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,979
a gift that will satisfy,

348
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:39,739
relieve, and appease...

349
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,340
all of the soldiers in the Ashina army.

350
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,900
I won't put Your Highness in a difficult position.

351
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,259
Have you thought it through?

352
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:53,019
Is it really worth it to give everything up like this?

353
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,979
When it comes to certain things,

354
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,820
there's no turning back.

355
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:00,860
It's just a gift.

356
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:04,340
Compared to the safety of the people in Shuozhou,

357
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:06,939
this is nothing.

358
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
I have...

359
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,580
no regrets.

360
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,179
I finally know...

361
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,860
how you got the name "the protector of the people".

362
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:27,179
Don't worry, Governor Gongsun.

363
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,419
I agree...

364
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,900
with your proposal.

365
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,659
I will surely keep my promise.

366
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Okay.

367
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Right here,

368
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,459
on behalf of the people of Shuozhou,

369
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
I thank you.

370
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,340
<i>Prefectural Governor's Manor</i>

371
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,179
We've been in battle after battle recently.

372
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,699
You've all worked hard guarding the city day and night.

373
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,540
Don't say that, Governor Gongsun.

374
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:08,179
You've been doing everything you can...

375
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,699
for all the civilians. It's even harder on you.

376
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,499
Yes.

377
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,979
You are our backbone.

378
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:14,860
It's all thanks to you...

379
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,979
that all the people of Shuozhou are united and protecting the city,

380
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:18,100
with no fear of death.

381
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,659
This battle has been tragic.

382
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,620
We must appropriately arrange...

383
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,620
the bereavement compensation for the soldiers who sacrificed.

384
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,780
When it's the right timing,

385
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,259
we must also send someone to Chang'an...

386
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:31,300
to report the situation here in Shuozhou...

387
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,540
and ask for help.

388
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,380
Over the recent years,

389
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,979
Shuozhou has been suffering from poor harvests.

390
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:38,219
Now, the granary has been burnt down...

391
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:39,620
and our military colony fields are destroyed.

392
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,419
This makes our situation even worse.

393
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
How are we going to get through this winter?

394
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
What will we do about the livelihood of our people in the coming year?

395
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,380
You'll need to think about these problems carefully.

396
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:59,340
In the future, there will be a lot to take care of in Shuozhou.

397
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,860
I hope all of you will do your best.

398
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
I hereby...

399
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,580
thank everyone in advance...

400
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:07,300
on behalf of the soldiers and civilians of Shuozhou.

401
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,219
There's no need for that, Governor Gongsun.

402
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:10,979
It's our duty.

403
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:12,259
You don't need to thank us.

404
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,979
I am thanking you...

405
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,699
for your deep kindness...

406
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,219
on behalf of the Shuozhou soldiers and citizens.

407
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Commandant Li.

408
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,259
It's difficult to turn down such gratitude.

409
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:27,100
Just accept it...

410
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,179
and drink this cup of wine.

411
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,620
Here.

412
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,060
Madam's millet wine is indeed the best.

413
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:47,739
It's so sweet and rich.

414
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,219
It's been a while since you've had a break.

415
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:50,900
Drink more if you like it.

416
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,620
This is a family meal.

417
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,780
Just relax yourselves.

418
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,499
Be good, Yuan Er.

419
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,820
Put the wooden sword down first.

420
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:00,659
We'll play after dinner, okay?

421
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
Okay.

422
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,340
Yuan Er got this wooden sword today...

423
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,699
and wouldn't let go of it.

424
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,019
I asked her why.

425
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:11,860
She said she wants to protect the people and help the weak,

426
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,140
just like Shi Si, Dou, and her father.

427
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,580
You must grow up quickly then, Yuan Er.

428
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,019
When you grow up,

429
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:20,140
we'll eliminate evil together.

430
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:23,780
That's great.

431
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,900
Yuan Niang,

432
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,580
hurry and say thank you to Shi Si.

433
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,780
If that's really what you aspire to do,

434
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:32,060
then learn some martial arts to protect yourself.

435
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,540
If one day,

436
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:36,459
Father isn't with you anymore,

437
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,259
you'll be able to protect yourself...

438
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:40,979
and you won't be bullied by bad people.

439
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:43,380
Why won't Father be here?

440
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,259
Silly girl.

441
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,820
Are you never going to get married?

442
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,620
Are you going to stay by my side...

443
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,860
until you become an old lady?

444
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,179
Honey, let me drink to you too.

445
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,659
All these years,

446
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,100
I put all my focus on fighting on the frontlines.

447
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,820
I have to thank you...

448
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,179
for giving me support,

449
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,900
looking after the wounded,

450
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,140
taking care of the logistics,

451
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,419
and pacifying the people.

452
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,300
You had to take on all those burdens alone.

453
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:27,140
You even took care...

454
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,739
and taught our Yuan Er...

455
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,900
by yourself.

456
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:34,499
I really don't know...

457
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,900
how I can repay you for everything you've done for me.

458
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,780
We complement each other...

459
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,659
and understand one another.

460
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,659
You don't need to repay me.

461
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,979
You have your principles.

462
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,259
This is also my choice.

463
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,860
I told you this before.

464
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,219
If there's something you want to do, just do it.

465
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,019
Even though I'm just the madam of this back courtyard,

466
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:10,140
I'll keep up with you...

467
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,340
and walk your path with you.

468
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,019
Honey.

469
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,019
You have to take care of your health.

470
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,179
It's autumn now.

471
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,699
You need to nourish your health.

472
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,300
Otherwise, when the winter comes,

473
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,900
you'll feel the cold...

474
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:51,259
and have trouble sleeping again.

475
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:13,699
You don't have to worry about me.

476
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:15,979
The winter is rough,

477
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:18,669
but spring will eventually come.

478
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:42,820
Spring will eventually come.

479
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Here.

480
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,539
We need another drink.

481
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:54,139
This drink...

482
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:55,979
is a toast to Shuozhou.

483
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,669
After experiencing this calamity, I hope Shuozhou will be blessed...

484
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:00,459
with good weather,

485
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,860
have good harvests, just like things used to be.

486
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,820
With you here, it will definitely happen.

487
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,139
Come on.

488
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:30,340
<i>Protect the frontier to bring peace to the people</i>

489
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:34,780
Governor Gongsun, did you ask me to stay behind...

490
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,380
because you have other orders?

491
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:43,900
Commandant Li, please have a seat.

492
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Please.

493
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,780
Inside is Shuozhou City's defense map.

494
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,099
All our supplies,

495
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:05,459
grain depots, and the treasury...

496
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,579
are all clearly marked on it.

497
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:12,340
As for this command token...

498
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:14,189
With this,

499
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:16,979
you can mobilize Shuozhou's defending troops...

500
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,780
and the people in this manor.

501
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,380
Why are you giving me these?

502
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,939
All the troops of Shuozhou listen to your orders.

503
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,300
Why are you giving me the command token?

504
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,619
Shuozhou's defending troops only listened to my orders...

505
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:36,539
because I've always been here.

506
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:38,979
Governor Gongsun.

507
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,939
What do you mean?

508
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:44,099
I've made up my mind.

509
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:46,499
Tomorrow, we'll open the city gates and surrender.

510
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,380
Ashina Sun has also already promised me...

511
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,900
that he'll make sure all the civilians will live.

512
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,740
At what cost?

513
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
What's the price we have to pay?

514
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,099
The price?

515
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,340
The price is...

516
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,459
my life.

517
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,099
Governor Gongsun.

518
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:16,820
Please give me a little more time.

519
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:19,059
I'll definitely come up with a foolproof plan.

520
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,340
This is already the best option we have.

521
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
Governor Gongsun.

522
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,459
All these years,

523
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:26,780
the Ashina Tribe has never occupied Shuozhou City.

524
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,539
So to the troops of Shuozhou,

525
00:37:29,939 --> 00:37:31,300
as long as I'm still alive,

526
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,979
they'll never surrender...

527
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:34,459
even if they're down to their last stand.

528
00:37:36,189 --> 00:37:37,740
But to the Ashina Tribe,

529
00:37:38,419 --> 00:37:40,059
I've guarded the frontier for years.

530
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:43,059
Their Great Khan has lost countless battles against me.

531
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,099
He hates me to the core.

532
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:48,059
Now, I can only offer up my life...

533
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,419
in order to dispel his doubts and resentment.

534
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,059
This is also the only way...

535
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,900
to get the people in the city a chance of survival.

536
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,979
No, I won't allow it.

537
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,709
There must be another way.

538
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:13,189
Being able to entrust the lives of the civilians in Shuozhou City...

539
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:15,019
to a Tang princess...

540
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,939
and commit an act of benevolence...

541
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,380
is considered a happy ending for me.

542
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,459
Princess Yongning is very smart.

543
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,619
You still have a lot to do in the future...

544
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,260
and a long journey ahead of you.

545
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:32,939
You can't break down here.

546
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:36,019
You know who I am.

547
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:39,499
The man who chased you that day...

548
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:41,619
called you Princess Yongning.

549
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,939
Princess Yongning,

550
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,099
do you have any last words?

551
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,499
I fought him before.

552
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,059
Based on his martial arts techniques,

553
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,709
I deduced that he must be an imperial guard in the palace.

554
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:59,939
He chased you all the way to Shuozhou to kill you,

555
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:02,979
yet he didn't have an official arrest warrant on him.

556
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:05,860
Other than the former Crown Prince's old subordinate,

557
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,189
who else could it be?

558
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:11,189
Actually,

559
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,300
to me,

560
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:15,780
it doesn't matter who you really are.

561
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,740
Ever since the first time you pulled that little trick...

562
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,539
and saved my wife and Yuan Er,

563
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,539
I knew you were no ordinary person.

564
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,189
No matter what intentions you had at the start,

565
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,099
I knew one thing for sure.

566
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,740
You had no ill intentions towards me or Shuozhou City.

567
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,579
That's why I was willing...

568
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,669
to keep you by my side.

569
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,939
Unfortunately,

570
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,539
I won't be able to see the day...

571
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,539
you walk to the end of the path in your heart.

572
00:39:57,669 --> 00:40:00,419
Governor Gongsun, my name is Li Chang Ge.

573
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,019
I'm the daughter of Crown Prince Li Jian Cheng.

574
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,419
I'm not Princess Yongning anymore.

575
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,380
Now,

576
00:40:07,669 --> 00:40:09,619
I just want to fight the enemy with you.

577
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:12,260
Please revoke your command.

578
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,229
I'll definitely do all I can to protect Shuozhou.

579
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
Your Highness.

580
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,780
Your Highness, don't do this.

581
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Your Highness.

582
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,780
I have been loyal and righteous all my life.

583
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,539
Especially at a time like this,

584
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:28,019
I cannot overstep my bounds.

585
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:31,979
I'm the one who should be on my knees right now.

586
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:34,780
Your Highness,

587
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,780
you have such kind affection for the civilians of Shuozhou City.

588
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,860
Please accept my gratitude.

589
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:43,059
Governor Gongsun.

590
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:44,189
Please rise, Governor Gongsun.

591
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,459
I don't deserve this.

592
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
Please get up.

593
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:49,709
Please get up.

594
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,780
Your Highness.

595
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,189
I have one more favor to ask.

596
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,139
At this point,

597
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,260
this is the only thing I can't let go of.

598
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,260
My dear Yuan Er...

599
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,709
hasn't grown up yet.

600
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,820
I know...

601
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,340
that after my death,

602
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,740
my wife won't be willing to remarry.

603
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:24,300
So I'd like to ask Your Highness...

604
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:26,340
to take care of her...

605
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:30,300
and my daughter, when possible.

606
00:41:34,189 --> 00:41:35,189
I hereby...

607
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,139
thank you...

608
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:39,499
on behalf of the two of them.

609
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:43,939
Governor Gongsun.

610
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,740
You should be watching Yuan Er grow up.

611
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,300
Governor Gongsun.

612
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:51,459
Please take back your command.

613
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,619
Please, Governor Gongsun.

614
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,579
I'll watch over them...

615
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,139
and pray for their safety from up above.

616
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:03,229
Elder Qin.

617
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,709
Take Her Highness to get some rest.

618
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:08,139
Governor Gongsun.

619
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:09,139
Governor Gongsun.

620
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,820
Governor Gongsun!
