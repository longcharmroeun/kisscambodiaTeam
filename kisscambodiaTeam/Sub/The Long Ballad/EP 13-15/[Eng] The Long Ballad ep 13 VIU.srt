<i>The Long Ballad</i>

3
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,400
<i>This is a work of fiction.</i>

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,239
<i>Episode 13</i>

5
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,719
Governor Gongsun.

6
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,319
This is all because of my negligence.

7
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,560
Because of our geographical advantage,

8
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,319
I moved the men from the east to the west.

9
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,439
I'm willing to redeem myself.

10
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,400
Please send me to the east to face the enemy.

11
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,920
That's enough.

12
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,359
When two armies fight,

13
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,000
it's a battle of wits.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
It's not entirely your fault.

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,319
I just didn't expect that...

16
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,000
the elite troops of Ashina Tribe...

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
are so tricky.

18
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,120
Xu Feng.

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
Gather everyone.

20
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,959
Get them to come with me and Commandant Li...

21
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,439
to face the enemy together at the East Gate.

22
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Yes.

23
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,879
But Governor Gongsun,

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,479
they worked tirelessly...

25
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,000
to steal from the granary.

26
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,159
The East Gate and the granary are miles apart.

27
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,400
How did they do that?

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,639
They're so fast.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,159
Shi Si Lang.

30
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,810
You need to be clear about it.

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,960
From now on,

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,039
you're dealing with Ashina Tribe.

33
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,639
They're the fiercest cavalry.

34
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
On my mark.

35
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,199

- Governor Gongsun! - Governor Gongsun!

40
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,959
It's all right.

41
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,879
I just need to wrap it up.

42
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Governor Gongsun.

43
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
Governor Gongsun, you should go back first.

44
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Leave it to me.

45
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,759
Lead everyone.

46
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,240
Guard the east side of the city!

47
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,439
Yes, sir!

48
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,000
Send Governor Gongsun back!

49
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,439
Yes.

50
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,959
This is bad! They brought reinforcements!

51
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,920
As you have planned,

52
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,879
Ya Luo took our men and destroyed the farms.

53
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,680
Gongsun Heng will find out about it soon.

54
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,199
Put it on.

55
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,639
I'm such a handsome man.

56
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,839
Why should I put on a mask?

57
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,199
Fine.

58
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,199
I should have chosen a nice mask.

63
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,920
So you're worried that he might recognize us.

64
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,120
You hid your real identity before.

65
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Shut up.

66
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,639
Since both of you are not true friends,

67
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,639
things are way easier.

68
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,879
Just kill him.

69
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,920
Let's catch the leader first.

70
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,120
I told you to shut up!

71
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,879
Relay my orders.

72
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,560
Attack the city in full force!

73
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,560
Attention, Eagle Army.

74
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,639
Kill them!

75
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,360
- Kill them! - Kill them!

76
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,279
Kill them!

77
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,639
Chief Registrar Li, the defense...

78
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,680
at the East Gate has always been the weakest.

79
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,959
I've sent people to get the watchtower and catapult.

80
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,199
Do we have knife rests?

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,639
We only have less than 100kg barbed wires.

82
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,639
We could only set up...

83
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,720
at most a line of defense with what we have.

84
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,439
Eagle Army will most likely avoid it.

85
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,800
Use all the barbed wires.

86
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,879
Yes, sir!

87
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,000
Be it the Eagle Army or the reinforcements,

88
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,040
they must have been riding all night.

89
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,560
They didn't have time to prepare...

90
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
food and water for the horses.

91
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,519
- Don't eat it! - Don't eat it!

92
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,800
Stop the horses!

96
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,090
All right.

97
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,159
It's Shi Si Lang again.

98
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,799
Ashina Sun.

99
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,840
We have to kill him!

If we lose the war,

101
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,000
it'd be difficult to explain to the Great Khan!

102

- Stop! - Stop!

167
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,559
that your target is not Shuozhou,

168
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,759
but Chang'an!

169
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,480

In comparison to the calamity in Shuozhou,

172
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
the resentment between Li Shi Min and I...

173
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600

Besides,

178
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,000
you can change the dressing for me in time, right?

179
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,440

00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,679
Wolf Army is attacking Yunzhou and Daizhou.

183
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
The Great Khan demanded you to conquer Shuozhou in 10 days.

184
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,399
Otherwise, His Majesty will do it himself.

185
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,039
If we continue camping outside the city,

186
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,000
can we take down Shuozhou in 10 days?

187
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,600
When the Great Khan gets here,

188
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,480
Eagle Army will become the laughingstock.

00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,039
A beast at bay will put up a desperate fight.

190
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
But for how long?

191
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,120
You're right.

192
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,159
The granary was burnt to the ground.

193
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,399
The farm was destroyed.

194
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,960
Let's starve them to death.

195
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,240
Mu Jin.

196
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,840
How are my archery skills?

197
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,519
You've never missed your target.

198
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,799
Ashina Sun.

199
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Don't tell me...

200
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,399
you plan to sneak into Shuozhou?

201
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,799
No way. Absolutely not.

202
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,320
I was wrong.

203
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,399
You are quite the archer.

204
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,159
Shi Si Lang is fine for sure.

205
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,480
I mean it.

206
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,720
Bring the report.

207
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,559
Let's meet up with Tu Ka She.

208
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,240
I'll get rid of him.

209
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Shuozhou...

210
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,799
will be taken over by the Eagle Army.

211
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,159
Don't worry, Your Highness.

212
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,960
In order to win against the Eagle Army,

213
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,799
I still have an idea.

214
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
What are you doing here?

215
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,080
The Bear Army is down and out.

216
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,039
How do you plan to explain this?

217
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,759
Your Highness!

218
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,240
Your Highness, please spare my life!

219
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,120
I promise...

220
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,519
I'll make sure to kill Chief Registrar Li!

221
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,679
Please give me another chance, Your Highness!

222
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,720
A missed opportunity is a lost opportunity!

223
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,600
Because of your one move,

224
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,919
half of the Bear Army could never come back to the grasslands.

225
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,159
If I give you another chance,

226
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm afraid even the Eagle Army can't save you.

227
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,839
Your Highness.

228
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,920
I have the heart to contribute to the Bear Army!

229
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,279
Heaven and Earth will be my witnesses!

230
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,890
Do you plan to explain to the Great Khan...

231
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,079
with this man's life?

232
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,200
The Bear Army is being held back by the treacherous official.

233
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,680
Regarding that...

234
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,599
I'll explain it to the Great Khan myself.

235
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,000
There's no need for that.

236
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,519
I've received the order from the Great Khan.

237
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,799
Why do you bring it to me now?

238
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,599
Do you still want to humiliate me?

239
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,759
We only hope that you can stop acting impulsively.

240
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,599
I don't expect you to contribute.

241
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,410
Just don't hold the Eagle Army back again.

242
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,920
You're trying to grind the Bear Army...

243
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,170
beneath your heel.

244
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,039
You're being overly impatient.

245
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,960
We've no choice...

246
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,519
but to report everything to the Great Khan.

247
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,559
Tu Ka She blatantly disobeys His Majesty's order.

248
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,000
Prince Sun.

249
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,799
The Prince of Bear Army has received your order.

250
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,319
Please leave.

251
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,960
Yi Bu Kan.

252
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Yi Bu Kan!

253
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,119
Yi Bu Kan!

254
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,680
Can't someone watch the door?

255
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,920
This is the battalion of the Bear Army,

256
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,720
yet everyone just barges in as they like!

257
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,000
The Eagle Army has just changed the venue of their battalion.

258
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,650
They will do something for sure.

259
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,000
Watch him closely. Keep an eye on him!

260
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,319
Do you understand?

261
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,599
Yes, sir!

262
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,519
Watch the door!

263
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,279
Just say what you want to say.

264
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,890
We could have bought off that strategist...

265
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,170
for our own use.

266
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,799
Why did you let Tu Ka She kill him?

267
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,519
I don't like traitors.

268
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,839
But he's right.

269
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,559
Gongsun Heng had wings on him.

270
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,200
If we get rid of Shi Si Lang,

271
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,410
things will be a lot easier.

272
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,890
If the Great Khan takes action himself,

273
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,890
you know the consequences better than anyone else.

274
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,799
Why are we just procrastinating?

275
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,279
She Er's Wolf Army will conquer Daizhou soon.

276
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,359
Great Khan demanded that we assist him.

277
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,119
When the time comes,

278
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,170
I'll send you.

279
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,519
Me?

280
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,240
Ashina Sun.

281
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,599
I just talk too much.

282
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,680
You don't have to push me into the pit of fire.

283
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,440
Once this battle is over, you'll set off.

284
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,170
Remember.

285
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,170
When you reach Daizhou,

286
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,650
keep some defender's clothes with you.

287
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,559
Don't make things difficult for the common people.

288
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,039
You don't have to tell the Great Khan...

289
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,839
what I just said.

290
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,119
Is that all?

291
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,759
Tell me what's going on!

292
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,799
- Attack! - Attack!

293
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:44,890
Come on!

294
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,890
Run!

295
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,440
Run!

296
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,720
- Run! - Hurry up!

297
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
Run!

298
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,799
Run for your life!

299
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,799
- Come on. - Run!

300
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,319
- Help! - Help!

301
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,410
What's happening?

302
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,440
- What are you doing? - Help!

303
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,839
- You can't go in! - Help!

304
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,799
- Open the door! - Help!

305
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,890
- What happened? - They have invaded the city!

306
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,759
Close the door.

307
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,839
- I'm begging you. - What are you waiting for?

308
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,890
- Come and help! - Please let my child in!

309
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,279
I'm begging you!

310
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,279
Open the door! Open up!

311
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,599
I'm begging you!

312
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,680
Please let my child hide!

313
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,440
I'm begging you!

314
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,039
I'm begging you.

315
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,599
Let the kid hide.

316
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,039
I'm begging you!

317
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,890
- What are you doing? - Please!

318
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,170
Let them in.

319
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,279
How dare you!

320
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,039
Who do you think you are?

321
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
How dare you point scissors at me?

322
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,920
Do you want to die?

Where is she?

326
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,799
Hey!

327
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
What are you doing?

328
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,440
The Great Khan demanded us to chase after...

329
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,839
Daizhou's army that escaped from the city.

330
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,440
Let's go!

331
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,079
Hurry up!

332
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,279
Master, where are we going?

333
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,160
Let's check the east part of the city.

334
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,880
The east of the city is besieged by the Eagle Army right now.

335
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,680
However, the area outside the east of the city is full of forests.

336
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,119
We never took strict precautions in that area.

337
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,160
The Eagle Army may not be that vigilant too.

338
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,119
Even if they keep a close watch,

339
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,079
there are so many mountains, so I'm sure we can avoid them.

340
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:38,920
Dou.

341
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,880
You're all grown up.

343
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,640
- Run. - Master, let's go together.

344
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,680
Call for help!

345
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,640
You followed me here.

346
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,480
It seems that not only you want Crown Prince's seal,

347
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,319
but you also want my life.

348
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,920
So what?

349
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,759
Governor Gongsun has been gravely wounded.

350
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,759
Shuozhou is surrounded by enemies.

351
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,920
Do you really have to kill me during this time?

352
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,279
Cut the nonsense.

353
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,200
My job is to kill you now.

354
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,960
Princess Yongning,

355
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,759
do you have any last words?

356
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,599
Even if I die,

357
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,920
I won't die...

358
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,119
in a lackey's hand.

359
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,680
Master, are you all right?

360
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,279
Do you know who she is?

361
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
If you help her,

362
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,440
you'll regret it later.

363
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,839
I only know that...

364
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,960
he's the Commandant of Light Chariot of Shuozhou...

365
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,759
who is fighting hard to resist foreign enemies.

366
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Sir.

367
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,000
I guess you came into Shuozhou...

368
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,759
before it is besieged by the Eagle Army.

369
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,319
You should know...

370
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,519
the situation in Shuozhou, right?

371
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Governor Gongsun is injured.

372
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,759
Everyone in Shuozhou...

373
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,960
is relying on Chief Registrar Li.

374
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,759
So...

375
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,279
I can't let you hurt him.

376
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,519
If you insist on helping her,

377
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,400
we'll just wait and see.

378
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Thank you, Elder Qin.

379
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,039
Elder Qin.

380
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,039
I have an idea.

381
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,640
We can get out.

382
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,759
Back then, when we drown Tu Ka She in water,

383
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,119
we drained all the water...

384
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,079
from the drainage that connects to Wuding River.

385
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,880
Master, let me go.

386
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,960
Your injuries...

387
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,519
I'll do it.

388
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,279
I'm more familiar with it.

389
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,359
Chief Registrar Li.

390
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,799
Chief Registrar Li.

391
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,519
Governor Gongsun?

392
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,519
- Please help Elder Qin. - Governor Gongsun.

393
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,680
- Chief Registrar Li. - Why are you here?

394
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,759
Elder Qin told me...

395
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,319
you found a stone canal...

396
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
that leads outside the city.

397
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,200
Judging by your outfit,

398
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,720
are you going to notify others on your own?

399
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,720
The canal in the city leads to the Wuding River.

400
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,279
The city is besieged by the Eagle Army.

401
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,440
Wuding River is the only place that is not heavily guarded.

402
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,319
If I don't go now,

403
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,599
I'm afraid there will be no time.

404
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,400
I plan to get out when it's dark...

405
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,279
to inform everyone.

406
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,759
You're already severely injured.

407
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,359
Today, you're attacked again.

408
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,839
It's like rubbing salt to the injury.

409
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,119
How could I...

410
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,920
put you in danger again?

411
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,759
That's right, Chief Registrar Li.

412
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,000
That man was merciless.

413
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,599
Chief Registrar Li.

414
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,599
Let me go.

415
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,160
Shuozhou needs you and Master.

416
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Only when both of you are around, people in Shuozhou can survive.

417
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,599
Furthermore, I'm Governor Gongsun's guard.

418
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,680
It's my duty.

419
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
No.

420
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,680
The canal was used to drain water.

421
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,559
It's narrow. You're not going to make it through.

422
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,079
Governor Gongsun, I can do it.

423
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,640
I can go through it.

424
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,039
Dou!

425
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,240
Master, I know you're worried about me.

426
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,640
You don't want to put me in danger.

427
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,599
But you're injured.

428
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,880
If you don't get well soon,

429
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,920
you won't make it through.

430
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,279
What if you pass out on the journey...

431
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,680
and delay in seeking help?

432
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,799
That's why I'm the best candidate to do it.

433
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,240
Please trust me, Governor Gongsun.

434
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,839
I won't let you down.

435
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,240
Stop messing around.

436
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,799
You're just a kid.

437
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,759
How can I put you in danger?

438
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,039
It's precisely because I'm young...

439
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,440
that I won't draw their attention.

440
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,400
Besides,

441
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
why did my master take me as his disciple?

442
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,519
It's because I'm smart.

443
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,200
I've been with my master for so long.

444
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,880
I've learned many tricks from him.

445
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,279
But when I'm back,

446
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,839
please let me have a title in the military camp.

447
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:48,920
Master.

448
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,160
Don't hesitate.

449
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,240
We've been through so much together.

450
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,240
Don't you think that I can handle it?

451
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,640
All right.

452
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,119
Make sure you take care of the bag.

453
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,640
There are an escape route map and a wrist crossbow in the bag.

454
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,200
You can use it against the pursuers.

455
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,039
Master, you are very insightful.

456
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,480
When I return with glory,

457
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
you'll have to call me...

458
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,519
General Dou.

459
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,000
Dou.

460
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,720
Take care of yourself.

461
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,039
Yes, Master.

462
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,359
Tell everyone to hang in there.

463
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,799
Wait for me!

464
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,960
Chief Registrar Li.

465
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,839
You took in such a great disciple.

466
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,039
I didn't teach him much.

467
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,200
I, on the other hand,

468
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,920
am so blessed...

469
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,039
to have met him.

470
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,039
Your Highness.

471
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,160
Our men followed Mu Jin...

472
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,640
but he shook them off halfway.

473
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,680
He was heading towards Daizhou.

474
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,039
Daizhou?

475
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,079
What does that mean?

476
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,359
Has the Great Khan conquered Daizhou?

477
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,720
What's wrong?

478
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,400
Why?

479
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,799
Why don't I know anything?

480
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,160
No one takes the Bear Army seriously!

481
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,319
Calm down, Your Highness.

482
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,279
I'll keep a wary eye on Ashina Sun.

483
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,200
I'll never let him deceive the Great Khan...

484
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,960
and take all the credit for conquering Shuozhou.

485
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,160
That's enough!

486
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,960
That's nonsense!

487
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,000
Get lost!

488
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,119
Get lost!

489
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,720
<i>Prefectural Governor's Manor</i>

490
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,119
<i>Broad-minded and knowledgeable</i>

491
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,200
Yuan Niang.

492
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
You're finally back.

493
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,400
People in the city sent us food.

494
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,880
They said that even if they could only afford husks,

495
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,119
they had to make sure that Governor Gongsun...

496
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,599
and the soldiers have enough to eat.

497
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,880
I sent them all back.

498
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,680
Those are all the grains people have been saving.

499
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,319
I don't have the heart to take it.

500
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,480
My dear wife,

501
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,880
you did the right thing.

502
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,319
Father.

503
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,799
They said it was all thanks to you...

504
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,359
Shuozhou is not conquered.

505
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,200
Yuan Niang, you're praising me again.

506
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,960
However, I think...

507
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,160
Shuozhou...

508
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,559
is still surviving...

509
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,960
because of them.

510
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,640
It has nothing to do with me.

511
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
I can't take the credit.

512
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,720
Count the rations...

513
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,720
and the grains that we own.

514
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,319
Distribute them to the people.

515
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,319
Yes.

516
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,480
We must survive until Dou is back.

517
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Yes.

518
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,079
Go!

519
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Minister Yi, as per the Great Khan's demand,

520
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,599
we've annihilated all the soldiers in Daizhou.

521
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,799
How about those who escaped from the city?

522
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,799
They were killed too.

523
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,799
Well done. The Prince of Eagle Army...

524
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,000
send someone from Shuozhou.

525
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,480
Great Khan instructed us to take him in.

526
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,839
Go back to the city.

527
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,200
Don't make the representative of Eagle Army wait.

528
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,240
Yes, sir!

529
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,559
We're doomed.

530
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,799
The bridle-road is blocked.

531
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,000
The news can't reach Chang'an.

532
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,559
Daizhou has been conquered too.

533
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,920
We can't get reinforcements.

534
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,160
What should I do?

535
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,400
I have to hurry back...

536
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,720
to inform my master.

537
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,329
- Stop. - Stop.

538
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,559
All of you.

539
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:33,960
Take Tang Army's military uniform.

540
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,440
After leaving Daizhou,

541
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,599
change into Tang Army's military uniform.

542
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,639
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

543
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,519
- Go! - Go!

544
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,960
- Go! - Go!

545
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,880
Come on.

546
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,159
Get up.

547
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,840
- Spare our life. - Spare our life.

548
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,440
- Please spare our life. - Please spare our life.

549
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:24,079
- Please. - Please.

550
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,159
Kneel. Hurry up!

551
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,480
Why should we kneel?

552
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,329
It's because of them that we're suffering now.

553
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,769
Kneel down!

554
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,159
- Please spare our life. - Please spare our life.

555
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,809
- Please spare our life. - Please spare our life.

556
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:07,840
Stop.

557
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,159
Stop.

558
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,719
Stop it!

559
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,809
Who are you?

560
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:13,840
It doesn't matter if you don't recognize me.

561
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,480
Can't you recognize Wolf Fang Arrow?

562
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,599
Since when the Eagle Army has control over the Wolf Army?

563
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,519
Know your place and get lost.

564
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,599
You should know...

565
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,880
how powerful the Eagle Army is.

566
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,719
If you lose your life because of the refugees,

567
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,239
it's not worth it.

568
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,639
Retreat!

569
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,239
- Go! - Go!

570
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,480
Go!

571
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,679
You should go now.

572
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:56,239
- Thank you. - Thank you.

573
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,880
It's urgent. We need to hurry.

574
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,960
- Yes. - Yes.

575
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
Go!

576
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:04,199
- Thank you. - Thank you.

577
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,400
Let's go home.

578
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,769
- That's great. - Father.

579
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,559
- Go! - Go!

580
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,289
- Go! - Go!

581
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:57,039
Isn't he...

582
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,289
the baby monkey that was on that person's side?

583
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,199
Yes.

584
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,289
I know you.

585
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,199
Kill him.

586
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,159
Hold on!

587
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,289
My king!

588
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,329
I have something to tell you.

589
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,360
"My king"? It's His Highness.

590
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,559
Yes, Your Highness.

591
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,769
You greeted me wrongly.

592
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,199
Kill him!

593
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,519
Your Highness must be curious about the situation in Shuozhou.

594
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:26,519
Spare me.

595
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,440
I may be useful to Your Highness.

596
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,199
Tell me what is so great about you.

597
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Otherwise, I'll chop you into pieces.

598
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,400
I bet you know that...

599
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,519
Chief Registrar Li trusts me.

600
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
I know all his moves...

601
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,239
better than anyone.

602
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,440
During the battle at Wuding River,

603
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,079
Your Highness lost so many soldiers.

604
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,559
It's impossible for Your Highness to continue the battle.

605
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,440
I heard that the Eagle Army is taking the lead...

606
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,559
Darn you!

607
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,639
Nothing you say is pleasant to the ears!

608
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:10,880
Are you trying to make me mad?

609
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,159
Kill him!

610
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,440
If Your Highness had any control over the situation,

611
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,000
Your Highness should have known that Chief Registrar Li...

612
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,289
has been promoted to Commandant of Light Chariot!

613
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Your Highness, you should keep me...

614
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,039
and let me negotiate with Shuozhou.

615
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,119
I can make Chief Registrar Li...

616
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,639
hand Shuozhou on a silver platter.

617
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,159
Now,

618
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,960
even this little monkey...

619
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,159
has the guts to deceive me.

620
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,840
Do I look so gullible?

621
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,960
Do I?

622
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,239
That rascal, Sima Jian, lied to you!

623
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,559
Your Highness,

624
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,199
Chief Registrar Li and Governor Gongsun are dying.

625
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,559
They were both seriously injured by the Eagle Army.

626
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,679
It's the perfect time to make peace.

627
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:00,000
I know them really well.

628
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:02,400
No one is more suitable for peace negotiations than me.

629
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,480
The Eagle Army has been fighting for so long.

630
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,039
However, everyone in Shuozhou still works together with high spirits.

631
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,840
At worst,

632
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,159
even if I can't persuade him,

633
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,639
we can crush the morale of the people in Shuozhou.

634
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:19,880
That's something...

635
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,679
the Eagle Army can't do.

636
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,400
Let's trust him for this once.

637
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,880
Tie him up to my horse.

638
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,159
Bring him to the battle.

639
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:38,289
Make sure he lives.

640
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,480
Yes, sir.

641
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,480
It's the Great Khan's order.

642
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,079
Intrusive maneuvers will be executed.

643
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,559
Go!

644
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,719
- Hang in there. - I can't walk anymore.

645
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,559
Young lady.

646
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:41,239
You mustn't do that.

647
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Put it on.

648
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,159
You're so kind.

649
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,159
Young lady, you were kind enough to save me.

650
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,440
If only my daughter...

651
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,880
was as lucky as I am.

652
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,519
You must stay alive.

653
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,440
You'll be able to see your daughter soon.

654
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,199
Your Highness, the Eagle Army...

655
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,559
obtained a lot of clothes belonging to soldiers of Daizhou.

656
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,289
In the journey, Mu Jin instructed the Eagle Army...

657
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,480
to change into Tang Army's military uniform.

658
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:38,289
The Eagle Army wants to take the lead!

659
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,519
Gather the Bear Army!

660
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,000
Hurry up!
