<i>The Long Ballad</i>

3
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,400
<i>This is a work of fiction.</i>

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,239
<i>Episode 13</i>

5
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,719
Governor Gongsun.

6
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,319
This is all because of my negligence.

7
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,560
Because of our geographical advantage,

8
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,319
I moved the men from the east to the west.

9
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,439
I'm willing to redeem myself.

10
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,400
Please send me to the east to face the enemy.

11
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,920
That's enough.

12
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,359
When two armies fight,

13
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,000
it's a battle of wits.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
It's not entirely your fault.

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,319
I just didn't expect that...

16
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,000
the elite troops of Ashina Tribe...

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,400
are so tricky.

18
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,120
Xu Feng.

19
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,400
Gather everyone.

20
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,959
Get them to come with me and Commandant Li...

21
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,439
to face the enemy together at the East Gate.

22
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Yes.

23
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,879
But Governor Gongsun,

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,479
they worked tirelessly...

25
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,000
to steal from the granary.

26
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,159
The East Gate and the granary are miles apart.

27
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,400
How did they do that?

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,639
They're so fast.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,159
Shi Si Lang.

30
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,810
You need to be clear about it.

31
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,960
From now on,

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,039
you're dealing with Ashina Tribe.

33
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,639
They're the fiercest cavalry.

34
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,960
On my mark.

35
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,199

- Governor Gongsun! - Governor Gongsun!

40
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,959
It's all right.

41
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,879
I just need to wrap it up.

42
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Governor Gongsun.

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
Governor Gongsun, you should go back first.

44
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Leave it to me.

45
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,759
Lead everyone.

46
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,240
Guard the east side of the city!

47
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,439
Yes, sir!

48
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,000
Send Governor Gongsun back!

49
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,439
Yes.

50
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,959
This is bad! They brought reinforcements!

51
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,920
As you have planned,

52
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,879
Ya Luo took our men and destroyed the farms.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,680
Gongsun Heng will find out about it soon.

54
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,199
Put it on.

55
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,639
I'm such a handsome man.

56
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,839
Why should I put on a mask?

57
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,199
Fine.

58
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,199
I should have chosen a nice mask.

63
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,920
So you're worried that he might recognize us.

64
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,120
You hid your real identity before.

65
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Shut up.

66
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,639
Since both of you are not true friends,

67
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,639
things are way easier.

68
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,879
Just kill him.

69
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,920
Let's catch the leader first.

70
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,120
I told you to shut up!

71
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,879
Relay my orders.

72
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,560
Attack the city in full force!

73
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,560
Attention, Eagle Army.

74
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,639
Kill them!

75
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,360
- Kill them! - Kill them!

76
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,279
Kill them!

77
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,639
Chief Registrar Li, the defense...

78
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,680
at the East Gate has always been the weakest.

79
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,959
I've sent people to get the watchtower and catapult.

80
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,199
Do we have knife rests?

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,639
We only have less than 100kg barbed wires.

82
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,639
We could only set up...

83
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,720
at most a line of defense with what we have.

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,439
Eagle Army will most likely avoid it.

85
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,800
Use all the barbed wires.

86
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,879
Yes, sir!

87
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,000
Be it the Eagle Army or the reinforcements,

88
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,040
they must have been riding all night.

89
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,560
They didn't have time to prepare...

90
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
food and water for the horses.

91
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,519
- Don't eat it! - Don't eat it!

92
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
Stop the horses!

96
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,090
All right.

97
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,159
It's Shi Si Lang again.

98
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,799
Ashina Sun.

99
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,840
We have to kill him!

100

If we lose the war,

101
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,000
it'd be difficult to explain to the Great Khan!

102
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
- Stop! - Stop!

Master, don't forget...

167
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,559
that your target is not Shuozhou,

168
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,759
but Chang'an!

169
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,480

In comparison to the calamity in Shuozhou,

172
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
the resentment between Li Shi Min and I...

173
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,600

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,039
Besides,

178
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,000
you can change the dressing for me in time, right?

179
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,440

180
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,200
Look.

181
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,679
I'm fine.

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,679
Wolf Army is attacking Yunzhou and Daizhou.

183
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
The Great Khan demanded you to conquer Shuozhou in 10 days.

184
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,399
Otherwise, His Majesty will do it himself.

185
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,039
If we continue camping outside the city,

186
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
can we take down Shuozhou in 10 days?

187
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,600
When the Great Khan gets here,

188
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,480
Eagle Army will become the laughingstock.

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,039
A beast at bay will put up a desperate fight.

190
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
But for how long?

191
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,120
You're right.

192
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,159
The granary was burnt to the ground.

193
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,399
The farm was destroyed.

194
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,960
Let's starve them to death.

195
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,240
Mu Jin.

196
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,840
How are my archery skills?

197
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,519
You've never missed your target.

198
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,799
Ashina Sun.

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't tell me...

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,399
you plan to sneak into Shuozhou?

201
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,799
No way. Absolutely not.

202
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,320
I was wrong.

203
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,399
You are quite the archer.

204
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,159
Shi Si Lang is fine for sure.

205
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,480
I mean it.

206
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,720
Bring the report.

207
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,559
Let's meet up with Tu Ka She.

208
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,240
I'll get rid of him.

209
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Shuozhou...

210
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,799
will be taken over by the Eagle Army.

211
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,159
Don't worry, Your Highness.

212
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,960
In order to win against the Eagle Army,

213
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,799
I still have an idea.

214
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
What are you doing here?

215
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,080
The Bear Army is down and out.

216
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,039
How do you plan to explain this?

217
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,759
Your Highness!

218
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,240
Your Highness, please spare my life!

219
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,120
I promise...

220
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,519
I'll make sure to kill Chief Registrar Li!

221
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,679
Please give me another chance, Your Highness!

222
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,720
A missed opportunity is a lost opportunity!

223
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,600
Because of your one move,

224
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,919
half of the Bear Army could never come back to the grasslands.

225
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,159
If I give you another chance,

226
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm afraid even the Eagle Army can't save you.

227
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,839
Your Highness.

228
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,920
I have the heart to contribute to the Bear Army!

229
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,279
Heaven and Earth will be my witnesses!

230
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,890
Do you plan to explain to the Great Khan...

231
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,079
with this man's life?

232
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,200
The Bear Army is being held back by the treacherous official.

233
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,680
Regarding that...

234
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,599
I'll explain it to the Great Khan myself.

235
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,000
There's no need for that.

236
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,519
I've received the order from the Great Khan.

237
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,799
Why do you bring it to me now?

238
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,599
Do you still want to humiliate me?

239
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,759
We only hope that you can stop acting impulsively.

240
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,599
I don't expect you to contribute.

241
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,410
Just don't hold the Eagle Army back again.

242
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,920
You're trying to grind the Bear Army...

243
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,170
beneath your heel.

244
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,039
You're being overly impatient.

245
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,960
We've no choice...

246
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,519
but to report everything to the Great Khan.

247
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,559
Tu Ka She blatantly disobeys His Majesty's order.

248
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,000
Prince Sun.

249
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,799
The Prince of Bear Army has received your order.

250
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,319
Please leave.

251
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,960
Yi Bu Kan.

252
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Yi Bu Kan!

253
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,119
Yi Bu Kan!

254
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,680
Can't someone watch the door?

255
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,920
This is the battalion of the Bear Army,

256
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,720
yet everyone just barges in as they like!

257
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,000
The Eagle Army has just changed the venue of their battalion.

258
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,650
They will do something for sure.

259
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,000
Watch him closely. Keep an eye on him!

260
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,319
Do you understand?

261
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,599
Yes, sir!

262
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,519
Watch the door!

263
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,279
Just say what you want to say.

264
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,890
We could have bought off that strategist...

265
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,170
for our own use.

266
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,799
Why did you let Tu Ka She kill him?

267
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,519
I don't like traitors.

268
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,839
But he's right.

269
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,559
Gongsun Heng had wings on him.

270
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,200
If we get rid of Shi Si Lang,

271
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,410
things will be a lot easier.

272
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,890
If the Great Khan takes action himself,

273
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,890
you know the consequences better than anyone else.

274
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,799
Why are we just procrastinating?

275
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,279
She Er's Wolf Army will conquer Daizhou soon.

276
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,359
Great Khan demanded that we assist him.

277
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,119
When the time comes,

278
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,170
I'll send you.

279
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,519
Me?

280
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,240
Ashina Sun.

281
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,599
I just talk too much.

282
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,680
You don't have to push me into the pit of fire.

283
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,440
Once this battle is over, you'll set off.

284
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,170
Remember.

285
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,170
When you reach Daizhou,

286
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,650
keep some defender's clothes with you.

287
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,559
Don't make things difficult for the common people.

288
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,039
You don't have to tell the Great Khan...

289
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,839
what I just said.

290
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,119
Is that all?

291
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,759
Tell me what's going on!

292
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,799
- Attack! - Attack!

293
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:38,890
Come on!

294
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,890
Run!

295
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,440
Run!

296
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,720
- Run! - Hurry up!

297
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Run!

298
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,799
Run for your life!

299
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,799
- Come on. - Run!

300
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,319
- Help! - Help!

301
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,410
What's happening?

302
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,440
- What are you doing? - Help!

303
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,839
- You can't go in! - Help!

304
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,799
- Open the door! - Help!

305
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,890
- What happened? - They have invaded the city!

306
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,759
Close the door.

307
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,839
- I'm begging you. - What are you waiting for?

308
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,890
- Come and help! - Please let my child in!

309
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,279
I'm begging you!

310
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,279
Open the door! Open up!

311
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,599
I'm begging you!

312
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,680
Please let my child hide!

313
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,440
I'm begging you!

314
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,039
I'm begging you.

315
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,599
Let the kid hide.

316
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,039
I'm begging you!

317
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,890
- What are you doing? - Please!

318
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,170
Let them in.

319
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,279
How dare you!

320
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,039
Who do you think you are?

321
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,680
How dare you point scissors at me?

322
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,920
Do you want to die?

Where is she?

326
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,799
Hey!

327
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
What are you doing?

328
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,440
The Great Khan demanded us to chase after...

329
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,839
Daizhou's army that escaped from the city.

330
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,440
Let's go!

331
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,079
Hurry up!

332
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,279
Master, where are we going?

333
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,160
Let's check the east part of the city.

334
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,880
The east of the city is besieged by the Eagle Army right now.

335
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,680
However, the area outside the east of the city is full of forests.

336
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,119
We never took strict precautions in that area.

337
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,160
The Eagle Army may not be that vigilant too.

338
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,119
Even if they keep a close watch,

339
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,079
there are so many mountains, so I'm sure we can avoid them.

340
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:32,920
Dou.

341
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,880
You're all grown up.

343
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,640
- Run. - Master, let's go together.

344
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,680
Call for help!

345
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640
You followed me here.

346
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,480
It seems that not only you want Crown Prince's seal,

347
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,319
but you also want my life.

348
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,920
So what?

349
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,759
Governor Gongsun has been gravely wounded.

350
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,759
Shuozhou is surrounded by enemies.

351
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,920
Do you really have to kill me during this time?

352
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,279
Cut the nonsense.

353
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,200
My job is to kill you now.

354
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,960
Princess Yongning,

355
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,759
do you have any last words?

356
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,599
Even if I die,

357
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,920
I won't die...

358
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,119
in a lackey's hand.

359
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,680
Master, are you all right?

360
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,279
Do you know who she is?

361
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
If you help her,

362
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,440
you'll regret it later.

363
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,839
I only know that...

364
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,960
he's the Commandant of Light Chariot of Shuozhou...

365
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,759
who is fighting hard to resist foreign enemies.

366
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
Sir.

367
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,000
I guess you came into Shuozhou...

368
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,759
before it is besieged by the Eagle Army.

369
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,319
You should know...

370
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,519
the situation in Shuozhou, right?

371
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,000
Governor Gongsun is injured.

372
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,759
Everyone in Shuozhou...

373
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,960
is relying on Chief Registrar Li.

374
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:40,759
So...

375
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,279
I can't let you hurt him.

376
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,519
If you insist on helping her,

377
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,400
we'll just wait and see.

378
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Thank you, Elder Qin.

379
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,039
Elder Qin.

380
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,039
I have an idea.

381
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,640
We can get out.

382
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,759
Back then, when we drown Tu Ka She in water,

383
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,119
we drained all the water...

384
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,079
from the drainage that connects to Wuding River.

385
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,880
Master, let me go.

386
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,960
Your injuries...

387
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,519
I'll do it.

388
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,279
I'm more familiar with it.

389
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,359
Chief Registrar Li.

390
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,799
Chief Registrar Li.

391
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,519
Governor Gongsun?

392
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,519
- Please help Elder Qin. - Governor Gongsun.

393
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,680
- Chief Registrar Li. - Why are you here?

394
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,759
Elder Qin told me...

395
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,319
you found a stone canal...

396
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
that leads outside the city.

397
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,200
Judging by your outfit,

398
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,720
are you going to notify others on your own?

399
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,720
The canal in the city leads to the Wuding River.

400
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,279
The city is besieged by the Eagle Army.

401
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,440
Wuding River is the only place that is not heavily guarded.

402
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,319
If I don't go now,

403
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,599
I'm afraid there will be no time.

404
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,400
I plan to get out when it's dark...

405
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,279
to inform everyone.

406
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,759
You're already severely injured.

407
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,359
Today, you're attacked again.

408
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,839
It's like rubbing salt to the injury.

409
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,119
How could I...

410
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,920
put you in danger again?

411
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,759
That's right, Chief Registrar Li.

412
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,000
That man was merciless.

413
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,599
Chief Registrar Li.

414
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:33,599
Let me go.

415
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,160
Shuozhou needs you and Master.

416
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Only when both of you are around, people in Shuozhou can survive.

417
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,599
Furthermore, I'm Governor Gongsun's guard.

418
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,680
It's my duty.

419
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
No.

420
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,680
The canal was used to drain water.

421
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,559
It's narrow. You're not going to make it through.

422
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,079
Governor Gongsun, I can do it.

423
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,640
I can go through it.

424
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,039
Dou!

425
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,240
Master, I know you're worried about me.

426
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
You don't want to put me in danger.

427
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,599
But you're injured.

428
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,880
If you don't get well soon,

429
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,920
you won't make it through.

430
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,279
What if you pass out on the journey...

431
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,680
and delay in seeking help?

432
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,799
That's why I'm the best candidate to do it.

433
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,240
Please trust me, Governor Gongsun.

434
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,839
I won't let you down.

435
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,240
Stop messing around.

436
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,799
You're just a kid.

437
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,759
How can I put you in danger?

438
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,039
It's precisely because I'm young...

439
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,440
that I won't draw their attention.

440
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,400
Besides,

441
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,000
why did my master take me as his disciple?

442
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,519
It's because I'm smart.

443
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,200
I've been with my master for so long.

444
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,880
I've learned many tricks from him.

445
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,279
But when I'm back,

446
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,839
please let me have a title in the military camp.

447
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,920
Master.

448
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,160
Don't hesitate.

449
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,240
We've been through so much together.

450
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,240
Don't you think that I can handle it?

451
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,640
All right.

452
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,119
Make sure you take care of the bag.

453
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,640
There are an escape route map and a wrist crossbow in the bag.

454
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,200
You can use it against the pursuers.

455
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,039
Master, you are very insightful.

456
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,480
When I return with glory,

457
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
you'll have to call me...

458
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,519
General Dou.

459
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,000
Dou.

460
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,720
Take care of yourself.

461
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,039
Yes, Master.

462
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,359
Tell everyone to hang in there.

463
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,799
Wait for me!

464
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,960
Chief Registrar Li.

465
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,839
You took in such a great disciple.

466
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,039
I didn't teach him much.

467
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,200
I, on the other hand,

468
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,920
am so blessed...

469
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,039
to have met him.

470
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,039
Your Highness.

471
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,160
Our men followed Mu Jin...

472
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,640
but he shook them off halfway.

473
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,680
He was heading towards Daizhou.

474
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,039
Daizhou?

475
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,079
What does that mean?

476
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,359
Has the Great Khan conquered Daizhou?

477
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,720
What's wrong?

478
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,400
Why?

479
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,799
Why don't I know anything?

480
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,160
No one takes the Bear Army seriously!

481
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,319
Calm down, Your Highness.

482
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,279
I'll keep a wary eye on Ashina Sun.

483
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,200
I'll never let him deceive the Great Khan...

484
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,960
and take all the credit for conquering Shuozhou.

485
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,160
That's enough!

486
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,960
That's nonsense!

487
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,000
Get lost!

488
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,119
Get lost!

489
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,720
<i>Prefectural Governor's Manor</i>

490
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,119
<i>Broad-minded and knowledgeable</i>

491
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,200
Yuan Niang.

492
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,640
You're finally back.

493
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,400
People in the city sent us food.

494
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,880
They said that even if they could only afford husks,

495
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,119
they had to make sure that Governor Gongsun...

496
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,599
and the soldiers have enough to eat.

497
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,880
I sent them all back.

498
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,680
Those are all the grains people have been saving.

499
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,319
I don't have the heart to take it.

500
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,480
My dear wife,

501
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,880
you did the right thing.

502
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,319
Father.

503
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,799
They said it was all thanks to you...

504
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,359
Shuozhou is not conquered.

505
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,200
Yuan Niang, you're praising me again.

506
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,960
However, I think...

507
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,160
Shuozhou...

508
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,559
is still surviving...

509
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,960
because of them.

510
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,640
It has nothing to do with me.

511
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
I can't take the credit.

512
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,720
Count the rations...

513
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,720
and the grains that we own.

514
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,319
Distribute them to the people.

515
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,319
Yes.

516
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,480
We must survive until Dou is back.

517
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Yes.

518
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,079
Go!

519
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Minister Yi, as per the Great Khan's demand,

520
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,599
we've annihilated all the soldiers in Daizhou.

521
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,799
How about those who escaped from the city?

522
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,799
They were killed too.

523
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,799
Well done. The Prince of Eagle Army...

524
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,000
send someone from Shuozhou.

525
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,480
Great Khan instructed us to take him in.

526
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,839
Go back to the city.

527
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,200
Don't make the representative of Eagle Army wait.

528
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,240
Yes, sir!

529
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,559
We're doomed.

530
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:58,799
The bridle-road is blocked.

531
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,000
The news can't reach Chang'an.

532
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,559
Daizhou has been conquered too.

533
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:02,920
We can't get reinforcements.

534
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,160
What should I do?

535
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,400
I have to hurry back...

536
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,720
to inform my master.

537
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,329
- Stop. - Stop.

538
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,559
All of you.

539
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:27,960
Take Tang Army's military uniform.

540
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,440
After leaving Daizhou,

541
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,599
change into Tang Army's military uniform.

542
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,639
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

543
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,519
- Go! - Go!

544
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,960
- Go! - Go!

545
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,880
Come on.

546
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,159
Get up.

547
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,840
- Spare our life. - Spare our life.

548
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,440
- Please spare our life. - Please spare our life.

549
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:18,079
- Please. - Please.

550
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,159
Kneel. Hurry up!

551
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,480
Why should we kneel?

552
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,329
It's because of them that we're suffering now.

553
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,769
Kneel down!

554
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,159
- Please spare our life. - Please spare our life.

555
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,809
- Please spare our life. - Please spare our life.

556
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:01,840
Stop.

557
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,159
Stop.

558
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,719
Stop it!

559
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,809
Who are you?

560
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:07,840
It doesn't matter if you don't recognize me.

561
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,480
Can't you recognize Wolf Fang Arrow?

562
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,599
Since when the Eagle Army has control over the Wolf Army?

563
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,519
Know your place and get lost.

564
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,599
You should know...

565
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,880
how powerful the Eagle Army is.

566
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,719
If you lose your life because of the refugees,

567
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,239
it's not worth it.

568
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,639
Retreat!

569
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,239
- Go! - Go!

570
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,480
Go!

571
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,679
You should go now.

572
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:50,239
- Thank you. - Thank you.

573
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,880
It's urgent. We need to hurry.

574
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,960
- Yes. - Yes.

575
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,000
Go!

576
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,199
- Thank you. - Thank you.

577
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,400
Let's go home.

578
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,769
- That's great. - Father.

579
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,559
- Go! - Go!

580
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,289
- Go! - Go!

581
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,039
Isn't he...

582
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,289
the baby monkey that was on that person's side?

583
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,199
Yes.

584
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,289
I know you.

585
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,199
Kill him.

586
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,159
Hold on!

587
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,289
My king!

588
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,329
I have something to tell you.

589
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,360
"My king"? It's His Highness.

590
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,559
Yes, Your Highness.

591
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,769
You greeted me wrongly.

592
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,199
Kill him!

593
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,519
Your Highness must be curious about the situation in Shuozhou.

594
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:20,519
Spare me.

595
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,440
I may be useful to Your Highness.

596
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,199
Tell me what is so great about you.

597
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Otherwise, I'll chop you into pieces.

598
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:47,400
I bet you know that...

599
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,519
Chief Registrar Li trusts me.

600
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
I know all his moves...

601
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,239
better than anyone.

602
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,440
During the battle at Wuding River,

603
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,079
Your Highness lost so many soldiers.

604
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,559
It's impossible for Your Highness to continue the battle.

605
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,440
I heard that the Eagle Army is taking the lead...

606
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,559
Darn you!

607
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,639
Nothing you say is pleasant to the ears!

608
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,880
Are you trying to make me mad?

609
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,159
Kill him!

610
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,440
If Your Highness had any control over the situation,

611
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,000
Your Highness should have known that Chief Registrar Li...

612
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,289
has been promoted to Commandant of Light Chariot!

613
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Your Highness, you should keep me...

614
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,039
and let me negotiate with Shuozhou.

615
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,119
I can make Chief Registrar Li...

616
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,639
hand Shuozhou on a silver platter.

617
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,159
Now,

618
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,960
even this little monkey...

619
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,159
has the guts to deceive me.

620
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,840
Do I look so gullible?

621
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,960
Do I?

622
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,239
That rascal, Sima Jian, lied to you!

623
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,559
Your Highness,

624
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,199
Chief Registrar Li and Governor Gongsun are dying.

625
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,559
They were both seriously injured by the Eagle Army.

626
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,679
It's the perfect time to make peace.

627
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,000
I know them really well.

628
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,400
No one is more suitable for peace negotiations than me.

629
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,480
The Eagle Army has been fighting for so long.

630
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,039
However, everyone in Shuozhou still works together with high spirits.

631
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,840
At worst,

632
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,159
even if I can't persuade him,

633
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:12,639
we can crush the morale of the people in Shuozhou.

634
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:13,880
That's something...

635
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,679
the Eagle Army can't do.

636
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:26,400
Let's trust him for this once.

637
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,880
Tie him up to my horse.

638
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,159
Bring him to the battle.

639
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,289
Make sure he lives.

640
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,480
Yes, sir.

641
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,480
It's the Great Khan's order.

642
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,079
Intrusive maneuvers will be executed.

643
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,559
Go!

644
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:14,719
- Hang in there. - I can't walk anymore.

645
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,559
Young lady.

646
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,239
You mustn't do that.

647
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Put it on.

648
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,159
You're so kind.

649
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,159
Young lady, you were kind enough to save me.

650
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,440
If only my daughter...

651
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,880
was as lucky as I am.

652
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:55,519
You must stay alive.

653
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,440
You'll be able to see your daughter soon.

654
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,199
Your Highness, the Eagle Army...

655
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,559
obtained a lot of clothes belonging to soldiers of Daizhou.

656
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,289
In the journey, Mu Jin instructed the Eagle Army...

657
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,480
to change into Tang Army's military uniform.

658
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,289
The Eagle Army wants to take the lead!

659
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,519
Gather the Bear Army!

660
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,000
Hurry up!
