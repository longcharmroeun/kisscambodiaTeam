00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,079
(The Long Ballad)

2
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,400
(This is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,239
(Episode 42)

4
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,519
(Quadrangular Courtyard)

5
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,200
That's so ridiculous.

6
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,879
Why did my father agree to it?

7
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,519
What are you afraid of?

8
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,319
Didn't they say that it doesn't matter who is it,

9
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,719
anyone can take the stage?

10
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,079
Does that mean...

11
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,480
people of the Tang Dynasty can join the open competition too?

12
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,519
What's wrong?

13
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,719
Are you worried that Shu Yu...

14
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,840
refuses to go on stage?

15
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,319
Le Yan.

16
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,560
Well...

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,719
Young Khan of Ashina Tribe is good, isn't he?

18
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,599
If no one can fight him,

19
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,680
what should I do?

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,639
With a top-notch horse, Tian Ji...

21
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,960
defeated King Wei of Qi's second-rated horse.

22
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,400
I can defeat him too.

23
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,560
I refuse.

24
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,090
Why?

25
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,280
It's boring.

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,400
Chang Ge.

27
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,810
It's okay. Let's forget about it.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,639
Just fight this once for Le Yan.

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,960
Firstly, you defeat She Er.

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,159
Then, you lose to Wei Shu Yu on purpose.

31
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,479
That's all.

32
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,039
Do you really think Wei Shu Yu can defeat me?

33
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,199
No way.

34
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,000
That's why you should lose to him on purpose.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,039
Why should I do that?

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,810
What do you mean "why"?

37
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,000
You're not going to marry Le Yan.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
It's only natural that you lose to him.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,599
Chang Ge, you don't have to fight...

40
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,039
because of me.

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,039
It's impossible that I lose to that guy...

42
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,080
in front of you.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
Forget it. I don't want to talk to him.

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Chang Ge.

45
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,680
Chang Ge.

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,639
Chang Ge.

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,479
You don't have to force your friend.

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,479
You don't have to force Shu Yu either.

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,919
If he likes me,

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,960
he'll figure it out when he's in the ring.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,800
If he doesn't like me,

52
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,319
then just let it be.

53
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,240
There are so many nice men in the Tang Dynasty.

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,919
Of course, I can get married to someone.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,840
Le Yan.

56
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,879
I'm really impressed.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
Forget it.

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
Even if we can't beat She Er,

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,199
it's good to exhaust him a little.

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,439
You can't go in.

61
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,639
You can't go in.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,479
Keep going.

63
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,599
Here.

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,639
Li Cheng Qian.

65
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,879
It's you.

66
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,319
Li Chang Ge.

67
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,560
I haven't sought revenge for what happened in Luoyang.

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Fine.

69
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,240
People!

70
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,170
Li Cheng Qian.

71
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,680
Le Yan.

72
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,399
Everyone, get out.

73
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,610
Come here.

74
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,680
Le Yan, calm down.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
You can't hit me.

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,879
I'll beg for forgiveness from Father later.

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,730
- Come here. - No.

78
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,120
Don't. Let go of me.

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,199
It's them. They brought me here.

80
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,800
- No. - No.

81
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,959
You're just unlucky today...

82
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,279
that I'm still alive.

83
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,439
But since we're old friends,

84
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,050
I won't hold it against you.

85
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,170
But from now on, if there's any rumor in Chang'an...

86
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,639
saying that Princess Yongning...

87
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,759
is still alive,

88
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,000
you should know the consequences.

89
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,759
Why are you so afraid of her?

90
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,680
Li Cheng Qian, you're too young.

91
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,360
You don't know a lot of things.

92
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,759
What they're playing now...

93
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,120
are leftovers from what I played.

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,279
Tell him.

95
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,050
What did I do back then?

96
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,519
Deputy Minister Wang...

97
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,079
is the son of Prince Dongjin.

98
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,839
He once stole a girl by force.

99
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,920
Princess Yongning broke three of his bones.

100
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,800
Later on, he ran away whenever he saw females.

101
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,079
He's still single until now.

102
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,839
The youngest son of Councilor Chen...

103
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,560
peed in the Free Life Pond at the East Market.

104
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,199
Princess Yongning immersed him in the pond for two days.

105
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,439
From then on, he focused on practicing Buddhism.

106
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,040
He advocates for setting animals free.

107
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,879
When I was young,

108
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,079
I disrespected Princess Yongning once.

109
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,800
Her Highness beat me up whenever she saw me.

110
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,199
To run away,

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,399
I trained myself really hard.

112
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,519
That's how I got the body.

113
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,480
Are you Fatty?

114
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
You're the one who bullied me all my life.

115
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,000
Li Cheng Qian, come here.

116
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,360
Has he been playing with all of you all this while?

117
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,639
Why should I tell you?

118
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,680
Come closer.

119
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,199
I want him...

120
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,879
to save your sister...

121
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,360
at the martial arts competition.

122
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,519
Zhangsun Jing is not our friend.

123
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,519
He's here today to make up the numbers.

124
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,639
You saw it.

125
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,879
He's watching at the side.

126
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,000
He didn't do anything.

127
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,240
You have good taste.

128
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,639
I can attest to that.

129
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,879
He's a good man.

130
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,959
All right.

131
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,879
You'll do it.

132
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,560
At the martial arts competition tomorrow,

133
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,279
you need to defeat the representative from Ashina Tribe.

134
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,319
Don't let anyone win our princess away.

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Godfather.

136
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,839
Moving forward,

137
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,279
I'm afraid...

138
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
I can't teach you anymore.

139
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't be so pessimistic.

140
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,439
We'll get the best doctor...

141
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,560
to cure you.

142
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,240
I know my condition...

143
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,959
very well.

144
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,800
Be loyal...

145
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,120
to His Majesty.

146
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Don't worry, Godfather.

147
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
I'll be loyal to the Tang Dynasty.

148
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
There are many ways to show loyalty.

149
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,800
Tomorrow, when you compete with Ashina Tribe...

150
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
in the ring,

151
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,680
make sure you don't lose.

152
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,720
I know how you feel.

153
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,160
Think about it.

154
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,319
If you feel like you're not worthy,

155
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,360
you can choose to beat Young Khan first...

156
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,000
and then pretend to lose...

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,199
to the other contestants from noble families.

158
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,199
But...

159
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,120
you can also opt to win until the end.

160
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,879
If you didn't raise me,

161
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,720
I'd still be an illegitimate child.

162
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,360
I wouldn't dare to cross the line to marry a princess.

163
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,799
All my life,

164
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,450
I sacrificed for the country.

165
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,559
I've never thought about myself.

166
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:00,039
You don't have to follow my path.

167
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,159
Just do as you wish.

168
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,679
Follow your heart but never cross the line.

169
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,919
That might be the best way to survive in the world.

170
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm coming.

171
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,240
Master.

172
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,210
You're here too.

173
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,450
- I wonder who will win. - Yes.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,159
I'm mad at Ashina Sun.

175
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,480
He really didn't come as he said.

176
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,279
Ashina Sun shouldn't be here.

177
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
If he's here,

178
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,240
he'll win for sure.

179
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
If he won,

180
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,679
he would have to marry the princess of the Tang Dynasty.

181
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
No.

182
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,799
I can't digest the fact...

183
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,450
that he's going to marry you.

184
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,679
If he marries the princess of the Tang Dynasty,

185
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
I can't take it.

186
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,519
Chang Ge.

187
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,450
Why isn't the Emperor of Tang here?

188
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,399
He just needs to know the result.

189
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,720
The result?

190
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,559
Please welcome the guardian warrior,

191
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,159
Young Khan of Ashina Tribe.

192
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,759
Greetings, envoys.

193
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,399
Is there anyone who volunteers to fight on the stage?

194
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,960
If no one is willing to fight, then...

195
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,399
I'm in.

196
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,879
- That's Zhi Xi. - It's Zhi Xi.

197
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,600
- He's doing it. - Right.

198
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,720
Why did Zhi Xi go up there?

199
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Tegreg Tribe fawns over Ashina Tribe.

200
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,559
They go against the alliance the most.

201
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,240
Do they plan to surrender to the Tang Dynasty?

202
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,440
Young Khan is so bold and brave.

203
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,639
He's indeed the best warrior on the grassland.

204
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,600
He is definitely qualified to marry the princess of the Tang Dynasty.

205
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,120
I, Zhi Xi, congratulate Young Khan in advance...

206
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,919
for marrying the new Khatun.

207
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,480
Look at Zhi Xi.

208
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,320
Young Khan won.

209
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,120
Do people from Tegreg Tribe...

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
all lack a spine?

211
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,639
If you don't want to form an alliance with the Tang Dynasty,

212
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,120
just go back to the desert.

213
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,840
Don't embarrass the rest of us who also come from the desert.

214
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,960
Your Highness.

215
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,559
No doubt I'm no match for Young Khan.

216
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,240
If any of you from the Southern Desert...

217
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,919
can fight Young Khan of Ashina Tribe,

218
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,240
please come forward.

219
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,960
Be it the Northern Desert or the Southern Desert,

220
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,080
is there no one who dares to fight me?

221
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,159
The Southern Desert intends to form an alliance with Tang.

222
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,039
Isn't it because you can't defeat anyone?

223
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,559
That's why you can only rely on Tang.

224
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,480
However, the princess of the Tang Dynasty...

225
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,960
is going to marry Young Khan.

226
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,480
Can't you see the state of affairs?

227
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,080
Are you really going to blindly follow...

228
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,279
the princess of the Northern Desert?

229
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,360
You!

230
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,200
I'm so going to beat you up,

231
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
you spineless man.

232
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,320
Don't stoop to his level.

233
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,720
Sit down.

234
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,840
What took you so long?

235
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,360
What are you wearing?

236
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,679
Don't touch my crown.

237
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,159
I'm here to accept the challenge.

238
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,919
Of course I have to dress like a warrior.

239
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,240
What are you laughing at?

240
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,360
Who are you?

241
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,879
Are you making fun of me?

242
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,360
She's Princess Tu Jia from the Southern Desert.

243
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,559
She's one of us.

244
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,840
Zhen Zhu, he's the crown prince of the Tang Dynasty.

245
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,480
The crown prince...

246
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,960
looks so brave and extraordinary.

247
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,720
I just can't contain my joy.

248
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,039
Why are you dressed like that?

249
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,480
Princess Yong'an shouldn't be present at the scene.

250
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,399
I want to see how it ends for me too.

251
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,480
It's okay, Chang Ge.

252
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,919
No one will notice.

253
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,519
Both of you are indeed siblings.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,399
Forget it. It's too late.

255
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,720
Let's go in.

256
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,440
Is there no one else from the desert?

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,080
In that case, the betrothal with the Tang Dynasty...

258
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,360
It's too early to tell.

259
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,159
Welcome, Your Highness.

260
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,919
Are you Young Khan of Ashina Tribe...

261
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,360
who wants to marry my sister?

262
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,519
Your Highness.

263
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,440
The young man on the stage is my son.

264
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
Thanks for the courtesy, Khatun.

265
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,600
That's not necessary anyway.

266
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,399
After all, we won't become a family.

267
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,320
It's better to keep a distance.

268
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,600
Did you bring anyone to take part in the competition?

269
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,639
Whether we are going to become a family or not,

270
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,879
we'll find out soon.

271
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,080
Zhangsun Jing.

272
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,240
I'll leave my sister in your hands.

273
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,000
I won't let you down.

274
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,879
I have a good relationship with the two princesses.

275
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,679
I allow both of you...

276
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,320
to watch the match together.

277
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,879
Thank you, Your Highness.

278
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,799
Cheng Qian.

279
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,600
Will it work?

280
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't worry.

281
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,480
Zhangsun Jing is the best fighter among Mother's nephews.

282
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,840
If he can't do it,

283
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,519
the rest won't be able to do it.

284
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,840
- In the blink of an eye, - He lost.

285
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,200
he lost even before he got to make a move.

286
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Yes.

287
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,879
Young Khan of Ashina Tribe is winning consecutively.

288
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,320
What?

289
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,759
Is that the end?

290
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,159
Is there anyone else who would like to challenge Young Khan?

291
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,360
Do we really have no one that can fight?

292
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,720
I guess no one dares to challenge me.

293
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,039
What's the hurry?

294
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,240
Marriage is a major life event.

295
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,960
You should give them more time to think about it.

296
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,000
Since Crown Prince has spoken,

297
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,639
I'll give every one of you...

298
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,200
more time to consider...

299
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,319
if you want to fight me in the ring.

300
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,839
I didn't expect Zhangsun Jing...

301
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,650
to be so weak.

302
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,480
What should we do now?

303
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,890
I don't want my sister...

304
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,839
to marry to such a poor place.

305
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,680
Furthermore, She Er...

306
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,000
really gets on my nerves.

307
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,519
I don't want him to be my brother-in-law.

308
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,599
Don't worry, Le Yan.

309
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,170
I'm sure Shu Yu will come.

310
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,000
Mr. Wei is here.

311
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,759
What happened?

312
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,119
Mr. Wei is here.

313
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,119
That's good.

314
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,960
Shu Yu.

315
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,240
Le Yan.

316
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,519
Before I get into the ring,

317
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,839
I have something to tell you.

318
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,079
I've been thinking about it...

319
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,000
and I decided to tell you that...

320
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,119
I will fight in the ring for sure.

321
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,960
You're like my sister.

322
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,279
I won't allow you to marry to the grassland.

323
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,200
Protecting is one thing.

324
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,519
But I can't lie to you.

325
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,839
If I win in the competition,

326
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,559
that doesn't mean we're getting married.

327
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,000
Le Yan.

328
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,799
You're so brave now.

329
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,119
I'm glad to see that.

330
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,119
That's why I can't be a coward...

331
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,599
that won't move forward.

332
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,359
I hope you can understand my goodwill...

333
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,720
as your big brother.

334
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,680
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,960
I understand.

336
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,920
Since you're not joining for the sake of marrying me,

337
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,319
then you don't have to go on the stage.

338
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,839
What I'm looking forward to...

339
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,920
isn't a victory in the fight.

340
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,039
I want someone who truly loves me.

341
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,039
I've thought it through.

342
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,319
It's not supposed to be a relationship between siblings.

343
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,799
I want a relationship where both persons...

344
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,650
can live together as husband and wife forever.

345
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,680
The man in the ring...

346
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,000
should fight for me because he loves me.

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,650
It's not about protecting me.

348
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,000
If it's only about protecting me,

349
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,170
I don't need it.

350
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,440
Even if you win the fight,

351
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,599
to me,

352
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,170
that's sheer humiliation.

353
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,440
But the competition...

354
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,680
As for the competition,

355
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,319
I won't trouble you, Shu Yu.

356
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm no longer the old Le Yan.

357
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,680
It's my business.

358
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,119
I can take care of myself.

359
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,079
Thank you, Shu Yu.

360
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,319
Le Yan.

361
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,480
What's wrong?

362
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,960
Where is Shu Yu? Why isn't he coming along?

363
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,410
Did he bully you?

364
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,359
- I'll go get him. - No.

365
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,240
I don't want to force him.

366
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,559
I don't want to make life difficult for myself either.

367
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,890
Have you made yourself clear?

368
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,559
Loud and clear.

369
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,440
I'll get Ashina Sun.

370
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,680
It's okay.

371
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,920
- Why not? - I don't want to force anyone.

372
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,240
You're not forcing anyone.

373
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,039
It's about your marriage.

374
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,039
Let's go through this for now.

375
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,920
- Wait for me. - Chang Ge.

376
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,960
Ashina Sun.

377
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,960
You finally came.

378
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,599
Come on, get in the ring.

379
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,240
I'm just here to watch.

380
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,650
What are you talking about?

381
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,170
You're already here. You obviously have the heart to help.

382
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,440
Why are you still lying?

383
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,039
I don't help others.

384
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,519
Le Yan is not just anyone.

385
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,559
Ashina Sun, stop talking.

386
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,440
As much as I hate to let you go on the stage,

387
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,170
but now, there's no other way.

388
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,359
You should go up.

389
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,839
How is it?

390
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,480
Is there no one who dares to go on stage?

391
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,200
If no one dares to challenge my son,

392
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,039
I'll take that as a yes...

393
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,559
to the betrothal with the Tang Dynasty.

394
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,359
Go now, Ashina Sun!

395
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,160
It's urgent. We'll talk about it after the fight.

396
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,640
We'll deal with the rest later.

397
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,759
Exactly.

398
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,160
Even if Chang Ge agrees with it, I won't allow it.

399
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,559
What is this?

400
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,319
An ample time has been given for your consideration.

401
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,319
I'll count to three.

402
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,599
If no one takes the stage,

403
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,240
it's settled then.

404
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,039
- Three. - Ashina Sun.

405
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,279
Ashina Sun.

406
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,359
Look at how smug he is.

407
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,960
Don't you want to punch him?

408
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,480
Two.

409
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,359
Hurry, jump from here.

410
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,519
I...

411
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,519
One.

412
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,839
Ashina Sun.

413
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm here.

414
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,519
Hao Du.

415
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,599
Who are you?

416
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,759
A pawn of the Tang Dynasty who can defeat you.

417
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,440
- Good job. - Good job.

418
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,640
He's badly injured.

419
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,119
Get up.

420
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,200
Hao Du.

421
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,279
Hao Du.

422
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,400
That's enough.

423
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,160
That's enough.

424
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,240
No more fighting. We admit defeat.

425
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,880
We admit defeat.

426
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
Hao Du, stop it.

427
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,759
I'm resigned to my fate. That's enough.

428
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,440
Hao Du.

429
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:11,599
I won't admit defeat.

430
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,759
That's enough.

431
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,319
You must not surrender to fate either.

432
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,839
That's enough.

433
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,920
She Er.

434
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,599
Stop wasting time.

435
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,359
Let's get this over with.

436
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Strangle him.

437
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,160
Hao Du, hurry up!

438
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,359
She Er.

439
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,759
Stop it!

440
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,759
The warrior of the Tang Dynasty won!

441
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,200
- That's great! - Great!

442
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,559
- That's great! - Great!

443
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,720
- Well done. - That's great!

444
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,039
- That's great! - Great!

445
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,559
- Okay. - Great!

446
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,759
We won!

447
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,680
- That's great! - Great!

448
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,799
He's a hero.

449
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,400
- He deserves to be respected. - Great!

450
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,960
Hao Du.

451
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,799
Thank you.

452
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,480
I will return to the palace to report to His Majesty.

453
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,720
- That's great. - Goodbye.

454
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,599
Well done.

455
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,079
Well done.

456
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Sure.

457
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,400
I won.

458
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,720
You don't have to marry him.

459
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,480
You don't have to marry him.

460
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,759
I know that...

461
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,400
you've met with Le Yan...

462
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,720
and made it clear to her.

463
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,799
Yes.

464
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,160
I don't want to hurt her.

465
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
You did the right thing.

466
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,279
You shouldn't have deceived her.

467
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,559
But if Hao Du didn't appear,

468
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,119
I don't think it would end well.

469
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,079
Even if Hao Du didn't come,

470
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,279
I'd already prepared...

471
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,519
to go on the stage.

472
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,440
I will never let Ashina Tribe take Le Yan away.

473
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,640
Then, I will ask His Majesty for forgiveness.

474
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,359
I believe that given a little bit of time,

475
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,960
Le Yan will come to her senses.

476
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,599
I don't expect the three of us...

477
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,920
to go back to how we were.

478
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,319
But at least,

479
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,119
you and Le Yan have to live well.

480
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,759
At any time.

481
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,519
I'm still your brother.

482
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,960
Thank you, Shu Yu.

483
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,160
Shu Yu.

484
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,160
There's something you need to pay more attention to.

485
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,240
The Tang Dynasty has to be more careful...

486
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,839
with Khatun from Ashina Tribe.

487
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,720
Why did you get in the ring?

488
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,519
I...

489
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,279
I worry that Ashina Tribe...

490
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,680
would bully the Tang Dynasty.

491
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,680
So...

492
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,440
You're just like Shu Yu.

493
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,960
You went on the stage...

494
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,640
just to save the Tang Dynasty's reputation.

495
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,799
You didn't do it for me.

496
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,640
Hao Du.

497
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,440
I, Li Le Yan, will find a way...

498
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
to salvage the reputation of the Tang Dynasty.

499
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,799
I don't need your help.

500
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,799
No, I'm actually...

501
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,319
I don't wish to see you...

502
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,720
being forced into a marriage...

503
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,920
with someone you don't like.

504
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,680
This is a sparring competition.

505
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,559
I'll marry whoever wins.

506
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,640
You've won the fight.

507
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,319
I'll marry you as I promised.

508
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,519
So, you think...

509
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,440
You think that I like you?

510
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,079
I know who you love.

511
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,559
Don't worry, Your Highness.

512
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,640
The fight doesn't count.

513
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,759
I will talk to His Majesty tomorrow.

514
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,880
You didn't even...

515
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,160
think about marrying me.

516
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,599
I am just a warrior.

517
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,240
How can I think too much?

518
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Why are you always so humble before me?

519
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,799
You could've done something greater.

520
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,519
Why did you risk your life...

521
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,920
- because of me? - That's because you deserve it.

522
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,200
But...

523
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,119
But I'm not good enough for you.

524
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,680
Do you want to know what I see in you?

525
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,680
When I first met you,

526
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,000
you were like an ice cube.

527
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,799
Your face is cold.

528
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,880
So does your heart.

529
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,319
And I was afraid of you.

530
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,960
I wouldn't dare nor want to go near you.

531
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
Later,

532
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,319
you're chasing after Chang Ge to kill her.

533
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,480
I hated you even more.

534
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,240
I guess I was wrong.

535
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,039
You're not cold-hearted.

536
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,279
You have no heart.

537
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,960
But...

538
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,359
when I was in the North...

539
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,720
running all the way to Luoyang,

540
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,240
you saved me.

541
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,240
The moment you hugged me...

542
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,960
and said that you would bring me home,

543
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,000
I was not afraid of you anymore.

544
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,960
Later on,

545
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,519
I relied on you more and more.

546
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,809
I started to feel that...

547
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,840
your heart is warm.

548
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,239
Only when I am with you,

549
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,329
I can feel a sense of security.

550
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,599
I'm at ease.

551
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,809
Actually, I gradually realized that...

552
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,039
you did many things...

553
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,159
because you had no choice.

554
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,519
You said many things...

555
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,840
but you didn't mean it.

556
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,809
Hao Du.

557
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,360
Actually, you're a nice person...

558
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,599
but you tend to hide your emotions.

559
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,840
You always make things hard for yourself...

560
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,000
to please others.

561
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,119
Today, in the ring,

562
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,599
I saw you being beaten over and over again.

563
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,079
I was really scared.

564
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,199
I was scared that I might not be able to see you again.

565
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,239
When I thought that I might not be able to see you again, I...

566
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,809
Let me ask you one last time.

567
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,639
Why did you get on the stage?

568
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,039
I got on the stage...

569
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,809
because I just didn't want you to be sad.

570
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,159
At the same time, I wanted to fight for myself too.

571
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:37,400
Fight for what?

572
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,519
Your Highness, you said this before.

573
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,199
You asked me to protect your precious life.

574
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:43,840
In the past,

575
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,519
I was protecting you as a royal guard.

576
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,360
But moving forward...

577
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,719
What were you trying to say?

578
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,199
Moving forward,

579
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,119
I'll protect you as your husband.

580
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,329
Why are you so bold now?

581
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,199
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

582
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,719
Just forget what I said.

583
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,289
Forget it?

584
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:27,639
Are you going to go back on your own words?

585
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,920
No, I didn't want to...

586
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,199
I told you.

587
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,880
You need to be careful.

588
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,769
If you don't take care of yourself,

589
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,239
how are you going to protect me?

590
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,679
I...

591
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,960
You...

592
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,880
Didn't you get hurt pretty badly?

593
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,329
You're still so strong.

594
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,329
It's suffocating.

595
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,679
I don't know what happened to me.

596
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:03,639
After hearing what you said,

597
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,289
I think I'm fine now.

598
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,519
Since you're all better now,

599
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,199
we should go to the farmhouse tomorrow.

600
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,440
It's been a while since I last went there.

601
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,920
I wonder how the people are doing.

602
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:22,400
Okay.

603
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,480
No matter where you go,

604
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:38,329
I'll be with you.

605
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,440
(Quadrangular Courtyard)

606
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,000
Look at your feet.

607
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,400
I didn't expect...

608
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,480
that this bunny...

609
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,119
would be getting married soon.

610
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,119
Le Yan,

611
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,809
can you forget Shu Yu for real?

612
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:21,199
Getting married is a big deal.

613
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,360
If you don't like Hao Du,

614
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,920
no one can force you.

615
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,559
Chang Ge.

616
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,440
I'm no longer...

617
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,769
the crybaby.

618
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,719
I've always...

619
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,679
seen Shu Yu...

620
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,000
as a hero.

621
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,880
I relied on him and admired him.

622
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:40,329
Gradually, it became a habit.

623
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,039
Until the day of the competition,

624
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,000
I realized that...

625
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,880
I've been neglecting Hao Du...

626
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,519
who was always next to me.

627
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,239
Shu Yu...

628
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,360
I'll always treat him as a brother.

629
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,000
Are you sure you really like Hao Du?

630
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,119
How about...

631
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,329
you and Ashina Sun?

632
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,239
How do you feel about him?

633
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,159
You're getting worse.

634
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:10,039
I was asking you a question.

635
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,679
In front of Ashina Sun,

636
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,840
do you feel the most relaxed?

637
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,329
It's as if you can show him...

638
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,239
all your emotions.

639
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:20,809
Furthermore,

640
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,769
you're not afraid that he'll find you hard to like.

641
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,639
You just want to show him...

642
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,679
your true self.

643
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,039
When I met him,

644
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:35,289
I was in the most awkward situation.

645
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:36,920
I was at my worst.

646
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,480
That's right.

647
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,960
In front of Hao Du,

648
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,519
I feel the most relaxed and natural.

649
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,769
On the other hand, in front of Shu Yu,

650
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:48,480
I'm so clumsy.

651
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,119
I should have let go of myself.

652
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,039
I shouldn't make him guilty either.

653
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,400
Everyone should enjoy...

654
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,000
being the most relaxed.

655
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:00,289
We should look into our hearts.

656
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:01,639
That's how we can be happy.

657
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,079
By the way,

658
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,400
I'm going to bed early.

659
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,639
Tomorrow, Hao Du and I...

660
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,880
are going to the farmhouse.

661
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,440
You just can't wait to go on a secret date with him.

662
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,769
That's not the case.

663
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,119
It's called...

664
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,079
"concerning about society".

665
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:22,239
They want us to sign the treaty right now?

666
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,519
No way.

667
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,679
It's late.

668
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,519
Why is it so noisy outside?

669
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,840
You don't want to offend the Ashina Tribe.

670
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,519
The treaty?

671
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,329
Then we came here for nothing.

672
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:35,239
- That's right. - You shouldn't sign it.

673
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,239
It's a dilemma.

674
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,289
That's right. You can't sign it.

675
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:40,480
Why is Tegreg Tribe so afraid of Ashina Tribe?

676
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,119
The Northern and Southern Desert... suggested the alliance...

677
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,719
to save your guts.

678
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,119
They've just won the fight today.

679
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:48,679
Now, the Emperor of Tang...

680
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,920
wants us to sign the treaty.

681
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,480
Isn't it obvious that he wants us...

682
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,079
to take sides in front of Ashina Tribe?

683
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,289
Look at their moves.

684
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:56,599
The Tang Dynasty could be the other Ashina Tribe.

685
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,679
You...

686
00:41:58,289 --> 00:41:59,400
He's distorting my father's intention.

687
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,559
That's enough. Stop it.

688
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,960
Let go of me.

689
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,519
Chang Ge.

690
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Everyone.

691
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,960
Emperor of Tang means to say that...

692
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,289
as long as Tang is here,

693
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:14,239
there's no need to be afraid of Ashina Tribe.

694
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,480
Of course.

695
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,329
Since the alliance was brought up by the Northern Desert,

696
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,480
if the Tang Dynasty turns into another Ashina Tribe,

697
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,159
the Northern Desert will fight against it.

698
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,289
That's right.

699
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,039
The treaty was initiated by the Northern Desert.

700
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:25,599
Tegreg Tribe doesn't acknowledge it.

701
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,159
And let me tell you something.

702
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:29,039
There's no way the Tegreg Tribe...

703
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,400
will sign the treaty.

704
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
People.

705
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,559
Think about it.

706
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,329
Once you sign the treaty,

707
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:36,719
it means you're clearly going against the Ashina Tribe.

708
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,289
We can't afford to offend the Ashina Tribe.

709
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:42,880
- Right. - We can't offend them.

710
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,440
We can't afford to offend the Ashina Tribe.

711
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,769
So what if you offend Ashina Tribe?

712
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,400
The Tang Dynasty will protect its allies.

713
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,840
Even if the Ashina Tribe intends to attack any of the tribes,

714
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,440
they will have to think about it again.

715
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,769
Don't you agree?

716
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,809
- Yes, that's right. - That's right.

717
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But...

718
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,119
Ashina Tribe is too strong.

719
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,039
I can't stop the princess of the Northern Desert...

720
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,519
to rely on the Tang Dynasty...

721
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:06,079
but don't give us a hard time.

722
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,519
Let's go.

723
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,920
- This... - Wait.

724
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,199
He left just like that.

725
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,119
It's a dilemma.

726
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,039
