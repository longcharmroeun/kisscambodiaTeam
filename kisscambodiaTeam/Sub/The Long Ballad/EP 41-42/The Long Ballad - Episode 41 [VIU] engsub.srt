00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,560
(The Long Ballad)

2
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,040
(This is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,239
(Episode 41)

4
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,319
Your Highness.

5
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,439
An Rou.

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,120
Do you think I'll be sent to the Ashina Tribe?

7
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Your Highness.

8
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,560
You mean the world to His Majesty.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,599
I believe His Majesty wouldn't be able to bear...

10
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,920
to let you marry to a faraway place.

11
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,159
Your Highness.

12
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,810
Nothing is certain yet.

13
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,400
Don't worry too much first.

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
You also saw...

15
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,199
Ashina Tribe's Khatun today.

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,759
From what I heard from the elders in the palace...

17
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,919
about her story,

18
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,159
she married to the grasslands for so long.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,280
She has had many husbands.

20
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,639
She seems to be doing well,

21
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,719
but who knows...

22
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,599
what she has been through?

23
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,000
Tell me, Hao Du.

24
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,199
Am I being too selfish?

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,090
I'm only thinking about myself.

26
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,439
Your Highness.

27
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,240
If you're willing,

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
I...

29
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,199
Le Yan.

30
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,639
Shu Yu.

31
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
You're here.

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,199
You don't have to tell me. I know everything.

33
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,759
I heard about what happened at the Quadrangular Courtyard.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,240
Shu Yu.

35
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,400
What should I do?

36
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,960
I don't know what I should do.

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,039
Shu Yu.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't be afraid.

39
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,199
I will go and write a letter to His Majesty.

40
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,199
I'll write thousands of letters.

41
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,199
I'll surely get His Majesty to take back his orders.

42
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,039
If it doesn't work...

43
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,280
If it doesn't work, I'll plead with my father...

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,840
and tell him to talk to His Majesty with me.

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,199
In consideration of my father,

46
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,199
- His Majesty... - It's no use.

47
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,199
We're currently in a critical phase...

48
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,680
of our alliance with the Great Desert.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
This is what Ashina Tribe is holding onto.

50
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,159
If Father changes his mind,

51
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,879
they'll surely make an issue about it.

52
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,919
If the alliance is affected because of me,

53
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,170
how can I face everyone?

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,879
If Tang's princess...

55
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,839
dies...

56
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,319
No one would let a dead person intermarry.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,079
Le Yan.

58
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,120
- Don't do anything stupid. - Shu Yu.

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,050
I'm not doing something stupid.

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,170
When King Nan of Zhou was on the throne,

61
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,319
Fan Ju faked his death to avoid disaster.

62
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Chang Ge...

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,079
Chang Ge has the most experience in faking death.

64
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,730
She'll surely figure something out for me.

65
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,240
If Princess Yong'an is gone,

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
then...

67
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,170
no one can force me to intermarry again.

68
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,839
And I won't drag my father down with me.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But...

70
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,759
That would be the last resort.

71
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,170
What should I do then?

72
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Sit and do nothing?

73
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,839
We'll figure something out.

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,120
If the Ashina Tribe...

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,199
officially talks to Father about this,

76
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,759
when everything is settled,

77
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,319
I must really marry to the grasslands.

78
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,279
I'm sure there's a way.

79
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sure there's a way.

80
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,680
Shu Yu.

81
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,879
If I marry to the grasslands,

82
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,800
to you,

83
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,680
it actually doesn't matter, does it?

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,399
Of course not.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,759
We grew up together.

86
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,279
I've always thought of you as my own sister.

87
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,279
As my own sister.

88
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,519
Thought of you as my own sister.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
Your sister?

90
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,360
So that day,

91
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,040
when I told you how I felt,

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
you thought of me...

93
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
as a younger sister?

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,759
Le Yan.

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,959
You may go.

96
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,360
I want to be alone.

97
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,759
Wei Shu Yu.

98
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,959
What are you going to do now?

99
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,360
You can't answer me?

100
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,680
So all this time,

101
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,319
you didn't think about how to deal with this?

102
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,160
In negotiating peace with Tang,

103
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,800
of course they need a useful hostage.

104
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Princess Yong'an is His Majesty's precious daughter.

105
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,720
Anyone can think of this.

106
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
I can't believe you didn't think of this at all.

107
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm asking you now,

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,120
and you couldn't even answer.

109
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,240
Hao Du.

110
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
You're crossing the line.

111
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,600
If you're just an official in the imperial court,

112
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,519
of course I won't ask you.

113
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,199
But don't you know?

114
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,480
She likes you.

115
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,480
She has always cared about how you feel and what you think.

116
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,399
Can you bear to let her be sad?

117
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,720
Stay out of my business.

118
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,879
Stop arguing!

119
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,839
You can both go.

120
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,199
I want to be alone.

121
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,360
(Gather beautiful scenery and auspiciousness)

122
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Mimi.

123
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,959
- Mimi. - Are they here?

124
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,319
Yes.

125
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,519
Don't worry. I won't let them find you.

126
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm fine, Chang Ge.

127
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,199
I'm not scared anymore.

128
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,480
I figured it out.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
Since I'm still alive,

130
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,839
it's only a matter of time before they find me.

131
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,319
There's no point in evading this.

132
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,480
Since I'm still alive,

133
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,199
I should live happily.

134
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,519
Since she's here, I don't need to hide...

135
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,039
like a ghost and live an ignoble existence.

136
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,090
The Eagle Army sent a message.

137
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,519
Mu Jin has already successfully entered the capital.

138
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,159
By now, I'm sure he's already...

139
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
in the old Dingxiang Palace.

140
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,090
Really?

141
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,679
This isn't right.

142
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,330
They already know that Mu Jin lied to them.

143
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,919
What if they find out...

144
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,360
that Mu Jin sneaked into Dingxiang, will they...

145
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,159
Mu Jin once saved a soldier in the capital.

146
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,279
They're friends.

147
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,159
I think he'll go to him this time.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,330
Heavenly Wolf God, please protect him.

149
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,919
I hope Mu Jin can turn disaster into a blessing.

150
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,679
But it doesn't look good at all now.

151
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,120
Yicheng definitely came prepared.

152
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,279
I think Le Yan is also doing badly.

153
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,210
Is Your Highness very disappointed...

154
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,279
that it wasn't Wei Shu Yu who came?

155
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,039
I forbid you to go to him.

156
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Your Highness.

157
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,600
If you really like him,

158
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll kidnap him for you.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,360
Just elope.

160
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll take full responsibility.

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,039
How will you take responsibility?

162
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,840
With your position and status,

163
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,799
if I leave,

164
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,159
and Father becomes furious,

165
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,330
how are you going to take responsibility?

166
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,279
I'm an upright man.

167
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,399
I'm concerned about the heavens and earth.

168
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,480
And I'm concerned...

169
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,000
And I'm concerned with my friends and family.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,279
Your Highness regards me highly.

171
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,330
If you think of me as a friend,

172
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,840
I'll prepare the money and horses for you.

173
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,120
Just leave.

174
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
I'm not leaving.

175
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm Princess Yong'an.

176
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,639
Since I buried Xiao Wu,

177
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,330
I've made up my mind...

178
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,450
to be a good Tang princess.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,399
That's why I can't leave.

180
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,000
I must face all of this.

181
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,799
Then you're going to intermarry?

182
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,799
No.

183
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,639
I'm not going to.

184
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,960
But I don't want to rely on anyone.

185
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,120
I want to fight for it myself.

186
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Hao Du.

187
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,399
Will you support me?

188
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,000
Khatun.

189
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,360
Don't you want to run far away?

190
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
Why did you come here yourself?

191
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,480
Why did you come to Chang'an?

192
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,519
Are you questioning me?

193
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,120
So what if I am?

194
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,799
Since when are you in charge...

195
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
of Ashina Tribe's internal affairs?

196
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
What's the matter?

197
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,080
As Ashina Tribe's Khatun,

198
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,799
am I just a figurehead?

199
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,480
To you,

200
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,879
aside from your father,

201
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,919
who else do you look up to?

202
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,159
I'm the one asking you.

203
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,919
Regardless,

204
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,440
I'm your elder.

205
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,159
It's fine if you're looking down on me.

206
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,159
But you must respect your father.

207
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,879
My father was the one who sent you?

208
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,559
Who else can it be?

209
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,679
How is he?

210
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,080
As long as you're willing to return with the Eagle Army...

211
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
and work for the grasslands again,

212
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,639
your father will let you return to the capital...

213
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,240
and let bygones be bygones.

214
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm afraid this is just your idea.

215
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,240
Is there a difference?

216
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,080
I came to Chang'an this time.

217
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,320
It's enough to prove...

218
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,519
that I can represent your father.

219
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,759
What a shame.

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,840
You're nothing to me.

221
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,960
What about Li Chang Ge?

222
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,519
I can't believe that the well-known commander...

223
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,039
of Ashina Tribe's Eagle Army back then...

224
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,720
is willing to become...

225
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,320
Li Chang Ge's guard.

226
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,720
Ashina Sun, sometimes,

227
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I really can't figure you out.

228
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
What's so good about Li Chang Ge?

229
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,320
How did she become...

230
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,279
the weakness of the grasslands' God of War?

231
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,799
If you want to be invincible on the battlefield,

232
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,720
the enemy's swords...

233
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,600
and your comrades' arrows aren't scary.

234
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,559
What's scary is that you have a weakness.

235
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,000
Your weakness...

236
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,279
is just right there.

237
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,320
If you dare to touch her,

238
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,759
I'll make sure you die a horrible death.

239
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,159
Greetings, Your Highness.

240
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,519
What's the matter?

241
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,919
I can't believe Mimi Guli is still alive.

242
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,440
She's part of the Great Desert's entourage.

243
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,279
Your Highness, aren't you surprised?

244
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,639
Ever since I saw Ashina Sun,

245
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,039
I knew that Mimi Guli must still be alive.

246
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,559
Then should we...

247
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,440
Send a message to Dingxiang.

248
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,600
Tell Lei Meng...

249
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,879
that those who should have died didn't die at all.

250
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,039
Yes, Your Highness.

251
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
What did you find out?

252
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
I checked...

253
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,279
what you told me to look into.

254
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,720
Those medicines are poisonous.

255
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,919
The poison isn't fatal.

256
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
But it will slowly...

257
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,519
invade your body's organs.

258
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,720
As time passes by,

259
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
you'll die of organ failure.

260
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
That woman is ruthless.

261
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,879
You saved my life before.

262
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,600
We're even now.

263
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,679
I'll keep it a secret that you're in Dingxiang.

264
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,039
- But hopefully... - I know.

265
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,200
Thank you.

266
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,120
I won't bother you about this anymore.

267
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,919
Uncle Lei's patrols are very strict daily.

268
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,320
Don't let him find you.

269
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,440
Wait.

270
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,480
One more thing.

271
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,840
Have you heard...

272
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,039
of a prisoner of war named Bu Zhen?

273
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
It's a kid.

274
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,519
A kid?

275
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,759
There are no kids in the prison.

276
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,679
In the Dingxiang Palace,

277
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,960
perhaps only the King of Sui's Palace has kids.

278
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,480
King of Sui's Palace?

279
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,600
I don't know about the rest.

280
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,639
Take care.

281
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,679
Why did my mother ask you to come?

282
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm asking you.

283
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,440
Why did my mother ask you to come?

284
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,559
Move.

285
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,919
Does she want you...

286
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,120
to go back with the Eagle Army?

287
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,639
Go back?

288
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,960
In Northern Desert, that arrow your mother released...

289
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
almost killed me.

290
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,360
Tell me.

291
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,399
How is my father?

292
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,480
My mother is taking good care of him.

293
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,720
Don't worry about it.

294
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,279
Why are you looking at me that way?

295
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,600
Do you really want to live like a fool?

296
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,000
Say that again.

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,240
Haven't you thought about it?

298
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,240
My father was very healthy.

299
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
Why did he suddenly fall ill?

300
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,559
And he even wanted to relocate the capital to Dingxiang.

301
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,559
My father is sick.

302
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,720
The power has been transferred to Dingxiang.

303
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,600
Do you think...

304
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,079
all of these happened naturally?

305
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,279
Don't try to blame me and my mother.

306
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,119
Don't include yourself.

307
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,410
You won't...

308
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,039
be able to do it without leaving any trace.

309
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,039
I've already confirmed it.

310
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,680
Yicheng is the one who holds the real power in Ashina Tribe now.

311
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,079
I see.

312
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,440
It turns out that she has been trying to trick me before.

313
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,410
She's onto you now.

314
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,319
It's only a matter of time before she finds out your identity.

315
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,200
We'll deal with them when they come.

316
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,680
There's nothing to be afraid of.

317
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
I wish I didn't take you to the grasslands back then.

318
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,440
If you didn't take me to the grasslands back then,

319
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,890
how would you be willing to protect me this way now?

320
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,440
You're a high and mighty army commander.

321
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,480
How can you like a traitor of Tang like me?

322
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,039
You came.

323
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,890
What's the matter?

324
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,680
Are you unwilling to accept that I found you?

325
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,480
Do you think that by reporting your fake death,

326
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,410
you'll be able to get away?

327
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,319
You should know...

328
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,440
that death isn't the end.

329
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,410
If someone living a miserable life...

330
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,519
wants to die,

331
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,170
then the other one who is alive...

332
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,000
must live miserably.

333
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
How can I bear to do that?

334
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,720
What did you do to Bu Zhen?

335
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,759
Why?

336
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,599
How dare you?

337
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,599
He's just a kid!

338
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
He's just a kid!

339
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,079
Why are you doing this to him?

340
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,240
Why?

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,650
Because you betrayed me.

342
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,920
If you do well, I wouldn't have mistreated him.

343
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,000
But you betrayed me.

344
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,559
I just took one finger from him.

345
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,890
Don't you think...

346
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,559
that I'm already very kind?

347
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
Bu Zhen.

348
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,599
Mimi.

349
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,839
Mimi.

350
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,890
Mimi.

351
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,890
- Mimi. - What's the matter?

352
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,319
Ashina Sun, Mimi is gone.

353
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,920
She's afraid of Yicheng.

354
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,079
I'm worried that...

355
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,519
Don't panic first.

356
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,410
Let's split up. I'm sure we can find her.

357
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,839
All right.

358
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Mimi.

359
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Father!

360
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,890
Father.

361
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,519
Are you going to see His Majesty...

362
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,279
to discuss the intermarriage?

363
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,079
I beseech you, Father,

364
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,650
please persuade His Majesty to let Her Highness...

365
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,559
Shu Yu, let me ask you.

366
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,170
You and Her Highness grew up together.

367
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,799
Do you have other thoughts about her?

368
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,799
Father, I...

369
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,799
Whether Princess Yong'an will marry somewhere faraway...

370
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,359
is an important matter in the imperial court.

371
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,000
You don't have any right...

372
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,240
to negotiate with His Majesty, understand?

373
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:11,279
If you're serious...

374
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,559
about your affection for Her Highness,

375
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,559
fight for it yourself.

376
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,440
There's only one identity who can do that.

377
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,519
Prince Consort.

378
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,480
You're all grown up now.

379
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,519
You know what you want.

380
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,920
If you've thought about it carefully,

381
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,170
fight for it yourself.

382
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Bu Zhen.

383
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,240
It's all my fault.

384
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,279
I couldn't protect you.

385
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,680
You must live well.

386
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,000
Wait for me to reunite with you,

387
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,319
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,599
If you want to see your brother,

389
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,000
obey orders.

390
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
Her Highness...

391
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
wants you to do something.

392
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,599
If you don't do it,

393
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,640
the consequence won't be just one finger.

394
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,839
Mimi.

395
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,480
It's really you, Mimi.

396
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
Ashina Sun faked his death.

397
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,519
I knew you must be alive as well.

398
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,960
I'll get going.

399
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,440
Do you hate me that much?

400
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,279
Young Khan, you have a prestigious status.

401
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,160
Why should you harass a slave like me?

402
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
I've never treated you as a slave.

403
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,759
Mimi.

404
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,279
Can you go back with me?

405
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,880
I promise I'll be good to you.

406
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,839
Mimi.

407
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,880
Listen to me.

408
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,400
Marrying Tang's princess is just...

409
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,319
I promise.

410
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,039
I would never be true to her.

411
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,319
Why are you telling a slave...

412
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,599
who you will be true to?

413
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,880
Of course I must tell you.

414
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,079
And I have to tell you that I...

415
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,279
I like you.

416
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,440
When we were little, you used to ride the horse next to me.

417
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,000
I thought, "Your hair looks amazing."

418
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,039
When it flies in the wind, it's like Central Plains' silk.

419
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
In this world,

420
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,920
you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

421
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,039
And you're the best.

422
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,559
When I played with you then,

423
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,920
- did you feel happy? - Yes.

424
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,880
When you played with me, I'd feel happy.

425
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,799
That's because I was afraid to make you unhappy.

426
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,400
Because if you're unhappy,

427
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,000
I don't know what kind of punishment will be given to me and Bu Zhen.

428
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,920
Actually, every time I saw you,

429
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,519
I felt scared.

430
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,319
I would even resent you.

431
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,640
Why did you save us?

432
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,759
I'd rather die.

433
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,279
I'm a living human being.

434
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,319
I'm not an emotionless plaything.

435
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't want to feel scared and try to please someone daily.

436
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,720
And I don't want to be beaten, starved, and scolded...

437
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,559
for some minor mistakes daily.

438
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,880
Do you understand how I feel?

439
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,880
You don't understand at all.

440
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,480
So, Young Khan,

441
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,799
I won't go back with you.

442
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Mimi.

443
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,039
Mimi.

444
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,920
Where did you go? I've been looking everywhere for you.

445
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,799
I'm fine.

446
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,680
I just walked around a bit.

447
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,519
Don't be scared. You have us.

448
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,799
Chang Ge, Young Khan marrying the princess is just a strategy.

449
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,640
If the princess really goes to the grasslands,

450
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
she'll surely suffer.

451
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,559
Don't worry.

452
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,799
I definitely won't let her marry into the Ashina Tribe.

453
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,759
All right.

454
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,680
Chang Ge.

455
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,200
Shu Yu, shouldn't you be in Taichi Palace today...

456
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,640
to discuss the intermarriage?

457
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,279
Why did you come to see me?

458
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,799
Shu Yu.

459
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,200
I want to stop the intermarriage.

460
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,599
But I'm not qualified.

461
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,960
You're stopping the intermarriage for Le Yan's happiness.

462
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,079
Why are you talking about qualifications?

463
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,200
What exactly are you worried about?

464
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Father told me...

465
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,640
that if I try to persuade His Majesty as the Prince Consort,

466
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,839
it might work.

467
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,119
That makes sense.

468
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,599
Based on your long friendship with her,

469
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,039
he'll surely consider these things.

470
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,839
And Le Yan will also be very happy.

471
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,799
- You know that she has always... - I know.

472
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,359
She confessed her feelings to me.

473
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,039
Then what are you hesitating about?

474
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,319
That's the most effective way...

475
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,720
to stop the intermarriage right now.

476
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Shu Yu,

477
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,759
- you and I... - I know.

478
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,960
I won't force you.

479
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,160
But I don't want to hurt her either.

480
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,400
I don't want to disappoint her.

481
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,680
I don't want her to marry to the grasslands.

482
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,319
But I know clearly...

483
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,759
that if I propose,

484
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,559
isn't that like pulling her out from one fiery pit...

485
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,279
and pushing her into another one?

486
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
To me,

487
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,559
she's really like my own sister.

488
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I got it.

489
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:22,880
In that case,

490
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,359
Le Yan also doesn't need forced love.

491
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,640
All we can do is see what happens.

492
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,839
Let's see what Ashina Tribe will do.

493
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,880
We'll deal with them when the time comes.

494
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,519
Chang Ge.

495
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,119
Since what happened at the East Palace,

496
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,799
I feel like the gap between you, me,

497
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,039
and Le Yan is becoming bigger.

498
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,480
I can't catch up with you two anymore.

499
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,440
When you say these things,

500
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,000
you're already not the same as before.

501
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,400
Sometimes, it's most difficult...

502
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,319
to face yourself.

503
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
You've already done that.

504
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,000
Actually, you don't need to be so pessimistic.

505
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,599
Because the one who can stop this...

506
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,880
isn't just you and me.

507
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,359
You mean...

508
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,400
- His Majesty? - He may be the emperor,

509
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,960
but he's also a father.

510
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,359
He definitely doesn't want to destroy Le Yan's happiness.

511
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,759
However...

512
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,720
We might still need an opportunity.

513
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,559
What opportunity?

514
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,640
Let's wait and see.

515
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,440
It's hard to say at the moment.

516
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,559
Your Majesty.

517
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,200
Regarding Princess Yong'an's intermarriage,

518
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,319
it definitely can't be changed.

519
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,839
It's already been decided a long time ago.

520
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,319
If Tang breaks the agreement,

521
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,200
I'm afraid Ashina Tribe will accuse us...

522
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,559
of being sly, fickle, and a promise-breaker.

523
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,839
How can we gain the Great Desert's trust then?

524
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,680
You mean...

525
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,119
we're only considering the current situation.

526
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,759
Princess Yong'an is His Majesty's daughter.

527
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,599
She's not just someone from the imperial family.

528
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,039
Given her status,

529
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,359
wouldn't the Ashina Tribe...

530
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,480
make a fuss about this intermarriage?

531
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,440
Your Majesty.

532
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,440
The intermarriage is indeed very troublesome.

533
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,079
But that will only happen later on.

534
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,359
Now, only by not breaking what was agreed upon...

535
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,559
is the fastest way...

536
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,960
to gain the trust of Great Desert's tribes.

537
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,920
Your Majesty, I strongly agree.

538
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,480
If we hesitate...

539
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
in the intermarriage with the Ashina Tribe...

540
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,119
and break what was agreed upon,

541
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,799
I'm afraid...

542
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,200
they won't let this go.

543
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,240
And our alliance with the Great Desert's tribes...

544
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,920
will fall through.

545
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,799
Your Majesty.

546
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,480
I believe intermarriage must be done.

547
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,400
If we must intermarry,

548
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,720
it can't be with the Ashina Tribe.

549
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,079
That's right.

550
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,799
If we agree to this,

551
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,519
Ashina Tribe will surely push their luck.

552
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,799
Your Majesty, at the moment,

553
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,160
Ashina Tribe is obviously using the intermarriage...

554
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,319
to challenge us.

555
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,640
If we don't keep our promise,

556
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,160
how can we convince the Great Desert's tribes?

557
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,839
Your Majesty.

558
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,559
I think that Princess Yong'an's intermarriage...

559
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,359
is a magnanimous act taken for the greater good.

560
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,680
She's intermarrying for the citizens and the nation.

561
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,119
In the future, if Ashina Tribe becomes disloyal,

562
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,000
and they want to make a fuss...

563
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,240
regarding the intermarriage,

564
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,440
we can't let Her Highness...

565
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,079
come back then.

566
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,559
You've studied hundreds of books.

567
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,799
But it seems like you didn't study them well.

568
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,519
You only learned how to be generous at the expense of others.

569
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,319
Your Majesty.

570
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,880
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

571
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,839
I failed to stop Her Highness.

572
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,759
Greetings, Your Majesty.

573
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,519
Why is Her Highness here? It's ridiculous.

574
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,519
Your Majesty.

575
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,160
Just now, in front of all the officials,

576
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,319
Her Highness said that I didn't study well.

577
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,599
But in front of all the officials,

578
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,359
Her Highness is discussing her own marriage.

579
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,319
It can be considered as interfering in political affairs...

580
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,759
and it's rude.

581
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,079
I wonder if that makes sense.

582
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,319
The late emperor gave Princess Yong'an her title.

583
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,200
How can it be rude for her...

584
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,519
to discuss her marriage?

585
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,160
You're Minister Chen from the Ministry of Rites, right?

586
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,720
Since my marriage...

587
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
is a major matter in the imperial court,

588
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,200
as His Majesty's loyal subject,

589
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,400
of course I should speak my mind.

590
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,599
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

591
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,000
Go ahead.

592
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,680
Your Majesty.

593
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,039
Forgive me for overstepping.

594
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,599
I'm your daughter.

595
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,759
But I'm no different...

596
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,240
from the other ladies in Tang.

597
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,359
We were born into this world...

598
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,240
to live for our father, emperor, and for the great cause.

599
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,400
But we can't just live for these things.

600
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Home is the basis of the nation.

601
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,240
Tang is prosperous...

602
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,279
because it can protect its citizens.

603
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,000
If Tang's prosperity is achieved...

604
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,359
through compromise,

605
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,920
may I ask what is a nation...

606
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,720
and what is a home?

607
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,920
What her Highness said is right.

608
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,279
In what way?

609
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,759
This is ridiculous.

610
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,119
Her Highness obviously doesn't want to intermarry.

611
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,119
That's right.

612
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,640
Your Majesty.

613
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,680
Even if Princess Yong'an does not wish to intermarry,

614
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,329
she doesn't need to say such lofty words.

615
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,719
Ashina Tribe's Khatun,

616
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,559
who came to discuss the intermarriage this time,

617
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:13,639
was Princess Yicheng...

618
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,809
from the Sui Dynasty back then.

619
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,639
Princess Yicheng's great act back then...

620
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,599
was very admirable.

621
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,960
Is our princess...

622
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,400
incomparable to the princess of the previous dynasty?

623
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,039
Minister Chen, you're very straightforward.

624
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,519
I admire you.

625
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,480
But what you said...

626
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,039
insulted all the men in Tang.

627
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,519
What does she mean?

628
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:37,559
What did she say?

629
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,559
What is she saying?

630
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,559
It's ridiculous.

631
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,920
Please watch what you say, Your Highness.

632
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,400
Minister Chen, do you know...

633
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,039
how Princess Yicheng...

634
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,199
endured it until today?

635
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,199
She was a princess of the previous dynasty.

636
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,559
In the unfamiliar grasslands,

637
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,199
she lived like a nobody.

638
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,239
She didn't have any dignity at all.

639
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,199
The Sui Dynasty was weak and easily bullied.

640
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,719
They were afraid of the Ashina Tribe.

641
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,199
That was why they let a weak woman...

642
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,519
make such a sacrifice.

643
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,840
Are the thousands of men in Tang...

644
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,769
afraid of strong enemies?

645
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,289
If Tang can't even protect...

646
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:14,639
their own children,

647
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,360
how would Great Deserts' tribes...

648
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,679
trust Tang...

649
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,039
to protect them?

650
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,519
Yes.

651
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,769
That makes sense.

652
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,480
You are right, Your Highness.

653
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Mr. Du.

654
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,960
There's no need for courtesy. Have a seat.

655
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,119
Thank you, Your Majesty.

656
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,840
Your Majesty.

657
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,329
I believe what Her Highness said...

658
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,440
is just an excuse to refuse the intermarriage.

659
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,000
Mr. Du,

660
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:08,199
what do you think?

661
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,880
As a woman,

662
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,400
Her Highness wouldn't bow down...

663
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,000
to the strong people in the grasslands.

664
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,519
I deeply admire what Her Highness said.

665
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,559
All right.

666
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,809
Just one word from the Ashina Tribe,

667
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,000
and Tang is presenting...

668
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,289
its princess.

669
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,719
How is it different from surrendering to them?

670
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,599
Your Majesty is brilliant.

671
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,159
We'll opt for the lesser of two evils.

672
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,239
I think that if the Ashina Tribe...

673
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,960
just uses verbal threats,

674
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,239
and they're able to take our princess,

675
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,559
it's a great evil.

676
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,239
If Ashina Tribe...

677
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,559
slanders us for breaking our promise,

678
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,289
we can still do something about it.

679
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:57,559
It's the lesser evil.

680
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,679
Tang Dynasty...

681
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,960
will never sacrifice a woman...

682
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,289
to get a brief moment of peace.

683
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,159
It's not because...

684
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,119
Yong'an is my daughter.

685
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,199
All the women in this nation...

686
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,159
are my people.

687
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,559
I will...

688
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:21,079
never sacrifice a single person.

689
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:25,239
Yong'an, in three days,

690
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,289
come with me to Quadrangular Courtyard.

691
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,880
If Ashina Tribe...

692
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,519
dares to bring up this matter again,

693
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,119
you can tell them yourself...

694
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,809
that the former agreement is canceled.

695
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:03,519
Welcome, His Majesty!

696
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,599
(Aspire for virtue and eliminate doubts)

697
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:43,840
(Aspire for virtue and eliminate doubts)

698
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,769
Due to the alliance,

699
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:11,769
you've come all the way here.

700
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,960
I would like to thank you first.

701
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,809
Emperor of Tang.

702
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Yan Li Khan has fallen ill.

703
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,079
That is why he told me to ask you...

704
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:39,519
if my son...

705
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:42,039
and Tang's princess's marriage can be confirmed...

706
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,329
before we chat about other matters.

707
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Well...

708
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,079
Khatun is not giving any consideration...

709
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,679
to Emperor of Tang.

710
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,679
Even if Great Khan is ill,

711
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:03,840
he's still worried about this marriage.

712
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,079
Today,

713
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:07,880
I'll give him an answer then.

714
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,239
Tell Khatun on my behalf.

715
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,920
I, thank the favor...

716
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,159
that you, Great Khan, and Ashina Tribe are showing me, Khatun.

717
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,960
I have weak health.

718
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:38,400
I don't deserve this marriage.

719
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,519
Please excuse me for not being able to comply.

720
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,119
What's going on?

721
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,599
You're turning down...

722
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:52,360
the marriage proposal?

723
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,639
Khatun, you're very talented.

724
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,599
What I can do...

725
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,920
might not even be half of what you're capable of.

726
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,039
So I can only disappoint you.

727
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,840
Emperor of Tang, do you think...

728
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,719
that since you have Great Desert's tribes now,

729
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,880
you can give up...

730
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,719
on your former agreement with our tribe?

731
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,199
What if something changes again in the future?

732
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,199
Will Tang...

733
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:21,079
also treat you the same way?

734
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,159
- Yes. - She's right.

735
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,400
How can they do this to us?

736
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,559
They're doing this to us.

737
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,769
They must keep their word.

738
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,519
Tang was the one who agreed to the marriage...

739
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,079
as proof of amity with the Ashina Tribe.

740
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,639
Now, Emperor of Tang is going back on his word.

741
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,039
If something happens, later on,

742
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,809
you can't blame us anymore.

743
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:54,360
Why is everyone hesitating?

744
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,559
We all traveled a long way to Chang'an...

745
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,809
to discuss the alliance.

746
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:00,119
That means we're willing to renew our friendship with Tang.

747
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,559
That also means...

748
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,039
that every single one of you...

749
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:06,960
has a chance to become Prince Consort.

750
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:08,960
- Become Prince Consort? - What does that mean?

751
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:10,960
I stand a chance too.

752
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:12,920
What do you mean?

753
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,329
Young Khan, you just said...

754
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:16,000
that intermarriage is proof of amity.

755
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:17,639
Everyone here...

756
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,329
wants to be friends with Tang.

757
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,119
In that case, may the best man win.

758
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:23,920
Let's ask Emperor of Tang...

759
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,329
to hold a martial arts competition for the Prince Consort.

760
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:26,639
This way,

761
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,960
it would be fair for all of us.

762
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:32,719
Great.

763
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,840
Only the winner...

764
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,559
deserves to be Princess Yong'an's husband.

765
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:39,000
Young Khan, do you dare to participate?

766
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,840
What's the matter, Young Khan?

767
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,960
Are you scared?

768
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,039
What are you talking about?

769
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,199
Why would I be afraid?

770
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:51,599
All right.

771
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,559
You're indeed a young hero, Young Khan.

772
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,289
In that case,

773
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:59,329
let's set it up here tomorrow.

774
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:02,559
It doesn't matter where you come from.

775
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,079
You may all compete.

776
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:07,400
The undefeatable winner...

777
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,840
deserves to be Yong'an's husband.

778
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,320
(The Long Ballad)
