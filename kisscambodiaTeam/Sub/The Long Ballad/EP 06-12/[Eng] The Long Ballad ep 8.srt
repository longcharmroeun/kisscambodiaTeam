00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,760
(The Long Ballad)

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,400
(This is a work of fiction.)

4
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,159
(Episode 8)

5
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,640
A decree's authenticity...

6
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,560
can be verified right away.

7
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,599
Chang'an uses top-quality ink cake.

8
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,959
The low-quality ink cake you used...

9
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,239
bled once met with water.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,719
Also, the silk you used...

11
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,079
is of inferior quality.

12
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,799
Don't talk.

13
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,959
What's going on?

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Don't worry.

15
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,959
As long as you don't show up,

16
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,719
your master won't be in danger.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,480
All this proves...

18
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,039
This proves the item is in Youzhou.

19
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,719
It's in your hands.

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Arrest her.

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

22
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,319
Take her away.

23
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,400
Search the place.

24
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,639
Yesterday, my master even told me...

25
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,639
Li Yuan is the only person she can trust now.

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,759
I can't believe he's actually a scoundrel.

27
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,879
No, I must save my master.

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,599
If you go out now,

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,370
it will only make your master die faster.

30
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,090
Your master's life depends on the thing you have on you.

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,960
Make sure you hide it well.

32
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,879
I'm sure your master can definitely escape.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't you believe so?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I do.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
- My master has nine lives.
- Good.

36
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,919
Then do as I say.

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,360
Go to the city gate right now and wait for your master there.

38
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,919
What about you?

39
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,960
Will you save my master?

40
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,479
Just worry about yourself.

41
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,599
Go.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Mr. Peddler.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
I believe you.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
There's nothing.

45
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,199
There's nothing.

46
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,680
Let me ask you.

47
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,039
Where is it?

48
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,159
Don't assume I won't dare to strangle you to death...

49
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,360
just because you're Princess Yongning.

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,800
So she's Li Jian Cheng's daughter, Princess Yongning.

51
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,800
No wonder she could steal the Crown Prince's seal.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,879
Shi Si Lang wants to take revenge on Li Shi Min.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,840
Jun Kuo.

54
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,719
If you kill her,

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,520
who will know where the item is?

56
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,680
Take her back for now.

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,560
(Peace and harmony)

58
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,240
Keep watch on this place.

59
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,800
If anyone comes, seize them all.

60
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,170
Yes.

61
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,279
(Governor's Manor)

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,279
Is Your Highness still unwilling to reveal where it is?

63
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,279
Your Highness's face is considered a pretty one.

64
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,279
But it may no longer be intact later.

65
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,839
I advise Your Highness to just obey and tell us.

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,279
I don't want you to suffer in vain.

67
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,279
I've already witnessed how great your acting skills are.

68
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,279
If I tell you now,

69
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,439
I'll just die even faster.

70
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,439
Your Highness is indeed a true princess.

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,360
You'd rather die...

72
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,959
than hand over that object.

73
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,120
But since you don't care about your own life,

74
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,170
I wonder if you care about other people's lives then?

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm afraid that envoy, Mr. Wei,

76
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,639
won't live past today.

77
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,399
Kill him if you want.

78
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,399
He has nothing to do with me.

79
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,879
"Nothing"?

80
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,920
I saw how Your Highness...

81
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,839
protected Mr. Wei with my own eyes.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
How about this?

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,680
I'll send someone to bring him here.

84
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,160
You and your old friend can have a nice reunion.

85
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
Maybe you'll recall something then.

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,160
It looks like Your Highness is really determined...

88
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,079
to cut ties with your old friend from Chang'an.

89
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,079
All right.

90
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,439
I'll kill him now then.

91
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,519
If you kill him,

92
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,439
you'll never get the thing you want.

93
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,720
I knew it.

94
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,279
It seems Your Highness is still reluctant to see him die.

95
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,639
Then I'll give you more time.

96
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,800
Look at him and recall your memories.

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,519
If you still don't recall anything,

98
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,639
both he and you...

99
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,279
will have to die.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Wei Shu Yu.

101
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,199
Wei Shu Yu.

102
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,399
If I work with Wang Jun Kuo,

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Youzhou will fall in the Ashina Tribe's hands.

104
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,759
But maybe I can use the forces of these rebels...

105
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,800
to attack Chang'an.

106
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,600
What are you thinking, Li Chang Ge?

107
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,160
It's the Ashina Tribe you're talking about.

108
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,160
If you help Wang Jun Kuo because of this,

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
you'll be the greatest sinner of the Tang Dynasty.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Come in.

111
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Your Highness.

112
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,439
Are we departing today?

113
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,439
Yes.

114
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,839
Wei Shu Yu's work is almost done.

115
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,600
We are meeting up with him today.

116
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,120
I'll take you to the east gate of the city later...

117
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,240
to meet Wei Shu Yu.

118
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Are you not leaving?

119
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm not leaving.

120
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,879
Hao Du.

121
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,240
If you run into Chang Ge,

122
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,120
can you spare her life?

123
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,160
Hao Du.

124
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
It's getting late.

125
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,600
Please hurry and pack your things, Your Highness.

126
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,210
Why are you locked up here too?

127
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I know.

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,480
You're still mad at me.

129
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,519
Why are you in Youzhou?

130
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,919
Was sending me off a cliff not enough?

131
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,039
You won't give it a rest until you personally see me die.

132
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,039
Chang Ge.

133
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,399
I...

134
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Stop talking.

135
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,679
Get some rest.

136
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,960
Whether you believe me or not,

137
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,000
I never betrayed you.

138
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,240
Hao Du set me up that day...

139
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,840
to mess with your emotions.

140
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,759
So what even if that's true?

141
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,450
You still chose to succumb to him.

142
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,799
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
I don't want you...

144
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,639
to be locked up in prison because of me.

145
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,159
You're thinking too much.

146
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,159
I'm here because I tried to get blood from a stone...

147
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,450
but hurt myself instead.

148
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,279
What?

149
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,210
Wang Jun Kuo...

150
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,879
Wang Jun Kuo wants to hand Youzhou over...

151
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,960
to Yan Li Khan.

152
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,450
That jerk is too ambitious.

153
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,360
He's a traitor.

154
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,480
Is Prince of Lujiang not going to do anything about this?

155
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,450
Prince of Lujiang is the mastermind.

156
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,000
What?

157
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,519
What are you going to do?

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,090
What should I do?

159
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,039
Isn't this the ending...

160
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,360
you and your new master want to see?

161
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,450
Chang Ge.

162
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,799
His Highness has always doted on you.

163
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,000
- He never thought of...
- Stop it.

164
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,519
Even if I shatter to pieces,

165
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,159
I won't succumb to Li Shi Min as you did.

166
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
Did you come to Youzhou alone?

167
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,039
No.

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,279
Hao Du and I are to meet at the city's east gate...

169
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,960
at 3:45pm today.

170
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,159
But trust me.

171
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,799
I won't tell him I saw you.

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,960
Do you think you'll still get out alive to see Hao Du?

173
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,799
If you want to make it out alive,

174
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
you'll need his help.

175
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Guards! I want to see Li Yuan!

176
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,399
- Guards!
- Chang Ge, what are you doing?

177
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,679
It's none of your business.

178
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,799
Guards!

179
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,960
You're not going to hand over the Crown Prince's seal, are you?

180
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
What else should I do?

181
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,559
Give it to you?

182
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,480
What's the problem with your chefs here?

183
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,000
There's not a single dish that's edible.

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I advise you not to overdo it.

185
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,519
There's a limit to the governor's patience.

186
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm a princess.

187
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,799
Show some respect.

188
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,919
Thanks to you,

189
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,879
I can't even eat anything now.

190
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
I don't have an appetite.

191
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,000
You want to die, don't you?

192
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,559
Uncle Li Yuan.

193
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,080
Is this how you teach your men?

194
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Yongning.

195
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,200
There's no use stalling us like this.

196
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,759
You're right.

197
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,559
My subordinate and I agreed to meet at a set time.

198
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,960
Even if I go early,

199
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,360
I won't see him.

200
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,360
If I don't get there safe and sound,

201
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,200
he'll carry out the orders I gave him in advance.

202
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,799
When that happens,

203
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,480
no one can get their hands on the Crown Prince's seal.

204
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,000
I have to hand it to you, Yongning.

205
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,759
I underestimated you.

206
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,279
But we're a family.

207
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,840
There's no need for us to fight.

208
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,720
I'm glad you think that way, Uncle Li Yuan.

209
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
It's getting late.

210
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,679
- We can go now.
- All right.

211
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,799
I look forward to hearing good news from you.

212
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Uncle Li Yuan.

213
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,039
Wei Shu Yu is one of my people.

214
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
Even if he dies, he has to die by my hand.

215
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
If anything happens to him,

216
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,000
I won't hold back.

217
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,879
Please.

218
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,279
Princess Yongning managed to safely escape from Chang'an.

219
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,360
Someone like that wouldn't fall into the hands of Wang Jun Kuo.

220
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,519
What benefits did the Ashina Tribe give you?

221
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,440
Instead of earning merit of punishing the rebels,

222
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
you'd rather serve as Yan Li's slave.

223
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Your Highness.

224
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,960
Do you really think...

225
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,480
people will risk their lives for you...

226
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,720
based on a few baseless words?

227
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,759
Besides, what you said about punishing the rebels...

228
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,480
is all utter nonsense.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,960
Only that Crown Prince's seal you have is valuable.

230
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,200
Perhaps you could earn a good amount out of it.

231
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,720
If news gets out...

232
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,960
that you've defected to the Ashina Tribe,

233
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,080
aren't you afraid the morale in the Youzhou's army will falter?

234
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,960
Then, the surrounding provinces will attack together.

235
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,559
You'll all be doomed.

236
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,720
Your Highness doesn't have to worry about that.

237
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,559
You should worry about yourself.

238
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Hao Du.

239
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,159
Don't disappoint me.

240
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,960
Why is Shu Yu...

241
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,480
Chang...

242
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,759
Don't shout.

243
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,440
If you call her, she's dead.

244
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,919
Look at that guy.

245
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,919
Li Chang Ge is being watched.

246
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,720
Who are they?

247
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,879
I don't know.

248
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,960
But since Li Chang Ge is here,

249
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,360
something bad must have happened to Wei Shu Yu.

250
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,279
Shu Yu.

251
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,919
If you don't want anything to happen to Wei Shu Yu,

252
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,960
stay here.

253
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Stay still.

254
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
It's an ambush.

255
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,519
Move.

256
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,319
Move.

257
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,890
Your Highness, do you still want to run?

258
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,200
Who are you?

259
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,170
I advise you to hand the item over.

260
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,079
Or else, I'll behead your master.

261
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,359
Go ahead.

262
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
But...

263
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
you have to give me her head.

264
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
I need to take it back to report the completion of my task.

265
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,519
You're not one of her people.

266
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,240
Who exactly are you?

267
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,000
Who are you to ask me all these questions?

268
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,240
Wei Shu Yu is in trouble.

269
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I figured.

270
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,839
Hao Du.

271
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,480
Chang Ge?

272
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,599
Chang Ge.

273
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,799
Let her go.

274
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,119
You first.

275
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,799
A life for a life.

276
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
That's fair.

277
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,119
Le Yan.

278
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Why are you here?

279
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,650
Chang Ge, I...

280
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,240
What are you waiting for?

281
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,480
The one in my hands is a Tang princess.

282
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,519
Then do you know who I have in my hands?

283
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,440
I don't care who she is.

284
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,319
Let her go.

285
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,799
I'll count to three.

286
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,359
If you don't let her go,

287
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,519
this woman is dead.

288
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,519
Qin Zhun.

289
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,799
Don't do anything reckless.

290
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,650
Hao Du.

291
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,519
Don't hurt Chang Ge.

292
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Let her go.

293
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,039
Hao Du.

294
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
One.

295
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,319
If we don't leave now, Wang Jun Kuo will bring his men.

296
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,319
None of us will be able to leave then.

297
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Two.

298
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,480
Who are you?

299
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,759
Three.

300
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,680
- Chang Ge.
- Let's go.

301
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,759
Chang Ge, hurry and go.

302
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,170
- Chang Ge!
- Your Highness.

303
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,359
Your Highness.

304
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,410
- Chang Ge, hurry and leave!
- I'm sorry, Your Highness.

305
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:06,880
Didn't you already leave long ago?

306
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
I...

307
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,720
I came back to take care of something.

308
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,000
Take care of something?

309
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,559
Do you want your horse back from Wang Jun Kuo...

310
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,480
or are you helping Wang Jun Kuo collude with the Ashina Tribe...

311
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,680
as their middleman?

312
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Qin Zhun.

313
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,240
Don't force me to become your enemy.

314
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,599
I was just trying to save you.

315
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Thank you for saving me.

316
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,200
I won't ask about the past anymore.

317
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,039
But from now on,

318
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,039
stay out of my business and leave Youzhou.

319
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,039
I think I should be the one to say that.

320
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,640
Those people won't let you off.

321
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,359
If you go back now, you're going to die.

322
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Come with me.

323
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,039
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

324
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,559
I definitely won't let Youzhou fall into the Ashina Tribe's hands.

325
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,440
If you keep following me,

326
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:02,759
I'll report you.

327
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,319
The imperial court is trying to kill you.

328
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,759
Why are you still working for them?

329
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,759
I just hate the people who destroyed my family.

330
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,759
But I'm still a citizen of Tang.

331
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Didn't you always want it?

332
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Take it for self-defense.

333
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,160
Let go. You're hurting me.

334
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,279
Hao Du, let go of me.

335
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,480
Let go.

336
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,400
Didn't you hear Chang Ge say...

337
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,319
that Shu Yu is in trouble just now?

338
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,519
I only care about where Li Chang Ge is.

339
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
But...

340
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,799
- Shu Yu...
- I'll say it again.

341
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,200
I only care about Li Chang Ge.

342
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm here.

343
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Chang Ge.

344
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Chang Ge.

345
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,599
Chang Ge, why did you come back?

346
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,519
If you move again, I'll kill her right now.

347
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,839
Li Chang Ge.

348
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,319
Are you not running anymore?

349
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,559
If you don't listen to me,

350
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,240
none of us are going anywhere.

351
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,119
Listen to you?

352
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,440
Do you still think you're a princess?

353
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,759
Li Yuan and Wang Jun Kuo...

354
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,400
colluded with the Ashina Tribe's Young Khan.

355
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,359
They're planning to give Youzhou to the Ashina Tribe.

356
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,039
A vicious army is currently coming to Youzhou.

357
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,519
Do you think we can still run?

358
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,079
Don't doubt it.

359
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,440
Wei Shu Yu...

360
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,119
is locked up in the dungeon of the governor's manor now.

361
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,880
If it weren't for the sake of Youzhou,

362
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,720
I wouldn't be standing in front of you right now.

363
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Hao Du.

364
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,960
Let's go and save Shu Yu...

365
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
Why should I trust you?

366
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,160
Based on the fact that I'm the one standing here now,

367
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
not Wei Shu Yu.

368
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,920
Wei Shu Yu has the entire Wei family behind him.

369
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,319
Do you think he would risk his whole family's life...

370
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
to put on an act with me?

371
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
There's no need to look around.

372
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
I'm alone.

373
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,319
Why are you unscathed?

374
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,160
Because the Crown Prince's seal is in my hands.

375
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,599
Hand it over.

376
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,880
Youzhou is about to fall into the enemy's hands,

377
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,400
yet you're still concerned about that?

378
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,920
Youzhou has nothing to do with me.

379
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,759
My priority...

380
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,200
is to bring you and the Crown Prince's seal back.

381
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,599
Nothing to do with you?

382
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,759
How could a general of the court say that the fall of Youzhou...

383
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:38,920
has nothing to do with him?

384
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,880
If Du Ru Hui were to hear...

385
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,000
how you have no regard for the bigger picture,

386
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,039
he'd kill you.

387
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,359
Don't talk about my godfather.

388
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,920
Why is a thief who stole the Crown Prince's seal...

389
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,200
talking to me about the bigger picture?

390
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,559
Li Chang Ge.

391
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,119
Even if what you said is true,

392
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,920
I won't let you run away again.

393
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,200
You're ignoring urgent priorities.

394
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,440
You only care about your personal gain.

395
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,079
How will you accomplish great things with such a mindset?

396
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,839
Regardless of what I accomplish, I don't need you to teach me.

397
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,400
Bringing back the Crown Prince's seal is the most important thing.

398
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,839
If Wang Jun Kuo gets his way,

399
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,480
it'll be too late even if we ask the court to send an army in.

400
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Li Chang Ge.

401
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,279
I don't care whether this is all true or not.

402
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,480
My priority right now...

403
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,319
is to safely get the princess out of Youzhou.

404
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,720
If you still think of the princess as your friend,

405
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
then cooperate.

406
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Useless!

407
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
There are so many of you,

408
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,160
yet you lost her.

409
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:40,839
I'm sorry.

410
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,039
I've ordered people to search the city for Li Chang Ge.

411
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,880
I've also given orders to close off the city gates.

412
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,559
I don't care what method you use.

413
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,559
I must get it by tomorrow.

414
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,759
Otherwise, when we face Young Khan,

415
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,279
you and I will be in big trouble.

416
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Governor.

417
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,079
I have something else to report.

418
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,359
I've discovered that there's another group...

419
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,319
tracking down Li Chang Ge as well.

420
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,799
That man is skilled in martial arts. He's even better than me.

421
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,039
He's definitely not a martial artist.

422
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,880
Could he be from the imperial court?

423
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,799
Then our plans...

424
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,519
Governor, you don't have to worry.

425
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,720
That person doesn't care...

426
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,200
whether Li Chang Ge is dead or alive at all.

427
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,039
He just wants to capture her.

428
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,440
So I suspect that person...

429
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,400
may also be after the Crown Prince's seal.

430
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,200
At this point,

431
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,680
there's no turning back.

432
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,799
I want both Li Chang Ge and the people...

433
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,359
- from the imperial court.
- I got it.

434
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,640
As long as she's alive,

435
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,039
she won't be able to leave Youzhou City.

436
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,680
Has Young Khan made any moves?

437
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,920
Yan Li Khan's army is heading south soon.

438
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,039
All we have to do is prevent any news of Youzhou City...

439
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,400
or other places from getting out.

440
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,599
Once Young Khan's big army arrives,

441
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,920
we won't have to worry about anything.

442
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,160
Both our glory...

443
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,480
depends on this.

444
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,680
Yes, Governor.

445
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,200
Hurry! Close the gate!

446
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,319
No one may enter or leave.

447
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,319
Close the gate? Why the rush?

448
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,200
This is General Wang's order. Hurry and follow through.

449
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,200
If the criminal escapes, it's on you.

450
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Yes.

451
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,920
(Youzhou)

452
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,279
Chang Ge.

453
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,519
I've always liked to lean on your shoulder...

454
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,839
ever since we were young.

455
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,720
I feel reassured whenever you're around.

456
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,519
I don't care if you're anxious.

457
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,640
I don't know...

458
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,839
how long it'll be until the next time...

459
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,720
I can lean on your shoulder.

460
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,920
Untie me.

461
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,119
My hands hurt.

462
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Li Chang Ge.

463
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,880
You're underestimating me.

464
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,759
(Rest stop)

465
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,359
Is capturing Chang Ge really that important?

466
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,960
Is it more important than our lives,

467
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,200
the entire Youzhou City,

468
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,880
and the lives of the civilians?

469
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,960
Youzhou has been sealed off.

470
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,960
I can't save the people of Youzhou.

471
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,359
I can't save Wei Shu Yu either.

472
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,359
So you're just going to watch Shu Yu die?

473
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,160
We'll send a smoke signal outside the city...

474
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,319
and inform the court.

475
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,960
This is the only way.

476
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,920
You mean...

477
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,400
Shu Yu can be saved?

478
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,079
We can only leave it up to fate.

479
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
It's you?

480
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Hurry in.

481
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
Why are you here?

482
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,759
The peddler told me to wait for you at the city gate.

483
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,960
I stayed there the whole time.

484
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,119
I didn't even blink.

485
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Then,

486
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,759
I saw soldiers sealing the gates.

487
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,039
Only one carriage left the city at the last minute.

488
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,200
I guessed that would probably be the last chance...

489
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,400
for you to escape.

490
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,559
So I followed the carriage.

491
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,680
That peddler was indeed right.

492
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,559
What did he say?

493
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,519
He said he believes that you'll definitely escape.

494
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,839
- Where is it?
- It's here.

495
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,359
It's here with me.

496
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,799
By the way, Master,

497
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,519
who kidnapped you?

498
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,119
They're from Chang'an.

499
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,759
They've even made it all the way to Youzhou?

500
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,960
The situation is very urgent now.

501
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,680
I'm going to need reinforcements.

502
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,559
Dou, wait for me here.

503
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,559
Master.

504
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,319
Don't leave me again.

505
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,160
What I'm facing now is a major army from Youzhou.

506
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,559
If I don't go over there now...

507
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,720
and Wang Jun Kuo gets his way,

508
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,240
there really won't be any way to escape then.

509
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,839
Then why are you still going?

510
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,200
Because I don't have any choice.

511
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,759
Besides,

512
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,519
I don't believe the Youzhou army...

513
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,960
will become stooges like Wang Jun Kuo.

514
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,319
Master.

515
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:34,920
Don't leave me again.

516
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,599
Fighting on the battlefield is my dream.

517
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,880
I want to see a real army.

518
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,079
I won't let you go on your own no matter what you say this time.

519
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
All right.

520
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:45,839
I'll take you.

521
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,000
I'll let you see...

522
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,319
what a real army looks like.

523
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,160
All right.

524
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,359
Before I go, I need to meet someone.

525
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Wait for me outside.

526
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Chang Ge.

527
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,960
Tell Hao Du to take you back to Chang'an.

528
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,079
It's not safe to stay here.

529
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Chang Ge.

530
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,400
I can't go back to Chang'an.

531
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,519
Grandfather wants to marry me off to the prairies...

532
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,720
and intermarry with the Ashina Tribe.

533
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
What?

534
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,119
But my father said I'm very sick...

535
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,720
and told me to recuperate in Luoyang.

536
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,720
Listen to your father.

537
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,200
Be good and stay in Luoyang.

538
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Chang Ge.

539
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,359
But I don't want to go anywhere.

540
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,759
I really want things to go back to the way they were.

541
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
That can't happen.

542
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,559
Then...

543
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,360
Then can we still see each other again?

544
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,599
It's best that we don't.

545
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Chang Ge.

546
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,769
Hao Du said that...

547
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,719
sending a smoke signal is our only chance.

548
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:31,239
Do you think Shu Yu can be saved?

549
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,519
I'll definitely save him.

550
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,079
Don't worry.

551
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,079
Youngsters these days are always in such a scurry.

552
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,769
By the way, Youzhou has been sealed off.

553
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,599
They have given orders not to let anyone in or out.

554
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,719
It's getting late.

555
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
There's a rest stop up ahead.

556
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,880
We can take a break there.

557
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,039
Just go with the flow.

558
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,440
Life is full of surprises.

559
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,400
Isn't that right?

560
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,400
Su Su.

561
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Let's go.

562
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Stop right there.

563
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
What are you doing?

564
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,639
Here's my seal.

565
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,400
I'm an envoy from Chang'an, Wei Shu Yu.

566
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Let him in.

567
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,360
(Share weal and woe)

568
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,079
You're saying Governor Li and General Wang...

569
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,159
have defected to the enemy?

570
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,639
What proof do you have?

571
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,519
The envoys and subordinates that came with me...

572
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,329
are all locked up in the dungeon of the governor's manor.

573
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,289
If you and your soldiers come along with me,

574
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,079
you'll see for yourself.

575
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:26,809
Soldiers from outside the city...

576
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,199
are not allowed to enter without a military order.

577
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,440
If you don't have any other evidence,

578
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:32,769
I'm afraid I cannot comply.

579
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,840
But the city is being controlled by Wang Jun Kuo's followers.

580
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,519
As soon as the Ashina Tribe's army arrives,

581
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,289
Li Yuan will hand Youzhou over to them.

582
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,400
The north of Tang will be defenseless.

583
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,039
Everything I'm saying is true.

584
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,769
Please dispatch your troops.

585
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,880
What if I refuse?

586
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,079
Then...

587
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,159
please forgive me for being rude.

588
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,840
You're not an envoy from Chang'an.

589
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,920
Speak.

590
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,079
Who are you?

591
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,119
Captain.

592
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Captain.

593
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,960
There's a smoke signal.

594
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,199
Smoke signal?

595
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,519
It's a smoke signal.

596
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,769
Captain, please send out your troops immediately.

597
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,159
Convey my orders.

598
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,880
- Assemble the entire army.
- Yes.

599
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Your Highness.

600
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
How is it?

601
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,079
The word got out.

602
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,079
The Tang soldiers are on alert now.

603
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,639
We have to leave now.

604
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,920
Wang Jun Kuo, that piece of trash.

605
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,360
Has the Youzhou vault been emptied out?

606
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,159
Good thing Your Highness had taken precautions.

607
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,519
The maps, family registries, silk, and money in the vault...

608
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,679
have all been transported out.

609
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,679
The carriage is hiding in the woods outside the city.

610
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:44,809
Good.

611
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,440
We didn't come here for nothing.

612
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,289
Let's leave the city with Wang Jun Kuo's command token.

613
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yes.

614
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,199
Stop.

615
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,289
Let's hide. We need to avoid them first.

616
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,329
Ashina Sun.

617
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,719
Don't go, Young Khan.

618
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,159
They have a lot of soldiers with them.

619
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,119
If you expose yourself now, it'll be hard to escape.

620
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,960
Your Highness, you're someone of special status.

621
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,400
We can't let anything go wrong.

622
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,679
Let's go.

623
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Come on.

624
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Come on.

625
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,639
It seems like someone is hiding over there.

626
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,719
- Go and take a look.
- Yes.

627
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,880
This is from the Youzhou vault.

628
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,239
It seems like there must be trouble in the city.

629
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,079
Convey my orders. We must speed up.

630
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,599
We must get to Youzhou City before dawn.

631
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,199
- Yes.
- Yes.

632
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,000
(Gumeng Inn)

633
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,840
Don't even think about calling for help.

634
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,880
Why don't you try it?

635
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:13,480
Let's see if you can shout faster than my blade moves.

636
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,769
She's still a kid.

637
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,239
Don't scare her.

638
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:20,809
Su Su.

639
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,769
Don't be afraid. It's all right.

640
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,599
Why hasn't anyone come back yet?

641
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,809
Can Chang Ge really save Shu Yu?

642
00:41:58,809 --> 00:41:59,960
Su Su.

643
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,880
Let me find you a friend.

644
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,329
Would you like that?

645
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,719
Shu Yu.

646
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,239
Sir, are you all right?

647
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,159
Water.

648
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,480
- Water?
- Water.
