00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,760
(The Long Ballad)

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,280
(This is a work of fiction.)

4
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,159
(Episode 11)

5
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,519
(Prefectural Governor's Manor)

6
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
Governor Gongsun.

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Governor Gongsun.

8
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,680
Chief Registrar Li.

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Governor Gongsun.

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,120
As the new chief registrar of the Governor's Manor,

11
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm not familiar with the affairs in Shuozhou yet.

12
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,799
I should go with you.

13
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,840
There's no need for you to come this time.

14
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,719
Xu Feng will go with me.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Chief Registrar Li.

16
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,719
You two can have a good rest.

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Yes.

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,840
(Prefectural Governor's Manor)

19
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,530
I originally thought...

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,719
that if Gongsun Heng could take me to see Sima Tu,

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,159
I could use my wits to find out...

22
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,759
about the battle formation at the northern border.

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,159
From the looks of it,

24
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,400
this will require some more effort.

25
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,759
Should we follow them then?

26
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,530
Forget it.

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,810
Since he turned me down,

28
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,879
it'll seem like we have ulterior motives...

29
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,240
if we follow along now.

30
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,090
Master, where are you going?

31
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,439
To rest.

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Your Highness.

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,039
Our spy has reported that Ashina Sun headed...

34
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,280
in the direction of Shuozhou last night.

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,840
The Eagle Army hasn't made any moves yet.

36
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,080
Ashina Sun only took Mu Jin with him.

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
- Guard.
- Your Highness.

38
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,319
Assemble the Bear Army.

39
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,319
Yes.

40
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,919
Since they're giving us a chance,

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,639
we need to show them who's boss.

42
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,240
You're brilliant, Your Highness.

43
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,879
This is nice.

44
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,919
How's the situation?

45
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,439
I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.

46
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,439
There are merely less than a thousand soldiers...

47
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,840
stationed in the east and the south.

48
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,639
I knew it.

49
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,399
With the advantage of impregnable terrain...

50
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
in the east and the south,

51
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,920
the prefectural governor of Shuozhou...

52
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,360
mainly stationed troops in the north and west.

53
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
But I just scouted the areas.

54
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,279
There are only less than 20,000 soldiers.

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
How did Shuozhou City get its reputation...

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,839
of being a secure and resilient city?

57
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,079
Tu Ka She said these people are all useless.

58
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,279
Could this be true?

59
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,680
When we entered the city just now,

60
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,839
did you notice the city wall?

61
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,079
(Shuozhou)

62
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,240
It's a lot thicker compared to other cities...

63
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,399
in the Central Plain.

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,959
Also, the rammed earth looks fairly new.

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,639
It must be regularly reinforced.

66
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,000
Usually, all sorts of people freely go in and out of the city.

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,399
But when a war starts,

68
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,399
no one is able to get in once the city gate is closed.

69
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,959
As long as there are sufficient provisions in the city,

70
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,839
it wouldn't be difficult to survive for several years.

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,680
Interesting.

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,360
Do you have a plan?

73
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,730
Come on.

74
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,680
We need to buy some Paulownia wood.

75
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,279
Would it kill you to stop being mysterious for one second?

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
If you can help Gongsun Heng...

77
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,399
analyze the good and bad of the bureaucracy...

78
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,720
and guarantee his career prospects,

79
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,879
a Sui Dynasty official like him who submitted to the Tang empire...

80
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,319
would surely be tempted.

81
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,759
I'm just afraid this isn't what Gongsun Heng is after.

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Why are you still such a kid?

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,920
You even choke when you eat noodles.

84
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,639
Master.

85
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,480
I think we're out of money.

86
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,480
We used up all our money...

87
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,959
after giving food to the beggars last time.

88
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,040
Did you not keep even a bit for ourselves?

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,399
Didn't you say it yourself?

90
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,720
People must be grateful.

91
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,879
If the beggars hadn't told us where the bandits were,

92
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,399
how would we have made our way into the Governor's Manor?

93
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
Since we have food and shelter at the Prefectural Governor's Manor,

94
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
what do we still need money for?

95
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,920
Master, those were your exact words.

96
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
I'll count to three.

97
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Let's run together.

98
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Sirs.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
How was the food?

100
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,600
It's a total of 10 coins for 2 bowls of noodles.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,839
No, we haven't finished eating.

102
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,040
We'll pay later.

103
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,399
Sorry, sir.

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,480
The two of us came out in a hurry...

105
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,759
and forgot our coin pouch.

106
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,759
How about this?

107
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,879
I'll tell my brother to go home and get it.

108
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll wait here.

109
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,959
All right. I'll go and get the money now.

110
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,079
Don't run!

111
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,360
I see.

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,439
One runs off first, then the other finds a chance to escape too.

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,360
I've seen tricks like this a lot.

114
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,600
Let's go. Come with me to the magistrate.

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,560
No, sir. Listen to me.

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
My brother went to get the money. He'll be back soon.

117
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,879
How do I know whether you're telling the truth or not?

118
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,879
Come on.

119
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,519
- Sir, let go...
- How much is it?

120
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I'll give it to you.

121
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Why are you here?

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Here's 10 coins.

123
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,680
Consider the extra money as a reward from this young man.

124
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,079
Thank you, sir.

125
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
Sorry for offending you earlier.

126
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,800
Break it up.

127
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,000
- Let's go.
- Come on.

128
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,519
Zhun.

129
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
We meet again,

130
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,680
Shi Si Lang.

131
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,759
Who is this?

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,800
I told you not to come to Shuozhou.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,040
Yet, look at you.

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,720
You didn't listen to a word I said.

135
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,879
What about you?

136
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,000
You're here yourself.

137
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,519
By the way, how is your injury?

138
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,680
You even know about his injury?

139
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,839
I was the one who bandaged him up.

140
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,959
Of course, I know.

141
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,040
So, you're that quack?

142
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,519
His wound would've recovered without getting bandaged,

143
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,639
but thanks to you...

144
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm fine now.

145
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,480
Just ignore him, Shi Si Lang.

146
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
He...

147
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,959
I'm glad you're fine.

148
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,839
By the way,

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Shuozhou has consolidated the border trade situation.

150
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,040
Profiteers like you...

151
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,759
will lose money no matter what business you do.

152
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,000
Shi Si Lang.

153
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,199
How long are you going to be in Shuozhou?

154
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,920
Forget it.

155
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,680
Let's not pry into each other's business.

156
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,879
Master.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You got out.

158
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Mr. Peddler.

159
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,960
Who is this guy?

160
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,330
Dou.

161
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,159
Zhun paid for our meal.

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,279
The two of us are on our way out of the city.

163
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Shi Si Lang,

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,879
can you take us?

165
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,559
Of course.

166
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,759
We have to part ways eventually,

167
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,000
so I'll leave you guys here.

168
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,450
Zhun.

169
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,559
I wish you all the best with your business.

170
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,090
Shi Si Lang.

171
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,279
Just like last time,

172
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,090
if there's nothing that you must stay in Shuozhou for,

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,240
you should leave as soon as possible.

174
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,360
Where else could I go?

175
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,159
Have you ever thought about going to the grasslands?

176
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
The grasslands?

177
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,879
I don't know anyone there.

178
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
I'd rather not.

179
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,759
You know me.

180
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,879
Thank you.

181
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,210
But I'll pass.

182
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,799
Who are these people?

183
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,960
They're the outpost of the Ashina army.

184
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,090
They're about to attack the city.

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,399
Shi Si Lang.

186
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,120
Some of my men are still in the north.

187
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,519
I have to head back to look after them.

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,759
You...

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,519
You better get as far away from Shuozhou City as possible.

190
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,600
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

191
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Master.

192
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,090
What should we do now?

193
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,210
Let's go back.

194
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,759
I can't believe Tu Ka She is trying...

195
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,000
to earn credit for himself while you're gone.

196
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,759
Are we sure we don't need to do something?

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,519
If you want to see Tu Ka She ends up in a mess,

198
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,559
then you can stay.

199
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,330
I'm not interested in watching losers.

200
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,399
Are you that certain he'll lose?

201
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,799
Tu Ka She is an idiot.

202
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
Besides, she's still there.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She?

204
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,799
Stop right there.

205
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,440
How dare you trespass our city's defense area?

206
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,799
Release the smoke signal and hit the drum!

207
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,240
The Ashina army is attacking!

208
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,279
Get out of the way.

209
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,440
If we miss the timing to warn them,

210
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
will you be able to bear the responsibility?

211
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
- Quick!
- No.

212
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Chief Registrar Li.

213
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Let him come up.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

215
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Chief Registrar Li.

216
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,080
- Why are you here?
- Governor Gongsun.

217
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,480
The Ashina Tribe's army is attacking.

218
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Hurry and strike the drum.

219
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,879
There's no rush yet.

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No rush?

221
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,440
So, you mean...

222
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,039
you still won't strike the drum and warn the people yet.

223
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,279
It's not time yet.

224
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,919
It's all right even if they come closer.

225
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,759
Governor Gongsun.

226
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,120
Think about it carefully.

227
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,799
Once the Ashina Tribe enters the city,

228
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,519
it'll be a catastrophe for Shuozhou.

229
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,039
It will also be...

230
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,519
- an impending danger for Tang!
- Stop it!

231
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,519
- How dare you to attack our master?
- Enough, Xu Feng.

232
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,919
He's just acting out of desperation.

233
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,679
We have to urgently deal with the enemy now.

234
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,799
I don't have time to explain everything to you.

235
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,799
Guards.

236
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

237
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,679
Take them back to the manor and watch them closely.

238
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,720
- Gongsun Heng.
- Come on.

239
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,840
You don't know how to make use of your soldiers.

240
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,039
- You're too willful.
- Come.

241
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,039
Gongsun Heng.

242
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,159
(Prefectural Governor's Manor)

243
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,679
Hey.

244
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,799
I won't go to the gate tower.

245
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,120
Am I not even allowed to walk around the manor?

246
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
The governor has given orders.

247
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,360
You two are not to go anywhere.

248
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,080
Do you believe him that much?

249
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,960
What if his decision is wrong?

250
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,480
The governor has his own plans.

251
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,000
That Gongsun Heng is just a phony.

252
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,639
I really don't know what he did...

253
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,480
to fool everyone in the city into supporting him.

254
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,080
Did you hear the war drum just now?

255
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,000
They only sent out a warning after such a long time.

256
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,919
I'm afraid...

257
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,759
this battle is a dangerous one.

258
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,159
Dou.

259
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,960
Do you think...

260
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,759
it was wrong for us to come here?

261
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,679
He doesn't even know the most basic military strategies.

262
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,639
I can't believe I was hoping...

263
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,000
to ask for his help in starting a revolt.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Exactly.

265
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Even I know...

266
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,519
we must send out a warning in time when enemies are in sight.

267
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,720
How could he not understand this...

268
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,879
as the prefectural governor of Shuozhou?

269
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,399
He might've done it on purpose.

270
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If he dares...

271
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,240
to give Shuozhou up to the Ashina Tribe,

272
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,320
I won't let him off.

273
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,679
I'll teach him a lesson too.

274
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Governor Gongsun.

275
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,679
Chief Registrar Li.

276
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,519
- I...
- Why didn't you sound the drum?

277
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,720
The Ashina soldiers suddenly struck the city.

278
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,960
Our soldiers didn't respond in one time.

279
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,279
It's only normal that we'd suffer tragically.

280
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,399
Tell me.

281
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,519
How many casualties are there?

282
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,759
Ten thousand?

283
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,639
Twenty thousand?

284
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,679
Or is it more?

285
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,360
Chief Registrar Li, we...

286
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
If you don't know anything about military tactics,

287
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
why didn't you listen to my advice?

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,200
Why did you insist on doing things your own way?

289
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,600
Did you do it on purpose?

290
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,440
You guys...

291
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,200
Do you have any regard for the lives of all the people in the city?

292
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Chief Registrar Li.

293
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,039
This battle was a triumph.

294
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We won.

295
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,679
We won?

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
How did we win?

297
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Yes, Governor Gongsun.

298
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,879
Hurry and tell us.

299
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,200
How did we win?

300
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,399
Calm down, both of you.

301
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,679
Let me explain.

302
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,519
Our master had his reasons for not sounding the drum...

303
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,639
to send out a warning.

304
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,480
At the time, 3,000 archers were hiding...

305
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,279
inside the city's gate tower.

306
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,720
The Ashina Tribe's soldiers rushed here on their horses.

307
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Very soon, they were within range for us to shoot.

308
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,480
Once our master gave the order,

309
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,679
10,000 arrows were released at once.

310
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,320
The Ashina Tribe's soldiers could not turn around in time...

311
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,679
and they immediately panicked.

312
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,200
Then, our master gave another order.

313
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,600
Convey my orders.

314
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Open the gate and bring out the chevaux-de-frise.

315
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,600
Our warriors got into position...

316
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,919
and attacked the enemy.

317
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,639
The Crescent Moon Array.

318
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,679
Chief Registrar Li, do you understand military strategies?

319
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,320
I've learned a thing or two before.

320
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Come.

321
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
Sit down.

322
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,159
Then, tell me.

323
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,360
If you were to lead the soldiers and create a battle formation,

324
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,440
what would you do next?

325
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,080
Next...

326
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,840
The Crescent Moon shall transition to the Serpent Battle Array.

327
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
If the body of the serpent is attacked,

328
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,600
the head and tail can come together as reinforcement.

329
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
And then?

330
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,799
Mr. Xu, continue.

331
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
And then,

332
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,759
after taking such heavy blows,

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,600
the Ashina Tribe's soldiers were already utterly destroyed.

334
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,600
But their commander, Tu Ka She, just wouldn't admit defeat.

335
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,399
They tried to attack us again.

336
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,440
Sound the war drum.

337
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,919
Light the smoke signal.

338
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,399
At that moment,

339
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,480
our warriors lying in wait sounded the war drums...

340
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,639
and sent out smoke signals...

341
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,679
in the northeast and northwest corners...

342
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,879
across the gate tower.

343
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,039
The battle cries of our soldiers echoed in their ears endlessly.

344
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,759
Tu Ka She was afraid they'd be surrounded on all four sides...

345
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,320
and was scared out of his wits.

346
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,519
They turned around and helplessly retreated.

347
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,600
Governor Gongsun, you're indeed impressive.

348
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:15,879
But...

349
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,679
Since there were soldiers lying in ambushes...

350
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,000
in the northeast and west,

351
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,759
why didn't you secretly send them in...

352
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,879
and take them by surprise?

353
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,080
Why did you have to create such a stir?

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
Could it be that you...

355
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,120
What?

356
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,799
You were bluffing.

357
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,240
You're indeed a very talented young man.

358
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,480
You saw right through me.

359
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,480
You're right.

360
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,879
Only 2,000 warriors were lying in wait.

361
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,639
Your military tactics are indeed incredible.

362
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,480
So...

363
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,200
You no longer think I don't know how to make use of my troops...

364
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,919
and only insist on doing things my own way?

365
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,680
I was the ignorant one.

366
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,559
Just because I learned a bit about military tactics,

367
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,759
I spoke arrogantly to you.

368
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm ashamed.

369
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,799
All right.

370
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,599
I won't take such trivial matters to heart.

371
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,799
But seeing how you risked your life...

372
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
to deliver the news to us,

373
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,079
I appreciate your kindness towards the civilians in Shuozhou.

374
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,720
Here, I'd like to thank you on behalf...

375
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,559
of all the citizens in the city.

376
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,890
Governor Gongsun.

377
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,079
I really admire your generosity.

378
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
After this battle,

379
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,319
I finally understand...

380
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,480
why you're undefeated...

381
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,170
and how Shuozhou City built its secure walls...

382
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,839
and brought joy and peace to its citizens.

383
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,960
If you don't mind,

384
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,519
I want to...

385
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,200
I want to...

386
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Do you want to join us in fighting the enemies...

387
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,720
and guarding Shuozhou City?

388
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm willing to share this responsibility with you.

389
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,240
You're a talented young man...

390
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,519
and you know military tactics.

391
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,319
I'm very gratified.

392
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,319
Get up.

393
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,519
I'm also willing to learn the art of war from you, Governor.

394
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,920
Okay.

395
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,119
Defend Shuozhou City with us too.

396
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Get up.

397
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,039
Congratulations to the Bear Army for making a safe return.

398
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,319
All of you came to see me this time.

399
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,650
Of course, we had to.

400
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Your Highness wanted to be the one to bring home a win first.

401
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,559
Without a word, you led your soldiers...

402
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,799
in a surprise attack on the city.

403
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,319
Although it didn't end well,

404
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,410
at least you didn't get completely wiped out.

405
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,839
I'm not in a good mood.

406
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,480
You better shut that mouth of yours.

407
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,599
The Bear Army's attack this time has alerted the enemy.

408
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,759
If we end up getting backed into a corner in this war,

409
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,170
it's all because of your mistake today.

410
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,599
What's wrong?

411
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,170
I just took my Bear Army out for a bit of training.

412
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,079
How could you hold me accountable for something so serious?

413
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,240
I know what I'm doing.

414
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,519
It's none of your business.

415
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,759
We don't want to get involved with your business either.

416
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,559
We'll be reporting everything about today's battle...

417
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,359
to the Great Khan.

418
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,480
You don't have to do it.

419
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,319
I'll report to him myself.

420
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,480
Send this letter...

421
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,519
to the Chief Commander's Manor.

422
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,410
(Only to be opened by Chief Commander Sima Tu.)

423
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,039
This time, the Ashina Tribe came with ill intentions.

424
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,079
If my guess is correct,

425
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,480
they'll definitely attack again.

426
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,410
We need backup.

427
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,759
I'm on it.

428
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,680
(Broad-minded and knowledgeable)

429
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,039
Governor Gongsun.

430
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,519
- Chief Registrar Li.
- Governor Gongsun,

431
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,650
this is a newly drawn map.

432
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,680
Please take a look.

433
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,200
Why do you look so troubled?

434
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,890
After all, we won the battle.

435
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,759
Why aren't you happy over our victory?

436
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,559
It's just a small victory.

437
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,519
What is there to be happy about?

438
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,359
I've already asked Xu Feng to ask the chief commander...

439
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,680
for backup.

440
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,890
Backup?

441
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,079
Shuozhou's terrain is impenetrable yet,

442
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,440
we still need reinforcements?

443
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
The truly powerful enemies of the Ashina Tribe...

444
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,240
haven't shown up yet.

445
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,920
Look at this.

446
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,640
The Wuding River is wide and deep.

447
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,480
It was supposed to be the natural defense line...

448
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,400
between Shuozhou and the Ashina Tribe.

449
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,559
But now,

450
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,119
we don't have enough soldiers,

451
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,599
so we can't dispatch troops to guard the riverbank.

452
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,440
That's why the enemies can freely come and go...

453
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,039
and approach the city.

454
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
Since they'll pass this river as they come and go,

455
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
why don't we turn this river...

456
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,599
into a war tunnel?

457
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,000
A war tunnel?

458
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,319
As the Ashina Tribe army isn't good in the water,

459
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,599
they probably prefer the dry season.

460
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,359
Of course.

461
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,480
If the river is dry,

462
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,720
there will be nothing obstructing them.

463
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,400
They'll be able to travel twice as fast as usual.

464
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,839
In that case,

465
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,640
we'll give them a dry season.

466
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
Give them a dry season?

467
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,039
What do you mean?

468
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,599
From what I heard, the dry season is always in July.

469
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,920
However, it just so happens that we have a lot of rain this summer.

470
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,519
The dry season...

471
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,160
will probably be coming at least half a month late.

472
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Coincidentally,

473
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,000
there's a dense forest at the head of this river.

474
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,599
If we send our elite soldiers...

475
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,119
to block the river current with rocks and wood,

476
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,720
it'll be done in just a few days.

477
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,200
Governor Gongsun,

478
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,359
what do you think?

479
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,279
You...

480
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,839
You're good, Chief Registrar Li.

481
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,319
How did you come up with such a strategy?

482
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,200
Please forgive my nonsense.

483
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,000
You are very clever.

484
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,119
I'm impressed.

485
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,559
However,

486
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,640
the Ashina Tribe's Bear Army was just defeated.

487
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,200
They fled in a hurry.

488
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,039
I don't think they'll dare...

489
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,759
to dispatch any troops for a while.

490
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,279
Even if they do,

491
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:37,119
they'll be very cautious.

492
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,480
It seems we'll need to carefully think...

493
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,880
about how we can get them to let their guard down.

494
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,440
If it weren't for the fact that the Ashina Tribe's soldiers...

495
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,599
are too strong,

496
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,640
there's actually a more reliable way to fight them.

497
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,359
A more reliable way to fight?

498
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,480
Tell me about it.

499
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,200
The military strategist, Sun Tzu, once said,

500
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,240
"In a battle,"

501
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,920
"one must use unconventional methods to win."

502
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,640
We could send out our troops as bait...

503
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,039
to lure the enemy's main forces.

504
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,880
And then, we can have our soldiers take a detour...

505
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,559
and attack the enemy's flank from behind,

506
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,880
destroying the enemy's territory.

507
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,400
Then, we'll crush them one by one.

508
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,720
Isn't that even better?

509
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Okay.

510
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,400
You're so young,

511
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,759
yet, you're so bold.

512
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
That's very impressive.

513
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,319
You remind me...

514
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,519
of someone else.

515
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,799
Who?

516
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,079
The Prince of Qin,

517
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,000
the current Crown Prince.

518
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,960
There were countless heroes near the end of the Sui Dynasty.

519
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,759
He was a young boy back then.

520
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,039
He led an army of men...

521
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,279
and attacked the enemy's territory.

522
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,319
He used the same strategy.

523
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,200
He was invincible.

524
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
I can't believe...

525
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,599
I heard you describe the same strategy today.

526
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Chief Registrar Li.

527
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,599
It seems you were just being modest...

528
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,480
when you said you only learned a thing or two.

529
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,200
The Crown Prince's great feats are well-known to the world.

530
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,599
I merely copied his strategy.

531
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
I don't deserve any praise.

532
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,240
Chief Registrar Li.

533
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Don't be so modest.

534
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,640
Shuozhou is incredibly lucky to have you.

535
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,880
Right.

536
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,000
One more thing.

537
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,880
Chief Registrar Li.

538
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,319
This is a report for the imperial court.

539
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,440
You must have a messenger travel day and night...

540
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,759
to get it to Chang'an immediately.

541
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,599
Governor Gongsun,

542
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,160
do you not trust the chief commander?

543
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,759
This isn't about trust.

544
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,920
It's just that...

545
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,480
this concerns the safety of the people.

546
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,000
We must do what we can to ensure that nothing goes wrong.

547
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,559
Yes. I'll get right on it.

548
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Li Shi Min.

549
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,799
Will I never be able to step out of your shadow?

550
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,240
I remember now.

551
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,759
You're from Shuozhou.

552
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,839
You know Shuozhou inside and out.

553
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,480
You knew we were going to lose today.

554
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,200
Are you conspiring with the enemy?

555
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,519
I'm innocent!

556
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,640
I've always been loyal to you, Your Highness.

557
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,359
I have a plan.

558
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,920
If Your Highness still wants to kill me after hearing me out,

559
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,920
I'm willing to accept it.

560
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,839
Tell me.

561
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
How confident are you about this?

562
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
If this works,

563
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,400
Shuozhou will self-destruct.

564
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,519
Your Highness will get all the credit.

565
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Is that so?

566
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Master,

567
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,000
Commander Sima has invited you to his place.

568
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,279
Sima Tu?

569
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,240
Did he say anything else?

570
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,279
No.

571
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,279
Perhaps he agrees to send reinforcements...

572
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,559
and wants to discuss it with you.

573
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,880
After the Ashina Tribe's invasion,

574
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,559
he hasn't made any moves at all.

575
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
He has always guarded against me.

576
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,000
It can't be that simple.

577
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,680
All right, you may go.

578
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Yes.

579
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,720
Elder Qin.

580
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,480
This invitation from Sima Tu...

581
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,480
must be a trap.

582
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,759
But he's the chief commander.

583
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,119
I can't disrespect him either.

584
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,680
- I have to go.
- Master.

585
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,480
I'll go with you.

586
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
It's okay.

587
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,200
I think it's more useful for you to stay here.

588
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,240
Elder Qin.

589
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,559
If I do not return this time,

590
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,440
hand this to Chief Registrar Li.

591
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,119
Master, are you sure?

592
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,160
The backgrounds of the two young men...

593
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,279
are quite suspicious.

594
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
I've never chosen people I suspect.

595
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,559
If I decide to choose them, I trust them.

596
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,440
You can be the one to decide...

597
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,640
when to give this to them.

598
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Master.

599
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,680
Elder Qin.

600
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,759
I know what you're worried about.

601
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,359
I trust him.

602
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
But...

603
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,400
- And I trust you even more.
- Master.

604
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,599
This...

605
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,440
Aside from hearing his words, you must also observe his actions.

606
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,039
Then you'll know where his heart lies.

607
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
I know.

608
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,319
He may be hiding something.

609
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,359
But I don't believe...

610
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,480
he's someone who will harm Tang and the civilians.

611
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,839
All these years,

612
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,920
I've defended against enemies with my troops...

613
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,200
and fought them countless times.

614
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,440
The enemies may have already seen through my tactics.

615
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,799
But he's different.

616
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,599
He's very clever with making use of troops.

617
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,279
He's versatile.

618
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,079
Moreover, the enemies are not familiar with his tactics.

619
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,720
We may gain victory by giving them a surprise.

620
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
However,

621
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:28,119
he's still inexperienced.

622
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,880
He needs your help.

623
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,519
Even if I don't come back this time,

624
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I believe...

625
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,240
as long as you work together,

626
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,720
you'll surely find a way...

627
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,279
to save the civilians of Shuozhou from danger.

628
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,359
Let me thank you in advance.

629
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,079
Master, please don't be like this.

630
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,559
I will do as you say.

631
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,319
(Broad-minded and knowledgeable)

632
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,720
(Chief Commander's Manor)

633
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,119
(Chief Commander's Manor)

634
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,640
- Governor Gongsun.
- Governor Gongsun.

635
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,119
Stop right there.

636
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:31,839
What?

637
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,119
Xu Feng.

638
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,599
Wait for me here.

639
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,079
Yes.

640
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Come on.

641
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,160
(Chief Commander's Manor)

642
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,480
Greetings, Army Chief.

643
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,559
So, you still remember I'm the chief commander?

644
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm not sure what you mean.

645
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,319
Please explain.

646
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Let me ask you.

647
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,880
Did you deploy the troops for the battle today?

648
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,359
Yes.

649
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,039
It was an urgent matter.

650
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,559
When we discovered the enemy,

651
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,079
the Ashina Tribe was already approaching the city.

652
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,079
We were in an emergency situation.

653
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,400
That's why I couldn't send any men to report to you.

654
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,759
In the face of urgency, I did what I had to.

655
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,880
Please forgive me.

656
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,279
I govern...

657
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,799
the armies of four provinces on His Majesty's behalf.

658
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,400
All the troops...

659
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,039
must follow my orders.

660
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,240
No one is allowed to dispatch our troops on their own.

661
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,240
I do understand the need...

662
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,079
to accommodate urgent circumstances.

663
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:54,119
But the battle today went on for four hours.

664
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,799
In those four hours,

665
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,880
were you so busy that you couldn't send one person...

666
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,079
to come and inform me?

667
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,839
I was careless.

668
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,960
Everyone knows how meticulous you are.

669
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,279
Why would you be careless?

670
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,640
Ultimately, this is all because...

671
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,480
you've just never had any respect for me at all.

672
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,559
I suppose you've worked too long for the Sui Dynasty,

673
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,400
so you've forgotten we're in a new dynasty now.

674
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,519
I'm serving the Tang Dynasty with utmost sincerity.

675
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,880
I hope you can understand.

676
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,839
I am absolutely loyal.

677
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,519
So you're saying I'm falsely accusing you?

678
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,799
I wouldn't dare.

679
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,279
Knowing that the soldiers only listen to your orders,

680
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,279
you've been a tyrant in Shuozhou for decades.

681
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,920
You've gotten used to throwing your weight around.

682
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,599
What is there you wouldn't dare to do?

683
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,920
Today, you deployed troops without permission.

684
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,559
If I don't do anything,

685
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,119
the other three provinces will follow suit...

686
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,960
and have no regard for me.

687
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Guards.

688
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,599
Army Chief.

689
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,960
We're in a critical battle situation now.

690
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,759
Please allow me to fight off the enemies first.

691
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,519
I'll surely visit you again to accept punishment.

692
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,279
So you want to come back for punishment when you're not busy?

693
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,880
You really are something.

694
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,480
Do you have any respect for His Majesty?

695
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,640
Army Chief.

696
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,480
The war should be our priority now.

697
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,839
Please put the civilians first.

698
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,599
Take him away.

699
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,039
Keep a close eye on him!

700
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,599
Governor Gongsun said...

701
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,880
he will stay at the Chief's Manor tonight.

702
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,039
You can go back first.

703
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,759
Army Chief.

704
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,159
Has the war report that the Governor's Manor...

705
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,159
sent off to Chang'an been intercepted?

706
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,199
Yes.

707
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,599
Any news of Shuozhou will never reach Chang'an.

708
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,400
Immediately send someone...

709
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,079
to guard the post road in the south.

710
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,360
Before the Ashina Tribe army retreats,

711
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,599
any news of the four provinces in the north...

712
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,360
must not get out.

713
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,119
Yes.

714
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Come out.

715
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,199
It's done.

716
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Hurry and leave.

717
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,809
You're not welcome here.

718
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,639
If I hadn't told you...

719
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,329
and we let Gongsun Heng anger the Ashina army,

720
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,960
the four provinces in the north would be in deep trouble...

721
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,639
if we drew the attention of their main forces.

722
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,840
I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to keep your position...

723
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,480
as the chief commander.

724
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,559
I did you such a huge favor.

725
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,809
It's not very appropriate...

726
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,079
for you to send me off like this, is it?

727
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,769
My Sima family...

728
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:14,440
no longer has anything to do with you.

729
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,880
You chose to defect to the enemy,

730
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:18,920
but don't drag me down with you.

731
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,199
You're wrongfully accusing me.

732
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,840
I'm doing this for your sake.

733
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,289
I also don't want to see civilians living in misery.

734
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,519
Gongsun Heng wants to risk the lives of everyone in the city...

735
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,329
so he can claim he cares about the people's livelihood.

736
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,840
Never mind locking him up.

737
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,400
You could even kill him.

738
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,039
It's none of your business...

739
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,079
how I'll deal with Gongsun Heng.

740
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,960
Fine.

741
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,960
It's only a matter of time...

742
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,329
until Shuozhou City collapses.

743
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:54,440
When the time comes,

744
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,920
you should fear for your life.

745
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,559
I'm currently serving the Ashina Tribe...

746
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,880
and I'm highly valued.

747
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,289
You've also seen what the circumstances are.

748
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,000
We're family.

749
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,880
Of course, I'll always keep your benefits in mind.

750
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,559
You and your people have become enemies...

751
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,639
with Gongsun Heng.

752
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,599
If he gets back on his feet one day,

753
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:20,960
do you think you'd be able to get a foothold in Shuozhou City?

754
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,599
I can only give you a piece of advice.

755
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,809
Give up the wrong path you're on and turn in the right direction.

756
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,769
It's still not too late.

757
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,400
It's almost dawn.

758
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:43,360
Get lost.

759
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:17,329
Chief Registrar.

760
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:20,159
It's late. Aren't you going to bed?

761
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,480
I'll sleep after I organize these documents for the governor.

762
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,360
What about you, Elder Qin?

763
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,519
You're getting old.

764
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,920
Why don't you let someone else...

765
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,440
be on night patrol?

766
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,519
Saying this...

767
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,639
makes it sound like you've done something guilty.

768
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,079
Elder Qin.

769
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,809
I'll just say one thing.

770
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,440
I have a clear conscience.

771
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,159
All right.

772
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:46,360
- Elder Qin.
- Xu Feng.

773
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:47,920
You came back so late.

774
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,960
Where's our master?

775
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,000
Sima Tu's subordinate told me...

776
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,119
that Master is staying...

777
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,239
at the Chief Commander's Manor tonight.

778
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,239
I think something's wrong,

779
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,360
so I hurried back here.

780
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,559
I knew it.

781
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,599
They've detained him.

782
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Why?

783
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm afraid it's because...

784
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,079
he deployed troops to fight the enemy without permission today.

785
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:07,639
Sima Tu has always thought...

786
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,079
of the governor as a thorn in his side.

787
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,289
He didn't respond...

788
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,400
to the governor's request for reinforcements.

789
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,920
Today, Master had no choice...

790
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,719
but to deploy troops to face the enemy.

791
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:21,519
I'm afraid they have a hold on him now.

792
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,840
That makes sense.

793
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,639
From the Sui Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty,

794
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,599
Governor Gongsun has held military power in Shuozhou.

795
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,199
The imperial court assigned the chief commander...

796
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,440
to govern the four provinces...

797
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,079
in order to limit the governor's power.

798
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,400
They fear he'll defy the court's orders.

799
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,679
After today's battle,

800
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,159
even though they didn't exactly get their way,

801
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,599
it'll be their excuse to rise in revolt later on.

802
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:39,719
Yes.

803
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,920
That dirty official.

804
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,480
How could he be so unreasonable?

805
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,079
I'll send people to charge into his manor...

806
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,440
- and save our master now.
- Stop right there.

807
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,329
- You can't go.
- Why not?

808
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Come to your senses.

809
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,719
They've detained our master,

810
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,239
but they're keeping quiet.

811
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,519
That's because...

812
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:56,199
they still don't have anything on him yet.

813
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,360
If we fight against the chief commander now,

814
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,599
we'd be giving them proof...

815
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,960
that Master has ulterior motives...

816
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,289
and is conspiring to stage a rebellion,

817
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,719
just like their accusations.

818
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,039
Then what can we do now to save Master?

819
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,809
Master is the prefectural governor.

820
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,559
Although they've detained him,

821
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,480
his life is not in danger for now.

822
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:19,809
But this must stay between the three of us.

823
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:21,360
Madam must not find out.

824
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,679
I don't want her to worry for nothing.

825
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,679
Yes.

826
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,519
Xu Feng.

827
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,920
You used to be a scout.

828
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:29,519
Investigating is your expertise.

829
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,079
Keep an eye on the chief commander.

830
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,559
Do not let him out of your sight for even a second.

831
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,679
Report every single detail to me by a carrier pigeon.

832
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Tomorrow,

833
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,920
I'll meet with Sima Tu myself to ascertain the situation.

834
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:43,039
Yes.

835
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:44,840
Elder Qin.

836
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,000
I'll go with you tomorrow.

837
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,159
Chief Registrar Li.

838
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,289
Staying here in the manor...

839
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,289
would already be a great help to us.

840
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,679
What's the background of Tu Ka She's advisor?

841
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,329
This man's surname is Sima.

842
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,599
He's an official of the Central Plain...

843
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,840
whom Tu Ka She captured...

844
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,289
when he went on an expedition with the Great Khan.

845
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:13,360
Seeing that he is quite clever,

846
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,480
Tu Ka She let him live.

847
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,840
He became the advisor for the Bear Army.

848
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,119
As they would say in the Central Plain,

849
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,239
he's "a villain who got into power".

850
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,360
Who knows what ideas...

851
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,000
that villain has given Tu Ka She this time?

852
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,329
Just now, our scout reported...

853
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,840
that the Chief Commander has detained Gongsun Heng.

854
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,360
Gongsun Hang has been detained?

855
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,639
So what if the city has a strong defense?

856
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,920
Gongsun Heng has been protecting Shuozhou for so many years,

857
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,719
but he got locked up by one of his own in the end.

858
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,289
They're pretty much just handing Shuozhou to us on a plate.

859
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,719
That's too bad.

860
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,329
A great soldier has been ruined by a wicked villain.

861
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,769
Keep an eye on Sima Jian.

862
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:51,289
Don't let him play with fire and end up burning us.

863
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,079
Yes.

864
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,000
Let me congratulate Your Highness in advance.

865
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,920
My brother has already imprisoned Gongsun Heng.

866
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,639
Once I persuade him some more,

867
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,809
he'll surely surrender soon.

868
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,039
Good.

869
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:14,639
If that day comes,

870
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,079
not only will I be flying high,

871
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,719
it will also mark the day you get rich.

872
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,880
I want to see how that scumbag...

873
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,769
will still compete with me.

874
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,559
(Prefectural Governor's Manor)

875
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:44,809
What is the meaning of this?

876
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:46,440
Just tell us if you want to kick us out.

877
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,559
What are you doing?

878
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,599
There is a thief in the manor.

879
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,239
Chief Li.

880
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:55,159
This morning, Sima Tu refused to let me in.

881
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,329
But my scout reported that...

882
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:01,079
Sima Tu claims Governor Gongsun colluded with the Ashina Tribe...

883
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,559
and disregarded military orders.

884
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,360
He is suspected of treason,

885
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,559
so he has been locked up to await trial.

886
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,079
Isn't that nonsense?

887
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,289
Where is the justice?

888
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
Justice?

889
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,360
If that existed,

890
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,289
the world would be a peaceful place.
