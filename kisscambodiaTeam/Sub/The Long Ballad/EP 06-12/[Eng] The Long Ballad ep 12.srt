00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,760
(The Long Ballad)

3
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,280
(This is a work of fiction.)

4
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,359
(Episode 12)

5
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,239
Army Chief has commanded me...

6
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,480
to come and collect...

7
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,920
Gongsun Heng's command token.

8
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,439
Where's the command token?

9
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,680
Give it to me now.

10
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,959
The thieves sure got here fast.

11
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,519
Come on.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,159
Madam, please be sensible.

13
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,400
Move out of the way.

14
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,400
Don't make our men use force.

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,480
This is the Gongsun family's private residence,

16
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,120
not the Shuozhou Office.

17
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,879
I can't make the decision...

18
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,039
on what my husband...

19
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,400
wants to keep or hand over.

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,199
I must wait for my husband's return...

21
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,919
before giving you an answer.

22
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,599
Madan, you better cooperate.

23
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,090
If you give it to us sooner,

24
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,599
it will also clear...

25
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,879
Governor Gongsun's name sooner.

26
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,759
Your family can also reunite sooner.

27
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,090
Governor Gongsun is currently detained and awaiting trial.

28
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,840
The result will all depend...

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,840
on Chief's decision.

30
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,400
At a time like this, I suggest...

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,479
you don't offend us.

32
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,879
What a coincidence.

33
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,810
Gongsun Heng fought in wars all his life...

34
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,000
and guarded this city for half of his life.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,520
While with him,

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,840
I'm used to seeing weapons.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,199
These empty words...

38
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,879
can't scare me.

39
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,680
Then don't blame me...

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,400
for being rude.

41
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,960
Who is it?

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,039
Who did it?

43
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,879
Speak if you must.

44
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,680
But don't you dare to act imprudently...

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,560
in front of my master.

46
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,120
Governor Gongsun is not here.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
Madam can't make a decision.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,240
If you need anything,

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,080
just come to me.

50
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,639
Can you make the decision?

51
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,719
My master has fallen into your hands.

52
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,439
I have to make the decision even if I can't.

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,479
Madam, if you trust me,

54
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,080
let me handle this.

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,319
Please go inside and take care of Yuan Niang.

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,439
- Thank you.
- This way, please.

57
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,759
Everyone.

58
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,159
Come with me.

59
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,199
Bad news!

60
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,319
Bad news!

61
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,319
Something bad happened! We got robbed.

62
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,639
Nonsense.

63
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,479
How can the Governor's Manor get robbed?

64
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,639
Are you kidding me?

65
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,439
We haven't thoroughly checked the money and items we lost.

66
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,599
But Governor Gongsun's study...

67
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,199
and the accounting room experienced very serious losses.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,759
In order to minimize the loss,

69
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,439
we need to go after the thief right away.

70
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
All right, that's enough. Where are your manners?

71
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,599
This is Imperial Guard Wang, who works for Chief Sima.

72
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,960
Greet him immediately.

73
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,730
Imperial Guard Wang, you came just in time.

74
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,170
Please help us go after the thief now.

75
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,240
What a joke.

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,959
How is a robbery at Governor's Manor my business?

77
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,240
Give me the command token now.

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,439
Command token?

79
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,959
The command token is in Governor Gongsun's study.

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,360
This is bad.

81
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,000
Where's the study?

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,079
Right there.

83
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,839
Come on.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Elder Qin.

85
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,839
We really got robbed.

86
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,399
Search the place!

87
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,050
What should we do?

88
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,610
My goodness. This...

89
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,079
Imperial Guard Wang, we didn't find the command token.

90
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,279
Don't try to trick me.

91
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,879
I don't care if the command token was really stolen or not.

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,279
Within three days,

93
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,160
if you can't hand over the command token,

94
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,439
there won't be peace in Governor's Manor.

95
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,519
Come on!

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,560
How did you know that they would come?

97
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,959
Sima Tu keeps pressuring Governor Gongsun...

98
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
to give him the command token.

99
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,360
This time, he detained Governor Gongsun...

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,319
just to get the command token.

101
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
This is...

102
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,720
just a delaying tactic.

103
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,600
Then what should we do now?

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Are we really going to hand over the command token?

105
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,199
Do you think Sima Tu can mobilize Shuozhou's troops...

106
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,959
once he has the command token?

107
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,319
You can try...

108
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,000
to take the command token to the camp.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
See if those soldiers...

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,879
will listen to you.

111
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,639
What do you mean?

112
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,279
Could it be that the soldiers of Shuozhou...

113
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,639
disobey the command token?

114
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,480
Forget the command token,

115
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,839
even the Emperor's seal...

116
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,560
won't be able to control...

117
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,000
the soldiers of Shuozhou.

118
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,920
The only thing that can make them obey willingly...

119
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,800
isn't an object.

120
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,920
Only Gongsun Heng can do that.

121
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,120
Elder Qin!

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,319
- Elder Qin.
- You have news?

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,399
Sima Tu sent people to open our vault.

124
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,399
They want to take all the money and everything valuable...

125
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,240
to reconcile with the Ashina Tribe army.

126
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,480
This won't do. We can't show weakness.

127
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040
This way, we'd only be digging our own graves.

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,720
Governor Gongsun is locked up in prison now.

129
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,040
He can't command the army.

130
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,680
What should we do?

131
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
The worst-case scenario is we fight them head-on.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
Let's just charge in.

133
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,879
Let's break into the prison to save Governor Gongsun.

134
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,759
You want to bring troops to charge into prison?

135
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,800
That would be exactly what Sima Tu wants.

136
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,720
Not only would you fail to save Governor Gongsun,

137
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,920
but you'd also be endangering Shuozhou.

138
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,360
Governor Gongsun hired you to be the chief registrar.

139
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,759
I hope he was not wrong about you.

140
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,040
I didn't expect Elder Qin to be quite smart.

141
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,120
Even if he walks shakily...

142
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,439
and seems unable to walk well,

143
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,839
he's quite clever.

144
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,079
Am I right, Master?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,079
Master?

146
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,199
Master.

147
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,040
What are you thinking about?

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,360
I am thinking of a way to save Governor Gongsun.

149
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,160
Select thousands of elite soldiers...

150
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,519
and surround Chief Commander's Manor.

151
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,480
I'll personally go there.

152
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,959
- I'll surely...
- You're very annoying.

153
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,399
We just came to Shuozhou.

154
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,199
We don't know much about the situation here.

155
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,040
Even Elder Qin doesn't know what to do.

156
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,160
Gongsun Heng trusts me so much.

157
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,920
How can I not save him?

158
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,210
Aside from hijacking the prison wagon, what else can we do?

159
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,120
Can you kill Sima Tu?

160
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,480
Why are you looking at me?

161
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,919
- I know what to do now.
- Master, where are you going?

162
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,210
I'll go and meet Elder Qin.

163
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,240
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

164
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,450
You knew that I'd come?

165
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,960
You must have come up with a plan.

166
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,399
We don't have much time.

167
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,879
Tell me.

168
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,159
I do have an idea that requires mobilizing troops.

169
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,879
Tell me about it.

170
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,720
I need some reinforcement soldiers under Governor Gongsun's command.

171
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,159
When the time comes...

172
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
This plan is too risky.

173
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,960
If we make any mistakes, we'll lose beyond redemption.

174
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,279
But right now,

175
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,799
we have no other choice.

176
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,720
Governor Gongsun...

177
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,399
was right about you.

178
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,840
Before Governor Gongsun went to Chief Commander's Manor,

179
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,720
he knew that he might be trapped.

180
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,330
He ordered me to wait for the right time...

181
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,960
to give this to you.

182
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,090
(Listen to orders carefully.)

183
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,879
I definitely...

184
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,600
won't let Governor Gongsun down.

185
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,639
All right.

186
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,679
What do you want me to do? Tell me.

187
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,159
Elder Qin.

188
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,399
I would like...

189
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,399
very reliable assistant generals working for Governor Gongsun...

190
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
to meet me here.

191
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,799
All right.

192
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,360
But let me tell you something.

193
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,679
I'm not helping you.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,039
I'm helping Governor Gongsun.

195
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,919
Master.

196
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,519
Didn't you want to talk to Elder Qin?

197
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,879
Why is he leaving?

198
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,090
We know what to do now.

199
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,399
What will you do?

200
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,210
Governor Gongsun left a note for me.

201
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,210
What note?

202
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,240
One's heart.

203
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,639
I finally understand what Shen Gu said back then means.

204
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,080
- I'm Guo Ning.
- I'm Zhang Hui.

205
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,320
- Greetings, Chief Registrar.
- Greetings, Chief Registrar.

206
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,679
Greetings, generals. Please rise.

207
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,559
I think the two of you...

208
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,919
already know that Governor Gongsun is in trouble.

209
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,000
Sima Tu intends to open the prefecture vault to negotiate peace.

210
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,159
I asked the two of you to come here today...

211
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,600
to seek your help...

212
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,840
to resolve this matter together.

213
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,480
Just tell me what to do.

214
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,840
As long as we can stop them from opening the city wall...

215
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,279
and get Governor Gongsun back,

216
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,080
we'll surely do everything we can.

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,559
In that case, I won't be shy then.

218
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,360
How many light cavalrymen are there?

219
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
There are 6,000.

220
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
General Zhang Hui and I have 3,000 each.

221
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,279
Then get 1,000 troops...

222
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,200
under General Guo's command.

223
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,639
Split them up in half.

224
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,039
At midnight daily,

225
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,879
ambush Ashina's camp outside the city.

226
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,120
Once they retaliate,

227
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,240
retreat right away.

228
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,840
Don't lose any troops or horses.

229
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,519
Yes.

230
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,320
What about me? What should I do?

231
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
I need you to secretly mobilize a part of the troops...

232
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,679
to go outside the city.

233
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,000
Station in the mountains in the northwest and northeast...

234
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,360
to form a triangular formation with the city's troops.

235
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,480
We only have 30,000 troops in the city.

236
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,039
Guarding the city is already pushing it.

237
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,240
Why do you want to send troops out of the city?

238
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,960
If something unexpected happens on the day of the peace negotiation,

239
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,759
General Zhang Hui's troops...

240
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,080
can pretend to be reinforcements.

241
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,919
When that time comes, we can overwhelm them for a while.

242
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,159
I understand now.

243
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,240
Don't worry, Chief Registrar.

244
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,960
I'll surely make proper arrangements before we open the city's gate.

245
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,120
Thank you, generals.

246
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:33,639
(Broad-minded and knowledgeable)

247
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,720
Master, is a note really powerful enough...

248
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,480
to mobilize thousands of troops?

249
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,639
What mobilized the thousands of troops isn't the note,

250
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,679
but one's heart.

251
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,679
If something goes wrong with this plan,

252
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,320
I'm afraid that even Governor's Manor...

253
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,480
would be doomed.

254
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,120
Without a hitch, there was no egg.

255
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,679
This is the only drastic measure...

256
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,080
I can think of...

257
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,559
to address the situation.

258
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
By the way, Elder Qin,

259
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
can you help me find a hidden place?

260
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,000
Except for you and Xu Feng, no one can find out about it.

261
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,360
All right.

262
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
I'm willing to gamble on Governor Gongsun's judgment.

263
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,399
I hope he's right.

264
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,759
Follow me.

265
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,200
There's a secret room in the manor.

266
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,919
What is your name?

267
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,320
We only ran into each other by chance.

268
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,000
We won't meet again.

269
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,279
Do you think we'll become friends?

270
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,480
Aren't we friends now?

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,039
The grasslands?

272
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,759
I don't know anyone there.

273
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,279
I'd rather not.

274
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,759
You know me.

275
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,639
What's the matter?

276
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,720
Ashina Sun.

277
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,200
Since you came back from Tang,

278
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,919
you turned into a different person.

279
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,159
You're even smiling for no reason.

280
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,440
And you're smiling...

281
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,279
so creepily.

282
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,919
Are you hiding something from me?

283
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,919
It's nothing.

284
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,840
Ashina Sun.

285
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,639
Could it be that you've fallen...

286
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,320
for some lady in Tang?

287
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,759
Thank you, Heavenly Fox God.

288
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,919
Ashina Sun...

289
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,360
finally gets it now.

290
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,759
Don't you have anything better to do?

291
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,399
Don't talk to me about that.

292
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,000
Just tell me if I'm right or wrong.

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're right.

294
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
How boring.

295
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,320
Hurry! Put out the fire!

296
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,360
Water! Hurry! Help put out the fire!

297
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,840
Hurry! Put out the fire!

298
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,039
Put out the fire!

299
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,440
What's going on?

300
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,240
- Your Highness.
- Didn't you say...

301
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
that Gongsun Heng was captured?

302
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,080
- I...
- Why are we being ambushed?

303
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,679
I...

304
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,720
Reporting!

305
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,879
Your Highness, the Tang army burned our provisions.

306
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,360
Did you save them?

307
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,399
Put out the fire if they're burning!

308
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,919
- Why are you reporting this to me?
- Yes.

309
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,440
What's the use of reporting it to me?

310
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Go!

311
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,720
You better get the facts straight.

312
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,080
Otherwise, I'll kill you first,

313
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,600
then I'll massacre Shuozhou City!

314
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,639
Yes.

315
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,279
I'll go and meet Sima Tu now. I'm going now.

316
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
(Shuozhou)

317
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
What did you find out?

318
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,240
The Bear Army's provisions are burning.

319
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,320
They're trying to save them now.

320
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,200
On our side, only a few tents have been burned.

321
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Everyone is fine.

322
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,960
Those who attacked us are like flies.

323
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,000
They're so annoying,

324
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,120
but we can't catch them.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's funny though.

326
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,039
The Bear Army was the one that was hit badly each time...

327
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,320
but they're not being more cautious.

328
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
What are you thinking about?

329
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,039
Gongsun Heng had led the army for decades.

330
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,759
He only defends and doesn't attack.

331
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,120
This is really unusual.

332
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,200
It seems like...

333
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,080
there's another expert in Shuozhou City.

334
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,079
Expert?

335
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,839
This is the legendary passageway?

336
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,170
I can't believe that Governor's Manor has such a thing.

337
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,319
This should be a secret room left...

338
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,559
from the Sui Dynasty period.

339
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,519
Not bad.

340
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Dou.

341
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,759
Remember everything that I'll be saying now.

342
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,799
Starting now,

343
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,890
you can't disclose...

344
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,279
everything you hear...

345
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
or see here.

346
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,279
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

347
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,920
Even if I don't quite understand it,

348
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,170
since you're someone destined for great things,

349
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,759
I'll do as you say.

350
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,680
Little Chief.

351
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,890
What happened? Are there any casualties?

352
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,759
Not a single soldier was injured.

353
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,920
According to the plan, we ambushed them after lights out, then ran.

354
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,759
These repeated ambushes...

355
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,920
caused them great turmoil and made them unable to sleep.

356
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,599
At this rate,

357
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,200
we'll annoy the hell out of them.

358
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,319
We've achieved our objective.

359
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,890
We need a new approach.

360
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,480
What is it?

361
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,200
It's just that this approach...

362
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,839
will be hard on you, Xu Feng.

363
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,279
Chief.

364
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,960
Didn't I tell you not to come?

365
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,039
Why are you...

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,759
Tu Ka She sent me here to ask you something.

367
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,079
What exactly are you planning to do?

368
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,119
If you've changed your mind,

369
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,000
and you won't open the city and surrender anymore,

370
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,170
I can tell His Highness.

371
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,650
Then please bear...

372
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,519
the consequences yourself.

373
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,119
We're still making an inventory of the Shuozhou vault.

374
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,720
Within two days, we'll provide the Declaration of Surrender.

375
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,960
Why would His Highness say that?

376
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,319
Our camp is being ambushed...

377
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,119
by Shuozhou's garrison each night.

378
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,559
The entire camp can't sleep peacefully...

379
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,960
and are in a terrible fix.

380
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,559
Is this the sincerity...

381
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,559
of your peace negotiation?

382
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,200
How did that happen?

383
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,480
You're in charge of the four prefecture's troops.

384
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,359
Gongsun Heng is in your hands now.

385
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,170
If you say that you don't know anything about it,

386
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,079
why would I believe you?

387
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,319
Gongsun Heng is in my prison.

388
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,599
He can't escape.

389
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,720
It's definitely...

390
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,279
It's definitely impossible for him to instruct them.

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
My brother.

392
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,519
A few days ago,

393
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,119
I heard that Gongsun Heng's command token...

394
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,240
was stolen.

395
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,039
Now, it seems like the thief...

396
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,720
is the one pulling tricks secretly.

397
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,480
In the past few days,

398
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,279
my men have been guarding...

399
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,720
those in Governor's Manor very closely.

400
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,680
The whole family is there.

401
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,200
I'll send Wang Li now...

402
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,890
to perform a city-wide search.

403
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,680
Even if they have to dig three feet under the ground,

404
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,890
we'll find him.

405
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,440
In that case,

406
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,200
I have one more favor to ask of you.

407
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,319
I already know where that thief is.

408
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,480
It seems like someone has been watching...

409
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,839
Chief Commander's Manor all along.

410
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,799
Didn't you notice, my brother?

411
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,720
Did Gongsun Heng ask you to do this?

412
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,799
I knew that Gongsun Heng...

413
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,359
has always had evil intentions.

414
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,720
He's up to no good.

415
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,440
Come.

416
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,720
Take him away.

417
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Sima Tu.

418
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,319
Leave him to me.

419
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,000
I'll make sure...

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,960
that he'll be in utter misery.

421
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,799
To the torture chamber.

422
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,519
All right.

423
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,200
You can't die.

424
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,759
But if you want to live,

425
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,799
it's not that easy.

426
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,799
You...

427
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,640
You traitor.

428
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,200
You won't tell me then.

429
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,599
Are you sure...

430
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,240
that you'll only bring that many people for tomorrow?

431
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,839
The eastern side of Shuozhou's mountains is dangerously steep...

432
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,839
and it's full of swamps.

433
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,519
No ambush has ever occurred there.

434
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,119
Because of this geographical advantage,

435
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,720
Gongsun Heng never guarded it much.

436
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Those people...

437
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
are enough.

438
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,480
The scout reported earlier...

439
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,960
that the Eagle Army's Central Plains military strategist...

440
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,960
went to Shuozhou again tonight.

441
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,119
I'm afraid...

442
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,400
that tomorrow's acceptance of surrender is fake,

443
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,960
and they'd attack the city instead.

444
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,319
If that's what Tu Ka She is planning,

445
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,039
he could work well with us.

446
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,839
But Chief Registrar Li in Shuozhou...

447
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,200
will surely not just sit and await doom.

448
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,920
I don't know if Tu Ka She...

449
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,319
can handle him.

450
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,759
Chief Registrar Li?

451
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,960
I've already checked.

452
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
He's the new chief registrar in Shuozhou.

453
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,079
He came from another province.

454
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,319
He has only been in the position for a short time.

455
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
Xu Feng.

456
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
I'm incompetent.

457
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,359
You were exposed?

458
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,160
They noticed me.

459
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,240
I fought with them for so long before I was finally able to escape.

460
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,799
I circled around for many hours.

461
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm sure no one followed me.

462
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Forget it.

463
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,160
Go and treat your wounds.

464
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,559
Don't show yourself for a while.

465
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
I'll tell you!

466
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,039
That's right.

467
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
I know where Chief Registrar Li is.

468
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,160
I can take you to him.

469
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I know...

470
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,240
where they're hiding.

471
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,559
I won't run away.

472
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,640
All right.

473
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,960
If you capture Chief Registrar Li,

474
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,799
I'll reward you greatly.

475
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,759
If you run away,

476
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,599
you should know the consequences.

477
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
This is Chief Registrar Li?

478
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,160
That's right.

479
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,279
A wise man submits to the circumstances.

480
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,160
Kill him.

481
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,720
Kill him.

482
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,160
I didn't expect you...

483
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,680
to be so ruthless.

484
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Good.

485
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,519
I like it.

486
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,480
Bury him.

487
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,880
Congratulations, Yi Bu Khan.

488
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,960
I've already ordered someone to kill that chief registrar.

489
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,200
It's my emeritus certificate. It's all ready.

490
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,079
The entire Shuozhou is ours.

491
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,400
Do you need these?

492
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,680
I'll decide for His Highness.

493
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,720
You can have these.

494
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,759
Thank you, Minister.

495
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,240
Thank you to His Highness.

496
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Come on.

497
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,960
The military strategist said...

498
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,559
that they already had killed Chief Registrar Li.

499
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,240
The gift list in the Declaration of Surrender...

500
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,359
is prepared as well.

501
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,920
What's the actual name of Chief Registrar Li?

502
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm not sure what his actual name is.

503
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,960
Isn't Shi Si Lang's surname Li too?

504
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,519
In this world, there are so many people with the same last names.

505
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,319
I don't think it's Shi Si Lang.

506
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,279
Command a team to follow Tu Ka She tomorrow.

507
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Don't let him die directly.

508
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,839
Yes.

509
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,759
(Shuozhou)

510
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,240
Army Chief Sima Tu...

511
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,240
opens the city and offers the Declaration of Surrender...

512
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,759
on behalf of Governor Gongsun Heng.

513
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,759
We hope that the Ashina Tribe's prince...

514
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,240
can spare the lives of our citizens...

515
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,680
based on your merciful nature.

516
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,559
The citizens...

517
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,799
thank you for your kindness.

518
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,200
Bring it forward.

519
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,799
These are the offerings of money, valuables, and provisions...

520
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,160
for your army.

521
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,720
Please take a look.

522
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,119
All right.

523
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,960
How can this happen?

524
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,079
I can't believe he didn't die.

525
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,400
Will you surrender or not?

526
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,559
What does this mean?

527
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,519
Did you set me up?

528
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,079
Let me explain.

529
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,359
You don't know what's good for you.

530
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,400
No!

531
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
If you move,

532
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,599
I'll kill you.

533
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,599
This is bad.

534
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,680
There's a coup d'état in the city.

535
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,119
Warriors!

536
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,160
The Tang army wronged us first. You can't blame us!

537
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,240
Come on.

538
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Attack!

539
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:03,000
- Kill!
- Kill!

540
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,640
Kill!

541
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,079
- Kill!
- Kill!

542
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,559
- Kill!
- Kill!

543
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Release the arrows!

544
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,519
Signal using the flag.

545
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,920
Send 5,000 troops...

546
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,880
to make them retreat to the riverbank.

547
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,640
Your Highness.

548
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,640
Gongsun Heng's Chief Registrar is commanding the battle.

549
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,000
They've set up an ambush.

550
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,119
We don't have enough people.

551
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,359
Why don't we retreat to the riverbank first...

552
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,720
and assemble with the army?

553
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Didn't you say that Gongsun Heng has been captured...

554
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,359
and his military strategist is dead?

555
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,400
I...

556
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,640
Cease the attack!

557
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,279
Retreat!

558
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,799
If you don't know the strategic plans of other states,

559
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,000
you can't get their recognition and be their friend.

560
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,559
If you're not familiar with the dangers of the forest...

561
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,680
and its terrain,

562
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,920
you can't march your troops properly.

563
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,240
Next,

564
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,359
it's up to you, General Guo.

565
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,759
Yes.

566
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,119
Army Chief died in battle.

567
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,880
The army can't be without a general.

568
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,400
The highest official...

569
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,119
in Shuozhou should replace him.

570
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,119
Yes.

571
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,599
I'll go get Master.

572
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,960
Sima Jian was right.

573
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,880
The shallow water in July is perfect for us to march on.

574
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,880
My brothers, stay close.

575
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,119
When we get into Shuozhou City,

576
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,799
that place is ours!

577
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,920
You can do whatever you want!

578
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
- Charge!
- Charge!

579
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,559
- Go!
- Go!

580
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,119
Stop.

581
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,599
Minister, help! The Tang army set up an ambush.

582
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,799
They're pursuing us!

583
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Your Highness.

584
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,200
Remind me.

585
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,720
Take Shuozhou City...

586
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,920
leave Chief Registrar Li to me.

587
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
I'll kill him with my own hands!

588
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,079
Your Highness.

589
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,400
They stopped attacking.

590
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,599
Why did you stop chasing us?

591
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,680
Come here!

592
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,920
- Come here!
- Come on!

593
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,519
- Come here!
- Come on!

594
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,200
- Come here!
- Come on!

595
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,599
Retreat!

596
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,000
Retreat quickly!

597
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,769
(Prefectural Governor's Manor)

598
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,000
This is all thanks to Chief Registrar Li.

599
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,289
If it weren't for him,

600
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,840
I'm afraid that Shuozhou would be in danger.

601
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,159
Chief Registrar Li is a clever man.

602
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,519
He used the Bear Army to kill Sima Tu.

603
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,599
But I have a question.

604
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,360
How did you know...

605
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,769
that the Bear Army will attack the city?

606
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,440
Sima Tu is a coward.

607
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,400
This time, in negotiating peace with the Ashina Tribe,

608
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,920
he was opening the door to a dangerous foe...

609
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,400
and asking someone to act against his own interests.

610
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,809
Ashina Tribe doesn't only want...

611
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,159
to plunder resources.

612
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,400
They want to use this peace negotiation...

613
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:08,769
to attack the city...

614
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:10,480
to fulfill their ambition.

615
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,679
I just went with the flow...

616
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,920
and used them to kill him.

617
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,719
I see.

618
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,440
Xu Feng deserves a lot of credit...

619
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,599
for our success this time too.

620
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,329
If Xu Feng didn't work with me...

621
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:22,639
to put on an act,

622
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,360
I'm afraid that we couldn't have fooled Sima Tu so easily.

623
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,880
It's just a bit of physical torture.

624
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,039
Even if it means risking my life for Master,

625
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,289
I would do it.

626
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,719
We've been following Master for so many years.

627
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:36,000
We should be loyal.

628
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,719
Yet you just came to Shuozhou for a short time,

629
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,480
and you've disregarded your own safety.

630
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:40,809
I really admire you.

631
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:45,519
However, I still have one question.

632
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,719
If I stab you a little deeper,

633
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,599
I'm afraid it will go through the blood pack and into your heart.

634
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:54,159
Why do you trust me so much?

635
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,639
I trust...

636
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,519
your loyalty to Governor Gongsun.

637
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,639
Well said.

638
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,159
I'm so lucky...

639
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,960
to have loyal people like you guys...

640
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
around me.

641
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,559
Commandant Li, I must thank you too.

642
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,400
Elder Qin, what did you call me?

643
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,639
Commandant of Light Chariots, Li Shi Si.

644
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:32,719
You filled up the dam upstream,

645
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,719
then released it to flood the enemy.

646
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,360
Commandant Li.

647
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,960
Your plan was great.

648
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,809
Shuozhou City was safe...

649
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,639
from being handed over...

650
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,809
because of your great contribution.

651
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,400
Please accept...

652
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,440
my bow on behalf of the people in the city.

653
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,519
Governor Gongsun.

654
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,639
Governor Gongsun, I can't accept this.

655
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,440
I still let you down.

656
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,199
They were able to save Tu Ka She.

657
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,679
Come on, rise.

658
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,039
Rise, all of you.

659
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:12,599
This time, I think the Bear Army was fully dispatched.

660
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,440
But I don't know if...

661
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,599
You're afraid that the Eagle Army will come too?

662
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Eagle Army?

663
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,440
The Eagle Army is Ashina Tribe's strongest military force.

664
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,400
They're not as incompetent as Tu Ka She's men.

665
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,199
If the enemy...

666
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,360
still has enough strength to attack,

667
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,769
and the river is flooded so they can't cross it.

668
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,440
The southeastern side is filled with mountains.

669
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,519
Besides, swamps are everywhere outside the east gate.

670
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:42,360
Even the citizens of Shuozhou go around them.

671
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:43,809
In that case,

672
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,599
the garrison outside the east gate...

673
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,039
should be transferred west of the city.

674
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,679
All right.

675
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,400
Listen carefully, everyone.

676
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,199
Let's do as Commandant Li said.

677
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

678
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,679
Your Highness.

679
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,329
The Tang army is very cunning.

680
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,440
They set a trap...

681
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:35,239
and even used you to kill my brother.

682
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,639
Because of this,

683
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,559
Gongsun Heng's Chief Register and I...

684
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,809
are absolutely irreconcilable!

685
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
What's the matter?

686
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,289
Do you feel bad that I killed Sima Tu?

687
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,960
No.

688
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,079
My brother was ineffective.

689
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,880
As the army chief,

690
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,809
he couldn't even control a governor.

691
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,039
He deserved to die.

692
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,199
I'm loyal to you.

693
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,519
Heaven and earth can attest to that.

694
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,719
Even though Sima Tu is dead,

695
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,239
I can still provide...

696
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,000
Shuozhou's information to you.

697
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,440
Please give me...

698
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,559
one more chance.

699
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:26,769
Remember.

700
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,329
I can take your life anytime.

701
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:30,360
Yes.

702
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,960
I will never...

703
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,719
let Chief Registrar Li get away again.

704
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,289
Reporting!

705
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,039
Your Highness. Earlier, Ashina Sun gathered...

706
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:39,440
the Eagle Army and left all of a sudden.

707
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,559
I don't know where he went.

708
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,289
Come.

709
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,440
Everyone.

710
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,289
Today,

711
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:55,840
let me tell you a story.

712
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,329
I saw it with my own eyes back then.

713
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,809
Chief Registrar Li...

714
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:02,079
did a somersault...

715
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,199
and shot that heavy arrow...

716
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,920
weighing 100kg.

717
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,559
He accurately avoided our warriors.

718
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,599
Without veering...

719
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,289
to the left or right,

720
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:15,199
he hit that peace agreement...

721
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,480
held by that man from the Ashina Tribe.

722
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,519
- Great!
- Amazing!

723
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,440
You can't call him Chief Registrar Li anymore.

724
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Governor Gongsun has already posted an announcement.

725
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,559
He has already been promoted...

726
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,920
- to Commandant of Light Chariots.
- Yes.

727
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,960
- Yes.
- You're right.

728
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,679
Commandant Li is so young and capable.

729
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,920
He became Governor Gongsun's assistant.

730
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,289
- Shuozhou is so fortunate.
- Yes.

731
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,769
(Prefectural Governor's Manor)

732
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,079
I didn't expect that in just a few days,

733
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,440
you can already share my husband's burdens...

734
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,599
and defeat the enemy.

735
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,960
I'm so lucky.

736
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:57,039
Using tea instead of wine, I'll make a toast to you.

737
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,809
You're exaggerating, Madam.

738
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,039
I'm the lucky one...

739
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,440
because I'm able to be stationed in Shuozhou...

740
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,679
with Governor Gongsun.

741
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,960
Look at how skinny you are.

742
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:14,360
The north is cold. You need to dress warmly.

743
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,639
Later, I'll look for suitable fabrics...

744
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,239
and make more clothes for you.

745
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,159
Madam, you're so good to me.

746
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,199
I'm very touched.

747
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,159
That's a token of my wife's gratitude.

748
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,440
I think you should stop being so shy.

749
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,719
If you don't mind,

750
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,639
this will be your home from now on.

751
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,039
Thank you, Governor Gongsun.

752
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Thank you, Madam.

753
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,039
Ever since...

754
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,960
my mother passed away,

755
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,079
this is the first time that I've felt such kindness.

756
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,840
Madam, I want one too.

757
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,880
Fine, I'll make them for you both.

758
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,400
Make him more clothes.

759
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,159
Let's eat.

760
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,239
- The food's getting cold.
- Yes.

761
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,329
Governor Gongsun!

762
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,769
The food storage is on fire.

763
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:04,960
It's already reduced to ashes.

764
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
What?

765
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,840
It's the Eagle Army.

766
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,239
Any casualties?

767
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,519
The fire is spreading fast.

768
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,599
Imperial Guard Xu already led us in putting out the fire.

769
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,289
The citizens nearby weren't affected.

770
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,519
Xu Feng did well.

771
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:29,159
- You may go.
- Yes.

772
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,519
Governor Gongsun.

773
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:32,719
Is the Eagle Army...

774
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,960
the elite force you've been worried about before?

775
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,119
They're finally here.

776
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:40,119
I just didn't expect them to come so soon.

777
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,079
Master.

778
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:43,480
In the swamp by the east gate,

779
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,960
we found these Paulownia wooden boards.

780
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,039
The Eagle Army's cavalry is very fast.

781
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,039
Together with the Paulownia tree's buoyancy,

782
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,440
I'm afraid that they've already crossed the marsh.

783
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,000
Governor Gongsun.

784
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,360
This is all because of my negligence.

785
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,920
Because of our geographical advantage,

786
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,559
I moved the men from the east to the west.

787
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,809
I'm willing to redeem myself.

788
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:02,880
Please send me to the east to face the enemy.

789
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,400
That's enough.
