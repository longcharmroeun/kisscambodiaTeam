00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,079
(The Long Ballad)

3
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,280
(This is a work of fiction.)

4
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,239
(Episode 7)

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
I didn't come here to seek protection.

6
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,359
I'm here to help you.

7
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,000
You mean...

8
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,480
Li Shi Min is currently surrounded by enemies.

9
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,079
He'll definitely split up the troops...

10
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,920
and station them everywhere to be sure.

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,840
Youzhou's army...

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,239
can also split up into two groups...

13
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,319
and take them by surprise...

14
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,200
in the south of Linpu Town and Jiangzhou,

15
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,159
then go west into Tongguan County.

16
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,120
When the time comes, the two armies can collaborate.

17
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,879
In a short time, we will win.

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,439
You mean...

19
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,810
You're extraordinary indeed.

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,840
There are indeed no cowards in the Li family.

21
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,840
Your Highness.

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,000
You came from the capital.

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,039
Do you know His Majesty's condition?

24
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,680
And what were Crown Prince's instructions?

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,039
That's the reason why I came here.

26
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,439
Before my father died, he gave me a decree.

27
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,400
Li Yuan, Prince of Lujiang, receive your orders.

28
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,090
This is the decree.

29
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,319
"Prince of Qin, Li Shi Min..."

30
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,439
"has committed treason and rose up in rebellion,"

31
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,680
"terrorizing the capital and endangering the nation."

32
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,199
"Youzhou's governor, Prince of Lujiang, Li Yuan,"

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,759
"must lead troops, go to the capital,"

34
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,800
"and kill the traitor..."

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,319
"to help the nation and make things right."

36
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,639
"Carry out this decree upon receipt."

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
I, Li Yuan, shall obey the decree.

38
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,680
This decree has resolved Youzhou's emergency indeed.

39
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,719
In rushing to prepare supplies for the troops,

40
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,960
we were afraid that after mobilizing them,

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
we couldn't sustain them.

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,199
With this decree,

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,599
Crown Prince's former subordinates will surely help out.

44
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,080
Governor, Chang'an's envoy has arrived.

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,439
He's waiting in the front hall.

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,759
Li Shi Min's envoy arrived so quickly.

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,639
Uncle Li Yuan, in my opinion,

48
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,560
it's better not to meet the envoy.

49
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,360
Your Highness, don't worry.

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,360
We've already come up with a plan,

51
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,919
and we have the decree.

52
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,919
We surely won't fail Crown Prince's orders.

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,199
Since the traitor's envoy came here himself,

54
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,159
why don't we take this opportunity to capture him...

55
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,520
and show our desire to fight him?

56
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,000
(In good times and in bad)

57
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,279
By Crown Prince Jian Cheng's decree,

58
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,399
capture the traitor.

59
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,240
Wang Jun Kuo, you're passing on a fake decree.

60
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,480
How should you be punished?

61
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,000
Kill him on the spot. Kill him!

62
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Wait.

63
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,079
Wei Shu Yu.

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Chang Ge.

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,120
Why are you here?

66
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,120
Are you not even embarrassed to ask me that?

67
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,360
Let me explain.

68
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,519
What can you explain?

69
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,680
If you surrender now,

70
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,759
I can let you live.

71
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,240
Chang Ge, you're crazy.

72
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,879
Do you know what you're doing?

73
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,439
You're aiding and abetting a rebellion.

74
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,360
That's because I'm not as lucky as you...

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,199
who has a choice...

76
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,040
and can follow another master.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,639
Right now,

78
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,519
I'm a slice meat on the chopping block.

79
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,279
Do you expect me...

80
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,120
to just watch Youzhou experience what happened in the East Palace?

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,480
Chang Ge, listen to me.

82
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,839
Crown Prince is kind.

83
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,560
He sent me to Youzhou this time...

84
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,519
to let Prince of Lujiang feel at ease.

85
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,959
We have a misunderstanding.

86
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,040
A misunderstanding?

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
Cut the crap.

88
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,079
- Capture him.
- Yes!

89
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,959
Put down your sword.

90
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,639
I'll say it again.

91
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,879
Put down your sword and you'll be spared.

92
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,639
Your Highness.

93
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,600
What we discussed today...

94
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,560
requires human sacrifice.

95
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,720
General Wang.

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,279
Do you know Crown Prince's assistant, Wei Zheng?

97
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,480
Wei Zheng is a great assistant of East Palace.

98
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,079
He is the son of Wei Zheng.

99
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,920
If we kill him,

100
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm afraid that the East Palace officials would feel disappointed.

101
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,000
I've long heard that Assistant Wei...

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,120
is very loyal to Crown Prince.

103
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,959
I can't believe that his son is such a coward.

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,839
You traitor.

105
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,319
Who are you to talk about my father?

106
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,360
You...

107
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,800
Envoy, you're mistaken in believing Prince of Qin.

108
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,120
Heaven and earth can attest to my loyalty to Tang.

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Crown Prince Jian Cheng left a decree before he died.

110
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,399
We're just obeying his decree to kill the traitor.

111
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,360
- Chang Ge.
- Guards.

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,040
Take him into the dungeon and keep a close eye on him.

113
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,680
Chang Ge, you...

114
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,079
Come on.

115
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,360
Let's go. Hurry up.

116
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,920
Yongning.

117
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,600
The envoy may have been captured,

118
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,759
but after a while,

119
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,240
those in Chang'an can't help but be suspicious.

120
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,920
Besides, if news of you being in Youzhou leaks out,

121
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,079
it'll be very unfavorable to our future plans.

122
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,759
In my opinion,

123
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,680
why don't you stay at my place and recuperate for a few days?

124
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,759
There's no need, Uncle Li Yuan.

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
I have a place to stay.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,480
I'll see you first thing tomorrow morning.

127
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,319
You're new to Youzhou.

128
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,600
You're not familiar with the place.

129
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,240
Moreover,

130
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,920
if Youzhou's spies follow you,

131
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,279
it'll be very troublesome.

132
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,399
Here's what we'll do.

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,079
I'll send a team to protect you secretly, all right?

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,079
Uncle Li Yuan.

135
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,399
Since I can come here all the way from Chang'an,

136
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,160
I can take care of myself.

137
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
I'll get going.

138
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,450
Jun Kuo.

139
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,799
I saw Chang'an's envoy go inside.

140
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,450
I can't believe that Shi Si Lang wasn't captured.

141
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,090
She's wounded.

142
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,879
It's a bit fishy for her to be wounded now.

143
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,279
Come on.

144
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,799
Over there.

145
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,399
Why are the staff from governor's manor following Shi Si Lang?

146
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,399
This is getting more interesting.

147
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,480
Shi Si Lang.

148
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,480
Who exactly are you?

149
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,120
(Crown Prince's seal)

150
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,480
Governor.

151
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,440
(Crown Prince's seal)

152
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,919
Governor.

153
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,279
Is there a problem...

154
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,879
with this decree?

155
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,960
(Crown Prince's seal)

156
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,200
(Crown Prince's seal)

157
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,519
You two, go out of the city now.

158
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,720
Go to the thatched hut outside the city and put on a white cloth.

159
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,960
Remember.

160
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,200
Don't let anyone find out.

161
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,720
Wait for the important guest from the north to contact you.

162
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,799
- Yes.
- Yes.

163
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,799
Master, you're back.

164
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,639
Master, why are you wounded?

165
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,879
Master.

166
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,679
Master.

167
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,120
Why are you wounded so badly?

168
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,039
I'm fine.

169
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,720
Dou.

170
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,399
I was being followed just now.

171
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,440
Master, who was following you?

172
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,240
I don't know.

173
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,879
I think it's my uncle's men.

174
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,200
But I can't do things according to my instincts now.

175
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,519
Because the only one I can count on now...

176
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,279
is my uncle.

177
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,919
Master, you have me.

178
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,039
She knows military strategy.

179
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,080
She's good at coming up with a plan.

180
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,159
If I don't need to fill out my name, I won't come out.

181
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,440
How about this?

182
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,879
Caravans have a lot of carriages and goods.

183
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,039
They won't search everything.

184
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,000
Just give me a place to hide.

185
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,320
She's not afraid of dying.

186
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't believe such an amazing woman exists in this world.

187
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,759
Wei Shu Yu.

188
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,080
You're indeed the princess's good friend.

189
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,200
You guessed that she'd pass by this place so easily.

190
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,759
Who is it?

191
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,559
What is it?

192
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,399
Did you cry?

193
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,679
No.

194
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,879
Men can cry too.

195
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,360
Don't be embarrassed.

196
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,360
I was never a crybaby since I was little.

197
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,360
I bleed, but I don't cry.

198
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,480
Stop acting tough.

199
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,200
Everyone gets upset.

200
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,600
If there's nothing else,

201
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm going back to sleep.

202
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm feeling down.

203
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,840
I wonder if you...

204
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,720
can take a walk with me.

205
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,360
Now?

206
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
There's a curfew.

207
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:30,960
That's strange.

208
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,639
So someone like you...

209
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,120
is afraid of curfews.

210
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,559
Where are we going?

211
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,320
What's the matter?

212
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,559
Are you afraid that I'll sell you off?

213
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm afraid you don't have that capability.

214
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,840
Why did you bring me there?

215
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,000
This place is far from worrisome things...

216
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,919
and closer to the moon.

217
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,559
Instead of getting close to the moon,

218
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,679
I think I'm closer to a troublesome man like you.

219
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,679
Is that a bad thing?

220
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,919
It's getting colder.

221
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,799
What's the matter?

222
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,679
Do you want me to give you my robe?

223
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,679
Do you feel better?

224
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,919
I feel much better.

225
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,759
So...

226
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,879
what exactly happened?

227
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Let me think.

228
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,799
If it makes a man like you so sad,

229
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,679
it must be because...

230
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,440
your marriage proposal got turned down...

231
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,320
and the girl you love ran off with someone.

232
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,799
What a bunch of nonsense.

233
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,159
I just met an old friend.

234
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,440
No.

235
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,839
We're not friends anymore.

236
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,839
A friend?

237
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,599
What kind of friend?

238
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,960
Why aren't you friends anymore?

239
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,960
We grew up together.

240
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,480
We studied and practiced martial arts together.

241
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,039
I thought that we'd be the same our whole lives.

242
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,079
But later on...

243
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,920
Later on,

244
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,839
perhaps you'll reconcile.

245
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,279
That's impossible.

246
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,720
In the future,

247
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,720
I don't think I'll have a friend like that again.

248
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,799
That's natural.

249
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,960
"Natural"?

250
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,890
Someone told me that...

251
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,599
some people are soft like water.

252
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,410
They tolerate everything.

253
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,519
And some people are like fire.

254
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,240
They'll only burn more and more.

255
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,279
Those who go near him will get burned.

256
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,240
If we force ourselves to be with them,

257
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,079
we'll only turn into ashes.

258
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,890
Who told you that?

259
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
Your friend?

260
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,650
My...

261
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,440
My foster father.

262
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,559
After he told me that,

263
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,890
my best friend and I parted ways...

264
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,440
and became enemies.

265
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,119
I'm probably the fire type of person too.

266
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,720
Do you think we'll become friends?

267
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,599
Aren't we friends now?

268
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,440
Qin Zhun.

269
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,039
Thank you.

270
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,319
Don't mention it.

271
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,440
You brought me here in the middle of the night.

272
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,279
You even tried to advise me.

273
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,079
I should thank you indeed.

274
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Shi Si Lang.

275
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,890
You can't stay in Youzhou for long.

276
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,359
Leave as soon as possible.

277
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,650
Why are you suddenly saying that?

278
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,759
Did you hear any news?

279
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,650
There's some movement in Youzhou's army.

280
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,119
Chang'an wasn't peaceful before either.

281
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,240
There are a lot of checkpoints here.

282
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,650
I'm afraid we'll get dragged by the disturbance here.

283
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,759
Qin Zhun.

284
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,319
You don't believe that I can protect myself?

285
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,680
I...

286
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,200
You should mind your own business.

287
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:29,759
Since you know that it's dangerous in Youzhou now,

288
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,960
after you're done with your business,

289
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
leave this place.

290
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,119
All right.

291
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,559
You should go.

292
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,960
It's almost dawn.

293
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,039
I miss my father.

294
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,759
When can we go back to Chang'an?

295
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,680
Please rest, Your Highness.

296
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,440
- I'll get going.
- Don't go.

297
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,599
I don't want to rest.

298
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:42,960
Just...

299
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,650
stay here.

300
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,039
Hey.

301
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,720
Why are you so quiet?

302
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,410
Your Highness told me to stay,

303
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,559
so I'm staying put here.

304
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,519
You look so serious.

305
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,279
It's quite funny.

306
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,410
It's getting late. We're alone here.

307
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,480
It's really inconvenient for me to stay here.

308
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,599
- I'll get going.
- Don't go.

309
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,200
Are you not following my orders anymore?

310
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Look.

311
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
I embroidered this bunny.

312
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,039
Other bunny embroideries...

313
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,640
have red eyes.

314
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,720
Mine has green eyes.

315
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,480
Because the grass is all a bunny sees.

316
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,440
That is a place with freedom.

317
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,880
I also want to be free.

318
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,720
Why are you so rude?

319
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,319
Are you always this cold?

320
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,039
Are you also the same as your godfather?

321
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,160
I don't think I've ever seen you smile.

322
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,359
Do you know how to smile?

323
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,279
Hao Du.

324
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm talking to you.

325
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,440
Are you deaf?

326
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,839
I feel so bad for myself.

327
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Chang Ge is still missing.

328
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,319
And my father...

329
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,039
is sending me to the prairies for intermarriage.

330
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,799
And now,

331
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,519
you ridiculously brought me here.

332
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
I have no one to talk to.

333
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,920
I've never spent the night outside alone.

334
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,440
I miss my father.

335
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,599
I want to go home.

336
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,319
What are you doing?

337
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Let...

338
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Let go of me!

339
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,079
Put me down!

340
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Hao Du!

341
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,440
Good night, Your Highness.

342
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,559
I'll just sit here.

343
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,559
I won't leave.

344
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,880
Shi Si Lang, get some rest.

345
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,359
You too.

346
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Your Highness.

347
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,759
Why are you here?

348
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,720
I've been waiting for you all night.

349
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,960
Since you're not back yet, I came out to take a look.

350
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,880
What's the matter?

351
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,079
Did you have a date with that East Palace guy?

352
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Get down to business.

353
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,000
Wang Jun Kuo sent someone today to give this submission letter.

354
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Go back first.

355
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,400
I have something to take care of.

356
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,960
Wait. He already went back to his room. You...

357
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,079
How long are you going to hide?

358
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,559
Come out.

359
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,400
When did you arrive?

360
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,759
Today.

361
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,839
Is he here?

362
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,799
Lead the way.

363
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,000
(Outstanding beauty)

364
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,640
Sir.

365
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,319
It has been a while since you came here.

366
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,279
Come here, pretty girl.

367
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,680
Come on. Let's drink more in your room.

368
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,319
- Give me a kiss.
- You're so bad.

369
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,160
Your Highness.

370
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,559
He's here.

371
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,440
Sir, does this feel good?

372
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,640
Why are you here?

373
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,839
What do you think I came here for?

374
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,200
Do you want to try it?

375
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,839
I've never seen you with any girl all these years.

376
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,680
If you don't like it,

377
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,799
did you come here to watch us?

378
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Hey!

379
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,599
Since I was little, I've hated your arrogance.

380
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,359
Leave.

381
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,400
Why exactly did you come here?

382
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,400
The reason why you're here is the reason why I'm here.

383
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,960
How did you know where I'm staying?

384
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,920
As usual,

385
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,319
you won't stay too close or too far from the governor's manor.

386
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,559
And you won't stay in a fancy and high-profile place.

387
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,880
That only leaves...

388
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,279
a few options.

389
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,480
You're finally using your brain.

390
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,160
I can also make you leave.

391
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,799
(To my son Ashina Sun, I hope you settle matters in Youzhou...)

392
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,880
(and go to Shuozhou.)

393
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,160
My father is transferring me to Shuozhou?

394
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,079
My father is mobilizing troops?

395
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,079
Just be a good dog.

396
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,319
Don't ask questions you shouldn't be asking.

397
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,400
Remember.

398
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,960
You go, but the horses stay.

399
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,960
You know a lot of things.

400
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,039
We grew up together.

401
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,640
Can you hide things from me?

402
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,200
Those warhorses are mine.

403
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,519
But you agreed to the condition.

404
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,200
Then I should complete it.

405
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,200
You don't have that right anymore.

406
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,960
Eagle Army's special assistant, Ashina Sun,

407
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,599
shall obey Great Khan's orders.

408
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,240
This is Youzhou's submission letter.

409
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,799
It's for my father.

410
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,279
I can't believe you haven't opened it yet.

411
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
It's just a dog wagging its tail.

412
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,039
There's nothing to see.

413
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,240
It looks good when you do it.

414
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,039
All these years,

415
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,720
you're still the ugliest dog.

416
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,279
All you do is steal bones that others are already chewing.

417
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,519
You don't understand.

418
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,559
It's more fun to steal someone else's.

419
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,160
Stealing yours...

420
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,359
is even more fun.

421
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,799
Wang Jun Kuo...

422
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,279
is becoming more interesting.

423
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,480
I want to see...

424
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,480
if he's really that capable.

425
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,359
Master.

426
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,880
You've been pacing around since morning.

427
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,000
Do you feel uneasy about your uncle?

428
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,279
I don't know.

429
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,559
Since the people I trusted the most betrayed me,

430
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,680
I became guarded against people.

431
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,359
But we have no other choice now.

432
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,480
Other than using my uncle's power...

433
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,200
and moving to the governor's manor,

434
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,160
there's no better way.

435
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,599
But no one can find out about this.

436
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,079
Otherwise,

437
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,279
if something goes wrong on my uncle's side,

438
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,799
the consequences would be unimaginable.

439
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,920
Master.

440
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,119
Let's not move into the governor's manor first.

441
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,519
The wooden shed is nice too.

442
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,279
Even if we don't move to the governor's manor,

443
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,440
my uncle will find out that we're staying here sooner or later.

444
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,720
It's just no one...

445
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,799
can find out about this.

446
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,519
Master.

447
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,480
Why don't you give it to me first?

448
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Let's live separately first.

449
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,359
Once you fully trust your uncle,

450
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,640
I'll return it to you.

451
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,799
Master, you trust me, don't you?

452
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,599
Of course I trust you.

453
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,200
However,

454
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,039
I feel anxious and suspicious about everything.

455
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,839
I think it's right...

456
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,839
to be cautious at a time like this.

457
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,880
Don't place the eggs in one basket.

458
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,119
You've become smart.

459
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,279
All right.

460
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,480
I'll leave it with you then.

461
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,720
Remember.

462
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,880
Nothing can happen to it.

463
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,119
As long as you're alive, you must have it.

464
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,680
Don't worry, Master.

465
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,480
This is considered a part of me.

466
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,039
I can bleed, but I can't lose it.

467
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,599
I must go to the governor's manor.

468
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,319
Stay here.

469
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,480
Sir, these are our guest's horses.

470
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,839
What should I say if you take it away?

471
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,839
Do you have a death wish?

472
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,440
Sir, these are our guest's horses.

473
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,720
Sir, you can't take it.

474
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,960
If you take it, what am I going to tell my customer?

475
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Sir.

476
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,480
Sir.

477
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,880
What's going on? What happened?

478
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,519
I don't know either.

479
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,519
The horses belong to our guest.

480
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,160
The guest left early in the morning.

481
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,880
When he comes back later...

482
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,680
Wait.

483
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,039
These aren't your horses.

484
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,839
They belong to us now.

485
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,039
Why should I believe that they belong to you now?

486
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,160
Why should I make you believe it?

487
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,200
These are our horses.

488
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Otherwise,

489
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,039
how can they run away like that?

490
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,960
Don't delay us. Scram.

491
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,640
What exactly happened to Qin Zhun?

492
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Forget it. I won't interfere.

493
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,759
I'll go to my uncle first.

494
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,119
Be ready to receive orders at any time.

495
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,680
I've already made arrangements there.

496
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Remember.

497
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,759
Once we get the goods,

498
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,160
I'll release the flare,

499
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,400
then take action immediately.

500
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

501
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,079
Go.

502
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,200
- Your Highness.
- Tell me.

503
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,640
She Er and Wang Jun Kuo will be...

504
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,079
transacting the warhorses at the thatched hut today.

505
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,160
Also, they say that She Er is pressuring Wang Jun Kuo...

506
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,880
to give him the Crown Prince's seal in two days.

507
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,119
Crown Prince's seal?

508
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,799
What's going on?

509
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,720
This is Youzhou's submission letter.

510
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,799
It's for my father.

511
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
I can't believe you haven't opened it yet.

512
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,559
- Ya Luo.
- Yes.

513
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,039
Did you read Wang Jun Kuo's submission letter?

514
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,640
How would I dare to read it?

515
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,359
I was careless.

516
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,000
It seems like I've underestimated Wang Jun Kuo.

517
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,839
Crown Prince's seal?

518
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,680
No wonder she was on the run all along.

519
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,720
Your Highness, where are you going?

520
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,799
I'm going back.

521
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,799
There are some things that I don't understand.

522
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,599
But Youzhou's affairs have nothing to do with us now.

523
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,880
There's someone who has something to do with me there.

524
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,599
Go ahead. There's no need to wait for me.

525
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,289
General Wang, you're so punctual.

526
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,199
Young Khan, why is it you?

527
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,960
Those from the Ashina Tribe are so interesting.

528
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,559
I meet different people each time.

529
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:30,039
I'm afraid not many people...

530
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,679
do business this way.

531
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,400
You only need to know...

532
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,039
that I have the final say starting today.

533
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,880
After all, I am Ashina Tribe's Young Khan...

534
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,809
and the one Yan Li Khan trusts the most.

535
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,119
Working with me...

536
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,360
is the best option for you.

537
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:47,960
I don't care what happened to Ashina Tribe internally.

538
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,159
I also don't care who I make the deal with.

539
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,559
I only care about the goods.

540
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,039
You came empty-handed.

541
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,329
How should I believe you?

542
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,880
Precious cargo must of course be kept safe.

543
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,440
If we just show it randomly, people might find out about us.

544
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,920
General Wang.

545
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:05,639
You can check the goods first.

546
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,329
Once the alliance is completed,

547
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,079
we'll give you the warhorse as agreed.

548
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,039
Wasn't that the person...

549
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,199
who took Qin Zhun's horses at the inn earlier?

550
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,920
Why is Qin Zhun...

551
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,119
involved with the Ashina Tribe?

552
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,639
This is what I want.

553
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,289
He's here to make a deal with Wang Jun Kuo.

554
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,480
Can you deliver the goods today?

555
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,639
General Wang, you're so impatient.

556
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,440
These warhorses...

557
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,199
will double my might.

558
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,880
Within the day, I'll be able to kill Li Yuan.

559
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,599
Youzhou City will also be mine.

560
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,639
General Wang.

561
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,000
I can give you the goods that you want anytime.

562
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,360
You haven't given me what I want yet.

563
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,199
I should have collateral.

564
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:11,639
I'll give you what you want soon.

565
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,199
Tell me.

566
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,289
I want the key to Youzhou vault,

567
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,840
so you won't cast me aside after I'm no longer needed.

568
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,639
Also, your command token,

569
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,360
so it will be easier for me to work.

570
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,559
All right.

571
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:30,199
Then Yan Li Khan and I...

572
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,840
will be waiting for your good news.

573
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:36,639
Wang Jun Kuo wants to sell Youzhou to Yan Li Khan.

574
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,199
This won't do.

575
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,880
I have to save my uncle.

576
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,480
Yongning.

577
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,329
- Why are you coming here rushing?
- Uncle Li Yuan.

578
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,329
Wang Jun Kuo has betrayed you.

579
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,769
He's working for the Ashina Tribe.

580
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,159
And he wants to take over Youzou...

581
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,360
and kill you.

582
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,679
Yongning, you're not aware.

583
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,440
Jun Kuo has been promoted in the military...

584
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,400
through his accomplishments in resisting the Ashina Tribe.

585
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,880
If you say that he wants to kill me, that's even more absurd.

586
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,239
We've been friends for many years and we're in-laws.

587
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,400
Are you thinking too much?

588
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,599
That's impossible.

589
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,679
I heard it myself.

590
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,809
Uncle Li Yuan. Come with me right now.

591
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:43,960
If he comes here in advance,

592
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
we won't be able to leave anymore.

593
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,039
- Come on.
- You...

594
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,239
You can't escape now.

595
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,809
Princess Yongning.

596
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,639
I've underestimated you.

597
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,039
Wang Jun Kuo.

598
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:05,809
This is the governor's manor.

599
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:07,079
How can you act so impudently here?

600
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:08,360
Retreat!

601
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,239
How can you give orders to Youzhou's troops?

602
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,039
You two will reunite again in the afterlife.

603
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:22,769
- Kill them!
- Yes!

604
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:29,360
Come on.

605
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Go after them.

606
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,239
Yongning.

607
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,719
What should we do now?

608
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,769
Wang Jun Kuo has already taken over the governor's manor.

609
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,599
I have nowhere else to go.

610
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
It will be fine, Uncle Li Yuan.

611
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,239
As long as they don't catch us,

612
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,289
we can still overturn the situation.

613
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,440
Why don't you come with me first?

614
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,880
- All right.
- All right.

615
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:48,920
(Qingxiang Inn)

616
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,119
Yongning, what is this place?

617
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,769
It's where I'm staying.

618
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:01,360
Where is he?

619
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,809
"He"?

620
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,239
Who?

621
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,960
Did you leave something...

622
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,769
with your friend?

623
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,159
I didn't say that I'm looking for something.

624
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,960
Yongning.

625
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,599
Since we're running away,

626
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,559
of course we should take some valuable items with us.

627
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,159
Think about it carefully.

628
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,880
Where is your friend now?

629
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:38,329
Dou.

630
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,440
Please don't come back here.

631
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,519
Yongning, we're running out of time.

632
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:45,000
If Wang Jun Kuo comes here, we'll be in trouble.

633
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,840
We came out from the back alley.

634
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,289
It's impossible for Wang Jun Kuo to follow us.

635
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,519
Could it be...

636
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,039
that you had an agreement in advance?

637
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,119
It's so uncomfortable to eat a lot of field rations.

638
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,519
My legs are numb already.

639
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,079
Master is back.

640
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,809
Your master fell for a trick.

641
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,840
I'm here to help you.

642
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,769
Yongning.

643
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,079
If I don't pull this trick,

644
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,480
how will you come to save me?

645
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
To be honest,

646
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,440
what you've been doing in the past few days...

647
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,159
moved me.

648
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,440
Why?

649
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:40,239
Young Khan wants me to give him Crown Prince's seal within two days.

650
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,039
If I wasn't forced by the circumstances,

651
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,840
I wouldn't have done this.

652
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,809
Those from the prairies want Crown Prince's seal too?

653
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,840
And they want us to give it to them within two days.

654
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,880
It seems like they want to use that to create trouble.

655
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,480
But Governor,

656
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,289
I think Yongning isn't easy to deal with either.

657
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,440
It seems like we must put on an act.

658
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,639
Please give your instructions, Governor.

659
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,159
Once we get the goods,

660
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:11,639
I'll release the flare,

661
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,960
then take action immediately.

662
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

663
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,599
These warhorses...

664
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,119
will double my might.

665
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,329
Within the day, I'll be able to kill Li Yuan.

666
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,960
Youzhou City will also be mine.

667
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,519
Yongning, if you didn't trust me,

668
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,159
how would I know where Crown Prince's seal is?

669
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,039
How do you know that it's in my possession?

670
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,480
A decree's authenticity...

671
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,480
can be verified right away.

672
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,440
Chang'an uses top-quality ink cake.

673
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,719
The low-quality ink cake you used...

674
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,079
bled once met with water.
