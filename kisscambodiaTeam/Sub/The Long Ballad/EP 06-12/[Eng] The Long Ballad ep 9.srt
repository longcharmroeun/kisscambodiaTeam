00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,040
(The Long Ballad)

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,319
(This is a work of fiction.)

4
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,239
(Episode 9)

5
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,319
Sir, are you all right?

6
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Water.

7
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,920
- Water.
- Water?

8
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,920
It's done.

9
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,599
Stop.

10
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,680
You killed Prince of Lujiang.

11
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,840
Prince of Lujiang, Li Yuan,

12
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,919
is rebellious and disobedient.

13
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,199
I've already killed him.

14
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,599
You killed your master to save yourself?

15
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,530
I serve Prince of Lujiang.

16
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,960
He instructed me to do evil things.

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,759
I had no choice.

18
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,759
Now, I've killed him.

19
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,479
I hope...

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,759
I hope I could redeem myself.

21
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,800
Where is Shu Yu?

22
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,319
Envoy Wei...

23
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,960
was wounded by Prince of Lujiang's men.

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,280
- I've instructed men to treat him.
- You...

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,719
He is recuperating in the room.

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,199
Envoy Wei?

27
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,520
General Shen.

28
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,879
I have a piece of important information for the royal court.

29
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,560
Do you know the identity of the person who just left?

30
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,360
She is the traitor, Li Jian Cheng's daughter.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,840
- Arrest him!
- Yes.

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
Shen Gu. You...

33
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,000
Prince of Lujiang has rebelled.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,439
Arrest all of his men for investigation.

35
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,639
Shen Gu.

36
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,879
I did this for you out of kindness.

37
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,879
I can't believe you're this ungrateful.

38
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,919
Shut him up.

39
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,639
I won't let you be.

40
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,800
Chang Ge.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,240
Why are you here?

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm just glad you're fine.

43
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,080
Le Yan is waiting for you at the stage station.

44
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,439
Somehow...

45
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,280
Wang Jun Kuo suddenly let me go.

46
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,919
He even got me a physician.

47
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,919
Hao Du lit the signal fire.

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,960
I impersonated you...

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,800
and summoned our generals outside the town.

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,120
Wang Jun Kuo knew that he is at a disadvantage,

51
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,400
so he killed his master to save himself.

52
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,599
What?

53
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,199
I've done all that I could.

54
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,599
Take good care of Le Yan.

55
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,199
Make sure she gets home safely.

56
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,680
Chang Ge.

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,919
As long as you're holding the Crown Prince's seal,

58
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,319
Hao Du would...

59
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,560
It doesn't belong to Li Shi Min anyway.

60
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,610
I just took what belongs to me.

61
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,560
Master, how was it?

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Let's go.

63
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,560
- Keep a close eye on her.
- Yes.

64
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,759
(Governor's Manor)

65
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,360
Under the orders of Crown Prince Zuo,

66
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,610
I have come to arrest the rebels.

67
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm Shen Gu, a general stationed at Youzhou.

68
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,680
Envoy Wei has informed us.

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,050
We're dealing with the funeral now.

70
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,560
Envoy Wei?

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,319
If Envoy Wei didn't arrive in time,

72
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,079
I can't even imagine the consequences.

73
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,079
What a shame.

74
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,399
Prince of Lujiang has been killed by Wang Jun Kuo.

75
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,519
We can't get the first statement.

76
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,480
(Governor's Manor)

77
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,519
Master, the person who kidnapped you is here again.

78
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,360
Come here.

79
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,360
Hold on.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,720
What are you planning to do to Wang Jun Kuo?

81
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,439
Once I've informed the court,

82
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,600
we will proceed from there.

83
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,439
For security purposes,

84
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,079
I've had him locked up in my camp.

85
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,240
Wang Jun Kuo is very cunning.

86
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
And he has many subordinates.

87
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,800
He might get away.

88
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,879
Thank you.

89
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,759
Who are you?

90
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,920
Why are you arresting me?

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,199
It's a kid?

92
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,480
Who are you?

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,800
Why did you push me?

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,879
I've contributed a lot.

95
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,839
I brought help from the camp during the night.

96
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,240
Don't forget to tell this to the court.

97
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm waiting for my reward.

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,560
I led the rest of the rebels and eliminated...

99
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,639
- the rebellion in Youzhou!
- Search the place.

100
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,639
- Yes!
- Yes!

101
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,759
Go!

102
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
Where is Chang Ge?

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,120
You're asking me?

104
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,000
It can't be like this.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
I have to get her back.

106
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,000
- It's still with her.
- I'm glad you know.

107
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,199
If we don't find it,

108
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,120
you and I can never go back to Chang'an.

109
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,199
Get up now.

110
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,720
Go and get her back.

111
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,639
Your partner is still in town.

112
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,680
Will he be all right?

113
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,040
We made a promise.

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,519
I'll leave hints along the path.

115
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,920
He'll come and see me when he gets out.

116
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
Thank you for saving my life.

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
I dare not accept a bow from Your Highness.

118
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,319
How do you know?

119
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,040
You have a courtly temperament.

120
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,079
Other people won't be able to learn it.

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,839
Rumors have it that Princess Yongning is still missing.

122
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,519
I was once the Crown Prince's subordinate.

123
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,120
How could I not recognize you?

124
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,560
Wang Jun Kuo even offered to hand you in to the imperial court.

125
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
This proves even more that I was right.

126
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,000
In that case,

127
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,399
why don't you join me and leave together?

128
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,600
Now, the whole Youzhou is in Li Shi Min's hands.

129
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,480
He surely won't let my father's former subordinates go.

130
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,120
Instead of being submissive,

131
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,279
why don't you leave with me?

132
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,559
We can work together.

133
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,559
I am a general.

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,039
I only follow orders.

135
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,240
General Shen.

136
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,000
The whole Youzhou is under Du Ru Hui's control.

137
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,919
We can never get Youzhou back.

138
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,240
We'll only be waiting for death here.

139
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,559
Besides,

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
I still have the Crown Prince's seal.

141
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,679
Do you really think a lifeless object...

142
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
can mobilize thousands of troops?

143
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm helping you because I want to repay the Crown Price's kindness.

144
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,330
It's a selfish action.

145
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,090
I'm the Crown Prince's former subordinate,

146
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,159
but first, I am a general of Tang.

147
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,450
Now, the Ashina Tribe is planning an attack in the north.

148
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,360
Youzhou is an important town in the north.

149
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,840
There are millions of people.

150
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,519
My job is to protect...

151
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,840
the land of Youzhou.

152
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,960
If I can't even perform my duties,

153
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,210
no matter what you have,

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,399
it'll be pointless, Your Highness.

155
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,759
Although I don't agree entirely,

156
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,559
I respect your decisions.

157
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,559
I learned something today.

158
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,960
Your Highness, you should leave.

159
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
When the chasers arrive,

160
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,840
I will have no choice but to do my job.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,559
I can no longer stay in Youzhou.

162
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,120
The world is huge.

163
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,759
Yet, I have nowhere to go.

164
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,279
Go northwest.

165
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,639
Go to Shuozhou.

166
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,000
It's an isolated place.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,210
It's a piece of land between Tang and the plains.

168
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,639
The royal court won't be able to reach you.

169
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,960
Thank you, General Shen.

170
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,919
Take care, Your Highness.

171
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
I shall bid you farewell.

172
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,279
Go!

173
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,090
Go!

174
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,159
- Go!
- Go!

175
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,240
Stop.

176
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,759
Your Highness, that's enough.

177
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,480
If we continue, we'll be exhausted.

178
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,879
Didn't you say that jerk has left already?

179
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Why did he come back?

180
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,679
I can't let this go.

181
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,840
I already observed the surroundings.

182
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,840
There's no trace of an army passing by.

183
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,279
That jerk must have come back alone.

184
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,559
Your Highness.

185
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,200
- What do you want to do?
- He plotted against me.

186
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,600
Why can't I do the same?

187
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,120
You should report back to Great Khan in this instance.

188
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,039
If we delay any longer,

189
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,799
Great Khan will get suspicious of us.

190
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,240
Stop telling me what to do and what not to do.

191
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,120
Do you really think that you're my elder brother?

192
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,519
So what if Great Khan is suspicious?

193
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,080
Am I supposed to just let this go?

194
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,679
Great Khan is leading his men to Shuozhou.

195
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,919
The astringer should be in the north of Shuozhou by now.

196
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,200
Go this way.

197
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,679
If we can guess which route he's taking,

198
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,679
so can Ashina Sun.

199
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,320
Yes.

200
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,559
Could they have taken the south route?

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,639
Don't you think he would have thought of that already?

202
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,080
That jerk is always full of tricks.

203
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,360
He has been after me.

204
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,480
He knew I would guess that he went this way.

205
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,080
But Great Khan gave him an order.

206
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
If he goes this way,

207
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,679
the military line will be delayed.

208
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,159
He would do whatever it takes to complete Great Khan's orders.

209
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,840
That's why he'll definitely take the north road.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,519
And I have a feeling that...

211
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,279
he will take the main road on purpose.

212
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,039
We'll cut him off at the main road.

213
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,120
We need to be fast.

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,159
Pick him up on the side road.

215
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,679
Why?

216
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,200
Because I think he'll take the main road.

217
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm sure he expected me to think that.

218
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,120
This time, I bet...

219
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,200
he could have guessed it too.

220
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,120
- Go!
- Go!

221
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,159
General Shen.

222
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,399
Are you trying to harbor a criminal?

223
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
A criminal?

224
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,360
What are you talking about?

225
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,279
The rebel, Wang Jun Kuo, has been imprisoned.

226
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,240
And you two are barging in...

227
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
with a piece of one-off charm.

228
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,320
I can't believe everything you say.

229
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,960
Now that the rebellion has begun,

230
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,720
we can't have any scouts...

231
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,320
get out of the town.

232
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,679
It seems today,

233
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,399
you're not letting us pass no matter what.

234
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,480
So what?

235
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,879
With General Shen's ability,

236
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,799
there's no way we can get away from him.

237
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,840
One of us has to sacrifice.

238
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,039
My martial arts skills are better than yours.

239
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,399
You should leave first.

240
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,240
Be very careful.

241
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,840
Go!

242
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,159
Attack!

243
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,919
Go!

244
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,960
Go!

245
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,559
Go!

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,799
I knew they wouldn't be able to find you.

247
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,720
But when you think you've dodged it,

248
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,080
you will definitely show up.

249
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Nice try, right?

250
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,919
That's right.

251
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,679
You're not defeated by failures.

252
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,039
Not bad.

253
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,960
Go!

254
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
Who told you to attack him?

255
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,440
My job is to protect you.

256
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,639
I'm not here to see you get beaten up.

257
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,679
I...

258
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,759
Ambush is about hitting the target immediately.

259
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,639
Now that you've alerted him,

260
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,480
it'll be hard to catch up with him.

261
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,720
Come on.

262
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,240
We must go back and report this.

263
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,399
Go!

264
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,519
Stop.

265
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,960
You guys continue to chase after him.

266
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,600
I can't let him get away with this.

267
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,399
- Go!
- Go!

268
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,159
Go!

269
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,720
Go!

270
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,480
Chang Ge.

271
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,639
Stop it.

272
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,759
Haven't you gotten into enough trouble in Youzhou?

273
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,000
When are you going to stop running away?

274
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Chang Ge.

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
I, Wei Shu Yu, swear to the heavens.

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,799
I'll do whatever it takes to protect you.

277
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,919
Even if I can't undo anything,

278
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,679
I'm willing to die with you.

279
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,799
Whether it's the world of the living or the dead,

280
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,279
I'll be with you until the end.

281
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,240
I won't trust anyone anymore.

282
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,080
I won't stay for anyone.

283
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,679
But you still have the Crown Prince's seal.

284
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,840
They won't spare you until they get it back.

285
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,200
You make it sound good.

286
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,840
You just want to retrieve the Crown Prince's seal.

287
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,279
So that you can get your job done.

288
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,359
Chang Ge.

289
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,000
Wei Shu Yu.

290
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,079
Listen carefully.

291
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,839
From now on,

292
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,170
we're no longer related.

293
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,799
This is the last time I'm doing this.

294
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,759
I'll give you another merit.

295
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,200
Take it back and report to your higher-up.

296
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
This is nothing but a lifeless object.

297
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,559
You can't move people's hearts.

298
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
From now on,

299
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,890
I won't rely on anyone else but myself.

300
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,079
Shen Gu.

301
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,720
You're hiding a criminal of the imperial court.

302
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,200
When I return to Chang'an,

303
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,170
I'll report this to the Crown Prince and get you punished!

304
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,799
Please don't be angry.

305
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,759
General Shen said you've been proven to be innocent.

306
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,519
He asked me to apologize on his behalf.

307
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,440
By the way, Envoy Wei is here.

308
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,279
Sir, this way, please.

309
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Please.

310
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,960
Did you lose Li Chang Ge again?

311
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,960
I have found the Crown Prince's seal.

312
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,650
We can return to Chang'an now.

313
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,170
I do not only want the Crown Prince's seal.

314
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,200
I want Li Chang Ge too.

315
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,410
Wei Shu Yu.

316
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,279
Where are you going?

317
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,000
The Princess is waiting at the stage station.

318
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,359
Good girl.

319
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,079
What's your name?

320
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,920
Who exactly are you?

321
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,920
If my partner doesn't see me when he gets back,

322
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,519
he'll definitely come looking for me.

323
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,279
By then, you'll be in trouble.

324
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,000
So let them come to me.

325
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,680
Good girl.

326
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,650
You have to be grateful.

327
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,039
Or you might get yourself killed.

328
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,650
Let me ask you again.

329
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,599
What's your name?

330
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,799
Tell him.

331
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,650
I'm Le Yan.

332
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,650
That's good.

333
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,480
Just call me Hai Lao.

334
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,240
Be good from now on.

335
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,680
I'll find a good family...

336
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,200
and sell you at a good price.

337
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,039
If you don't,

338
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
I'll cut off all your limbs.

339
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,119
I was kidnapped too.

340
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,480
These two are human traffickers.

341
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,319
Human traffickers?

342
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,559
They would kidnap women and children for human trafficking.

343
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Human trafficking?

344
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,079
Where to?

345
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,240
What does he mean when he said he will cut off my limbs?

346
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,119
It means he'll cut off your arms and legs...

347
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,519
and made you a beggar.

348
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,599
Le Yan.

349
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,440
We have no other choice but to help each other out.

350
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,079
Do you understand?

351
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,640
Go!

352
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,880
Go!

353
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,119
Le Yan.

354
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Le Yan.

355
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,559
Where's the Princess?

356
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,960
Where did the guest of this room go?

357
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,400
I don't know.

358
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,880
I didn't hear anything from this room.

359
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,559
All of her valuables are gone.

360
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,480
There are no signs of struggles in the room.

361
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,720
The Princess couldn't have left by herself.

362
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,079
There's only one possibility.

363
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
She was knocked out and taken away.

364
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,559
Wei Shu Yu.

365
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,079
Wei Shu Yu.

366
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,279
Clean up the mess.

367
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,559
Return to Chang'an immediately.

368
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,680
Report about Youzhou...

369
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,759
and that the Princess has gone missing.

370
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,279
No.

371
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm going to find her.

372
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,160
I'll say this one last time.

373
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,880
Your mission now...

374
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
is to report back to Chang'an.

375
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,400
Le Yan has disappeared.

376
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,759
That's not important right now.

377
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,400
She doesn't know the area well.

378
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,200
It's a war zone further north.

379
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,599
Le Yan is a noble woman.

380
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,160
She's innocent and weak.

381
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,400
She's all alone now.

382
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Our first priority is to bring her back.

383
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,720
Shut up, Wei Shu Yu.

384
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
Let me ask you, whose fault is it that the Princess is missing?

385
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,839
Who told her to come along?

386
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,599
Who's the one who guaranteed to take full responsibility...

387
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,960
for the Princess' safety?

388
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,480
I said I'd bear it.

389
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,920
And I will take full responsibility.

390
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
You can report to the higher-up.

391
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,960
No matter what it takes,

392
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,400
I will find the Princess.

393
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,000
If anything happens to her,

394
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,319
I'll pay for it with my life.

395
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Wei Shu Yu.

396
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,480
Don't forget why you come to Youzhou.

397
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,759
Also,

398
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,839
you won't find the Princess alone.

399
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,400
We need the Crown Prince's help.

400
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,240
It's a mark left by my master.

401
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,079
Your Highness.

402
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,720
The smoke signal has been extinguished.

403
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Youzhou has been conquered.

404
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,359
Envoy Wei is on his way back to the capital.

405
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,880
That's good.

406
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,119
Your Highness.

407
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,880
All Li Jian Cheng's former subordinates...

408
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,039
are around Shandong, Hebei.

409
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,799
If we let them continue to guard the city,

410
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,759
it'll be nursing a viper in our bosom.

411
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,960
The same thing that happened in Youzhou will happen again.

412
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,720
What are you trying to say?

413
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,240
All Hebei townsfolk are guarding the perimeter...

414
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,359
to prevent invasion of the bandits from the plains.

415
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,279
Are you trying to take away...

416
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
all their military power?

417
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,319
If you have a better solution,

418
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm all ears.

419
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,440
Don't forget.

420
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,079
It was your son who went to Youzhou.

421
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,960
Not only Prince of Lujiang didn't follow him back to the capital,

422
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,720
but he also started a rebellion.

423
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,160
Your son...

424
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,160
is such a genius.

425
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,039
Your Highness, I didn't teach my son well.

426
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,599
I have committed a grave sin.

427
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,400
When he comes back,

428
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,359
aside from the punishment from the royal court,

429
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,160
I will punish him personally.

430
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,119
But the Youzhou incident...

431
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,279
is related to our great nation.

432
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,039
I beg you, Your Highness.

433
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,359
Please don't suppress the military officers.

434
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,279
So that the people wouldn't panic.

435
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,279
I once assisted Jian Cheng in managing Hebei.

436
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,599
I'm willing to go to Hebei...

437
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,640
to appease Li Jian Cheng...

438
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,960
and Li Yuan Ji's former subordinates.

439
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:42,920
Mr. Wei.

440
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,880
If Your Highness trusts me,

441
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,440
I'll set off tomorrow morning.

442
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,400
I hope Your Highness could make them yield...

443
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,039
and submit to you by making peace.

444
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
All right.

445
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,359
I'll leave it to you, sir.

446
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:03,200
It's a long journey.

447
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,279
You may dress casually...

448
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,079
and act without permission.

449
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,839
Thank you, Your Highness.

450
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,759
If he doesn't return,

451
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,000
no matter where he is,

452
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,319
I will get rid of him...

453
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,480
on behalf of the royal court.

454
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,599
You don't mean it.

455
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,519
In fact, you purposely talk about...

456
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,240
punishing the generals and his son...

457
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
to incite him to volunteer to go to Hebei.

458
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,160
So what?

459
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,319
Poor Wei Zheng.

460
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,720
He's such a straightforward person.

461
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,319
He thought...

462
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,839
if he didn't take care of it himself,

463
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,960
you will really request His Highness to punish the generals.

464
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,720
It's not easy for us to get him on our side,

465
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,480
of course we have to put him to good use.

466
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,079
Otherwise, it would be a waste of his talent.

467
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,240
That makes sense.

468
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,680
Every time I see you,

469
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,880
you're either living in a woodshed or a shabby house.

470
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,799
Why are you here?

471
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,480
I should be the one asking you that.

472
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,839
Not everyone is as wealthy as you.

473
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,759
Why are you hurt?

474
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,359
What are you doing?

475
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,759
Treat your wound, of course.

476
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,319
Come on.

477
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,480
Ask me anything you want.

478
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,480
Don't hold it in.

479
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,559
How did you get hurt?

480
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,519
What's with the horses?

481
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,039
There's no need to beat around the bush.

482
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,720
You have questions for me, don't you?

483
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,200
Yes.

484
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,920
I am from the Ashina Tribe.

485
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,559
I won't deny that.

486
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,200
You and Great Khan's son of the Ashina Tribe know each other.

487
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,559
He colluded with Wang Jun Kuo.

488
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,960
He even stole from Youzhou's treasury.

489
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,559
Are you involved?

490
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,599
I can only tell you this.

491
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,039
I was indeed wounded by his men.

492
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,559
As for the treasury's carriage you stopped,

493
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,000
it was also me who flawed it.

494
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,640
It really is you.

495
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,400
Who are you?

496
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,079
Qin Zhun.

497
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,319
Since you don't want to tell me,

498
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,400
then I won't ask.

499
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,839
I'll think of you as a profiteer.

500
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,000
But it's not my style to not help those in need.

501
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,119
After leaving Youzhou,

502
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,160
where will you be heading?

503
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,599
I can't tell you.

504
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,920
Go down this road.

505
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,759
There are only two choices.

506
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,000
It's either heading to Shuozhou...

507
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,319
or the plains.

508
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,440
I don't think...

509
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,359
you're heading to the plains.

510
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,799
Don't go to Shuozhou.

511
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,160
Why not?

512
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,799
That's the border.

513
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,960
It's next to the plains and far away from Tang.

514
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,200
Also,

515
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,599
over the years,

516
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,960
it has always been a war zone.

517
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,200
You should just mind your own business.

518
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,440
I'm serious.

519
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,559
You should leave.

520
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's not safe here.

521
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,680
If anyone asks,

522
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
just say you've never seen me before.

523
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,519
Will you be all right...

524
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,519
by yourself?

525
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,519
Don't worry.

526
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,279
I won't die that easily.

527
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,839
Hold on.

528
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,519
Next time,

529
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
don't live in this hellhole anymore.

530
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,799
Sympathy is not my thing.

531
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,160
I'm lending it to you.

532
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,759
Remember to pay me back.

533
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,920
Thank you.

534
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,119
Until we meet again,

535
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,039
Shi Si Lang.

536
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,160
No.

537
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,799
Princess Yongning.

538
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,039
I'm glad we got it back.

539
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Reward Envoy Hao and Envoy Wei.

540
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,079
Thank you, Your Highness.

541
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,680
The Chang Ge I know...

542
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,680
won't give this up that easily.

543
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,279
Is Chang Ge all right?

544
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,000
After Princess Yongning handed this over to me,

545
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,359
she escaped.

546
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,839
Forget it.

547
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,039
Don't cause any more trouble.

548
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,119
Put an end to this.

549
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,960
I have something else to tell you, Your Highness.

550
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,440
Is it about Chang Ge?

551
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,680
It's about Princess Yong'an.

552
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,359
What's wrong with Le Yan?

553
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,519
Princess Yong'an...

554
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,559
followed the troop to Youzhou.

555
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,840
But unpredicted changes happened in Youzhou.

556
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,639
Wei Shu Yu was captured by Wang Jun Kuo.

557
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,559
Hao Du went to rescue him.

558
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,559
And Princess Yong'an waited at the stage station.

559
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,559
But...

560
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,400
When they returned to the stage station...

561
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,639
after signal smoke is cleared,

562
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,809
Princess Yong'an disappeared.

563
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,679
Your Highness.

564
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,639
I've asked the surrounding counties...

565
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,440
to secretly find out where Princess Yong'an is.

566
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:40,329
Wei Shu Yu has requested to go look for Princess Yong'an...

567
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,360
to make up for his mistakes.

568
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,719
Should we summon...

569
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,559
Wei Shu Yu back for punishment first, Your Highness?

570
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,329
Forget it.

571
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,329
I believe that...

572
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,289
he'll do his best to find Yan Er.

573
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,079
Convey my orders.

574
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,960
Say that Princess Yong'an is ill.

575
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,039
And she's still recuperating at Luoyang Palace.

576
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:19,559
You can't tell anyone about this.

577
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,920
Don't worry, Your Highness.

578
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,329
I'll surely make arrangements.

579
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,519
Ke Ming.

580
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,769
You may leave now.

581
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,360
I want to be alone.

582
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,440
I'll take my leave.

583
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,199
Le Yan.

584
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,199
You dropped your food.

585
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,880
Pick it up.

586
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,400
If you're not going to eat it, I will.

587
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,599
Slow down.

588
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,289
It's all yours.

589
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,599
You're so good to me.

590
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,199
We'll be sisters from now on.

591
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
We'll share the good and the bad.

592
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,360
Le Yan, I'm a bit thirsty.

593
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,599
I'll drink your water.

594
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,920
Hai Lao.

595
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,079
Can I have some more water?

596
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:14,289
I've given you all the food and drinks for today.

597
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:16,400
You gave them up yourself.

598
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,039
Whose fault is it?

599
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:39,880
Fang Yi.

600
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,920
Your Highness.

601
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,519
Any news from Le Yan?

602
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:55,000
I've sent out more men to search for Princess Yong'an in every county.

603
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
But...

604
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,329
there's no news yet.

605
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,679
Yan Er.

606
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,880
A weak girl like you...

607
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,119
wandering among the common folks.

608
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:19,480
I'm really worried about you.

609
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,159
Water.

610
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,559
Water.

611
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,719
Le Yan.

612
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,119
Water.

613
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,599
Le Yan.

614
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,639
Shu Yu.

615
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,840
Shu Yu, you came to save me.

616
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,519
Don't die here.

617
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,840
Don't get my carriage dirty.

618
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,079
Who is Shu Yu?

619
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,840
Do you want me to bring Shu Yu...

620
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,289
to keep you company?

621
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,480
No.

622
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,289
Please don't hurt Shu Yu.

623
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,039
You've been missing for days.

624
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,840
I didn't see anyone named Shu Yu come looking for you.

625
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:54,480
Could he have forgotten about you already?

626
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,519
How much money do you want?

627
00:39:58,769 --> 00:39:59,809
How much do you want?

628
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,079
I'll give it to you.

629
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:02,519
Just let me go.

630
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,639
So you're from a rich family.

631
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,599
Then all the more reason I shouldn't let you go.

632
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,119
Your family will kill me if I set you free.

633
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,480
No, they won't.

634
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,519
They won't. I promise.

635
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,519
They won't.

636
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,159
Hai Lao, please.

637
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,840
Please let me go.

638
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,239
I need to rest.

639
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,880
Shut up.

640
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,519
Or I'll cut off your tongue.

641
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,329
Shu...

642
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:40,880
Shu...

643
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,039
Good job.

644
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,679
You've learned your lesson.

645
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,400
Stop.

646
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,239
Le Yan.

647
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:29,289
Where are you?

648
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,039
(Shuozhou)

649
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:04,880
Sachets.

650
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,329
Sachets. Have a look.

651
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:08,440
They're playing ball.

652
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,639
Buy one for your child.

653
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,289
Catch.

654
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,519
Shuozhou is far beyond the borders of the state.

655
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,079
This place is isolated.

656
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,440
It has been at war for years.

657
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,880
Why is it so busy and crowded?

658
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,119
I'm Gongsun Heng of the state.

659
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,039
Surrender now, you thieves.

660
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:32,400
Gongsun Heng?

661
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,639
- No.
- Give me something to eat.

662
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,329
- Have a drink.
- Thank you.

663
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:38,599
- Thank you.
- Take it.

664
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,840
- Even in the Chang'an,
- Thank you.

665
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,599
it's not as busy and harmonious as this place.
