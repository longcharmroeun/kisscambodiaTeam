(The Long Ballad)

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,400
(This is a work of fiction.)

4
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,280
(Episode 10)

5
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,840
Sir, this way, please.

6
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,480
Sir,

7
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,560
you look worn out.

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,599
You're not a local, are you?

9
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,640
Yes.

10
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,040
You should try our famous smoked jade chicken.

11
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,799
I haven't ordered yet.

12
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,200
Our shopkeeper told me...

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,359
to serve all out-of-town visitors our famous smoked jade chicken.

14
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,560
It's a welcome gift from us.

15
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Waiter.

16
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,159
Let me ask you something.

17
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,319
Shuozhou is a border state...

18
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,319
far away from the capital.

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,799
It was supposed to be an isolated place.

20
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,810
Why is this place so peaceful and prosperous?

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,919
People here even care for the beggars on the street.

22
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,120
Sir, you don't know.

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
This place is a war zone.

24
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,280
Our people are having peace here...

25
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,960
all thanks to our prefectural governor,

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,840
the great Gongsun Heng.

27
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,560
Waiter.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,370
Give us more wine.

29
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,960
- And two side dishes, please.
- All right.

30
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,919
Gongsun Heng.

31
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,400
That's why even kids are mimicking him.

32
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,370
He seems to be well-liked.

33
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,280
Sir, please enjoy.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,319
Waiter.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,960
Tell me more about Gongsun Heng.

36
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,960
He's the prefectural governor of Shuozhou.

37
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,280
He has been here since the Sui dynasty.

38
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,800
All these years,

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,719
he has enhanced the military power and the security of Shuozhou.

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
For every fight that northern barbarians make,

41
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,520
they won't gain a thing.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Governor Gongsun even gives our people farming lands.

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,639
It has attracted numerous visitors.

44
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,800
We're the busiest prefecture compared to our neighboring states.

45
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,000
Our shopkeeper told me...

46
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,719
to serve all visitors from other states...

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,039
our famous smoked jade chicken.

48
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,400
One chicken does not worth much.

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,319
We can't make Governor Gongsun lose his face.

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,560
Am I right?

51
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,800
Waiter.

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,840
I'll get busy.

53
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,159
Call me if you need anything.

54
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,000
Sir, this way, please.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,319
- Do you have any more seats?
- A former general...

56
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,199
of Sui actually cares so much for his people.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,439
People like him must hate war a lot.

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
How can I convince him...

59
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,319
to start a revolt against Prince of Qin?

60
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,759
Dou.

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,959
Master.

62
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,279
It's really you.

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,360
I saw someone that looks like you from afar.

64
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,480
So I followed you here.

65
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,800
That means we're destined to be master and disciple.

66
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,959
Are you hungry?

67
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,399
Let's go. I'll buy you something delicious.

68
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,480
All right.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,279
I always know that you're my savior.

70
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,560
With you, everything will be fine.

71
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,319
By the way, Master.

72
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,730
Should we go to the magistrate now?

73
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,959
Like how we did in Youzhou.

74
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,399
We'll tell him the truth.

75
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,480
And ask him to start a revolt.

76
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,079
Youzhou is an important land to my father.

77
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,759
Even his own men are eyeing this piece of land.

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,319
Gongsun Heng was a general from the previous empire.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,610
Why should he help us?

80
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,839
In this world,

81
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,079
I can't trust anyone anymore.

82
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,560
Master, what about me?

83
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,240
Do you trust me?

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,050
Yes.

85
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,079
Dou.

86
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,120
I think I've grown up a lot recently.

87
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,959
Not having trust in anyone feels worse than being cheated on.

88
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,759
Master.

89
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,399
I don't understand.

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,399
You better not.

91
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,920
Let's go. I'll buy you something delicious.

92
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,240
After meals, I'll take you to the poorest place in Shuozhou.

93
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,720
I'll teach you your first lesson,

94
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,959
which is how to gather information.

95
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,759
His Highness is back.

96
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,079
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

97
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,839
- Ashina Sun.
- Your Highness.

98
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,639
Ashina Sun.

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,279
You're back.

100
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,199
You're hurt.

101
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,759
It's a long story.

102
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,079
She Er, that brat.

103
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,639
He even dares to kill you now.

104
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,120
If I die in Tang,

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,399
he could walk away from it completely.

106
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
If I were him,

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,319
I would seize this opportunity as well.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,720
This is a bit too risky.

109
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,759
But what if he reports this to Great Khan?

110
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,759
He won't.

111
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
I know him well enough.

112
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,560
There's no way he would tell on me...

113
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
and admit defeat.

114
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,759
If I'm going to fight,

115
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,920
I will bear the consequences.

116
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,759
Who bandaged this?

117
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,680
What a mess.

118
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,920
If it were someone else,

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,279
he'll be seriously injured.

120
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,240
Why are you laughing?

121
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,079
It's nothing.

122
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,639
Are you hiding something from me?

123
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,839
Keep your distance.

124
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
Did a lady from Tang bandage you?

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,399
Your Highness, Tu Ka She is here.

126
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,680
He's outside the barracks.

127
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,439
What is he doing here?

128
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,079
The time has come.

129
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I haven't informed him yet.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,039
Ashina Sun.

131
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,000
You're still alive.

132
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm glad.

133
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,919
You hurt your eye.

134
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,159
Just say what you want.

135
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,120
Don't give me that attitude.

136
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,039
Do you think I wanted to come?

137
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,279
Great Khan has asked us to come here...

138
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,679
and go to Shuozhou with you guys.

139
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,559
He's afraid you'll lose the battle.

140
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,279
What else?

141
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,879
There's more.

142
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,559
This is Great Khan's orders.

143
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,759
Great Khan has put me in charge of this mission.

144
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,330
And I will take full control this time.

145
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,679
So...

146
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,480
every move you astringers make,

147
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,799
you have to report to me.

148
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,960
Cooperation is all about give and take.

149
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,720
What about the Bear Army?

150
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,039
Are you guys going to report to us as well?

151
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,399
It's not on the order.

152
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,879
You can go now.

153
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,879
Where was I?

154
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,000
You were saying that Ba Lu can finally hold a bow now.

155
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,559
He wants to take part in next year's hunt.

156
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,559
And Ge Sang wants to learn archery and horseback riding.

157
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,840
But her mother says no.

158
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
She's right.

159
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,450
Why should a girl learn archery and horseback riding?

160
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,039
I'll go see her mother later.

161
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,330
I'll tell them I said yes.

162
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,600
You agreed?

163
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
That's enough.

164
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm leaving.

165
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,679
Just you wait.

166
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,799
It seems like someone is defaming us in front of Great Khan again.

167
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,159
Tu Ka She never likes you.

168
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,759
He said he's here to help.

169
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,330
He's obviously here to take all the credit.

170
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,399
It's obvious who's behind all this.

171
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,960
If he chickens out because of one failure,

172
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,519
then that's not the She Er we know.

173
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,090
Right.

174
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,240
Did you just say...

175
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
you agreed to let the girl learn archery and horseback riding?

176
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,240
Yes.

177
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,240
I said yes.

178
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,960
(Prefectural Governor's Manor)

179
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,639
Elder Qin.

180
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,480
Ashina's army has come to attack us.

181
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
They look well-prepared.

182
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,919
I will send the troops...

183
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,960
to guard the northwest and northeast corner...

184
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,840
to form a horn shape around the city.

185
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,159
What do you think?

186
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,679
You are great in military tactics.

187
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,720
This time, Ashina Tribe...

188
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
will be defeated.

189
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,720
(Gongsun Heng)

190
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,320
Even though we're impregnable,

191
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
we need the reinforcements from Daizhou and Bingzhou...

192
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,919
to defend the entire frontier.

193
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,320
Without them,

194
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,799
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

195
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
Governor, there is a big trouble.

196
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,879
Tell me.

197
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,799
Madam and Yuan Niang ran into some bandits...

198
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,879
on their way to the temple.

199
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,879
What?

200
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,039
We found the damaged carriage...

201
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,120
and the body of the coachman on the driveway.

202
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,919
This...

203
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Get up.

204
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,200
Where are my wife and daughter?

205
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,360
We couldn't find them.

206
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
You couldn't find them?

207
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,840
Those bandits.

208
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,799
This is outrageous.

209
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,879
Convey my orders.

210
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,200
Get all our men...

211
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,840
and come with me to annihilate the bandits in the mountains.

212
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,320
We must save my wife and daughter.

213
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,559
Yes.

214
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,679
My dear.

215
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
My dear.

216
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,559
My dear.

217
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,559
Are you all right?

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,080
Yuan Niang and I are fine.

219
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,919
Thanks to two young lads.

220
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,240
That's how we managed to survive.

221
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,799
"Two young lads"?

222
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,919
Yuan Niang.

223
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,559
Are you all right?

224
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,919
Good girl.

225
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,960
How are you feeling?

226
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,320
Father, I'm fine now.

227
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,360
You're feeling all right now?

228
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,720
- Good girl.
- My dear.

229
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,039
They are my saviors.

230
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,720
I have to thank both of you for saving my wife and daughter.

231
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,399
I'll do my best to repay you.

232
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,799
My name is Shi Si Lang.

233
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,200
This is my brother, Dou.

234
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,799
It was urgent.

235
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,879
So I had no choice but to lie to Madam.

236
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,039
Lie to me?

237
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,799
In that case,

238
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,919
please come in and have a chat with me.

239
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,279
My brother and I have been wandering from Longxi all the way here.

240
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,240
The two of us...

241
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,039
were taking a break in a forest.

242
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
Dou was exhausted, so he fell asleep.

243
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,600
Just as I was about to wake him up to continue with our journey，

244
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,279
I heard a few bandits around.

245
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
They're plotting something secretly.

246
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,039
Dou.

247
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,559
Dou.

248
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,679
Wake up. Let's go.

249
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,960
Come on.

250
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
Someone is here.

251
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,000
I've found out something.

252
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,639
Gongsun Heng's daughter is sick.

253
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,799
His wife will pass by here tomorrow to go to the temple on the mountain.

254
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,960
We must seize the chance to rob all the valuables.

255
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,440
That jerk, Gongsun Heng.

256
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,879
He cut off our escape route.

257
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,440
We have nowhere to go now.

258
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm merciful enough not to kill his wife.

259
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,200
Let's go and get ready.

260
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,559
So how did you save my wife and daughter?

261
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,799
Actually, my brother and I were trying to figure out a plan.

262
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,440
We can't confront the bandits.

263
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,879
And we can't inform you in time.

264
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,279
So...

265
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,559
we decided to lie.

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Hurry, they're here.

267
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,200
We're good.

268
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,679
Come on.

269
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:34,919
Go!

270
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,559
Go!

271
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,559
Move.

272
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,720
Move.

273
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Move.

274
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,360
- Step aside.
- Stop.

275
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Stop.

276
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,120
Do you guys want a ride?

277
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Thank you, ma'am.

278
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,000
My brother is sick for half a month and couldn't recover.

279
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,600
According to the monks at the temple,

280
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
we have to walk to the temple...

281
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,440
to show our sincerity.

282
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,879
I can't bear to see him in so much pain.

283
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,559
But we have no choice.

284
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,799
Really?

285
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,639
Of course, it's true.

286
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,840
Wait for me at the temple.

287
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,039
These two lads and I...

288
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,159
will walk to the temple together.

289
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,679
Madam, but...

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,559
I've seen every doctor in town.

291
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,039
But Yuan Niang's cough...

292
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,440
is not getting better.

293
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,639
This trip is to pray to Buddha.

294
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,799
This young man is absolutely right.

295
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,840
I have to walk step by step to the temple to show my sincerity.

296
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
You should go.

297
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Yes, Madam.

298
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,639
Madam.

299
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,039
Why don't you let me hold your daughter for you?

300
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,559
How can I trouble you?

301
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,080
No worries. I'm strong.

302
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,360
Here.

303
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,919
Here.

304
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,679
Come on.

305
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,360
- Let's walk together.
- Thank you, Madam.

306
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,519
I used Yuan Niang to make you walk with us.

307
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,759
Because...

308
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,240
in this world,

309
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,440
every mother is willing to sacrifice herself for her children.

310
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,279
Thank you for saving my life.

311
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
I can never repay you.

312
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,519
You're being too courteous, Madam.

313
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,240
Because my mother...

314
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,799
was just like you.

315
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,890
She would do anything for me.

316
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,650
That's true.

317
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,359
If you had used another reason,

318
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,839
I don't think I'll get off the carriage.

319
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,119
But I didn't expect that...

320
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,839
it will cost the coachman's life.

321
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,079
I've wronged the coachman.

322
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,680
Actually, I didn't expect...

323
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,079
the coachman...

324
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,890
to be killed too.

325
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,440
It's those bandits' fault.

326
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
They're too brutal.

327
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,890
It's all right.

328
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,000
You're already doing a good job.

329
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,599
Elder Qin.

330
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,650
Convey my orders.

331
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,960
Make sure to take care of the coachman's funeral.

332
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,480
And from now on,

333
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,119
look after his family.

334
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,440
Yes.

335
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,480
You're indeed a young hero.

336
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,000
It's just that...

337
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,319
is it really just a coincidence?

338
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,279
Governor.

339
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,000
My younger brother and I depended on each other since we were little.

340
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,170
We don't have parents.

341
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,170
After experiencing life and death,

342
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,559
we're already as good as dead.

343
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,170
If I could save your wife's life,

344
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,119
it'll be my utmost honor.

345
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,000
Besides, I've long heard that you are highly respected.

346
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,200
You're strict in rewards and punishments.

347
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,440
You'll surely reward both of us handsomely.

348
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,119
So...

349
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,170
You saved my wife and daughter...

350
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,920
all because you want me to reward you?

351
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Yes.

352
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,799
I did have an ulterior motive.

353
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,410
But all I want is to follow a wise leader.

354
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,000
You think I would keep the two of you by my side...

355
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,720
just because you saved my wife and daughter?

356
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Governor.

357
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,650
My father...

358
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,480
was a former Sui general.

359
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,839
He did nothing great his whole life.

360
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,680
Before he passed away, he asked me to go to the border state...

361
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,890
and do something great.

362
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,279
Besides, I was able to save your wife and daughter.

363
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,759
It wasn't just a coincidence.

364
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,000
Isn't this the fate between you and I?

365
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,410
You have a way with words, young man.

366
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,650
Please get up.

367
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,319
My dear.

368
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,079
Shi Si Lang is the daughter of a former Sui general.

369
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,839
He also saved Yuan Er and I.

370
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,799
He's somehow related to the Gongsun family.

371
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,119
The two lads have nowhere to go.

372
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,960
- How about...
- Thank you for taking us in, Madam.

373
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,480
You two have saved...

374
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,170
my wife and daughter's life.

375
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,759
How can I say no?

376
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,480
Since you're willing to stay,

377
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,920
you may have the room in the backyard.

378
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,359
What happens in the future,

379
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,039
we'll discuss it later.

380
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,890
Thank you, Governor.

381
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,240
It has been so long since I slept on such a comfortable bed.

382
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,599
Master.

383
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,119
So we've succeeded.

384
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,920
Gongsun Heng loves his wife and daughter dearly.

385
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,359
Naturally, we'll be treated well.

386
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,079
But to get him to trust me,

387
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,799
it won't be easy.

388
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,519
Then why did he ask us to stay?

389
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,890
It's all because of his wife.

390
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,920
That means he still has doubts about us.

391
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,200
At least he doesn't trust us.

392
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,519
It's hard to trust someone.

393
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,720
He knows that as well.

394
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,519
No matter what,

395
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,519
we've succeeded in the first step of our plan.

396
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,319
Next, we need to obtain Gongsun Heng's trust.

397
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,890
Then we'll take control of the military...

398
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,319
and start a revolt.

399
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,759
Keep the secret to yourself.

400
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,839
What do you think?

401
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,480
Those two lads...

402
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,650
saved Madam and Yuan Niang.

403
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,839
That alone...

404
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,039
They've gotten your weakness right away.

405
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,519
These two boys are smart.

406
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
They're also very brave.

407
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,119
But...

408
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,680
they're also witty and cunning.

409
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,759
Don't worry, Master.

410
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,720
I'll pay special attention to them.

411
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,240
The nation is in turmoil.

412
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
War is imminent.

413
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,839
We need people to help us too.

414
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,559
If they're being honest...

415
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,599
about earning some recognition,

416
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,599
then they are at the right place.

417
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,119
But...

418
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,640
We still have to be careful.

419
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,279
Since we don't know what will happen,

420
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,480
then let's leave it to fate.

421
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,519
As for the peace in the manor,

422
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,720
worry not, Master.

423
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,559
I'll protect them with all my might.

424
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,559
Isn't this Prince Sun?

425
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,559
What is it?

426
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,359
I have a question for Prince Sun.

427
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,680
Shuozhou is right in front of us.

428
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
When do you plan to take it down?

429
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
To attack or not?

430
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,559
When to attack?

431
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,279
It's all up to me.

432
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,359
It's just a small town.

433
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,839
How long do you need to consider?

434
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,759
Are you scared?

435
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,839
It's just a small border state.

436
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,640
But back then, even Shu Le Khan can't take it down.

437
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,039
Try to take it down if you can.

438
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,160
That's because back then,

439
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,200
Shu Le Khan didn't have any valiant warriors.

440
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,519
I'm right here.

441
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,519
I've taken down countless cities that are tougher than this.

442
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,000
What if we fail?

443
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,440
Will the Bear Army take full responsibility?

444
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,680
How could we fail?

445
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,480
You haven't even attacked yet.

446
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,920
Why should we take responsibility?

447
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,200
My army will be leading this attack.

448
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,440
All you need to do is cooperate with us.

449
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,000
That way, we will not fail.

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,200
I'm counting on the Bear Army then.

451
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,200
All right.

452
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,559
Get two sets of Central Plain’s clothes ready.

453
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,559
Are you going to Shuozhou?

454
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,039
Know yourself and your enemy, and you will never be in danger.

455
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,039
(Prefectural Governor's Manor)

456
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,359
Good girl.

457
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,359
Give me a hug.

458
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,240
Yuan Niang.

459
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,119
Let's go back.

460
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,559
I want Shi Si Lang.

461
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,400
- Shi Si Lang.
- Madam has made you...

462
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,680
some delicious rice cakes.

463
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,799
- Shi Si Lang.
- What's going on?

464
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,519
They're obviously watching out for us.

465
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,319
There's nothing wrong with being defensive.

466
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,240
Let's go out.

467
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,599
Maybe we'll make a new discovery.

468
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,440
Are you going to get information from bandits again?

469
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,160
Some things should not be mentioned again.

470
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,839
Governor, there's an uneven distribution...

471
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,160
of reclaimed wasteland in Chengdong.

472
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,400
There are arguments.

473
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,640
They're begging to see you.

474
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,759
It's not a big deal.

475
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,799
You can just get anyone to handle it for you.

476
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,440
It's not a small matter.

477
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,720
We can divide and register the land into even sizes.

478
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,160
And distribute based on the number of adult men in one family.

479
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,599
Any undistributed lands will be managed by the government.

480
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,519
They can claim their share of land when younger boys reach adolescence.

481
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,880
What do you think?

482
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,079
Do as he says.

483
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,119
Yes.

484
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,519
Good morning, Governor.

485
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,079
You know politics.

486
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,160
A little.

487
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,400
When did you learn it?

488
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,039
My father is a low-ranking official.

489
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,440
I was influenced by him.

490
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,200
All right. Let me ask you.

491
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,759
There has been a back-channeler dealing with the Hu merchant.

492
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,079
What do you think?

493
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,400
Dealing with foreign merchants is inevitable.

494
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,559
Both parties are only getting what they need.

495
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,920
That's how you make a living.

496
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,440
Actually, you shouldn't eliminate them all at once.

497
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,480
But we have to control the type of item sold and their amount.

498
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,200
Basically, have a general control over the transactions made.

499
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,960
Decisions can be made accordingly if the circumstances allow.

500
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,319
If I didn't hear it myself,

501
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,240
I can't believe this is coming from you.

502
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
You've flattered me, Governor.

503
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,839
I'm nothing compared to you.

504
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,880
Where are you two going?

505
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,240
My brother and I are new in town.

506
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,559
We are planning to take a spin around...

507
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,960
and see out what's interesting.

508
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,920
We'd also like to learn about the customs of this place.

509
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,160
All right, you guys go ahead.

510
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Yes.

511
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,359
- You heard him.
- Yes.

512
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,759
What do you think?

513
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,440
You always value talents.

514
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,720
I think you're very tempted this time.

515
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,039
Yes.

516
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,240
If my subordinates had been as talented as him,

517
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,680
then I would have much lesser things to worry about each day.

518
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Elder Qin.

519
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,400
- Follow them.
- Yes.

520
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:27,759
Your Highness.

521
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,599
You can't let this slide.

522
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,160
Mr. Du.

523
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,519
The Crown Princess just made this plum cake.

524
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,079
Try one.

525
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,480
Wei Zheng just arrived in Cizhou.

526
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,400
And he met up with Li Jian Cheng's former subordinate,

527
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,480
Li Zhi An right away.

528
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,200
Li Yuan Ji's guards, Li Si Xing who was previously imprisoned...

529
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,519
was also released on the spot.

530
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,519
And these two men disappeared in an instant.

531
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,160
They've got some nerve.

532
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,960
Please summon Wei back immediately and punish him, Your Highness.

533
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,680
That's not right, Mr. Du.

534
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,400
I remember you were the one...

535
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,440
who incited him to take this job.

536
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,000
I wanted him to calm down Hebei.

537
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,039
I didn't tell him to release the prisoners along the way.

538
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,359
What's more, it's a military officer who can lead the army.

539
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
It's fine.

540
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,480
Your Highness.

541
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,680
Mr. Wei's action reminds me of someone.

542
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,599
There's someone more eccentric than Wei Zheng?

543
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,960
Your Highness, please tell us.

544
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,880
A Qi man from the Warring States period, Feng Xuan.

545
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,359
Yes.

546
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,240
The man who won the people's hearts by burning bonds, Feng Xuan.

547
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,559
He's indeed an extraordinary person.

548
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,119
Feng Xuan had only burned bonds.

549
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,519
But the man whom Wei Zheng released...

550
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,200
was a warrior who can fight.

551
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,039
Get the Central Secretariat to convey my orders.

552
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,759
Inform the East Palace and Prince of Qi before June 4...

553
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,559
and Li Yuan before June 17...

554
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:57,960
that no one should punish Wei Zheng.

555
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,440
Any offenders will be punished.

556
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,480
Please reconsider, Your Highness.

557
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,799
If even reporting is forbidden,

558
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,799
then Wei's gang will be even more brazen.

559
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,160
Wei Zheng might find this encouraging.

560
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,119
He might even release Wang Jun Kuo.

561
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,759
Have a look.

562
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,200
"I can't be selfish."

563
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
"I have to think of the nation."

564
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,200
"It's a great honor to work for Your Highness."

565
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,440
"I have to repay your kindness and contribute to this country."

566
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,359
How cheesy.

567
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,119
As for Wang Jun Kuo,

568
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,880
send in a team of strong men and take him to the capital...

569
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,759
so that no one finds him suspicious.

570
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,359
Don't mention anything about him going to jail or repent.

571
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,240
Just say he has been ordered to enter the capital.

572
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
I'll do it right away.

573
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,119
Mr. Fang.

574
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,000
Do you have any news about Le Yan?

575
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,720
Do you think...

576
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
the heaven is punishing me?

577
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,119
I've lost Chang Ge.

578
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,480
Do you want me to lose Yan Er too?

579
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,240
Your Highness.

580
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,240
Don't overthink it.

581
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,480
Princess Yong'an and Princess Yongning...

582
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,440
will come back safely.

583
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,920
I will send more men to look for them.

584
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,359
Girl.

585
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,440
You're pretty smart.

586
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Hai Lao.

587
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,039
Look, Hai Lao.

588
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,160
I even brought wine.

589
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,200
Great.

590
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,680
This roast chicken is especially delicious.

591
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,039
Smell it. It smells good, right?

592
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,079
- Good.
- Let me pour you some wine.

593
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,519
It's very aromatic.

594
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,720
All right.

595
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,559
Mr. Ma Zi, please have a drink.

596
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,839
Cheers.

597
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,880
Cheers.

598
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,759
- One more glass.
- Fill it.

599
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,880
Here.

600
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,920
One more.

601
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,400
Fill it up.

602
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,759
Cheers.

603
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,039
Le Yan.

604
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,039
You want to run away?

605
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,200
If they find out,

606
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,599
they'll kill you.

607
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,440
It was so hard to get them drunk.

608
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,160
It's now or never.

609
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,000
Perhaps tomorrow I'll be sold off as a limbless beggar.

610
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,440
If you don't want to,

611
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,559
don't blame me for not bringing you.

612
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,119
But...

613
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,720
I'll go with you.

614
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,160
That's what sisters are for.

615
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,240
Be careful.

616
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,640
Su Su!

617
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,839
They locked the doors.

618
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,920
How can we get out of here?

619
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,640
Here.

620
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,400
Look, Le Yan.

621
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,559
There's a hole there.

622
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,559
But it's too high up.

623
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,599
We can't reach it.

624
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,160
Yes, we can, Su Su.

625
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,680
There are two of us.

626
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,839
Right, Le Yan.

627
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,960
I'll go first.

628
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,640
Help me get out of here first.

629
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,240
Then I'll save you, all right?

630
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,799
Le Yan.

631
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,839
Be quiet.

632
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,599
Ma Zi is still sleeping outside.

633
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,680
Stay put for a while.

634
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
I'll be right back.

635
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,119
But you...

636
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Su Su.

637
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,119
The two of them have been wandering around in town aimlessly.

638
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,119
They didn't do anything strange.

639
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,599
They bought a lot of snacks...

640
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,639
and gave to the beggars at the temple.

641
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,880
They said it's Governor Gongsun's order.

642
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,079
There's nothing suspicious.

643
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,639
The people are grateful to the Governor.

644
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:39,400
Forget it.

645
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,519
Stop tailing them.

646
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,559
You've been exposed.

647
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,960
You may leave.

648
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,039
You don't have to follow them anymore.

649
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,119
Understood.

650
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,480
- Elder Qin.
- Elder Qin.

651
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,809
You're back.

652
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,519
How's your stay in Shuozhou?

653
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,639
It's great.

654
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,920
We walked around the town today.

655
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,289
There's good food in town.

656
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:12,400
It's fun too.

657
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,920
That's good.

658
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,360
There's news from the capital.

659
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,880
I should report it to the Governor.

660
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,119
I should go now.

661
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,360
Call me if you need anything.

662
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,519
We won't stall you, Elder Qin.

663
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,880
Is it about Chang'an?

664
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,159
I think so.

665
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,039
Then let's...

666
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:36,769
Let's go inside first.

667
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,840
If Li Shi Min is publicly searching for us,

668
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,679
he would've already informed all the states.

669
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,289
He doesn't have to wait until now.

670
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,809
I'm afraid something worse is about to happen.

671
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,719
To eliminate the Gu Tribe,

672
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,329
cooperate with the Luo Tribe to besiege Wu City.

673
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,769
Cheng Zhi Jie and Li Shi Ji have been at war for months.

674
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,960
Yan Li actually has so much control over Tang's army.

675
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,559
Is he trying to...

676
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,079
What a big ambition.

677
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,769
With your martial arts skills,

678
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,920
you must have an extraordinary background.

679
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,719
You're well hidden in the Prefectural Governor's Manor.

680
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,329
A butler is actually an expert.

681
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,920
Did the Governor send you?

682
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,960
You're wrong.

683
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,880
My master never keeps someone he doesn't trust.

684
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:44,000
But I had to act careless.

685
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,559
Otherwise, you wouldn't be so fearless.

686
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,960
You're not from Longxi, are you?

687
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I've been away from the Central Plain for too long.

688
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,639
I know the Longxi accent very well.

689
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Although you copied it very well,

690
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,440
there's still a difference.

691
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,239
Who exactly are you?

692
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,960
I let it slip on purpose.

693
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,809
You tailed me here after I told you there's news from the capital.

694
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,679
A spy from the north?

695
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,039
The Military Governor's department?

696
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:19,079
Or are you from Chang'an?

697
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:28,159
You're the imperial court's man.

698
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,400
Are you here to take back the Governor's military power?

699
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,360
The imperial court has always been worried...

700
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,239
about Governor Gongsun's military power.

701
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,519
But you should understand.

702
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,000
Shuozhou can stand strong until today...

703
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:43,599
wasn't because of the imperial court.

704
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,809
You can check out Shuozhou.

705
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,440
How are the people living here?

706
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,480
And compare it with the people of the other states.

707
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,639
It's not an easy task to make such a mundane land a prosperous town.

708
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,639
You're overthinking it.

709
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,599
I'm not from the imperial court.

710
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,559
I'm here to find a place to live.

711
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,809
I lied about my Longxi background...

712
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:10,480
so that the Governor would take us in.

713
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,599
Forgive me for lying.

714
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,559
I'm not interested in looking into your past.

715
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,639
And I don't care what you want.

716
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,039
Leave the Gongsun family alone.

717
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,000
And I will leave you alone.

718
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,199
You're a smart guy.

719
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,329
You better behave yourself.

720
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,289
This is bad.

721
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,000
They knew that Su Su had escaped.

722
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,719
Don't be afraid.

723
00:40:58,329 --> 00:40:59,769
You're better than her.

724
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,360
You won't end up like her.

725
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,079
I came to see you today.

726
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,159
I want to discuss something with you.

727
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:15,639
Please tell me.

728
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,809
I thought about it over the past few days.

729
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,289
If you don't mind,

730
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,719
can you stay and be my registrar?

731
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,289
Your brother, Dou,

732
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,880
can be your assistant.

733
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,679
What's wrong?

734
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,840
Are you feeling inferior?

735
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,920
No.

736
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,239
I...

737
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,159
I thank you for taking us in, Governor Gongsun.

738
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,920
Great.

739
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:47,119
This is my personal guard, Xu Feng.

740
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,769
- Mr. Xu.
- Mr. Li.

741
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,000
All right.

742
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:56,960
The Military Governor has invited me over to his place.

743
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,769
I'll get going then.

744
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,880
The Governor admired your talent.

745
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,840
And we need manpower right now.

746
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,289
So we can't care about anything else.

747
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:17,199
But I'll repeat what I said.

748
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,329
Leave the Gongsun family alone.

749
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,239
And I will leave you alone.

750
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:23,400
You have misunderstood us.

751
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,400
From now on, I'll devote my heart and soul to the Governor.
