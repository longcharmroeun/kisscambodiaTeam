5
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,820
Senior Sister,


6
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,750
the last sword token to 
 be brought into the Graveyard of Gods


7
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,530
must be mine.


8
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,160
[Huang Shuli, the Illusory Demon Sect]


9
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,390
How arrogant!


10
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,750
Just because you think you're talented


11
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,140
doesn't mean you can defeat me.


12
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,570
Try me.


13
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,380
I can't bear leaving you.


14
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,430
Forgive me if I don't look at you.


15
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,510
I will always miss you, father.


16
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,820
Take care.


17
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,380
Pan Qianqian,


18
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,260
The Land of Chaos consists of five continents.


19
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,310
This is your first trial,


20
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,820
Heavenly Calamity Continent.


21
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,230
What are the other four?


22
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,020
Wait till you pass the first one.


23
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,660
The Land of Chaos is controlled by different clans.


24
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,950
You must be familiar with two of them.


25
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,150
The Terminator Sect.


26
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,350
Who uses the Terminator Profound Bomb?


27
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,460
Exactly.


28
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,230
It's a secret weapon


29
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,340
of this clan.


30
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,590
No wonder Master Mohai said


31
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,100
it's not from


32
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,900
the Scarlet Tide Continent.


33
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,100
He is really learned.


34
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,100
The other is the Celestial Artefact Sect.


35
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,900
Forefathers of the Armament Sect?


36
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,510
I'm the Senior Sister of the Armament Sect.


37
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,940
I suppose we can become allies.


38
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,460
Wait till you get to


39
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,870
fight with them.


40
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,710
Of course,


41
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,420
there's another power,


42
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,900
the Heavenly Sword Sect.


43
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,260
Please take our respect.


44
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,100
The first task on the Heavenly Calamity Continent


45
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,590
is the Graveyard of Gods.


46
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,900
That doesn't sound like a safe place.


47
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,260
One could easily die there.


48
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,630
It opens every ten years.


49
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,470
The best students from each sect


50
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,710
will be given sword tokens and enter it.


51
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,060
How...how many could survive this?


52
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,910
Less than one


53
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,650
out of ten.


54
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,710
No one knows how dangerous


55
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:34,990
the Graveyard can be.


56
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,100
One can only get out safely


57
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,590
if they're acknowledged by
 the Demon Sealing Tombstone.


58
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,780
It is said that the Tombstone


59
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,090
is a legacy of Gongmu Lie.


60
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,300
Gongmu Lie?


61
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,659
But no one knows


62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,630
whether he ever really existed.


63
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,380
Who owns the Tombstone now?


64
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,260
It has never acknowledged any master.


65
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,870
Sir,


66
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,990
why is this place called the Land of Chaos?


67
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,750
It's easy to understand.


68
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,470
Because it is


69
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,100
chaotic.


70
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,870
You'll get to know what that means


71
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,220
as soon as you go down there.


72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,430
You must remember.


73
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,780
Do not try to be a hero.


74
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,380
You're indeed powerful.


75
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,750
Both of your fathers are from the 
 Fragmentation Realm.


76
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,630
But the leaders here all belong to
  the Imperishable Realm.


77
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,780
Two levels higher.


78
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,590
Li, I heard that there's also a Nether Race


79
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,909
living on the Land of Chaos?


80
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,990
Yes, you're right.


81
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,540
One of its clan, the Ghost Eye Race


82
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,780
live peacefully with the Human Race there.


83
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,820
What do they look like?


84
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,540
Like the Horned Demon Race?


85
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,870
You'll know when you go down there.


86
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,540
What matters most is that


87
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,780
have you got enough spirit stones?


88
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,220
Yes, we have.


89
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,990
You don't look like locals.


90
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,580
Do you need a guide?


91
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,100
Let the Ghost Eye Race show you 
 around Dark Jade City.


92
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,340
If you take us with you


93
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,860
to Dark Jade City,


94
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,220
we can give the most comprehensive


95
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,430
and detailed information


96
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,310
about the Land of Chaos.


97
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,150
What lovely kids!


98
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,060
We're not kids.


99
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,030
We're the Ghost Eye Race.


100
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,310
We're much older than kids.


101
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,780
People of our race are born


102
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,630
to have the shortest bodies.


103
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,780
We have great wisdom.


104
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,100
My name is La Pu.


105
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,150
I'm La Fei.


106
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,380
I'm La Er.


107
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,870
We're well-informed.


108
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,260
If there's something that we don't know,


109
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,540
no one else


110
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,870
could.


111
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,740
Are you heading to the Graveyard of Gods?


112
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,820
Do you need a guide?


113
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,150
How do you know


114
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,470
we're not locals?


115
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,940
Because we're clever.


116
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,500
We know as soon as we saw you.


117
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,190
And I know


118
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,100
you must have the sword tokens 
 from Heavenly Sword Mountain.


119
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,140
The floating island where


120
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,500
Li Mu kept the Sixth Heavenly Sword


121
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,909
has just passed by.


122
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,150
You appeared right at this time.


123
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,340
But you don't even know about us.


124
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,190
You landed here


125
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,870
without knowing who we are.


126
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,780
We quickly figured out


127
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,500
you must be the famous five


128
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,660
everyone's talking about recently.


129
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,190
We're famous?


130
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,380
Sure.


131
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,660
You possess five sword tokens.


132
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,100
It's said that Li Mu


133
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,750
did you a favour


134
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,030
on the Scarlet Tide Continent.


135
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,220
Let's go.


136
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,430
I get to like the Ghost Eye Race.


137
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,430
Me, too.


138
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,100
Dark Jade City is ruled by


139
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,220
five Silver rank forces.


140
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,830
Different forces and races


141
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,780
trade with each other here


142
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,190
because of the Graveyard of Gods.


143
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,270
It's a busy place.


144
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,660
I heard that you don't welcome outsiders?


145
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,700
People on the Land are rather tolerable.


146
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,580
Indeed.


147
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,270
But this is a place for the mighty.


148
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,390
Battles and wars


149
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,900
take place on a daily basis.


150
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,340
That's how the Land of Chaos


151
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,270
got its name.


152
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,510
What do you want?


153
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,660
Do you know


154
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,580
what kind of warriors


155
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,220
will the five Silver rank forces send?


156
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,540
Of course.


157
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,780
Keep up. Let me tell you.


158
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,140
If you see anything good


159
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,270
as we walk along,


160
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,460
I can introduce them for you.


161
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
You can buy whatever you like.


162
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,900
Do you get commission


163
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,220
if we buy what you recommend?


164
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,870
Of course.


165
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,460
Ladies,


166
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,780
what you like must be different


167
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,430
from what the gentlemen do.


168
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,430
Shall we


169
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,220
show you around the other side of the street?


170
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,510
Cunning kids.


171
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,430
You worry that we might stop them


172
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,020
from shopping?


173
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,750
First, we're not kids.


174
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,390
We're the Ghost Eyes Race.


175
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,020
Second, that's what men are like.


176
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,070
Let's go.


177
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,870
Wanna go with me alone?


178
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,630
I notice that you don't talk much.


179
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,860
No one talks to you either.


180
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,900
What do you think?


181
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,510
Wanna buy a Demon Sealing Tombstone?


182
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,540
This was the secret weapon


183
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,310
used by Gongmu Lie in the war.


184
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
Tourists would always


185
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,190
buy some as souvenirs.


186
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,580
Wanna buy some, ladies?


187
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,220
Do you believe


188
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,700
Gongmu Lie really existed?


189
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,460
It's not a matter of what we believe.


190
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,450
The point is


191
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,980
we can earn money from his tale.


192
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,310
You buy this for yourself


193
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,950
or for him?


194
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,580
Who's he?


195
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,740
It's none of your business, kid.


196
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,060
It's the Ghost Eye Race!


197
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,950
It's none of your business, either.


198
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,070
Tingyu,


199
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,300
this is your life.


200
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,060
Why don't you just go for your love?


201
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,460
If you don't take action now,


202
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,580
he will be taken by Ling Yushi soon.


203
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,900
Qin Lie and Du Shaoyang


204
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,140
are both men with visions.


205
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,430
They won't waste time on relationships.


206
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,220
Although Du Shaoyang


207
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,690
may love you,


208
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,140
he won't stay for you.


209
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,190
He's eager to have power.


210
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,780
Qin Lie is also the same.


211
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,780
He won't bother himself with love.


212
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,390
You really don't care about


213
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,990
your true feelings deep inside?


214
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,190
I made my pursuit of love.


215
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,780
I got it. I was in love.


216
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,340
I never regret it.


217
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,630
What about you?


218
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,870
Don't you want to be loved?


219
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,020
Have a look.


220
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,750
Wrap them up for me.


221
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,750
OK.


222
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,390
That's great.


223
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,190
Why are they in a hurry?


224
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,020
Do you know why?


225
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,630
We don't know at the moment.


226
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,220
We will know in a bit.


227
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,820
We have a secret art.


228
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,870
We can get information from plants.


229
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,540
We can also get news


230
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,510
from other people of our race.


231
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,830
Of course, we need to charge for this.


232
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,070
Fine. Go ahead and ask.


233
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,070
It turned out that the gate of the 
 Graveyard has been opened.


234
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,020
How lucky we are.


235
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,310
Only those from the Manifestation Realm


236
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,750
are allowed to enter.


237
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,220
It's easy to get in


238
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,830
but difficult to get out.


239
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,700
Don't even enter if you're afraid of death.


240
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,780
How about we find a tavern


241
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,010
for you to rest inside?


242
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,230
[The Tavern of the Blue Star Association]


243
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,190
You charge for more than 
 50 premium spirit stones


244
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,700
just because we asked you a few questions


245
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,780
and you showed us around the city?


246
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,510
That's our price.


247
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,750
Why didn't you tell us earlier?


248
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,630
You didn't ask.


249
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,870
Stop quarrelling.


250
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,510
Shame on you.


251
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,510
I haven't decided to pay as 
 the Mayor of Purple Mist Sea.


252
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,750
How dare you, as a former Pavilion Master,


253
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,770
to act on behalf of me?


254
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,630
Twenty stones.


255
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,070
Take it or leave it.


256
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,310
Cheapskates.


257
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,990
That's unfair.


258
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,020
They're not stingy.


259
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,630
They're just pretending to be rich.


260
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,750
I didn't expect


261
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,740
things are so expensive here.


262
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,990
Will it cost more


263
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,100
if we stay in a tavern?


264
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,780
Let's ask around first.


265
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,270
The room I showed you is the dining hall.


266
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,900
Let me take you to the Heaven Room.


267
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,870
It was designed by


268
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,340
Master Ru himself.


269
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,580
It's beautiful.


270
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,430
Every item is the only one in the world.


271
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,460
Sects from the five Silver rank forces


272
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,700
have all stayed here. It's top-rated.


273
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,700
Sir.


274
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,870
What's the price for one day?


275
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,650
Five hundred premium spirit stones.


276
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,830
Five hundred?


277
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,540
That's a little expensive.


278
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,460
How about I show you the Earth Room?


279
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,950
It's not as good as this one, though.


280
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,780
Still, it was highly praised


281
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,620
by our distinguished guests.


282
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,660
How much then?


283
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,990
One hundred premium spirit stones a day.


284
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,630
One hundred?


285
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,220
I'll pay for it.


286
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,740
Wait a minute.


287
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,950
We don't know how long we will stay here.


288
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,990
Save some money, Miss.


289
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,750
Do you have cheaper rooms, sir?


290
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,650
We only have the Secular Room then.


291
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,540
Everyone can afford it.


292
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,500
It only costs fifty premium spirit stones.


293
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,870
Can you make it cheaper?


294
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,190
How much can you


295
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,780
afford then?


296
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,940
500 medium-grade spirit stones.


297
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,190
How could you pay me with medium-grade stones?


298
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,010
Piss off.


299
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,750
Don't mess around.


300
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,990
I didn't expect a saintess like you


301
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,830
would become a poor mouth one day.


302
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,700
No wonder Uncle Li


303
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,430
asked us to take more spirit stones with us.


304
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,100
Shall we go to another tavern?


305
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,950
Same price everywhere else. However,


306
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,390
if you've got the sword tokens,


307
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,310
you can use them as a mortgage here.


308
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,140
We can let you stay in the Heaven Room for free.


309
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,950
How do you know we've got the sword tokens?


310
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,460
It looks like everyone's well-informed here.


311
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,220
Let's leave here.


312
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,630
Wanna leave? You wish.


313
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,070
What do you mean?


314
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,870
Leave the sword tokens 
and show yourselves out.


315
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,140
Fight or flight?


316
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,770
Fight, of course.


317
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,310
You guys from the Scarlet Tide Continent


318
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,020
are not bad, huh?


319
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,430
Those little bastards of the Ghost Eye Race


320
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,990
took our spirit stones without telling us.


321
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,300
It's them who betrayed us.


322
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,700
I like them.


323
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,700
I'm from Blue Star Association!


324
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,300
It's part of Heavenly Sword Mountain.


325
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,060
If you hurt me,


326
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,819
they won't let you go.


327
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,510
Wanna try us now?


328
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,700
My lady...Master, please don't.


329
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,390
We're appointed by Li Mu of Heavenly Sword Mountain.


330
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,550
Do you want us to


331
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,500
invite him here?


332
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,460
I don't dare to.


333
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,670
There could be many


334
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,870
who are trying to take our tokens.


335
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Take care.


336
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,220
Let's go.


337
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,910
The Graveyard of Gods hasn't opened yet.


338
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,270
Let's just wait.


339
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,580
Who're you thinking of?


340
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,150
Why should you ask?


341
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,630
You tell me then.


342
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,450
Ma'am,


343
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,180
you've won the trust of our people.


344
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,500
That's a huge responsibility.


345
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,550
I need to take it seriously.


346
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,630
Mother of Earth has the power


347
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,580
to change landscapes


348
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,580
and create flowers, bushes


349
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,990
and trees,


350
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,420
even lakes.


351
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,030
You've made it.


352
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,290
That's such a big power


353
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,270
inside you.


354
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,990
I finally understand


355
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,870
why I grew spirit plants


356
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,940
better than others.


357
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,420
I believe


358
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,940
one day,


359
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,750
you're going to take us back to the ground.


360
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,700
I can enjoy


361
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,940
the sunshine then.


362
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,670
I'm not sure about this.


363
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,460
But since you trust me so much,


364
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,550
I don't know what to say.


365
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,390
Ma'am,


366
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,420
don't worry.


367
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,930
The Nether Race will always support you.


368
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,690
The Human Race


369
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,510
are born to be greedy and brutal.


370
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,860
Although they didn't hurt us


371
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,100
when I returned via the teleportation formation


372
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,870
in the Purple Mist Sea,


373
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,060
I believe


374
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,420
it was only because they were afraid of


375
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,510
the Heavenly Sword Sect.


376
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,630
The Profound Heaven Alliance 
 and the Eight Extreme Temple


377
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,820
were greatly undermined.


378
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,580
But for the help of Li Mu


379
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,700
and the secret escort of the Master of Frost,


380
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,870
they would have exterminated us all.


381
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,060
We need to thank Qin Lie, after all.


382
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,940
He had begged the Master of Frost to help us.


383
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,150
He can't expect us


384
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,940
to stop holding grudges against him just because of this.


385
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,790
Granny,


386
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,030
I don't want to launch another war.


387
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,820
First,


388
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,940
people will suffer.


389
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,340
We need time to recuperate.


390
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,630
Second,


391
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,100
they will only fight back more fiercely


392
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,390
if we ever win over them.


393
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,060
What if they


394
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,750
wage war against us first?


395
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,900
We'll never give in.


396
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,510
I'll never go easy on them


397
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,580
even if I have to turn the Land into ruins.


398
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,670
So I need to cultivate the 
 Scripture of Nine Hells as soon as possible.


399
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,750
The power of the strongest race


400
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,910
is already in your blood.


401
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,030
You need to take it slowly, even if you're desperate.


402
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,390
You can't rush with your cultivation.


403
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,580
I can't take it slowly.


404
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,390
I said I need to destroy them.


405
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,150
How can I just pose around


406
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,180
without having real power


407
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,750
by that time?


408
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,460
You made me so angry


409
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,060
by asking Li Mu to invite me here,


410
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,450
no matter whether it's because you have pity on me


411
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,420
or you just want to motivate me.


412
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,790
But this time,


413
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,270
I really want to say thank you.


414
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,300
Thank you for taking me to such a beautiful place.


415
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,580
It's only the territory of Silver rank forces.


416
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,790
I wonder what that of


417
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,340
the Gold rank forces will be like.


418
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,820
The gate is about to open. Come down.


419
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,700
Wait. Wait.


420
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,870
The gate of the Graveyard will open twice today,


421
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,460
with a two-hour interval.


422
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,580
I need to tell you something


423
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,690
before you go in.


424
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,780
It's really important.


425
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,750
It's a life-and-death matter.


426
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,390
How much do you want?


427
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,550
One thousand.


428
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,460
Wait.


429
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,180
It's hard to get out alive.


430
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,100
I suppose you will all die in there.


431
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,910
Do you need those spirit stones 
 as your grave goods?


432
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,790
Why don't you spare us some?


433
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,420
Two hundred. That's what I can give.


434
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,180
Give me.


435
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,210
I was going to offer only 50.


436
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,300
The gate is open.


437
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,940
Tell us.


438
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,300
You need to join hands before you enter


439
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,220
so that you won't get carried away


440
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,630
by strong winds.


441
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,820
You should have known what to do


442
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,150
if you had watched them do it.


443
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,270
You could have saved 200.


444
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,900
Put Tang Siqi down.


445
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,180
Hurry up.


446
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,790
Du Shaoyang, save her.


447
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,270
Hurry up.


448
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,750
Chu Li?


449
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,300
Among the students of all sects,


450
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,820
one must be mentioned.


451
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,390
Chu Li.


452
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,180
The genius of the Terminator Sect.


453
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,220
This guy is grumpy.


454
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,930
He always carries a lot of 
 Terminator Profound Bombs.


455
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,990
He sets them off


456
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,990
whatever his mood.


457
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,210
You can easily recognise him.


458
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,180
The fur of snow wolves


459
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,220
are precious on the Land of Chaos.


460
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,580
If you see someone


461
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,630
wearing a snow wolf fur coat,


462
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,780
that must be him.


463
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,810
I finally find you.


464
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,990
Move aside.


465
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,620
I finally find you.


466
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,550
Qin Lie,


467
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,460
did you get the Demon Sealing Tombstone?


468
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,420
Yes.


469
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,620
Let me see it.


470
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,460
You're not Qin Lie.


471
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,870
You're from the Illusory Demon Sect.


472
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,660
The Illusory Demon Sect are good at illusory arts.


473
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,510
It is rumoured that


474
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,060
she can transform herself into a dozen of appearances.


475
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,700
Her bewildering art


476
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,990
is the most terrifying.


477
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,270
She can transform herself into


478
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,750
the person you love and befuddle you.


479
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,910
You love him


480
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,940
but you could still break my charm.


481
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,870
That man I love


482
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,940
would either blame me if I act rashly


483
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,180
or ask me if I get hurt.


484
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,550
He wouldn't just ask me for a 
 Demon Sealing Tombstone.


485
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,870
Just like La Fei told us,


486
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,700
you're good at illusory arts but not martial arts.


487
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,630
Where can you hide?


488
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,510
Chu Li,


489
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,820
let's deal with her!


490
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,790
Shu Li,


491
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,100
are you alright?


492
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,790
Leave her to me.


493
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,100
Stop right there.


494
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,910
Try me if you want her to die.


495
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,670
What're you doing?


496
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,390
If you drink that,


497
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,340
I can let her survive.


498
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,300
I'm afraid you won't let her go


499
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,390
even if I drank this.


500
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,390
Stop it!


501
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,550
You can choose to leave


502
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,750
or drink that wine.


503
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,900
This is not toxic.


504
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,390
Do you know what poison your woman got?


505
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,630
If you want to detoxify her, drink it.


506
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,420
I would very much like to see


507
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,910
how you two survive this.


508
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,100
Shaoyang, leave!


509
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,420
Du Shaoyang...Du...


510
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,820
All dead.


511
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,910
How powerful.


512
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:49,990
Save me!


513
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,820
I haven't been to the Graveyard.


514
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,390
I can't just die.


515
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,460
Shaoyang, no!


516
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,100
I can pay you back now.


517
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,990
Siqi,


518
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,150
you need to thank me for it.


519
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,270
But for me, how could you save her?


520
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,340
They were cunning.


521
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,150
They pretended to be dead and ambushed me!


522
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,340
Shaoyang, just leave.


523
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,060
You're ambushed.


524
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,510
Yeah.


525
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,390
Yiyuan, tell us


526
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,790
about how they ambushed you.


527
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,330
I entered the tavern as soon as you did.


528
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,670
I thought you killed that servant.


529
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,940
I was about to praise you.


530
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,550
I didn't expect they caught me off guard


531
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,990
and got me under a massive net.


532
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,340
You plotted this?


533
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,630
Yes.


534
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,630
I was wondering just now


535
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,179
how could you be knocked off easily


536
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,790
by a Blue Start Association member


537
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,310
since you're so powerful.


538
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,590
I didn't think too much


539
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,860
since I remembered Li Mu


540
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,420
had told us everyone is talented here.


541
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,790
You stopped me from getting the Tombstone?


542
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,219
Yes.


543
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,750
I asked Song Tingyu to distract you.


544
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,219
You had been taking advantage of me.


545
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Alright.


546
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,989
If you still want the Tombstone,


547
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,699
go and get it.


548
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,860
You helped Qin Lie to stop me


549
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,219
just because I had lied to you?


550
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,550
You lied to me today.


551
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,900
Are we even now?


552
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,030
No.


553
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,510
I lied to you, not for revenge.


554
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,260
I always know what you're like.


555
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,270
I know what you desire.


556
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,380
Since...


557
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,700
Since you know I want the Tombstone,


558
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,550
why would you help Qin Lie then?


559
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,380
I didn't want you to make any more mistakes.


560
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,990
Shaoyang,


561
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,070
I know what it is like


562
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,420
to be betrayed by someone.


563
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,380
You get to know now.


564
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,700
Qin Lie still chose to stay with you


565
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,660
after so many betrayals.


566
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,750
I don't want you to regret it.


567
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,790
Regret what?


568
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,890
He never takes me as his friend.


569
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,980
I never want to stay with him.


570
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,830
We're destined to be enemies.


571
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,110
From what I observed,


572
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,110
you trusted each other at Nebula Pavilion.


573
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,650
You worked well together in the Armament Sect.


574
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,700
You are good brothers


575
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,610
who get each other's back.


576
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,180
Shaoyang,


577
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,030
why can't you give up those grudges?


578
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,590
When you both achieve great things,


579
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,900
you can have a good competition then.


580
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,220
I'll be there to cheer for you.


581
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,940
Why don't you care about me?


582
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,180
I've been turned into a snake.


583
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,510
When can I recover my body?


584
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,700
Don't you worry that


585
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,660
I might be cooked in a soup?


586
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,900
Lianrou, I miss you.


587
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,510
Better hide somewhere then.


588
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,460
She now has the Tombstone.


589
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,900
I come to save you. How could you talk to me like this?


590
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,940
You are Qin Lie?


591
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,550
Who else would I be then?


592
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,180
You come to save me?


593
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,510
I come to save you


594
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,860
because I'm strapped for cash.


595
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,550
I didn't have enough spirit stones.


596
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,620
I'm wondering maybe


597
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,310
I can take them away if you die.


598
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,590
I've got the Demon Sealing Tombstone. Take it.


599
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,450
Transfer your energy onto it


600
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,830
and see if it reacts to it.


601
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,660
Either this is a fake


602
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,700
or I'm not Gongmu Lie.


603
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
That's impossible.


604
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,510
Of course you're not.


605
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,550
I'm Gongmu Lie.


606
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,830
From the Fulfilment Realm?


607
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,980
Don't you want the Tombstone?


608
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,180
Come and get it.


609
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,990
Are you mad?


610
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,510
I just managed to get rid of him.


611
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,510
You're from the Manifestation Realm.


612
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,940
How can you defeat one from the Fulfilment Realm?


613
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,110
They've got endless Terminator Profound Bombs!


614
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,510
Do you fear them? Do I?


615
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,030
We'll fight together


616
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,940
or die together.


617
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,660
Alright.


618
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,790
Let's fight then.


619
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,830
It's so very touching.


620
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,110
Tell you what, I really can't stand


621
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,350
a loving couple.


622
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,860
Don't be ridiculous.


623
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,140
Fight or not?


624
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,270
Man,


625
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,590
you're my hero.


626
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,790
I admire this beauty, too.


627
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,270
A perfect match.


628
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,180
I've got the Demon Sealing Tombstone!


629
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,940
Stop there!


630
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,380
You put on such an act with Tang Siqi


631
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,620
just to distract Du Shaoyang


632
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,460
and buy me time to get the Tombstone?


633
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,660
When did I give myself away?


634
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,350
If Tang Siqi were in danger,


635
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,990
how could you not save her


636
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,900
but hurry to the gate of the Graveyard instead?


637
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,860
So, you knew this was a trap.


638
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,860
But you still came with me.


639
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,140
Did you fear that I might run into danger


640
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,270
in the Graveyard?


641
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Song Tingyu,


642
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,690
let me warn you again.


643
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,790
Don't try to be clever with me.


644
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,380
It's so annoying.


645
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,370
There's danger behind the door.


646
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,070
What is it?


647
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,750
Aren't they supposed to be dead?


648
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,990
It looks like


649
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,310
they don't think they're dead.


650
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,110
I don't have eyes.


651
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,030
I can't see your face.


652
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,590
Who's talking?


653
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,510
I don't have ears.


654
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,860
I can't hear your voices.


655
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,750
It seems to come from behind the door.


656
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,270
How would you know


657
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,510
there was danger behind the door?


658
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,140
I just knew.


659
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,180
I got a strange feeling


660
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,140
as soon as I came here.


661
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,750
It's so weird.


662
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,650
We need to find Yiyuan as soon as possible. Otherwise,


663
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,460
it will be a disaster if they break in.


664
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,210
Lianrou,


665
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,860
I miss you so much


666
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,060
at the moment.


667
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,750
None of them came back for me.


668
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,510
You will


669
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,460
if you are here.
