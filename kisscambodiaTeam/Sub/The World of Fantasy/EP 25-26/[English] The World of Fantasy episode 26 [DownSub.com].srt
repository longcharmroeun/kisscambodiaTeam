[Episode 26]


4
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,539
Who're you?


5
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,580
A snake.


6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,350
I mean, who are you?


7
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,940
Do I know you?


8
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,620
Who are you?


9
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,180
Do we know each other?


10
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,900
No, we don't.


11
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,590
I don't know you.


12
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,530
So stop asking.


13
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,310
Who is he?


14
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,710
Why I feel so distressed


15
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,900
seeing him cry?


16
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,430
So clever.


17
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,579
Even I was fooled by him.


18
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,620
I'll make friends with him.


19
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,740
Brother Chu,


20
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,380
take it slowly.


21
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,660
This place is unusual.

Let's hide behind the door.


24
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,980
We'll take the long view. Come on.


25
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,730
Feng Yiyou,


26
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,260
you said you would kill me


27
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,540
every time your Celestial Artefact Sect


28
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,540
see me? What're you doing?


29
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,220
Why are you so nice to me?


30
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,180
This is a critical time for the 
survival of the Human Race.


31
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,990
Survival is our top priority.


32
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,590
Do you get it?


33
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,590
No.


34
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,900
How about this?


35
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,350
You hide inside.


36
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,150
I'll go


37
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,430
to find out what they are.


38
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,460
Leave them to me. You can go now.


39
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,310
Brother Chu, just leave!


40
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,660
Leave now, Brother Chu.


41
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,380
No no no, Brother Chu.


42
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,460
Let me do it, Chu.


43
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:52,990
Brother Chu,


44
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,900
your juniors were captured by those things.


45
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,950
Take me there.


46
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,660
This is where Junior Ling was


47
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,900
captured by those


48
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,020
ghost-like men.


49
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Are you alright?


50
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,980
What do you think?


51
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,190
Where are those two assholes?


52
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,430
You bastards.


53
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,100
You want me dead, eh?


54
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,090
I'll blow you up.


55
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,060
Stop there!


56
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,870
Stop!


57
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,340
Just stop it.


58
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,710
I'll blow you up!


59
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,340
I'll blow...


60
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,310
Run!


61
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,820
Wait wait wait.


62
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,659
Just because you have endless Bombs


63
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,260
doesn't mean you don't need to behave yourself.


64
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,580

Let me show you how powerful my weapon is.


68
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,430
Let me show your mine.


69

Hurry up. Run! Leave!

Stop there.

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,500
We'll all die if you don't stop!


73
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,630
The second volume of the Scripture of Nine Hells


74
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,710
has shown itself.


75
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,630
Calling Mother of Earth.


76
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,590
The Land of Chaos.


77
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,780
It's not Du Shaoyang.


78
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,750
It's me.


79
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,470
Ma'am,


80
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,150
what's wrong with you?


81
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,100
Du Shaoyang didn't


82
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,590
kill Qin Lie.


83
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,260
I did.


84
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,630
You said


85
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,340
you once saw someone holding a dagger


86
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,770
The one who killed Qin Lie?


87
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,090
Yes.


88
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,780
That was me.


89
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,700
I was the killer.


90
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,070
I don't know if this is a sign.


91
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,190
What happened just now?


92
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,870
The second volume of the Scripture has been made.


93
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,700
We're calling the Mother of Earth.


94
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,510
Dark Jade City on the Land of Chaos


95
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,140
should be where the second volume refers to.


96
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,630
The Land of Chaos.


97
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,750
Qin Lie,


98
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,270
I need to go to Dark Jade City immediately.


99
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,690
One thousand years ago,


100
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,780
The Venerable launched


101
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,900
the teleportation to get to the Land of Chaos.


102
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,660
The Horned Demon Race had completely changed.


103
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,460
They could no longer co-exist with the Human Race.


104
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,220
One either killed


105
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,020
or got killed on the Land of Chaos.


106
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,190
As a result, The Venerable decided to close the teleportation.


107
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,190
Hence, it became the biggest secret


108
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,100
of our race.


109
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,700
The Nether Race also live on the Land of Chaos.


110
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,780
Do they get along with the Human Race?


111
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,630
Apart from the Horned Demon Race


112
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,190
and the Dark Shadow Race 
 on the Scarlet Tide Continent,


113
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,700
there's another clan of the Nether Race


114
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,540
the Ghost Eye Race living on the Land of Chaos.


115
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,220
The reason why they can survive there


116
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,630
is because they're pretty useful.


117
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,780
They live a humble and peaceful life there.


118
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,140
The Ghost Eye Race look


119
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,310
totally different from the Horned Demon Race.


120
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,450
But


121
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,510
you're their leader.


122
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,340
You will recognise them as you meet them.


123
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,630
The appearance of the second volume of the Scripture


124
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,570
implies that I have understood the first volume.


125
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,900
The energy of the Mother of Earth


126
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,660
will be released again.


127
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,220
The power of the Earth


128
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,020
belongs to you.


129
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,460
Granny,


130
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,020
the second volume of the Scripture 
is on the Land of Chaos.


131
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,870
The teleportation formation happens


132
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,750
to be located right beneath the Nether Realm.


133
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,020
Is that just a coincidence?


134
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,190
Isn't it?


135
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,540
Yeah,


136
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,870
such a coincidence.


137
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,700
Qin Shan happened to save you.


138
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,700
There happened to be a formation


139
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,510
here.


140
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,140
Huang Shuli,


141
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,430
show yourself up!


142
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,460
Come out!


143
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,100
Little bastard. You took it from me 
 when you lost to me.


144
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,510
Bastard? Me?


145
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,510
Our Master didn't treat me fairly.


146
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,950
I'm the Senior Sister.


147
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,830
I should have got the sword token.


148
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,140
But our Master insisted that 
we compete for it.


149
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,510
It's not his fault.


150
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,190
When our Master said we shall compete,


151
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,340
you were so excited.


152
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,870
You thought you were invincible.


153
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,140
But it turned out that I'm better


154
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,770
at martial arts and illusory arts.


155
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,460
You even attacked me unfairly.


156
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,390
You don't deserve the title of Senior Sister.


157
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,540
You were better at illusory arts?


158
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,190
Stop there.


159
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,580
Qianqian.


160
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,700
Qianqian.


161
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,220
Who are you?


162
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,430
It's me, Qianqian.


163
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,780
Who are you?


164
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,390
Do we know each other?


165
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,950
No, we don't.


166
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,690
I don't know you.


167
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,580
So, stop asking.


168
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,700
It's you.


169
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,100
It's me, Qianqian.


170
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,740
What gave me away?


171
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,140
The person I met last night


172
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,700
didn't even know me.


173
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,430
Why would you transform into him?


174
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,990
Who is he?


175
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Stop acting like you don't know.


176
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,090
He is your crush.


177
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,630
I sensed that.


178
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,660
Nonsense.


179
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,070
I don't have a crush.


180
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,750
I won't be myself if I don't kill you today.


181
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,700
Again?


182
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,830
You're not Senior Sister?


183
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,270
What're you talkin' about?


184
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,220
Do I look like a woman?


185
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,870
It's you.


186
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,190
Who the hell are you?


187
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,900
Why are you on my mind?


188
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,540
What do you mean "on your mind"?


189
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,940
If you're not,


190
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,870
why would the Senior Sister use you against me?


191
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,540
I...


192
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,700
If you don't explain,


193
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,430
I will kill you. Wanna try me?


194
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,630
Who are you?


195
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,180
I really don't know what you're talking about.


196
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,190
I'm asking who you are.


197
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,950
Why can't I ask that if you ask me?


198
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,390
Let me ask you one last time.


199
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,580
Who are you?


200
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,340
She is mental.


201
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:18,990
See ya.


202
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,750
Stop there.


203
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,660
Qin Lie, who are you really?


204
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,700
Where are you? Help!


205
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,750
Stop there!


206
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,310
Siqi, stop!


207
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,270
Siqi.


208
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,990
I see you, Siqi.


209
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,830
Siqi.


210
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,460
Siqi, I see you.


211
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,090
Why are you hiding from me?


212
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,460
Siqi,


213
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,390
I let the one who had poisoned you


214
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,780
escape.


215
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,330
Don't worry.


216
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,950
I'll find her


217
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,220
and kill her.


218
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,020
But before that,


219
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,750
let me kill you first.


220
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,830
Who are you?


221
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,140
Why do you want to kill


222
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,540
the one who hurt me and me as well?


223
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,780
Si...


224
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,700
Watch out!


225
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,500
I had known before I came here


226
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,100
that I would either kill others or get killed.


227
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,450
I admit you did better than me.


228
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,420
But please let my woman go.


229
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,140
You think I want to kill her


230
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,990
for the Demon Sealing Tombstone?


231
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
Siqi...


232
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,579
She's poisoned by the Voodoo insect.


233
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,990
She will die soon.


234
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,030
Her mind


235
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,339
will be controlled by the Voodoo insect


236
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,940
until it eats it up.


237
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,150
In the end,


238
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,990
she will become a ghost killer 
 for Black Voodoo Cult.


239
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,030
She would even


240
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,270
kill her own father,


241
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,220
let alone you.


242
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,630
Black Voodoo Cult?


243
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,790
Since she's yours,


244
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,270
do you want to


245
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,390
do it yourself?


246
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,910
Alright.


247
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,820
Let me do it.


248
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,100
Siqi.


249
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,750
Shaoyang.


250
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,750
Are you alright?


251
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,270
You don't want to kill me then?


252
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,460
Do you want me to?


253
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,100
Of course not.


254
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,150
I managed to get rid of my father.


255
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,300
I finally managed to get your love.


256
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,220
I have so many places to visit


257
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,460
and so many things to do.


258
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,930
I don't want to die.


259
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,580
This is the Siqi I love.


260
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,390
Will you love me


261
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,390
even if I am very ugly?


262
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,580
The first time I met you,


263
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,300
you also wore a veil.


264
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,030
I didn't even know what you looked like.


265
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,820
Let alone today when I love you so much.


266
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,220
Shaoyang,


267
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,630
I'm sorry.


268
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,910
Siqi,


269
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,990
do you remember


270
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,100
what did the people look like


271
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,550
who poisoned you?


272
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,390
I've been looking for you


273
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,290
ever since I got out of the Graveyard of Gods.


274
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,820
Later,


275
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,750
I found a couple talking secretly in the woods.


276
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,750
Shaoyang.


277
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,750
Shaoyang.


278
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,060
Black Voodoo Cult. The Illusory Demon Sect.


279
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,910
They must have the cure.


280
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,100
We must find


281
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,670
Qin Lie at the moment.


282
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,220
Can you still make it?


283
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,340
Let's go.


284
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,300
Siqi.


285
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,870
Siqi.


286
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,790
It should be here.


287
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,030
Why did it suddenly disappear?


288
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,150
Terminator Profound Bombs?


289
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,510
Could it be Qin Lie?


290
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,630
I don't have ears.


291
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,100
I can't hear your voice.


292
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,180
I don't have eyes.


293
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
I can't see your face.


294
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,630
You crazy woman. Why are you chasing me?


295
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,790
Yiyuan?


296
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,540
Brother.


297
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,980
Brother, you...


298
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,220
I'm not your brother.


299
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,100
Stop following me around.


300
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,510
Brother, I...


301
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,540
Just leave. Don't cause trouble for us.


302
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,150
Why do you mean?


303
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,790
I'm here to help.


304
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,750
Plus, any friend of my brother's


305
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,340
is a friend of mine.


306
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,330
I don't have eyes.


307
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,220
I can't see your face.


308
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,940
I don't have ears.


309
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,270
I can't hear your voice.


310
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,100
Here it goes again.


311
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,580
My world is chaos.


312
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,810
But I heard you summoning me.


313
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,820
Your voice is the first thing I've ever heard.


314
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,750
Where's the Demon Sealing Tombstone?


315
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,060
Tombstone, you're finally back.


316
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,820
What the hell is that?


317
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,750
Brother,


318
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,910
don't be afraid.


319
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,030
I'll protect you.


320
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,790
If this thing dares to lay a finger on you,


321
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,420
I...I...I'll blow it up.


322
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,100
Don't do it.


323
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,510
Alright.


324
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,700
Gongmu Lie, you're finally back.


325
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,460
Gongmu Lie?


326
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,030
You call him that?


327
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,900
Who are you?


328
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,100
Gongmu Lie, I've been waiting for you for too long.


329
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,390
Thousands of years have passed. 
Thousands of flowers have died.


330
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,220
Too long.


331
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,510
Yeah,


332
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,060
I'm back.


333
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,510
But I'm not Gongmu Lie, I'm Qin Lie.


334
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,420
Who the hell are you?


335
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,390
I'm the Night Fairy.


336
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,580
The Night Fairy,


337
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,180
servant of Gongmu Lie.


338
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,910
How do you know about me?


339
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,380
Who are you?


340
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,940
No, you're not her.


341
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,910
How could you forget me?


342
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,270
Did you do this on purpose?


343
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
Because you're still angry at me?


344
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,380
Why would he be angry at you?


345
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,210
Grandfather.


346
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,510
Grandfather.


347
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,910
Grandfather.


348
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,670
You're really Gongmu Lie.


349
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,220
Go and check it out.


350
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,460
Grandpa, what's all this?


351
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,150
They're the Spirit Pillars.


352
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,510
I built them for you to play.


353
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,390
I don't have eyes.


354
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,300
I can't see your face.


355
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,790
I don't have ears.


356
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,910
I can't hear your voice.


357
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,100
My world is chaos.


358
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,940
Who are you? I heard...


359
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,150
I heard you summoning me.


360
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,790
Even though I can't see,


361
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,420
I heard it.


362
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,100
Your voice is the first thing I've ever heard.


363
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,940
Who are you?


364
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,750
I'm your mentor.


365
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,550
I'm a part of the Spirit Pillars.


366
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,390
Spirit Pillar?


367
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,750
The Pillars contain the primary state 
of everything in this world.


368
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,750
They're in the primary state,


369
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,500
but if you can grasp it,


370
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,100
you'll be much better than others


371
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,700
on this land.


372
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,340
What's your name?


373
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,700
I don't have one.


374
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,300
You can give me a name if you want.


375
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,820
There's no light here.


376
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,340
No need for light.


377
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,270
True light lives in your heart,


378
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,390
not in the outside world.


379
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,580
So, you live in the dark forever?


380
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,550
That's one way to put it.


381
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,060
I'll give you a name?


382
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
I know it.


383
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,100
How about, the Night Fairy?


384
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,220
The Night Fairy?


385
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,820
I like it.


386
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,540
From now on,


387
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,670
I'll be your mentor and your company.


388
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,940
So the Spirit Pillars were made for you.


389
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,450
No wonder they light up when you touch them.


390
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,550
Where's my grandfather?


391
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,580
Gongmu Master? Has he gone missing?


392
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,300
Do you not know?


393
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,060
I don't.


394
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,290
If I was Gongmu Lie,


395
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,670
why am I Qin Lie now?


396
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,550
Why did I forget my past?


397
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,060
What's with the Soul Suppressing Orb


398
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,340
in my brain?


399
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,180
Why did you forget about the past?


400
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,750
What's with the Soul Suppressing Orb


401
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,460
in your brain?


402
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,300
I guess we have two confused humans here.


403
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,420
No.


404
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,940
You're a human.


405
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,630
But you're not.


406
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,300
I'm a human.


407
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,390
You turned me into a human.


408
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,420
You gave me a flesh.


409
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,570
Why do you look frustrated?


410
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,700
Someone went back on a promise.


411
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,750
Don't care about the others.


412
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,150
You just need my companionship.


413
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,180
Only humans can keep each another company.


414
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,100
But you're not human.


415
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,540
You can turn me into one.


416
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,030
Can I?


417
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,750
Everything starts from the primary state,


418
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,700
including human bodies.


419
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,180
You have grasped half of


420
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,150
the 12 Spirit Pillars.


421
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,820
I think you can do it.


422
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,870
Can you see me?


423
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,460
Of course I can.


424
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,940
But,


425
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,180
but I can't see myself.


426
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,910
What do I look like?


427
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,340
Very pretty.


428
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,380
Why you made me like this?


429
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,390
We don't have maids here.


430
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,100
One day, a young maid walked by.


431
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,390
I found it interesting,


432
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,940
and I remember how she looks like.


433
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,870
Then... I'll be your maid from now on.


434
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,510
It's you


435
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,460
that gave me a human body.


436
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,750
It's you


437
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,620
that made me felt the warmth


438
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,580
of holding hands,


439
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,670
of relationships.


440
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,940
It's you


441
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,790
that made me taste the fun of being a human.


442
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,100
But, it's me who kept you company till you grow up.


443
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,870
What are you doing?


444
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,510
Nothing.


445
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,340
I just thought you have relationship problems


446
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,750
with this Miss. Night Fairy here.


447
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,690
You don't get it,


448
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,300
no woman is as scary as an abandoned ex.


449
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,870
I need to be prepared.


450
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,220
Don't say a word. Let me test her first.


451
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,140
Oh, so you two grew up together.


452
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,790
Then what happened?


453
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,550
Did you get married?


454
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,790
Made love?


455
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,940
No.


456
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,270
The Night Fairy


457
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,060
has always been the most loyal friend of his.


458
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,910
How do you know?


459
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,060
I read it on The Tale of Gongmu Lie.


460
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,940
The Night Fairy was there for him


461
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,700
for many years,


462
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,630
and they overcome many hardships together.


463
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,870
Bullshit.


464
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,390
That's not true.


465
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,030
He was tempted by a woman,


466
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,420
and betrayed his own people for her.


467
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,020
Wuchun.


468
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,420
You can't go.


469
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,510
Get out of my way.


470
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,750
I'm part of the 12 Spirit Pillars,


471
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,740
you can't get past us.


472
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,990
The Spirit Pillars are mine.


473
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,150
Over my dead body.


474
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,180
She looks so resentful.


475
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,150
I understand your love


476
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,390
and feelings for him.


477
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,420
But he doesn't get it!


478
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,100
The power left in those Pillars


479
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
have turned this space into chaotic flows.


480
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,100
I'm weak now.


481
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,750
I couldn't get out.


482
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,390
How long have I been waiting for him?


483
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,220
One thousand years?


484
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,990
Two thousand?


485
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,390
He didn't even come back to get me.


486
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,100
I miss you more,


487
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,700
with each passing day.


488
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,630
I resent you even more,


489
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,580
with each passing year.


490
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,060
So The Graveyard of Gods,


491
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,390
the Demon Sealing Tombstone,


492
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,030
everything was set up by you?


493
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,300
That's right.


494
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,510
So the Tombstone will bring you back here.


495
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,340
No wonder the Tombstone recognizes you.


496
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,050
Now that you're back,


497
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,990
you don't even remember me.


498
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,790
You killed


499
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,790
all the people that came here?


500
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,820
I didn't need to.


501
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,460
This place is filled with the
 remaining power of the Spirit Pillars.


502
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,150
If they can't get out,


503
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,910
they will surely die here.


504
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,580
What do you want then?


505
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,980
I want you to stay here.


506
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,550
Stay with me forever.


507
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,910
I'm not sure about my identity.


508
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,870
I don't know what Gongmu Lie was like.


509
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,100
I am good for nothing.


510
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,580
I even lost my friends.


511
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,820
The wind?


512
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,300
The wind


513
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,180
is a manifestation of all things.


514
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,740
The sound travels through air.


515
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,700
I sense that


516
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,750
you have the power from the Spirit Pillar.


517
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,420
Keep calm. Listen to


518
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,179
all the sounds in the air using this power.


519
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,460
Can I?


520
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:14,900
You're Gongmu Lie.


521
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,590
You can do it.


522
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,659
Help!


523
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,179
It's Yiyuan.


524
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,110
Yiyuan,


525
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,510
where are you?


526
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,699
Yushi.


527
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,699
Wuchun?


528
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,030
Why is she here?


529
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,179
Wuchun?


530
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,310
You know her?


531
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,139
Wuchun, Wuchun.


532
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,900
I killed her.


533
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,900
Help!


534
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,900
Stop chasing me! I really don't know you!


535
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,990
How could a lady like you


536
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,410
chasing a man like this?


537
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,380
I won't chase if you stop.


538
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,420
Yiyuan.


539
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,990
Yushi,


540
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,690
please explain to this lady for me.


541
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,070
I just came from the Scarlet Tide Continent.


542
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,510
I really don't know her.


543
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,110
Xuanxuan?


544
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,370
Xuanxuan.


545
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,860
You know her?


546
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,790
Who's Xuanxuan?


547
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,380
Xuanxuan,


548
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,510
I'm your sister.


549
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,690
You got the wrong person.


550
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,550
My name is Pan Qianqian.


551
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,380
Kill them.


552
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,420
Tang Siqi.


553
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,740
You can't kill her.


554
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,270
Stop chasing me!


555
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,510
Why in this city?


556
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,900
What's going on again?


557
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,460
Yiyuan.


558
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,180
You can't escape from me!


559
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,220
Dark Jade City.


560
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,860
Blue Star Association.


561
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,990
There's danger!


562
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,700
Damn. It looks like they've entered through the door!


563
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,740
What's going on?


564
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,410
I heard it.


565
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,270
Someone's inside.


566
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,890
Du Shaoyang?


567
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,310
Qin Lie.


568
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,510
Hi, Qin Lie and Saintess Song.


569
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,990
This is Chu Li from the Terminator Sect.


570
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,180
Where's Tang Siqi?


571
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,860
Let me introduce.


572
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,830
This is the Third Heavenly Swordsman


573
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,140
Yan Baiyi.


574
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,610
The youngest sword holder


575
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,270
in the Heavenly Sword Mountain.


576
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,900
We got separated


577
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,350
as soon as we came in.


578
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:50,980
I've been looking for you.


579
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,410
I found Siqi first.


580
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,990
It turned out she has been poisoned 
by the Voodoo insect.


581
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,860
Black Voodoo Cult?
