00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,690
[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,150
[Episode 29]


4
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,220
I thought after you grew up,


5
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,750
your temper would be better.


6
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,070
Answer my question.


7
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,820
So what if you know your father is alive or dead?


8
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,620
Since you can't find it,


9
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,110
you won't be able to get to it.


10
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,940
Why?


11
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,260
'Cause you don't have enough power.


12
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,660
Unless,


13
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,820
you have the Crimson Flame.


14
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,990
I have it.


15
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,070
Volume Two of the Scripture of the Nine Hells.


16
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,510
I didn't expect Chongming to
 have such an ace in his hand.


17
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,170
You were forced to use the Soul Suppressing Orb


18
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,180
to seal the divine blood of Gongmu Lie.


19
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,660
Then you ordered the four spirit artifacts to guard the Soul Suppressing Orb.


20
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,590
After he was asleep for 10,000 years,


21
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,460
when the Golden Force dropped their guard,


22
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,260
you secretly awakened


23
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,900
Qin Lie of the Human Race.


24
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,380
You arranged all this


25
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,180
for your grandson.


26
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,740
But how come Chongming was able to foresee


27
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,660
what's happening today 10,000 years ago?


28
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,460
I've got it.


29
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,579
They have people from the Ghost Eye Race


30
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,260
that can see the past and the future.


31
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,230
Damn it.


32
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,070
Say something, please say something.


33
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,340
Chongming knows where my son is.


34
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,380
What do you mean?


35
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,150
Chongming once said


36
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,350
in a time of turmoil,


37
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,660
my son could be dead and also alive


38
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,230
'cause the spirit of the God of War won't die.


39
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,730
Aren't those words only comforting?


40
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,430
When I heard of my son's death,


41
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,149
I was also suspicious.


42
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,500
So I secretly went to 
the Deserted Spirits Realm to look for the truth.


43
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,100
Chongming said those words to me.


44
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,150
At that time,


45
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,470
I didn't take them seriously.


46
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,260
But today


47
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:36,190
she said the same words to my grandson


48
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,380
and kept them in Volume Two of the Scripture of the Nine Hells.


49
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,990
It is definitely not a coincidence.


50
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,630
I've got to find Chongming.


51
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,750
Wait.


52
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,150
She died of serious injuries before she sealed her remaining power in Volume Two.


53
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,340
10,000 years have passed.


54
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,470
Her divine sense might have all gone.


55
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,700
Even if there's only a slight chance,


56
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,060
I will seize it.


57
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,540
Big brother, the way ahead is too dangerous.


58
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,420
If he were your son,


59
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,100
would you be afraid of danger?


60
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,780
Thankfully the Night Fairy stopped it.


61
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,500
They can't see Volume Two again.


62
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,150
The Divine Race is about to come back.


63
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,220
Before he builds his temperament,


64
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,220
he should stop dreaming to be awakened.


65
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,910
You go there


66
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,310
and take back Volume Two.


67
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,220
What if something unexpected happens?


68
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,100
Then play it by ear and wait for me to come back.


69
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,820
What if you won't be able to come back?


70
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,180
Then put this


71
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,030
in his mind.


72
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,710
I was holding two grenades in my hands.


73
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,260
Ms.Ye told me


74
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,100
Big Brother is Gongmu Lie,


75
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,990
and Yushi is Wuchun.


76
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,820
Ms.Ye herself


77
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,870
had also lost half of her divine sense.


78
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,260
We didn't say this before


79
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,030
not because we wanted to conceal it


80
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,420
but because we didn't know how to say it.


81
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,540
Now...


82
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,150
As for the Black Voodoo Cult, 
I'll have Duan deal with it.


83
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,030
Now our biggest threat


84
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,750
is the Divine Race.


85
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,540
When the Human Race and 
the Divine Race were fighting,


86
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,150
the Gongmu Family also joined the war.


87
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,150
Gongmu Hao was even known as the God of War,


88
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,940
but unfortunately he died in that war.


89
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,260
Once the Divine Race is back,


90
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,500
together with Gongmu Lie and the Mother of Earth,


91
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,100
they will definitely give a hand to the Golden Force.


92
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,590
Nothing is clear yet,


93
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,540
and there are too many mysteries.


94
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,500
Why Yushi and I


95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,150
were asleep for 10,000 years?


96
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,870
Now we have woken up,


97
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,870
but we don't know who we are.


98
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,310
And just now,


99
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,030
who was it that interrupted Volume Two?


100
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,460
Interrupted?


101
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,340
What interrupted Volume Two


102
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,150
was the Spirit Pillars stolen from me.


103
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,750
I checked Yushi's crystal.


104
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,190
I'm sure my Spirit Pillars were stolen.


105
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,990
Someone used the power of 
my Spirit Pillars to interrupt Volume Two.


106
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,660
Is it the Night Fairy?


107
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,220
I think so, too.


108
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,190
So the Night Fairy didn't disappear?


109
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,710
She made it out of the Graveyard of Gods?


110
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,659
What about the guys from the Ghost Eye Race?


111
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,710
Ask for their opinions.


112
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,020
I've asked them,


113
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,030
but they didn't know anything.


114
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,150
They are talking about our race,


115
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,909
but don't allow us to get involved.


116
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,590
They're treating us like children, huh?


117
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,500
Obviously!


118
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,590
Then we should escape from here.


119
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,659
In the last three years,


120
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,430
we've been kidnapped three times.


121
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,060
Eight of us died.


122
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,630
All our spirit stones were stolen.


123
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,470
Another 25 died of hunger.


124
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,340
We had 36 of us.


125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,870
Now only we three have survived.


126
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,190
Shall we still trust her?


127
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,060
But we have a bed now.


128
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,470
I've never slept on such a soft bed.


129
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,660
I want to sleep on this bed forever.


130
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,590
So you choose a bed over me?


131
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,660
She is the Mother of Earth,


132
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,860
so she's our mother.


133
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,500
Isn't it a good thing to have a mother take care of us?


134
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,870
Where was she when we were in trouble?


135
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,020
Or when we were dying 
due to the lack of spirit stones?


136
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,270
Now she wants us to call her mom.


137
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,900
It's too late.


138
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,650
One more thing.


139
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,860
Chongming said,


140
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,140
only when Gongmu Lie, Wu Chun


141
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,700
and the four spirit artifacts gather together


142
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,100
can Volume Two be summoned.


143
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,950
What are the four spirit artifacts?


144
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,510
Volume Two was poised to be summoned in my hand.


145
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,650
When Mr. Li appeared,


146
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,580
it unfolded right away.


147
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,900
I knew you would think this way.


148
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,700
Help yourself to check this sword.


149
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,260
I also wish


150
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,100
it were the spirit artifact Gongmu needs.


151
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,220
My Terminator Profound Bombs 
could be one of them.


152
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,140
In terms of power,


153
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,340
they can definitely make it to the top four.


154
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Check them.


155
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,700
If these are not enough, I can give you more.


156
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,780
How about


157
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,140
we all show our weapons?


158
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,830
Start from me.


159
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,870
Anyway,


160
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,340
I would like to know


161
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,430
how you think of these two's new identities.


162
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,510
Especially you.


163
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,070
Whether you're Qin Lie or Gongmu Lie,


164
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,220
whether you like it or not,


165
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,780
I'll call you Big Brother.


166
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
So will I.


167
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,220
So will I.


168
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,190
No, I was wrong.


169
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,310
I should call you brother-in-law.


170
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,310
You should be very clear


171
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,020
about my attitude towards Gongmu Lie.


172
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,740
Brother Duan?


173
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,830
I don't care about who he is.


174
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,580
No matter what,


175
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,700
Shaoyang and I consider him as Qin Lie.


176
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,510
Thanks to you all.


177
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,660
As for the Black Voodoo Cult,


178
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,660
could you ask your men to get rid of them?


179
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,310
When I'm in the mood.


180
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,940
Come here, time for a meal.


181
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,630
What's wrong? You don't like it?


182
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,130
Are you kidding us?


183
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,950
We don't eat food.


184
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,630
What do you eat?


185
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,340
We eat spirit stones.


186
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,180
- Spirit stones? 
- Spirit stones?


187
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,820
Why do you think we charge 
so many spirit stones


188
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,870
for each question we answer?


189
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,950
No wonder


190
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,580
you've earned so many


191
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,780
yet you don't have a proper shelter.


192
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,780
How many spirit stones do you need to eat?


193
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,310
1,000 for breakfast, 3,000 for lunch


194
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,900
and 5,000 for dinner


195
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,700
each person.


196
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,060
Each...


197
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,390
9,000 per person per day.


198
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,750
27,000 per day for you three!


199
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,990
You'll never have enough 
no matter how hard you work.


200
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,430
Some people even bully us,


201
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,140
and don't pay after they get the answers.


202
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,650
Others believe we're rich,


203
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,220
and kidnap us.


204
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,100
We're the last three of the Ghost Eye Race.


205
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,100
'Cause the others have all died of hunger.


206
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,540
How many spirit stones do you have?


207
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,630
Those can barely fill my stomach.


208
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,270
I'll fill your stomach.


209
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,100
I have no other merit


210
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,830
but being super rich.


211
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,430
It won't be a problem


212
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,620
to feed them for a few years.


213
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,140
Brother Chu,


214
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,750
see for yourself.


215
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,020
All gone?


216
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,700
Just a mouthful.


217
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,700
Can you really feed us?


218
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,220
Of...course, I told you just now.


219
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,630
I have no other merit


220
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,990
but being...


221
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,750
Super rich.


222
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,570
It seems we need to work for Uncle Li


223
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,140
to be able to feed them.


224
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,310
Lianrou.


225
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,100
Lian...Lianrou.


226
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,630
What brings you here?


227
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,430
Lianrou.


228
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,340
So it's true.


229
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
You don't like me anymore.


230
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,660
I...


231
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,870
Why would you say that?


232
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,140
Did you forget I'm from the Illusory Demon Sect


233
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,020
and can see who is in your mind?


234
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,580
You have someone else on your mind.


235
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,900
I sensed that long ago.


236
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,460
I didn't say it, 'cause I wanted to see


237
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,430
how long you were going to lie to me.


238
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,020
But I couldn't bear it anymore.


239
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,310
I...


240
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,630
Who is Lianrou?


241
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,990
She...


242
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,310
Tell me.


243
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,340
Did you forget the Love Eater we met?


244
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,580
It ate my love for you.


245
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,990
Then I met another girl.


246
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,220
I wouldn't say I don't like you anymore.


247
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,340
But you still have her on your mind.


248
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,430
Not me.


249
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,950
We shouldn't betray our commitment.


250
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,390
That's very bad.


251
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,630
But if I have both of you on my mind,


252
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,460
it's even worse.


253
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,830
But don't worry,


254
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,310
I'll forget her soon.


255
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
Tomorrow, I'll forget her tomorrow.


256
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,990
I...I'll let you rest.


257
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,820
This...


258
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,900
This seems to be my room.


259
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,070
So annoying.


260
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,830
Come in.


261
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,070
You're still awake.


262
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,900
I can't fall asleep.


263
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,950
You're also awake.


264
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,510
Are you alright?


265
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,670
Huh...


266
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,910
Are you afraid that I can't accept 
Qin Lie is Gongmu Lie


267
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,510
and will force him and Lin Yushi apart?


268
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,030
Let go of him.


269
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,819
You didn't fancy any guy 
on the Scarlet Tide Continent.


270
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,579
But here is different.


271
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,270
There's always someone that deserves you.


272
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,329
Such as...


273
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,579
Such as,


274
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,340
Chuli, the guy that bombs everyone he sees.


275
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,700
Actually I think


276
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,780
he is a good match for you.


277
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,750
He is also playful,


278
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,180
much better than Du Shaoyang.


279
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,700
This Du Shaoyang


280
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,340
always wears a sullen look


281
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,750
as if someone owes him a huge debt.


282
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,580
Why did you get me involved?


283
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,510
You used to be so arrogant


284
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,170
and always put on airs.


285
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,150
Ever since you got together with Du,


286
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,940
you don't even dare to talk loudly anymore.


287
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,990
Where is your old self?


288
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,940
Bittersweet, this is what love should be.


289
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,180
Is Du Shaoyang alright?


290
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,870
Knowing his good friend


291
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,460
becomes Gongmu Lie,


292
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,270
he must be suffering.


293
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,870
Of course.


294
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,180
I tried to console him,


295
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,450
but he wouldn't talk to me.


296
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,540
He just wanted to go somewhere alone.


297
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,820
I wanted to stop him 
but I didn't want to upset him.


298
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,670
Uncle Li,


299
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,580
Duan Qianjie knows very well


300
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,100
the flaws of the Eye of Frost.


301
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,870
From the very beginning,


302
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,510
you sent him to look out for us secretly,


303
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,940
didn't you?


304
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,940
If he went across the line before,


305
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,220
please forgive him.


306
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,750
He is not a bad person.


307
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,870
He has a poker face,


308
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,630
but he did help us a lot.


309
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,300
Thank you for taking care of us.


310
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,810
Uncle Li, to you.


311
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,670
Uncle Li,


312
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,820
you and him are...


313
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,030
He and I are like brothers.


314
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,510
Why did you beat him?


315
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,300
You deserve it. Go beat him.


316
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,570
Shame on you.


317
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,630
Beat them.


318
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,150
Beat them.


319
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,340
They deserve it. They deserve it.


320
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,390
Beat them.


321
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,500
Go away.


322
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,870
Stop.


323
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,510
You two jinxes.


324
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,150
Don't show up in my face.


325
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,460
I'll beat you every time I see you.


326
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,460
Let's go.


327
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,420
Where are your parents?


328
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,940
I don't remember.


329
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,550
Maybe my bad luck killed them. You?


330
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,030
Same here. I don't remember clearly.


331
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,940
They probably died for the same reason.


332
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,870
My surname is Li, what's yours?


333
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,940
Duan.


334
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,460
I'll call you Brother Duan.


335
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,180
From today, I'm your big brother.


336
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,390
You follow me. I'll look after you.


337
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,670
I'm your big brother.


338
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,790
You follow me. I look after you.


339
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,460
You don't know,


340
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,330
we never knew if we could get our next meal or not.


341
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,630
We were always hungry.


342
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,460
We even had no place to live.


343
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,820
We looked everywhere for shelters.


344
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,270
Summers were bearable,


345
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,910
but winters were the most difficult.


346
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,990
Little brother.


347
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,870
Let's start a fire, ok?


348
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,990
I'm tired, big brother.


349
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,940
You do it.


350
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,060
I'm also tired.


351
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,820
You're the little brother, you do it.


352
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,460
Big brother, come close to the fire.


353
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,870
No. It's better here.


354
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,990
It's in the corner, no wind.


355
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,030
You said you were cold, didn't you?


356
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,550
But now I'm not cold.


357
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,630
Come closer and share the fire.


358
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,550
I need to sit here to think about things.


359
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,460
A lot of things.


360
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,340
Go to sleep if you're tired.


361
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,100
That was a long time ago.


362
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,580
Considering your difficult past,


363
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,180
your friendship now is even more precious.


364
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,940
Brother Duan


365
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,790
is the biggest concern on my mind.


366
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,220
What adventures did you have


367
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,990
that let you have so many skills?


368
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,660
Not necessarily adventures.


369
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,460
But I did understand swordsmanship 
better than others.


370
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,270
As for Brother Duan,


371
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,390
his skills developed from a fight after another.


372
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,790
He is talented in martial arts.


373
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,580
With his help,


374
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,420
in my fight at Mount Heavenly Sword,


375
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,550
I unexpectedly inserted the sixth sword in it,


376
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,180
and became a Sword Holder.


377
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,990
Who is stronger, you and him?


378
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,460
I really don't know.


379
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,750
We've never had a real fight.


380
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,910
Even if one were stronger, the gap would be minimal.


381
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,300
But how come you become a sword holder,


382
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,700
but not him?


383
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,750
He made me.


384
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,060
In fact,


385
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,820
in our hearts,


386
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,180
we treat the other as family.


387
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,620
Though he is defiant,


388
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,340
to him,


389
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,020
I'm his only family.


390
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,670
Big brother, drink some water.


391
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,270
Big brother.


392
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,790
Big brother.


393
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,580
Big brother, you have a fever.


394
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,390
Is everything clear?


395
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,030
Drop the act.


396
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,870
You pretended to chat, but you've been plotting.


397
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,060
What's your purpose of poking around our story?


398
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,420
There is one thing


399
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,910
I really don't know how to say.


400
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,060
'Cause it's too weird.


401
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,420
Volume Two has shown up.


402
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,550
You only know about the four spirit artifacts,


403
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,550
but you don't know


404
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,750
they are not common artifacts.


405
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,460
You said we all live in your mind.


406
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,420
Are you nuts?


407
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,670
Calm down.


408
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,030
You trust him?


409
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,030
I believe he won't deceive me.


410
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,060
Duan Qianjie,


411
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,550
I didn't deceive Uncle Li.


412
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,940
If you're not human,


413
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,270
but spirit artifacts...


414
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,940
- You're not human...
- Duan Qianjie.


415
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,220
Big brother,


416
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,140
do you really believe we are spirit artifacts?


417
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,180
Wait.


418
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,270
We're spirit artifacts?


419
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,460
Qianjie, do you remember your parents' faces?


420
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,060
The truth is in Volume Two.


421
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,550
Someone interrupted it


422
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,510
'Cause they didn't want us to know too much.


423
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,750
Volume Two was interrupted by the Spirit Pillars.


424
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,460
It is probably the Night Fairy who did it.


425
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,180
But what's her purpose?


426
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,510
If the person behind this is your old flame,


427
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,270
you'd better think about how to lure her out.


428
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,790
Are you upset?


429
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,270
None of your business.


430
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,460
Your rival is so much better than you.


431
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,700
It must be hard for you, right?


432
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,420
Your rival in love is also much better than you.


433
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,820
How do you feel about that?


434
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,550
I surely don't like that.


435
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,580
But you seem to have forgotten


436
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,910
Xie Jingxuan was poisoned by a voodoo insect.


437
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,700
You have a solution?


438
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,140
If you can't find the master of the insect,


439
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,270
even if you wipe out the Black Voodoo Cult,


440
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,460
it will be useless.


441
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,150
Unless,


442
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,390
you become the new master of the Black Voodoo Cult.


443
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,550
You're asking me to hide in the dark


444
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,390
and become the new master of those vicious insects?


445
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Song Tingyu, what do you want me to do for you now?


446
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,630
Do you know the Voodoo Master?


447
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,550
It's Jiang Yan. He died in the war with the Divine Race.


448
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,980
His body is still in the Graveyard of Gods.


449
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,550
I met him before.


450
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,390
Jiang Yan, the Voodoo Master,


451
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,870
was an ancestor of the Black Voodoo Cult.


452
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,100
The Voodoo Race was the predecessor 
of the Black Voodoo Cult.


453
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,030
The race was good at using voodoo insects.


454
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,990
Their skills were diverse and remarkable.


455
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,630
In prehistoric times,


456
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,390
every 100 years, there would a dark period


457
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,060
that lasted for a year.


458
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,260
The whole world was in darkness.


459
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,990
People couldn't survive.


460
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,300
The Master would let out voodoo insects 
to lighten up the sky.


461
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,270
After he died in war,


462
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,510
manipulating voodoo insects became a lost art.


463
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,510
In order to survive,


464
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,700
they have become today's Black Voodoo Cult,


465
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,460
vicious and looked down upon by others.


466
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,630
Now all the other voodoo skills have been lost.


467
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,940
Voodoo insects have become a tool to kill.


468
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,630
Though the Voodoo Master died,


469
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,380
his body is in the Graveyard of Gods,


470
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,630
and it still has the smell of voodoo insects.


471
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,550
Even if you only get a little bit of it,


472
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,270
you shall be able to dominate the Land of Chaos,


473
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,030
and be on a par with Qin Lie.


474
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,220
To remove the voodoo insect from Xie


475
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,060
will be a piece of cake.


476
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,570
This is the entry to the Graveyard of Gods.


477
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,340
It's up to you to make a choice.


478
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,670
Is that


479
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,630
the Voodoo Master?


480
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,220
You stole the Spirit Pillars,


481
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,620
and interrupted Volume Two.


482
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,420
I'm not keen to read


483
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,630
their ridiculous romance stories.


484
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,340
I'm Jiang Yan, the Voodoo Master.


485
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,990
I used to be upright and
 protect the people of the Spirit Realm.


486
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,670
However, in the war with the Divine Race,


487
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,670
I was set up by the Golden Force


488
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,060
who wanted to exterminate my race.


489
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,420
Our devotion and commitment


490
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,330
only brought us betrayal and slaughter.


491
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,410
If you want to use my power,


492
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,630
you have to swear


493
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,810
that one day


494
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,660
you will take our Voodoo Race


495
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,700
back to the Land of Gold.


496
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,820
I, Du Shaoyang,


497
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,820
I want to beat him.


498
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,580
I don't want to stay weaker than him all my life.


499
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,030
If for my whole life


500
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,670
I'm just useless,


501
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,750
how can I say I love her.


502
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,670
I'd rather cut her out of my life,


503
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,030
let go of her


504
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,790
and myself.


505
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,420
The way ahead is long.


506
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,460
My destination is unknown.


507
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,300
Facing the moon,


508
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,630
I, Du Shaoyang, hereby swear


509
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,750
I will lead the Voodoo Race to regain glory and power.


510
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,750
Congratulations! You've got a new lease of life.


511
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,220
You are the Night Fairy?


512
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,670
It's not hard to steal the Spirit Pillars.


513
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,150
But only the Night Fairy


514
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,750
can use it with ease.


515
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,580
You're not stupid.


516
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,270
Where is Ye Yihao?


517
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,630
Is he dead?


518
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,940
No,


519
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,420
I kept him alive.


520
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,940
He'll be useful one day.


521
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,340
The Supreme Voodoo Insect.


522
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,550
He inherited it from the Voodoo Master.


523
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,270
From today, he'll replace you


524
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,790
and become the new master of the Black Voodoo Cult.


525
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,060
My Master.


526
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,340
Yushi, say something.


527
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,340
Qianqian.


528
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,580
Are you really leaving us?


529
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,630
I'm going back to the Illusory Demon Sect.


530
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,790
Why not go back later?


531
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,180
After we remove the voodoo insect from Siqi,


532
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,750
I'll take you there.


533
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,580
I'm not happy here.


534
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,020
Qianqian, there must be a misunderstanding.


535
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,450
Shut up.


536
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,460
If you don't love me,


537
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,940
don't play with my feelings


538
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,580
and waste my time.


539
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,670
Can I visit you in the future?


540
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,790
You're...always welcome.


541
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,670
Don't worry.


542
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,420
It's all my fault.


543
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,179
I'll be responsible for it.


544
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,139
I'll help you to take her back.


545
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,270
He said he would take me back.


546
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,900
I should have killed him just now.


547
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,179
You didn't eat anything. Nor did you take any food.


548
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,460
It'll take a few days to go back from here.


549
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,940
I'm afraid you'll get hungry.


550
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,030
You're a lady. Be gentle.


551
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,620
Since you fancy gentle ladies,


552
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,219
go back to your Lianrou.


553
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,550
Sorry, I was wrong.


554
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,860
I put my foot in my mouth.


555
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,070
Do you want it or not?


556
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,110
Get lost.


557
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,900
Shall we use teleport or fly?


558
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,310
I don't have a flying vehicle.


559
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,350
Can I use yours?


560
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,420
Get out of my face.


561
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,830
Can you say something else?


562
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,900
Fuck off.


563
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,270
Why are you following me?


564
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,460
Since you don't like me,


565
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,380
why do you come here to see me off?


566
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,180
I don't know.


567
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,990
I'm just worried about you.


568
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,510
I feel bad.


569
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,700
Is it true that you don't know why


570
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,700
but you just want to follow me?


571
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,350
Yes, you know what I'm thinking.


572
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,270
Do you want to say


573
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,510
your symptoms are the same as mine


574
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,590
when I first met you?


575
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,830
You just don't know why.


576
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,750
Is that because


577
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,750
I have you in my heart?


578
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,790
How can that be?


579
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,460
You're such a good actor.


580
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,660
I was almost deceived


581
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,460
by your innocent face again.


582
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,020
You're a playboy.


583
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,110
You already have a girl.


584
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,990
Now you want to hoax another one.


585
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,860
We girls from the Illusory Demon Sect


586
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,030
hate players the most.


587
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,590
We'll kill every last one of them.


588
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,070
Come with me if you have guts.


589
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,460
I promised Yushi


590
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,990
that I would take you back.


591
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,210
Go away.


592
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,990
I'll kill you if you don't go.


593
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,620
Hongyan.


594
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,830
Boss.


595
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,940
What's wrong?


596
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,110
The Supreme Voodoo Insect.


597
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,590
It's recorded that in the prehistoric times


598
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,460
Jiang Yan, the Voodoo Master, was one of the greatest lords.


599
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,420
Under his leadership, the Voodoo Race


600
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,070
were respected and remarkable.


601
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,000
He kept the Supreme Voodoo Insect himself.


602
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,620
It was superb.


603
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,900
It could kill and also save people.


604
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,180
But after he died in the war with the Divine Race,


605
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,180
the Voodoo Race began to decay.


606
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,860
The Supreme Voodoo Insect has been lost.


607
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,380
It'll not only make people lose their five senses


608
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,990
but also control their consciousness.


609
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,660
It is like her,


610
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,180
but more difficult to deal with.


611
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,220
Once scratched by people poisoned by a voodoo insect,


612
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,610
you will be infected.


613
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,130
How many people have been poisoned?


614
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,310
More than 1,000.


615
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,140
The number is increasing.


616
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,110
10,000 years have passed


617
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,140
since prehistoric times.


618
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,550
Those insects must have died of
 either hunger or coldness.


619
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,790
Besides,


620
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,030
the Voodoo Master has long been dead.


621
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,270
His body is in the Graveyard of Gods.


622
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,660
We all saw him.


623
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,660
Is it because Ye Yihao is still alive?


624
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,270
I have the same concern.


625
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,550
Where are the three Ghost Eye people?


626
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,410
No way.


627
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,460
How come I've lost all my power?


628
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,310
We've really lost our power.


629
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,940
Why is this the case?


630
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,380
The Supreme Voodoo Insect.


631
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,860
Will I be blind and deaf?


632
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,310
Their target should be us.


633
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,850
They attacked them


634
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,350
'cause they want to stop us


635
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,610
from getting any clues.


636
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,550
I ordered my men last night


637
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,180
to guard them from outside.


638
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,620
I didn't expect


639
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,620
the they would be able to sneak in.


640
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,900
Why will the Black Voodoo Cult target us?


641
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,900
Because of our feud in the Graveyard of Gods?


642
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:31,700
I don't know.


643
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,420
Something is wrong here.


644
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,620
My men are trying to find out


645
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,550
whether the mutation only occurred
 in the Dark Jade City.


646
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,660
We can't rule out they may have also occurred


647
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,420
in other continents and cities.


648
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,380
If they only occurred in the Dark Jade City,


649
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,740
once the news got out,


650
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,140
all sects will send people 
to wipe out the Black Voodoo Cult.


651
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,860
It will be a huge trouble then.


652
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,700
By then,


653
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,350
the Dark Jade City may really turn into a Land of Chaos.


654
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,350
Yushi, Big Brother has left.


655
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,990
What did you say?
