[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,150
[Episode 30]


4
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,820
Ms.Ling, Brother La Pu has left.


5
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,789
Where has he gone?


6
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,580
No idea.


7
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,470
I told him not to, but he wouldn't listen.


8
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,620
He said he didn't trust you guys.


9
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,670
Let's split up and look for him.


10
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,110
You found the base of the Black Voodoo Cult?


11
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,990
Yes.


12
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,580
You guys go find La Pu first.


13
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,150
Qianjie and I will check this out.


14
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,100
Let's split up.


15
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,650
Let's work in pairs,


16
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,180
so as to have one another's back.


17
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,540
Shaoyang and I will search over there.


18
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,620
I'm pairing up with you?


19
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,150
Are you unhappy about it?


20
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,620
We can take separate actions.


21
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,710
I didn't say I was unhappy.


22
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,460
Hurry up! Or Brother La Pu would die!


23
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,460
La Pu!


24
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,510
La Pu!


25
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,510
Let's search separately.


26
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,100
I worry that the Black Voodoo Cult would catch them.


27
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,460
Alright, be careful!


28
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,100
Meet me at our usual spot then.


29
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,790
La Pu!


30
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,260
I thought we agreed to gather at the city gate.


31
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
What's the deal now?


32
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,150
Guess you and Brother La Pu


33
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,100
planned to meet up here


34
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,100
instead of at the gate,


35
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,820
and then run off together.


36
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,310
Run!


37
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,370
This way.


38
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,950
Help!


39
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,710
Help!


40
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,940
Let...let go!


41
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,990
Let go of me! Let go of me!


42
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,660
Help!


43
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,820
Let go of me!


44
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,940
Let go of me!


45
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,540
Let go!


46
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,060
So much noise.


47
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,990
It seems you don't intend to kill Ling Yushi,


48
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,030
at least not for now.


49
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,060
What is it that you're up to?


50
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,150
I'm worried that


51
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,650
they would overthink, just like you.


52
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,190
So I asked them to


53
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,710
find Ye Yihao first,


54
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,750
to divert their attention.


55
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,500
Ye Yihao.


56
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,940
You really made it out of the Graveyard of Gods.


57
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,380
Aren't you guys the same?


58
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,030
You wanna cause trouble in my territory?


59
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,260
You will get yourself killed.


60
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,340
Did you manipulate voodoo insects to


61
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,380
bring disturbance to the Dark Jade City?


62
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,190
Who else would be


63
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,020
capable of that?


64
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,659
Where else apart from


65
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,210
the Dark Jade City?


66
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,909
The Dark Jade City is merely a start.


67
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,909
How can you manipulate 
the Supreme Voodoo Insect?


68
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,659
Hasn't it been lost for long?


69
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,330
You thought it was lost?


70
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,380
That's why you've always despised me.


71
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,380
For millenniums, the Black Voodoo Cult 
hasn't made great achievements.


72
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,659
Manipulation of voodoo insects


73
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,150
is only about turning people into puppets.


74
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,500
I know exactly what you're capable of.


75
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,540
There's no way you can 
cultivate the Supreme Voodoo Insect.


76
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,310
Tell me.


77
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,780
Who's behind you?


78
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,060
The Heaven Fighting Race.


79
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,260
Your ancestors were slaughtered by them,


80
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,100
and you're conspiring with them!


81
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,300
So long as I can restore


82
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,820
the Voodoo Cult to its glory,


83
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,060
it doesn't matter who I work with.


84
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,020
What are you after?


85
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,310
Qin Lie and Ling Yushi.


86
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,940
One is Gongmu Lie.


87
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,710
The other is the Mother of Land.


88
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,150
They're obstacles to the Divine Race.


89
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,590
Look,


90
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,540
what if they got poisoned


91
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,430
by the Supreme Voodoo Insect?


92
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,710
So what?


93
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,150
The more powerful they're,


94
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,870
the stronger the Insect's


95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,630
counterforce will be in their body.


96
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,100
Gongmu Lie and the Mother of Land


97
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
would become our slaughtering machines.


98
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,150
And then, we can work with the Divine Race


99
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,340
and eliminate those who despised us.


100
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,220
That would rejuvenate the World of Fantasy.


101
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,050
It's about time. It will happen.


102
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,910
La Pu!


103
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,100
Help!


104
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,820
Help! It's La Pu.


105
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,310
Help! Help!


106
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,380
La Pu, are you alright?


107
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,820
Can you see things?


108
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,380
Let go!


109
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,340
Qin Lie!


110
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,190
What happened, Qin Lie?


111
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,630
Qin Lie!


112
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,220
Qin Lie!


113
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,270
It worked.


114
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,340
The Mother of Land has been poisoned 
by the Supreme Voodoo Insect.


115
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,820
Why don't you bring people to kill her, Duan?


116
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,900
Any delay would leave us in endless troubles.


117
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,990
Who is that?


118
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,990
Big Brother.


119
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,100
Hurry back to the inn.


120
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,270
Chu Li.


121
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,390
Siqi.


122
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,750
Why are you here?


123
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,340
Look, I think we saw this before.


124
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,020
This belongs to La Er.


125
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,660
I found it on the ground.


126
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,340
Perhaps...


127
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,460
They're caught by the Black Voodoo Cult.


128
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,540
What did you find?


129
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,870
This is my keepsake for you.


130
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,140
Please keep it safe.


131
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,220
In the future, you should comb 
my hair with it every day.


132
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,540
Even if I'm no longer with you one day,


133
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,390
upon seeing this,


134
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,510
you would still think of me.


135
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,630
It's okay.


136
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,700
It's my comb.


137
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,870
I might have left it here just now.


138
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,100
And oh, Ling Yushi is in trouble.


139
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,510
Let's hurry back to the inn.


140
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,630
What happened?


141
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,750
Just hurry up!


142
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,650
Can you suppress it on your own?


143
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,070
No wonder it's called the Supreme Voodoo Insect.


144
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,830
I can only contain it temporarily.


145
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,750
What about you?


146
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,220
Are you alright?


147
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,430
I had a severe headache all of a sudden.


148
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,990
But it's gone now.


149
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,430
Who plotted all this behind the curtain?


150
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,510
And why are we the target?


151
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,580
Overthinking wouldn't fix the problem.


152
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,070
Go find Uncle Li


153
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,460
to deal with the situation.


154
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,630
If the poison kicks in,


155
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,700
you probably can't control it on your own.


156
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,700
No,


157
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,860
I can't leave you alone at the inn.


158
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,950
Neither of you can stay.


159
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,100
Let's go!


160
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,220
Duan Qianjie knew you were poisoned.


161
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,900
He brought people to capture you.


162
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,220
Wait outside.


163
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,190
Yes.


164
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,220
Did Qin Lie and Ling Yushi come back?


165
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,070
They did,


166
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,070
but they left again,


167
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,190
in haste.


168
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,830
Mr.Chu and Ms.Tang went with them.


169
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,100
Tang Siqi.


170
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,020
You can settle down here.


171
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,190
I've checked. It's safe here.


172
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,420
Where is this?


173
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,100
A place to hide things.


174
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,020
This is full of Terminator Profound Bombs.


175
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,900
If Duan's people found here,


176
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,460
just bombard them with those.


177
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,630
Also,


178
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,210
his fighters are strong.


179
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,140
These might not suffice. I'll get more.


180
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,270
You have more?


181
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,500
Yeah, loads of them.


182
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,540
If I dig out all the bombs across


183
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,460
the five continent,


184
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,950
they could destroy the whole Land of Chaos.


185
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,060
Qin Lie, I'm worried that Shaoyang and Tingyu...


186
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,340
Go!


187
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,900
I'm fine.


188
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,820
Yushi was poisoned by the Voodoo Insect?


189
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,950
Of course.


190
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,540
Otherwise, why'd she leave?


191
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,140
Tang Siqi must have tipped her off.


192
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,390
Everyone poisoned


193
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,780
by the Voodoo Insect


194
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,540
has been sent to prison.


195
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,780
Give my order. The Dark Jade City 
is now on full guard.


196
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,140
Yes.


197
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,700
Brother Duan,


198
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,460
go find Qin Lie and Ling Yushi.


199
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
Talk to them nicely,


200
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,750
Don't pick a fight with them.


201
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,390
I'll go in to check


202
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,100
if there're any traces left behind.


203
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,140
Sure.


204
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,460
Where are Qin Lie and Ling Yushi?


205
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,630
I don't know.


206
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,700
What's their plan?


207
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,420
I don't know.


208
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,950
I'm here to help.


209
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,310
I don't believe you.


210
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,390
You fell for it again.


211
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,780
What trick are you playing?


212
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
Last time, you've seen


213
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,750
that Shadowless Stone, right?


214
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,070
That...


215
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,900
That's a trick invented by Master Mohai.


216
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,510
He's got a childlike temperament.


217
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,900
In the public eye,


218
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,900
he invented things to kill or save people.


219
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,700
Behind closed doors, he just fiddled with


220
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,270
those boring tricks.


221
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,870
The thing under your feet


222
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,990
is used to deal with his wife.


223
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,630
With this,


224
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,630
his wife could never catch him.


225
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,780
His wife?


226
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,900
That's right.


227
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,510
Stay here. I'll get going.


228
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,570
I'll kill you sooner or later.


229
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,950
Harsh words and deeds


230
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,220
can be a demonstration of love.


231
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,660
Just stay here. Bye-bye.


232
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,630
You...


233
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,700
I made some rice soup.


234
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,100
Hope you didn't ruin the kitchen?


235
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,460
Almost.


236
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,750
How's it?


237
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,390
I used to long for touching your face,


238
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,870
wondering how that would feel.


239
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,270
But I never dared to.


240
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,580
I fear that would scare you away from the Ling Borough.


241
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,830
And now I've touched it.


242
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,990
But I didn't feel a thing.


243
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,870
I've got a rough skin.


244
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,020
It wouldn't feel nice anyway.


245
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,660
When the poison in you is cleared,


246
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,070
you could touch it


247
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,660
whenever you want.


248
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,140
You've lent me a lot of money,


249
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,340
so take that as my repayment.


250
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,510
Then I'd suffer a great loss.


251
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,870
As long as you're with me,


252
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,630
I have nothing else to wish for.


253
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,980
Qin Lie,


254
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,310
pick a flower for me.


255
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,790
Did you think of any cure


256
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,300
for the poison in your body?


257
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,790
I smelled the fragrance of flowers on the way,


258
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,180
and just wanted you to pick a flower for me.


259
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,180
That's it.


260
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,579
Then, as soon as Chu Li is back,


261
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,940
I will go.


262
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,300
He's back.


263
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,030
I'm so concerned about you guys.


264
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,090
So I brought a couple of them back first.


265
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,410
And I'll go again later.


266
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,030
Brother Chu,


267
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,790
please take care of Yu Shi for me.


268
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,100
I'll be out for something.


269
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
What is it?


270
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,910
Picking flowers.


271
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,750
Picking flowers?


272
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,340
Now?


273
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,790
They're blooming now.


274
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,870
It only happens once in a few years.


275
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,860
They're more precious than the One Heart Leaf.


276
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,670
Qin Lie,


277
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,220
go pick one for me.


278
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,940
You see these spirit flowers and plants every day.


279
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,330
Is that not enough?


280
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,030
Why bother picking flowers?


281
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,870
It smells so nice!


282
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,270
I'll find a bottle to put them in.


283
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,630
No need for that.


284
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,100
You...


285
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,910
What are you doing?


286
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,100
My power only allows me


287
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,030
to tie down the Supreme Voodoo Insect.


288
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,060
With this,


289
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,270
even if I lose my five senses,


290
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,100
I could still feel you and I won't be


291
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,940
worried about not seeing you


292
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,340
or forgetting you.


293
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,270
Yushi, to me you're


294
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,340
always different


295
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,170
from anyone else.


296
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,550
I've never


297
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,030
doubted the feelings between us.


298
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
But I always feel


299
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,510
there is a strange force


300
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,060
that is trying to separate us.


301
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,940
The Soul Suppressing Orb?


302
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,270
Both my memory and family background


303
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,100
have been sealed.


304
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,910
Could my feelings have been sealed too?


305
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,030
Don't worry,


306
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,790
and don't be afraid.


307
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,260
I'll always stand by your side,


308
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,700
anytime and anywhere.


309
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,220
What are you thinking?


310
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,670
The same as what you're thinking.


311
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,290
Who is the mole


312
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,380
amongst us?


313
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,180
I'm not a mole, definitely not.


314
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,030
I...


315
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,750
Excuse me.


316
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,100
I was inside and eavesdropped on you


317
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,570
the whole time.


318
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,820
You were saying a lot of honeyed words,


319
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,870
and it was awkward for me to come out.


320
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,170
I trust you.


321
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,300
Why are you suspicious of a mole?


322
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,660
The Three La's lost their ability to prying,


323
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,300
so it was at the inn that


324
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,820
the Voodoo Insect got them.


325
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,910
Uncle Li has cleared out the inn


326
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,340
and forbidden others to check in.


327
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,220
Duan also deployed a heavy guard around the inn.


328
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,870
Someone who could get in


329
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,270
and place the Insect


330
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,170
is by no means an outsider.


331
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,220
So?


332
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,810
You're suspecting Uncle Li?


333
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,990
It can't be Uncle Li.


334
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,700
I know he treats us well,


335
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,300
but you don't know for sure.


336
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,790
I see. It's related to


337
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,910
the Spirits Artifacts.


338
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,420
He wants to own it.


339
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,580
Right?


340
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,060
Brother Chu,


341
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,820
I've got no time to explain.


342
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,270
But trust me,


343
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,180
it's not Uncle Li.


344
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,340
Then who would it be?


345
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,700
Du Shangyang?


346
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,910
I heard he is quite temperamental, and...


347
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,030
No.


348
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,170
He's not capable of it.


349
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,790
Besides him, there's another person.


350
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,220
What do you think of the mastermind


351
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,060
behind all this?


352
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,930
Don't worry.


353
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,510
I've got a solution.


354
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,630
Are you feeling cold?


355
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,420
Not as much as it would be in the Ling Borough.


356
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,820
What,


357
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,220
are you homesick?


358
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,100
When we've got spare time,


359
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,940
let's go back there.


360
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,870
To me, home is just


361
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,580
where you are.


362
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,630
Yu Shi,


363
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,870
do you still remember my promise


364
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,550
to you at the Qi Sha Valley.


365
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,820
I said I owed you a wedding.


366
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,580
That was not out of guilt or pity,


367
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,910
it was visceral.


368
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,860
Regardless of the prophecy of Chongming


369
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,550
or the seal of the Soul Suppressing Orb,


370
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,750
at this moment,


371
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,300
I just want you to know that


372
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,220
I, Qin Lie,


373
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,550
am going to marry you, Ling Yushi.


374
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,750
Yushi,


375
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,030
please say yes.


376
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Yushi?


377
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,660
I'm alright.


378
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,460
I suddenly couldn't


379
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,060
hear your voice.


380
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,870
I'm seeing it again.


381
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,300
- Qin Lie!
- Big Brother!


382
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,100
- Big Brother! 
- Qin Lie!


383
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,220
What happened?


384
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,390
It's there.


385
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,510
What's the matter?


386
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,270
Master of the Gongmu House


387
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,030
asked you to retrieve Volume Two.


388
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,750
Why are you still here, Father?


389
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,180
Do I have to do as he says?


390
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,630
Gongmu Shan is too cautious about things.


391
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,300
While it's a good quality,


392
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,100
overthinking can lead to loss.


393
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,460
He only wants his grandson to show up


394
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,940
when the situation


395
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,750
has become flawless.


396
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,150
But sometimes, miscalculation is inevitable.


397
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,790
Chongming is a case in point.


398
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,660
[Hua Yuxin]


399
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,270
But you promised him, Father.


400
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,030
Did I?


401
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,220
He left as soon as he finished talking.


402
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,820
Did I make any promise to him?


403
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,790
Go down there, now!


404
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,150
Remember, only watch,


405
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,990
but don't take action.


406
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,550
Yes.


407
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,630
Go then!


408
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,900
Master Li!


409
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,510
Evil beings.


410
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,220
Shaoyang!


411
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,180
Siqi!


412
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,180
I know that you could find me.


413
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,550
How would I forget


414
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,820
our promise?


415
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,300
Where are my earrings?


416
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,900
I forgot them.


417
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,500
And oh,


418
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,030
what happened to the kids?


419
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,270
When I came back, the town was guarded heavily.


420
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,550
I asked around


421
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,460
and found out Qin Lie is in trouble.


422
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,820
Are they alright?


423
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,940
Yushi was poisoned by the Supreme Voodoo Insect.


424
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,510
Qin Lie and Chu Li are hiding together with them.


425
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,750
Tingyu's whereabouts are unknown.


426
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,180
So where are they now?


427
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,180
And how are they?


428
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,270
Whilst looking for the kids,


429
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,030
I found La Er's shoe


430
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,940
and this comb.


431
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,100
If I tell you I lost it,


432
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,750
while looking for them,


433
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,510
and it coincidentally dropped at


434
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,670
the place where La Er was caught,


435
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,390
would you believe me?


436
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,820
At the Scarlet Tide Continent,


437
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,510
Qin Lie turned to the Nether Race.


438
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,940
I helped the Profound Heaven Alliance capture them.


439
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,860
In your eyes,


440
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,750
I betrayed Qin Lie.


441
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,790
But in my eyes,


442
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,510
he betrayed the entire human race.


443
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,060
But you all think I'm the one to blame.


444
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,670
Afterwards,


445
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,270
I've been considered


446
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,500
entirely unworthy of trust.


447
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,630
I've only got one question.


448
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,700
Did you turn to the Black Voodoo Cult for help?


449
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,820
Song Ting Yu was right.


450
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,150
At the Graveyard of Gods,


451
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,150
I should have followed Ye Yihao.


452
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,150
Even if I ended up getting killed,


453
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,170
at least that would be clear-cut.


454
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,670
Did Tingyu really say that?


455
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,270
Siqi,


456
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,300
I had always been alone,


457
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,390
fighting for myself.


458
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,820
Until one day,


459
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,300
I thought I met someone who wouldn't leave me


460
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
no matter how much I lose,


461
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,870
someone who genuinely knows who I am.


462
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,990
But now it looks like


463
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,460
everything was but a dream.


464
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,300
Siqi,


465
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,790
although I really cherish


466
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,790
the affection between us,


467
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,700
I'm afraid it has eventually


468
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,090
come to an end.


469
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,870
From now on,


470
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,510
we'll part our ways.


471
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,030
Please take good care of yourself.


472
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,550
Shaoyang.


473
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,390
I'm sorry.


474
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,790
The Eye of Frost.


475
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,630
Master.


476
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,940
We were looking for you.


477
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,100
What is it?


478
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,270
Li killed many people in prison.


479
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,300
Big Brother.


480
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,460
He woke up.


481
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,220
Is the headache still there?


482
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,990
Not anymore.


483
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,910
It's gone all of a sudden.


484
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,060
Uncle Li, Duan Qianjie


485
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,460
or Du Shaoyang.


486
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,670
One of them must be in trouble.


487
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,580
I have to find out.


488
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Sister Buli.


489
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,350
The Master of Frost.


490
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,179
You are the legendary Master of Frost.


491
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,989
Killing was the only thing on Li's mind,


492
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,070
as he slaughtered many in the town.


493
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,460
I had no choice but to freeze him.


494
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,699
Someone did it on purpose.


495
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,460
I think you guys


496
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,830
can already guess who she is.


497
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,989
Not really.


498
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,860
Now we need to lure her out,


499
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,790
but with what?


500
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,350
With his life.


501
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,179
Big Brother.


502
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,270
The Eye of Frost.


503
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,210
He deserves death for the massacre.


504
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,790
Do you want to kill him?


505
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,510
Yes.


506
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,070
Then I'll kill you first.


507
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,460
Help me.


508
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,110
Watch out, Qin Lie!


509
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Gongmu Lie!


510
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,270
You're conspiring against me.


511
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,170
How else can we make you show up?


512
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,110
There's another person besides him.


513
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,590
It's Song Tingyu.


514
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,700
In the Imaginary Beast's illusion,


515
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,550
she wanted to kill you many times,


516
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,140
and called you Wuchun.


517
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,380
It also happened when you


518
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,310
entered her mind.


519
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,380
Afterwards, at the Graveyard of Gods,


520
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,550
The Night Fairy also showed


521
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,180
such hatred when she saw me,


522
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,510
which was so close to


523
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,900
what Song Tingyu showed.


524
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,860
The Night Fairy is Song Tingyu, correct?


525
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,350
Wait,


526
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,830
at the Graveyard of Gods,


527
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,380
they were two different people.


528
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,980
That's not true.


529
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,740
They were the same person.


530
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,590
Stop her.


531
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,140
It's half of the divine sense.


532
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,830
You're ganging up on me.


533
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,350
Our guess is right.


534
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,940
Even if you didn't harm the three kids,


535
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,550
you'd be the only one who could


536
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,350
easily steal the Spirit Pillars from me.


537
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,110
Since the meeting at the inn,


538
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,700
you've never showed up.


539
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,700
You were observing us in secret.


540
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,940
There's one thing I couldn't figure out.


541
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,220
Ten millenniums ago,


542
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,700
half of your Spirit Consciousness


543
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,900
left following Gongmu Lie.


544
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,550
Why did it end up as Song Tingyu?


545
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,930
Half of my consciousness followed you,


546
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,110
watching you suffer for this women,


547
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,860
and sealed to unconsciousness by Gongmu Shan.


548
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,270
I was too weak to save you,


549
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,070
so I just stayed by your side.


550
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,830
After ten millenniums, you finally woke up.


551
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,460
I chose the most powerful place


552
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,620
on the Scarlet Tide Continent,


553
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,350
so that I could still protect you.


554
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,140
Half of my consciousness waited for you 
at the Graveyard of Gods for ten millenniums,


555
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,220
The other half protected you 
for another ten millenniums.


556
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,030
But still,


557
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,940
all you care about is this woman.


558
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
How did you manipulate the Supreme Voodoo Insect?


559
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,550
I have my own ways.


560
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,660
The Night Fairy,


561
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,860
expel the poison for Yushi first.


562
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,540
We can sit down and talk.


563
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,460
I'll do that after she dies.
