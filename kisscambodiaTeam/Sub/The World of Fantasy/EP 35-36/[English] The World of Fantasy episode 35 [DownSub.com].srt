[Episode 35]


4
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,180
I think,


5
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,539
I should say it to the forehead of Qin Lie.


6
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,670
But will he be


7
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,070
willing to lend his forehead to me?


8
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,710
What are you doing here?


9
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,350
I am worried about you.


10
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,260
Worried about what?


11
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,810
I can't be better.


12
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,460
You are sad deep in your heart


13
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,260
but why don't you cry it out?


14
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,100
Then you can go sleep after crying.


15
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
You kept nagging last night


16
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,940
and Yushi had to stay up for you.


17
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,460
She is my big sister.
Of course, she had to keep me company.


18
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,070
What does it have to do with you?


19
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,300
Who are you?


20
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,180
Who do you like?


21
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,950
If I have to say a person who I like,


22
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,740
then I like


23
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,070
Tong Xin.


24
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,620
He is adorable and he saved my sister.


25
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,510
But if you are asking about who I love,


26
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,620
then...


27
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,070
I love Yuxin.


28
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,710
In front of you is Yi Yuan.


29
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,950
Why didn't you choose me?


30
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,150
If you don't like or love me, then what is it?


31
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,510
No feeling for me at all?


32
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,870
It is you.


33
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,380
You stupid.


34
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,870
The person I like and love


35
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,350
is you.


36
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,460
Promise me,


37
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,580
find someone who treats you nicely,


38
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,310
has fun banter with you,


39
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,460
and always stays with you, okay?


40
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,820
Of course, I will find someone.


41
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,500
And the one I find


42
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,820
must be better than you.


43
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,990
Xuanxuan, I... I'm...


44
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,190
I told you, you should never apologize to me.


45
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,140
I am leaving.


46
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,060
Then leave.


47
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,710
Why are you looking at me 
as if you don't wanna leave me?


48
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,870
Xuanxuan,


49
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,780
the human heart can change.


50
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,060
You can fall in love with someone again.


51
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,030
I know.


52
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,750
Du Shaoyang,


53
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,990
if I tell you that


54
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,780
you are one of the four spirit artifacts...


55
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,380
I am my own person.


56
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,990
Don't you dare think that
I would be less than you forever.


57
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,220
I told you to go home.


58
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,940
I...


59
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,750
I am going home.


60
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,909
Is this the way home?


61
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,820
It isn't?


62
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,060
Then maybe I got lost.


63
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,500
Look how scatterbrained I am.


64
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
Are you?


65
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,050
Alright.


66
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,910
Fine, I lied to you.


67
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,380
I knew it.


68
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,820
You old man. Tell you what,


69
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,100
I value loyalty more than my own life.


70
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,910
I am persistent and sentimental.


71
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,990
Now that I regard Qin Lie as my big brother


72
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,430
and he is in trouble,


73
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,340
I will not run for my own life 
and leave him in danger.


74
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,210
Are you throwing your own life away?


75
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,030
That's called dying in my prime.


76
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,990
I'd like to sacrifice for our brotherhood.


77
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,990
I don't even want to live to your old age.


78
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,140
Always nagging and gabbling.


79
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,309
Pretending to be gallant but actually a coward.


80
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,830
How rude!


81
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,770
You can go now.


82
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,990
Why? What is your game here?


83
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,940
I also wish to find a friend


84
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,540
who is willing to die for me


85
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,750
or someone


86
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,220
I am willing to sacrifice my life for.


87
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,700
Really?


88
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,460
You do think this way?


89
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,100
It is the right thing to do.


90
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,100
That's why they say...


91
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,390
- Are you leaving or not?
- Life...


92
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,660
I am leaving, I am leaving.


93
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,460
Where are they now?


94
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,510
They're at the Ling Town.


95
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,190
So far away.


96
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,580
Thanks a lot.


97
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,510
Get back here.


98
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,660
Father.


99
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,100
What's going on?


100
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,800
Gongmu Shan is in danger now.


101
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,510
He is trapped in the Six Heaven Fire Formation.


102
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,340
Didn't he go to find Chongming to


103
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,020
ask about Gongmu Hao's whereabouts?


104
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,020
Maybe it's Chongming.


105
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,270
Maybe it's Gongmu Hao.


106
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,830
They are all trapped in the Six Heaven Fire Formation.


107
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,100
I need to go save them.


108
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,270
Don't, father.


109
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,700
The Six Heaven Fire Formation


110
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,870
can only be broken by
the original Scripture of the Nine Hells.


111
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,100
If you go to save them,


112
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,100
you are seeking your own demise.


113
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,700
What demise?


114
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,780
Told you it's sacrificing for my loyalty.


115
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,700
Otherwise,


116
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,220
wouldn't I be less than that brat?


117
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,070
Go watch Du Shaoyang closely.


118
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,460
Don't fight him unless necessary.


119
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,830
Let them settle their


120
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,180
grudge by themselves.


121
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,140
Understood.


122
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,540
Three of the four artifacts are now in their place.


123
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,990
The one who gained something


124
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,020
is Gongmu Lie.


125
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,140
But the one who lost something


126
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,950
is me,


127
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,900
Qin Lie.


128
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,170
As we are getting closer
to the day Gongmu Lie awakens,


129
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,250
it feels that on that day


130
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,830
Qin Lie would be replaced by him.


131
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,140
But I hate to leave those around me,


132
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,900
you in particular.


133
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,900
That's 'cause you care about 
loyalty and relationships.


134
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,990
What you are afraid of


135
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,580
is never heavy responsibilities,


136
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,540
but losing people you care about.


137
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,780
I am afraid of losing you the most.


138
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,830
No matter you are Qin Lie or Gongmu Lie,


139
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,700
I will always stand by your side.


140
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,630
- Where do you think you are running to?
- Mom.


141
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,270
- Mom, stop it. 
- Run, keep running.


142
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,950
You stop right there.


143
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,700
Alright, fine, mom.


144
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,100
Get out of my way.


145
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,780
- Mom. 
- I'll slap you on the butt.


146
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,660
After three more months,


147
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,650
the moon will come out.


148
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,430
Then we'll come back here


149
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,270
three months later.


150
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,310
Why bother waiting for three months?


151
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,740
Even if the moon doesn't come out,


152
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,430
it's still there.


153
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,950
It still knows about what's on our minds.


154
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,650
The moon already knows about
what I am thinking.


155
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,830
Did it tell you?


156
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,750
No, it didn't.


157
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,780
What is on your mind?


158
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,540
Here come the newlyweds.


159
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,260
Here come the newlyweds.


160
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,100
The first kowtow is for the Ancient Masters.


161
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,220
They will be happy


162
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,220
if we are happy.


163
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,510
Every year,


164
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,460
to the moon,


165
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,430
I would make the same wish.


166
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,460
I wish to grow old with you


167
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,460
and stay together forever.


168
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,430
Now the wish has come true.


169
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,750
Even if I am punished for breaking the ban,


170
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,690
I won't regret it.


171
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,740
When all the spirit artifacts are in place,


172
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,510
I will be able to awaken.


173
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,340
Then, we can lift the curse.


174
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,460
Unless you hate me,


175
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,770
otherwise, the curse will never break.


176
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,620
But I would rather die


177
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,990
than let you hate me.


178
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,220
You shouldn't have been so cruel to cast it.


179
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,390
But it saved your life,


180
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,740
so I don't regret anything.


181
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,940
Then today,


182
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,510
we need to do another thing
that we will never regret.


183
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,100
Are you willing to do it?


184
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,540
Yes, I am.


185
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,540
Witnessed by the snow and ice,
matched by the cloud and wind,


186
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,990
Qin Lie and Ling Yushi


187
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,310
of the Ling Town in the far north


188
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,070
will take each other as husband and wife.


189
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,870
We got to know each other.


190
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,580
We made our promises for life.


191
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,430
We will grow old together


192
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,750
and be with each other through everything


193
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,430
with no regret.


194
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,510
I know about the wind, the sea


195
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,190
and most importantly, you.


196
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,390
I devote to you my heart, my affection


197
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,900
and my everything.


198
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,990
With water as wine, 
we hereby take the vow today.


199
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,750
Against a background of violence,


200
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,300
disciples of any sect


201
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,300
are able to swagger


202
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,460
boldly in the open.


203
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,220
Except you,


204
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,750
who are forced to hide in the dark.


205
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,790
It's been ten thousand years.


206
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,660
Do you want to keep living in shadows,


207
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,340
or devote your body


208
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,300
to the Supreme Voodoo Insect left by our ancients


209
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,870
to bring glory to the Black Voodoo Cult again


210
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,820
so you can walk in broad daylight?


211
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,790
We pledge our allegiance to you, Master.


212
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,220
Where is Qin Lie now?


213
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,420
In the snowfield.


214
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,870
The Scarlet Tide Continent.


215
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,990
Ling Town.


216
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,150
It's Chu Li.


217
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,300
Don't pull a long face.


218
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,860
I only got beaten up 'cause I let my guard down.


219
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,390
I'll be fine after resting for a while.


220
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,910
I am so sorry, Yushi.


221
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,570
I occupied your new house.


222
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,940
It's fine.


223
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,060
What should we do now?


224
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,420
Go and find Du Shaoyang.


225
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Go where to find him?


226
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,510
The only lead we have is


227
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,700
the Graveyard of Gods.


228
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,150
Alright.


229
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,460
Let's go now.


230
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,700
If we really find Du Shaoyang later,


231
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,870
don't fight him and leave it to me.


232
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,670
What do you want to do?


233
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,510
Don't worry, he already has a plan.


234
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,670
But Xuanxuan...


235
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,750
I am fine.


236
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,420
You stay here in the Ling Town.


237
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,700
Don't go and risk your life with us.


238
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,510
No.


239
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,540
Every time I left you, I ended up regretting it.


240
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,750
I don't care.


241
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,510
I will go wherever you go.


242
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,750
But I can still see the tears on your face.


243
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,270
Obviously, you are very vulnerable right now.


244
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,180
I am afraid you might hinder us later.


245
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,910
How about you go back and cry for a while?


246
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,260
Shut your mouth.


247
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,390
Let's go.


248
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,150
Such a tough girl.


249
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,060
Let's go.


250
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,220
Master,


251
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,910
I am back.


252
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,550
Master?


253
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,270
When we first met,


254
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,280
it happened to be that time of a year


255
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,150
when the moon was in its zenith.


256
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,380
First met?


257
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,030
You mean ten thousand years ago?


258
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,350
Guess ten thousand years ago,


259
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,990
something happened between us.


260
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,460
You know it better than me.


261
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,300
My master,


262
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,630
there are things I know about


263
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,630
and things I don't know about.


264
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,870
Tell me about it.


265
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,170
I am


266
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,550
a dagger you forged before.


267
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,910
You are the dagger?


268
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,300
I am the first spirit artifact you ever made.


269
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,550
My master,


270
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,910
aren't you happy to see me again?


271
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,870
I am neither happy


272
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,180
or unhappy to see you.


273
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,030
Is that so?


274
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,420
I remember


275
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,750
you were so happy at that time.


276
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,220
But I was not.


277
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,750
If you wanted to make an artifact,


278
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,820
why didn't you make


279
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,630
a blade that slays in the battlefield,


280
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,150
or a strong armor that protects you from enemies?


281
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,990
Instead, you made this insignificant dagger.


282
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,750
You hold a grudge against me.


283
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,100
You were a powerful magic weapon


284
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,580
that killed countless enemies
in the battle with the Human Race.


285
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,180
You fought until the last minute,


286
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,910
but eventually you were broken


287
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,820
and the only part left was the edge.


288
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,420
I hated to see you rust or become scraps,


289
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,510
so, I forged you into a dagger.


290
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,150
You thought you were insignificant,


291
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,220
but you didn't know how valiant you were in battle.


292
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,220
You thought I made you like this willfully


293
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,270
but you didn't know that was the best I could do.


294
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,150
If you pledge allegiance to me,


295
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,630
I promise you that


296
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,100
I will take you with me to the battlefield


297
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,390
and lead the armies.


298
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,550
You pledged allegiance to me,


299
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,940
but why do you still hate me?


300
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,670
Because you're full of lies.


301
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,990
You actually think of me as nothing


302
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,420
even after ten thousand years,


303
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,180
when I woke up from the sleep


304
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,630
and we met in the Ling Town.


305
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,790
At that time, the moon was in its zenith.


306
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,420
I asked you


307
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,910
if you were willing to fight by my side,


308
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,390
you said that


309
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,150
you didn't see eye to eye with me.


310
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,270
But you never asked why


311
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,300
or reflected on what you did back then.


312
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,820
You harbor evil intentions and play dirty tricks.


313
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,590
Your hatred from ten thousand years ago


314
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,790
never stopped.


315
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,100
Then why don't you ask me


316
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,660
why I followed you but still held a grudge?


317
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,300
If you wanna say it, then tell me.


318
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,180
After you forged the dagger,


319
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,300
have you ever drawn it from its sheath?


320
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,550
Yes.


321
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,510
Only once.


322
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,750
You...


323
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,020
You never heard my sobbing.


324
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,420
You failed me.


325
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,870
I huddled in the cold,


326
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,180
dark sheath.


327
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,910
I ate ice and snow,


328
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,140
only waiting to be drawn from the sheath.


329
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,870
You said you'd bring me to the battlefield,


330
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,460
but all you did was to let a woman hold me


331
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,420
and stab me into your own body.


332
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,340
You used me on the battlefield of love.


333
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,580
That's enough.


334
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,340
I know everything


335
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,060
that you just said.


336
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,030
But a spirit artifact is still an artifact.


337
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,940
You won't be blamed. Just come back.


338
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,300
Why would I choose to be your servant


339
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,220
instead of the master of the Black Voodoo Cult?


340
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,510
I haven't paid you back for your kindness,


341
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,580
how can I go back now?


342
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,750
How will you pay me back?


343
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,550
Ten thousand years ago,


344
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,500
because of her,


345
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,940
you broke your promise to me.


346
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,300
Today, I will use your blood


347
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,670
to compensate all my hatred and grievance.


348
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,820
That's enough.


349
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,870
You are getting more and more absurd.


350
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Let's just fight.


351
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,220
Such a long speech!


352
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,450
You want to fight or not?


353
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,220
Charge!


354
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,460
Don't kill them.


355
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,220
Xuanxuan, go bring them back.


356
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,460
Understood.


357
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,300
Qin Lie,


358
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,870
what are you doing?


359
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,460
I knew that you are my spirit artifact.


360
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
What did you say?


361
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,940
I didn't tell you


362
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,270
because I had so many doubts and questions.


363
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,940
I wondered why you betrayed me again and again.


364
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,580
I also wondered


365
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,030
why I could never fully trust you.


366
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,220
I didn't dare to tell you everything


367
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,100
but I didn't want to let you go either.


368
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,180
Now I finally know.


369
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,150
I forged you as my first spirit artifact.


370
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,510
And I also failed you.


371
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,100
Ten thousand years ago 
and ten thousand years later,


372
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,990
I am the one who owes you.


373
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,170
So, the only thing I can do


374
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,630
is use my blood to wash away


375
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,270
your grievance and anger.


376
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,990
What would I want your blood?


377
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,150
Are you alright?


378
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,150
I am fine.


379
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,820
I won't die for a moment.


380
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,670
Thank you for letting me do this.


381
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,670
You always know what I want.


382
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,820
If you don't want to be the dagger,


383
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,670
then just be Du Shaoyang.


384
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,750
But then,


385
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,300
you won't be able to go back to be Gongmu Lie.


386
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,270
If I had a choice,


387
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,270
I would rather be Qin Lie.


388
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,390
You are willing to let me go?


389
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,060
What's the point of forcing you to stay?


390
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,510
Everyone has the right to choose


391
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,020
their own path in life.


392
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,790
I want more than being a dagger.


393
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,100
I want to be Du Shaoyang.


394
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,720
I want to be human.


395
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,790
I want to have all the emotions of a man


396
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,340
with their joys and happiness.


397
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,030
I don't care if you are


398
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,180
genuine or not this time,


399
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,550
but from this moment,


400
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,990
we don't owe each other anymore.


401
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,820
We'll go our separate ways.


402
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,170
And I hope we'll never see


403
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,300
each other ever again.


404
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,180
Who are you?


405
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,580
Jiang Yan,


406
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,100
the residual power of the voodoo insects


407
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,700
can no longer save you. Die.


408
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,630
Jiang Yan.


409
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,390
How is it possible?


410
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,150
Who is it?


411
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,420
People from ten thousand years later.


412
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,790
[Su Mie, slayer of the Surah Realm]


413
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,300
Ten thousand years later?


414
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,410
Ten thousand years later?


415
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,870
We traveled back to ten thousand years ago.


416
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,690
Just now, I knew I was doomed


417
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,030
so I buried the remaining power of


418
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,340
the Supreme Voodoo Insect 
deep underground in the Spirit Realm.


419
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,460
I just waited


420
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,790
for people to take the power


421
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,940
so I can bring them back


422
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
to help me escape and change my fate.


423
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,910
Turns out,


424
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,990
you never wanted me to bring glory to the Cult,


425
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,510
you were just using me!


426
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,420
You need to kill them.


427
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,270
Otherwise, don't even think about going back.


428
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,220
Alright.


429
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,860
I'll kill you with them then.


430
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,510
Is this far away enough?


431
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,220
I think so.


432
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,620
What do you wanna do?


433
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,380
Then I'll start it.


434
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,220
No, no, no.


435
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,620
I'm gonna use the bomb to help you repent.


436
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,310
No.


437
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,350
Don't.


438
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,990
No.


439
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,380
Let go!


440
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,790
It will blow you up.


441
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,420
I can't.


442
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,940
We agreed to save them.


443
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,790
Weird.


444
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,990
I can't wield the Power of Earth.


445
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,750
The sand feels unusually cold too.


446
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,590
Something is wrong.


447
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,180
The Power of Earth is not working.


448
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,070
Du Shaoyang,


449
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,180
you are a spirit artifact!


450
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,350
You should go to your master when there's danger.


451
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,940
Your only way out is to help your master awaken.


452
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,860
Qin Lie, help me.


453
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,980
She must have a good reason.


454
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,460
Let's hold it until she wakes up.


455
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,660
I'll try my best.


456
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,510
Are you dead?


457
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,830
No.


458
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,790
Are you dead?


459
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,590
No.


460
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,550
Don't bomb us. Please.


461
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,460
Don't bomb us. Don't.


462
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,660
You...


463
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,620
Are you okay now?


464
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,460
Your Terminator Profound Bomb is indeed powerful.


465
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,750
It killed the voodoo insects in us.


466
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,830
Pay for our medical bills!


467
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,410
You bombed us so badly,


468
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,030
you need to compensate us with lots of money.


469
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,220
They are definitely okay now.


470
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,990
Let's go. Let's bomb Du Shaoyang.


471
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,380
Wait.


472
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,270
It wasn't Du Shaoyang.


473
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,500
What are you saying?


474
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,220
If it weren't him,


475
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,310
then who did this?


476
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,780
It's the Night Fairy.


477
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,180
The Night Fairy?


478
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,830
The Night Fairy?


479
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,030
You saw it through.


480
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,220
You are so annoying, woman.


481
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,590
I knew it was you.


482
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,940
Now I don't have to worry.


483
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,550
Worry about what?


484
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,940
No matter if what's happening outside is real or not,


485
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,860
as long as you are behind it,


486
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,980
you will never hurt Qin Lie,


487
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,850
not under any circumstance.


488
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,590
It's Gongmu Lie.


489
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,700
The name doesn't matter.


490
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,110
You won't hurt him anyway.


491
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,940
Now that I saw it through,


492
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,620
why don't we be honest with each other


493
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,460
and leave here together?


494
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,180
Now that you know he's not in danger,


495
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,900
why hurry to leave?


496
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,700
Why not sit down and have a chat


497
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,140
so we can know more about each other?


498
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,860
Maybe,


499
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,900
you will find out that my resentment towards you


500
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,420
is merely a misunderstanding.


501
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,340
Maybe,


502
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,460
I will stop this.


503
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,100
How did you know it's fake?


504
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,610
I tried to use the Power of the Earth,


505
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,660
but it didn't work.


506
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,780
And I felt this chill in my body.


507
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,620
I tried to gather sand into a sword,


508
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,380
but my wrist felt numb.


509
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,220
How can sand make you feel cold?


510
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,110
Only ice and snow can do that.


511
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,210
Right.


512
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,830
That's what I thought.


513
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,460
Then I remembered that,


514
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,990
we were in the Ling Town.


515
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,460
The far north,


516
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,790
where snow and wind never stops.


517
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,900
Such a miserable life.


518
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,750
So I began to think,


519
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,270
maybe this is not sand


520
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,790
but ice and snow.


521
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,900
Maybe we didn't go back to ten thousand years ago,


522
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,900
but we're still in the Ling Town,


523
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,990
and we never left there.


524
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,620
So observant.


525
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,620
When you have doubts,


526
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,620
you just pay extra attention.


527
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,310
I wasn't sure until you said...


528
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,380
Du Shaoyang,


529
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,030
you're a spirit artifact.


530
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,140
You should go to your master when there's danger.


531
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,620
Your only way out is to help him awaken.


532
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,110
How would Jiang Yan know


533
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,030
Du is a spirit artifact?


534
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,590
He's the voodoo master.


535
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,790
He sees everything through.


536
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,350
What's so strange about it?


537
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,310
But the most important thing is that


538
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,510
you can't hide your resentment towards me,


539
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,900
no matter how hard you try.


540
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,350
I'm afraid the only person that hates me


541
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,700
this much in the world,


542
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,180
is you, the Night Fairy.


543
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,590
We are still in the Ling Town.


544
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,850
This so-called ten thousand years ago,


545
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,220
is just an illusion you created.


546
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,030
Great!


547
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,650
So brilliant!


548
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,380
I'm so scared. I won't hate you anymore.


549
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,260
What are you after?
