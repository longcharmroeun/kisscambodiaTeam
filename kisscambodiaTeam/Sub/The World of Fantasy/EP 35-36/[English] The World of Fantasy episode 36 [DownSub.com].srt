[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,150
[Episode 36]


4
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,500
We're still in the Ling Town.


5
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,820
It's just an illusion you created


6
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,110
that feels like ten thousand years ago.


7
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,070
Good job.


8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,670
Clever.


9
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,390
I worry that I might not be able to hate you again.


10
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,260
What exactly do you want?


11
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,710
Yushi.


12
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,710
You think this is the best we can get?


13
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,660
What do I want?


14
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,460
Why do you have so many questions?


15
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,810
You really don't care about Qin Lie 
 out there, do you?


16
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,540
You won't hurt him, will you?


17
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,980
Those people are slayers from the Surah Realm.


18
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,710
If this is just an illusion,


19
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,140
could slayers be real?


20
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,740
Of course not.


21
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,310
They are the illusions


22
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,950
created by the Supreme Voodoo Insects.


23
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,740
They take orders from me.


24
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,100
They won't hurt Qin Lie


25
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,260
without my command.


26
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,180
It's just


27
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,060
you've made me sleep now.


28
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,660
They can be brutal


29
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,820
without my instructions.


30
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,540
I see. Qin Lie is protected by the Spirit Pillar.


31
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,870
But they're the Supreme Voodoo Insects.


32
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,530
The Spirit Pillar is only a tiny object.


33
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,350
How could it protect him


34
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,460
from the Supreme Voodoo Insects?


35
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,350
This is my divine sense.


36
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,990
I'm the Master here.


37
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,790
You will obey me


38
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,510
even if you are the Mother of Earth.


39
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,310
Go! Leave!


40
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,660
I won't. Let's go together.


41
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,260
Yushi is still trapped in there. I can't leave.


42
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,500
Don't you want to be human?


43
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,380
Go, then!


44
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,310
You pretended to give yourself away


45
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,820
so that you could lure me in.


46
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,060
That's right.


47
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,430
I know.


48
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,540
You're better at playing it cool than Qin Lie.


49
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,310
When I was feeling cold


50
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,940
and found out you were going to


51
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,540
use the strength of the earth,


52
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,150
I knew you would see through my plot at any point.


53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,710
So,


54
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,380
I lied to you that Du Shaoyang was a spirit artifact.


55
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,100
I made a slip of the tongue 
 on purpose to lure you in.


56
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,780
Then you made me talk to


57
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,500
to buy you more time.


58
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,710
What are you playing at?


59
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,660
Take it easy.


60
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,340
All in good time.


61
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,940
It's done!


62
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,820
What exactly do you want?


63
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,940
I want to awaken Du's bloodline.


64
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,990
I want him to be a spirit artifact and 
 go back to where he belongs.


65
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,430
Gongmu Lie will wake up this way.


66
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,540
Weren't you trying


67
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,710
to stop him from waking up?


68
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,870
I didn't expect that


69
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,310
your love for Qin Lie


70
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,380
could let him break the


71
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,150
Forbidden Curse Wuchun had cast on him


72
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,780
and love you back.


73
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,260
That's why you want him to wake up


74
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,660
and change back to Gongmu Lie.


75
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,430
The Forbidden Curse works better on the latter.


76
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,470
Yes. He won't


77
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,100
miss you a bit by then.


78
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,190
Night Fairy, stop it.


79
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,820
Shut up.


80
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,260
Gongmu Lie will hate you for this.


81
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,250
You're just my substitute.


82
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,940
You don't deserve to mention his name.


83
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,260
Get out of here!


84
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,820
I can't allow you to do this.


85
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,220
You can't hurt Qin Lie.


86
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,750
Song Tingyu.


87
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,780
The man you love


88
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,710
will never love you again.


89
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,980
Don't!


90
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,140
Gongmu Lie, this is just an illusion.


91
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,429
The Night Fairy created it all.


92
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,950
Please don't.


93
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,870
Gongmu Lie, you're finally back.


94
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,510
Leave!


95
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,580
Do you know how much I missed you?


96
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,870
If you had listened to me


97
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,340
not to go to the Deserted Spirits Realm,


98
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,310
you wouldn't have to sleep for ten thousand years.


99
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,510
It's none of your business


100
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,700
where I went.


101
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,660
You.


102
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,130
Tell me


103
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,990
what's going on.


104
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,540
Where is he?


105
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,510
At least we need to find his body if he dies.


106
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,950
Damn it.


107
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,780
Could he be abducted by the Night Fairy?


108
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,100
Hang on.


109
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,190
The spatial energy is unusual here.


110
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,430
La Fei. La Er.


111
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,190
Here it is.


112
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,510
How did you get the


113
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,510
Supreme Voodoo Insects from Jiang Yan?


114
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,460
I was trapped in the Graveyard of Gods 
for ten thousand years.


115
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,830
I didn't know the Insects were buried


116
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,540
beneath until


117
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,780
I sensed the Voodoo Master.


118
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,660
Then I tried to control Du Shaoyang with them.


119
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,460
I didn't expect to be hurt by Sheng Xie


120
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,990
when I was recovering the first spirit artifact.


121
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,220
I pretended to repent


122
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,340
and stayed inside the Spirit Pillar to recover.


123
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,950
I was waiting for my time.


124
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,700
I didn't expect Du Shaoyang


125
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,830
to plot against me with the Voodoo Insects.


126
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,780
I took this opportunity


127
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,430
to send the fire diagram into their bodies.


128
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,950
I'll kill them.


129
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,830
I'll kill them all.


130
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,190
You know who your real master is?


131
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,190
Yes, we know.


132
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,900
Too right!


133
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,700
You will all obey me.


134
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,190
Otherwise,


135
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,340
the fire diagram inside you


136
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,870
will burn you out.


137
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,380
Of course.


138
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,870
The Night Fairy is controlling 
the Supreme Voodoo Insects.


139
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,390
Qin Lie is trapped in the illusion with others.


140
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,870
What do we do now?


141
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,270
Hang on.


142
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,870
Let me think.


143
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,750
Have you done with it?


144
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,830
No. No. No.


145
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,830
Have you finished?


146
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,390
I found out that you were in the Ling Town


147
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,190
through the Ghost Eye Race.


148
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,780
So, I tricked Du into meeting you there


149
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,190
to prevent the last spirit artifact 
 from returning to its master.


150
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,900
I didn't expect that Qin Lie 
 would rather let Du leave


151
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,190
than awaken himself.


152
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,190
My plan failed.


153
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,530
So, I had to create an illusion


154
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,660
that the Voodoo Master was killed
 ten thousand years ago.


155
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,540
They were forced to wake up


156
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,310
when faced with danger.


157
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,140
You were a badass.


158
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,540
You almost killed Qin Lie.


159
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,540
No, I didn't. That was nothing


160
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,580
as long as you can wake up.


161
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,900
What if I did not?


162
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,940
You would rather let me die


163
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,990
than see me


164
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,100
with another woman.


165
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,780
That's right.


166
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,630
No.


167
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,540
Stop there.


168
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,660
Gongmu Lie.


169
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,700
I am always your mentor and friend.


170
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,750
I've always stayed with you.


171
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,890
I've been waiting for you for ten thousand years


172
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,740
while you were sleeping.


173
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,100
You should even want to kill me


174
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,270
after all this time?


175
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,430
You stopped me ten thousand years ago.


176
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,950
You plot against me after all this time.


177
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,460
Shouldn't I kill you?


178
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,220
Yes, you should.


179
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,900
You should.


180
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,700
You should.


181
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,430
Since you do not want to live with me,


182
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,830
why don't you die with me?


183
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,210
How about this?


184
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,630
Have you made up your mind?


185
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,460
I'm still thinking!


186
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,180
Still thinking?


187
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,780
What the hell are you thinking about?


188
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,220
They're fighting inside!


189
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,580
You're so useless. I'll do it myself.


190
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,990
Damn.


191
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,140
They can't hold it anymore.


192
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,770
It's going to explode!


193
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,830
Chu Li, do something!


194
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,950
Chu Li?


195
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,140
What are you doing with this turtle shell?


196
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,190
Shut up.


197
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,390
You know nothing, do you?


198
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,900
You lot from the Scarlet Tide Continent.


199
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,990
Our sect are the maters of bombs.


200
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,190
You are only good at


201
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,540
setting them off like firecrackers.


202
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
We're different.


203
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,900
We practise using our spirit energy.


204
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,020
The more skilled we get,


205
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,100
the more likely we are to 
 make it an integral part of us.


206
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,630
Hang on.


207
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,310
You want to crack the illusion 
 with a human bomb?


208
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,020
Would you die of it?


209
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,870
No.


210
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,190
That's impossible.


211
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,990
But my skill is not yet perfect.


212
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,540
I still need your help when I throw the Bomb.


213
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,430
You need me to throw you then?


214
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,070
Many thanks in advance.


215
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,830
You have the Illusory Demon Sect to thank!


216
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,540
They're in grave danger. Come on.


217
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,070
Step aside, guys.


218
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,780
Chu Li.


219
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,819
Gongmu Lie.


220
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,869
You gave me a body.


221
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,980
However,


222
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,420
I've suffered a lot as a human.


223
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,870
Since you wish so,


224
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,820
have it your way then.


225
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,420
Kneel.


226
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,670
I don't want to give in.


227
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,510
You were a gun owned by the God Race.


228
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,020
You were born to kill your own master.


229
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,790
I despise


230
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,940
my own fate.


231
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,940
I hate what it means to be natural.


232
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,340
You killed him


233
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,820
to defend the dignity of the God Race.


234
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,420
Won't give in?


235
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,910
That's why you're Du Shaoyang.


236
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,100
You have the bloodline of the God Race.


237
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,140
I am the only one that connects with you.


238
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,390
You will only become my spirit artifact


239
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,940
if you are willing to obey me.


240
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,050
Don't you worry that I might kill you


241
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,820
if I am born to kill my master?


242
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,510
No spirit artifact wants


243
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,150
a reputation like that.


244
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,270
You're so loyal to me


245
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,910
that you don't even mind your reputation.


246
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,550
I understand you.


247
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,580
Only you


248
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,180
are able to change my fate.


249
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,220
This is


250
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,340
your only opportunity.


251
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,740
Who dares to stop me?


252
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,550
How dare you.


253
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
I know you. In the Deserted Spirits Realm,


254
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,940
you refused to tell me the whereabouts


255
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,580
of my father.


256
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,100
Sister. Sister. Sister.


257
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,820
Sister.


258
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,910
Sister.


259
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,390
I knew.


260
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,340
Once Qin Lie wakes up,


261
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,630
I will lose him forever.


262
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,340
I don't know him.


263
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,630
I know you always don't mean what you say.


264
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,510
You can never make me forgive the Surah Realm.


265
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,910
Never!


266
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,390
I...


267
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,060
Let go of her! Let go of her!


268
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,910
Let go of her! Let her go!


269
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,580
I've been holding these grudges 
for ten thousand years.


270
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,150
I can only calm myself


271
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,790
if I kill all its people.


272
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,630
I won't let you leave


273
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,550
till my last breath.


274
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,210
Don't hurt her!


275
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,460
Why I still remember you


276
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,580
when you already forget me?


277
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,940
Was it because I cursed you


278
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,700
but forget to curse myself?


279
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,410
I didn't forget to curse myself.


280
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,100
It's just I don't want to forget you.


281
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,700
I don't want to forget the joy of love.


282
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,510
I want to remember you.


283
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,340
Remember what you look like,


284
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,990
no matter it's been a thousand,


285
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,180
or ten thousand years,


286
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,550
no matter whether you still remember me or not.


287
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,870
You've cast a Forbidden Curse on Gongmu Lie.


288
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,060
Yes.


289
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,150
What else?


290
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,420
Nothing.


291
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,820
What else?


292
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,990
Nothing.


293
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,990
You should have forgotten each other.


294
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,910
But only he got the curse.


295
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,550
You forgot to cast it on yourself.


296
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,420
You worried that if he ever woke up,


297
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,700
no one would be able to 
 see him through difficult times.


298
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,460
You would rather suffer 
 the bitter love on your own.


299
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,860
Your love for Gongmu Lie


300
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,990
will go beyond time.


301
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,790
You aren't even aware


302
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,060
of that yourself.


303
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,330
One day,


304
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,030
when you understand it


305
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,100
and still don't


306
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
regret it,


307
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,910
that's when you can truly wake up.


308
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,220
Sister Wuchun.


309
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,870
The Mother of Earth.


310
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,420
Donâ€˜t cry.


311
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,630
I'm still your sister.


312
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,910
Sister.


313
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,270
Do you know how to save him?


314
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,180
He will be fine.


315
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,820
Where is Gongmu Lie?


316
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,050
He's left for the Surah Realm for revenge.


317
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,510
He's gone too far.


318
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,100
You can't get him back.


319
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,460
I need him to come back.


320
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,750
Gongmu Lie.


321
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,700
Follow the stars and come back.


322
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,990
Gongmu Lie.


323
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,060
Follow the stars and come back.


324
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,390
Does it mean...


325
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,390
The universe is turned upside down?


326
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,820
I've never seen this before.


327
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,670
Before the universe was created,


328
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
the world had been chaos.


329
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,420
The Mother of Earth had been able to


330
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,980
get the spirit energy from the sky


331
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,620
and control the space and dimension.


332
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,260
However, this could only be done


333
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,870
if she sacrifices herself.


334
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,510
Wanna stop me?


335
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,030
Can you?


336
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,750
Gongmu Lie.


337
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,750
Don't go there.


338
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,380
Why do you stop me?


339
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,870
Ten thousand years ago,


340
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,220
you refused to tell me where my father was.


341
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,820
Now,


342
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,630
you want to stop me from going wherever I like.


343
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,220
I hate you so much.


344
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,670
I've been hating you since ten thousand years ago.


345
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,060
No!


346
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,700
I hate you!


347
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,820
Don't!


348
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,990
I'm now casting the Forbidden Curse on you,


349
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,460
using my blood, as the Queen of the Nether Race.


350
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,060
I forbid you, Gongmu Lie


351
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,670
from ever falling in love with Wuchun.


352
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,510
Ridiculous.


353
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,870
How could a tiny curse


354
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,300
stop Gongmu Lie from loving Wuchun?


355
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,870
If it fails,


356
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,270
I am willing to pay you back with my life.


357
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,510
You're ruthless.


358
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,420
I have to.


359
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,870
How do I


360
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,210
break this curse?


361
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Unless


362
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,930
you hate me.


363
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,990
I'm sorry.


364
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,460
It's my fault.


365
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,340
I don't want to see you die.


366
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,390
So, I asked you to hate me.


367
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,180
The curse broke because of hatred.


368
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,060
That's why you saw


369
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,340
yourself killing the person you love.


370
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,510
It would hurt you to the core.


371
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,870
It's all because you were so ruthless.


372
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,670
And that's why


373
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,220
you hurt me to the core.


374
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,550
The deeper the love, the deeper the hate.


375
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,780
We will go down in history


376
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,860
because of hatred.


377
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,300
There isn't hatred


378
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,300
without love.


379
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,740
Back at that time,


380
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,270
we met for one moment


381
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,550
after missing each other for ten years.


382
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,460
Now,


383
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,060
we finally get to meet


384
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,390
after ten thousand years.


385
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,220
Gongmu Lie,


386
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,910
can you promise me something?


387
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,870
Never enter the Surah Realm


388
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,150
until the time has come


389
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,300
and you are ready.


390
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,100
You know me as well as


391
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,100
Qin Lie knows Ling Yushi.


392
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,090
I am always slower


393
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,460
on this.


394
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,510
I know you less than you know me.


395
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,780
It's alright.


396
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,410
You still have ten thousand years.


397
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,820
I only need to say one thing to you


398
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,750
in ten thousand years.


399
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,790
You don't have to say it.


400
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,870
You don't have to prove it.


401
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,580
But you can forget it.


402
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,580
I will prove it with my whole life,


403
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,150
with my life as Gongmu Lie and Qin Lie.


404
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,670
Because


405
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,940
you are my wife.


406
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,990
This is what I can give you.


407
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,150
The last leaf of heart.


408
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,990
I'll keep your soul here.


409
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,340
It stays with me forever.


410
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,860
If you ever meet someone


411
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,220
throw it away.


412
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,060
I only


413
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,940
need you


414
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,700
in my life.


415
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,820
Chu Li.


416
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,550
Yu...


417
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,340
Wu...


418
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,940
Look after Xuanxuan.


419
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,070
Don't worry.


420
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,179
I will always be with her.


421
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,070
If she dies,


422
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,139
I will die with her.


423
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,449
Gongmu Lie,


424
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,790
ask Tong Xin to save Sister.


425
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,140
Don't.


426
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,140
He...He...


427
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,540
He...He can save Yushi.


428
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,110
He is with that...


429
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,070
That...


430
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,590
Old bastard Hua.


431
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,660
He is with him.


432
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Master Hua?


433
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,130
Can you save my sister?


434
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,420
They can.


435
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,510
Us?


436
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,070
You can't bring people back to life.


437
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,860
But you can borrow the strength of the earth.


438
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,660
How?


439
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,270
Let the Mother of Earth return to the earth.


440
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,260
She might be able to come to life.


441
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,420
Are we there yet?


442
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,270
She can't make it any longer.


443
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,860
You need to leave her even if you can't.


444
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,620
Close it.


445
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,900
The Ghost Eye Race is asking the Earth for help.


446
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,830
Please resurrect the Mother of Earth.


447
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,930
Show yourself.


448
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,310
I need to go looking for my father


449
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,750
and my grandfather.


450
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,510
Go with me


451
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,380
if you want to.


452
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,510
I won't stop you


453
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,270
if you want to leave.


454
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,550
I'll be back


455
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,860
by the time you wake up.


456
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,900
Let's go.


457
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,830
Take me with you.


458
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,750
I don't take kids.


459
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,790
How about this?


460
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,660
Not bad.


461
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,380
They've all gone. I know you miss them.


462
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,750
I would rather you died forever.


463
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,380
You just want to make me cry.


464
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,310
I make you cry?


465
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,220
I only want to make you laugh.


466
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,220
Besides,


467
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,590
you never cried for me.


468
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,700
You only cried for Yiyuan,


469
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,940
for Hua Yuxin,


470
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,900
and Tong Xin. Right?


471
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,370
I will blow you up with my Bomb!


472
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,030
They never mean what they say,


473
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,220
that's what grown-ups are like.


474
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,830
Teasing each other.


475
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,500
Never gets to the point.


476
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,140
You lot,


477
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,830
wanna go with us?


478
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,550
We need to stay here,


479
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,790
waiting for the regeneration 
 of the Mother of Earth.


480
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,900
We need spirit stones, as many as possible.


481
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,550
You can take these.


482
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,940
I'll have my people bring you the rest.


483
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,380
Xuanxuan,


484
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,070
one can change their mind.


485
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,270
One can always fall in love again.


486
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,310
We're never going to starve again. Never.


487
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,140
Will you go or not?


488
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,510
Always so slow.


489
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,140
Bye-bye.


490
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,900
Gongmu Lie has woken up.


491
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,310
The four spirit artifacts have been restored.


492
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,350
However,


493
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,270
there's still a long way to go


494
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,830
to overthrow the tyranny of 
 the Heaven Fighting Race.


495
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,110
Under the leadership of Gongmu Lie,


496
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,990
they are heading to the Surah Realm.


497
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,550
A new journey has begun.


498
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,940
They will fight for justice.


499
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,220
They will fight for the Spirit Realm.
