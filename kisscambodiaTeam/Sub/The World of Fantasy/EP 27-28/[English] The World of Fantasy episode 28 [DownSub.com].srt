[Episode 28]


4
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,220
You really didn't hear what we said?


5
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,100
Feeling guilty now?


6
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,710
Were you speaking ill of me


7
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,990
just now?


8
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,810
How could I?


9
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,220
Do I look like that kind of guy?


10
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,540
Let's get down to business.


11
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,030
Why are you here today?


12
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,990
Ling Yushi.


13
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,430
What's your relationship?


14
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,100
We're friends.


15
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,020
Friends?


16
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,870
How long have you known each other?


17
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
How much do you know about her sister?


18
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,740
Why do you look familiar?


19
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,820
The air turbulence in the Graveyard was so strong.


20
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,180
I've just got out. I'm all mixed up now.


21
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,990
I'm drawing a blank here.


22
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,790
Why do you want to learn so much about her?


23
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,540
To help her, of course.


24
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,100
Don't you think we need to help her?


25
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,180
Look,


26
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,590
she's nice and beautiful. She's also talented.


27
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,990
It's a pity


28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,180
she's got something on her mind.


29
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,310
Her sister's incidents must be a blow to her.


30
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,230
How're you going to help her?


31
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,540
Lie to her.


32
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,020
Lie?


33
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,710
It doesn't hurt if I


34
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,100
get one more elder sister.


35
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,590
You're so kind.


36
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,710
We thought as soon as she woke up


37
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,500
she would figure out what happened to me first.


38
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,230
It turned out that


39
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,430
you are her priority.


40
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,180
That what she's like.


41
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,610
She seems to be rash


42
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,460
and headstrong.


43
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,590
But she's warmhearted and kind.


44
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,460
She cares more about me than anyone else.


45
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,510
She asked me a lot of things.


46
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,620
I worried I might give it away.


47
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,300
So, I said I couldn't remember.


48
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,380
What do we do now?


49
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,870
Let's go ahead with it.


50
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,790
Yiyuan,


51
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,710
will you do me a favour?


52
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,820
She used to annoy me.


53
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,310
But now,


54
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,700
well,


55
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,650
since you had asked me to find out about her sister,


56
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,780
my memory came back


57
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,470
as she told me about her.


58
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,590
Qianqian, it turns out that


59
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,750
I've been to the Scarlet Tide Continent before.


60
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,310
I met you there.


61
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,220
We fell in love at first sight.


62
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,060
We agreed to get married.


63
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,909
We travelled together


64
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,340
to Ling Town,


65
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,580
where we met Ling Yushi and Qin Lie.


66
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,100
Yushi


67
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,190
had been missing her sister so much that


68
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,860
she mistook you for her sister.


69
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,380
We got along well with each other.


70
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,030
I had pity on her.


71
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,870
So, I regarded her as my elder sister.


72
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,310
We didn't expect that


73
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,660
Ling Town got a massive attack from the spirit beasts.


74
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,910
We helped them fought with the beasts.


75
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,430
There's a spirit beast in the far north


76
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,100
called the Love Eaters.


77
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,060
They feed on the feelings of beloved ones.


78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,430
We were attacked by this beast.


79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,710
We got lost and never managed to


80
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,750
recognise each other ever since.


81
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,500
Are you lying to me?


82
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,470
If you've changed your mind


83
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,910
and don't want to be with me anymore,


84
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,780
you can call that a lie.


85
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,460
I shouldn't suspect you.


86
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,780
We won't get separated anymore.


87
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,340
I've always been thinking about you.


88
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,659
Even my feelings were eaten up.


89
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,220
I still remember you.


90
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,190
Why don't you remember me


91
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,990
like I do?


92
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,780
Does that mean I love you


93
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,430
more than you love me?


94
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,820
No, it doesn't.


95
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,540
The beasts which attacked us


96
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,630
were a mother and a son.


97
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,860
The son ate you and I got its mother.


98
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,540
She ate up more feelings than her son.


99
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,340
Oh, that's why.


100
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,750
You've suffered a lot.


101
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,340
That's nothing.


102
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,630
Let's go to find my sister now.


103
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,630
Don't give it away.


104
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,210
Sister.


105
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,150
Sister.


106
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,860
You really are my sister.


107
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm sorry.


108
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,990
I forgot who you are earlier on.


109
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,340
I'm your sister.


110
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,630
Never say sorry to your sister.


111
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,540
Sister,


112
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,470
although I can't remember what happened in Ling Town.


113
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,940
It doesn't matter.


114
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,380
I can call you my sister again.


115
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,430
If I ever forget, I'll do it again.


116
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,100
You'll always be my sister


117
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,530
no matter what.


118
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,630
Ok.


119
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,870
We'll return to Ling Town together.


120
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,540
There there. Stop crying.


121
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,710
Did I act that well?


122
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,870
I was just moved by you.


123
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,870
You pretended it so well.


124
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,060
I almost started to believe


125
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,990
you've picked up your memory.


126
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,190
Don't you forget.


127
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,590
I'm a talented student of the Illusory Demon Sect.


128
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,710
Just stop acting.


129
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,870
When she hugged me,


130
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,460
it really felt like she's my sister.


131
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,140
If she asks me to do anything,


132
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,750
I'll do for her.


133
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,630
Don't...


134
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,540
Don't cry.


135
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,990
Please don't cry.


136
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Fine.


137
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,460
Let's cry together.


138
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,580
I'll look after her. You can have some rest.


139
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,340
The Night Fairy,


140
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,460
what do you want to tell me?


141
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,510
Is it about Gongmu Lie?


142
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,630
I need to know


143
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,630
what happened after I left you.


144
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,390
Kid,


145
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,270
are you lost?


146
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,870
Where's your family?


147
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,190
Gongmu Lie.


148
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,750
Qin Lie.


149
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,570
Tingyu.


150
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,300
Yes. I do love Qin Lie.


151
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,700
I don't need a reason. I just love him.


152
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,140
I see.


153
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,510
Song Tingyu,


154
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,630
thank you.


155
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,510
We'll protect Gongmu Lie


156
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,750
together in the future.


157
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,340
You are me


158
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,020
and me you.


159
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,460
When I was on the Land of Far North,


160
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,750
looking at the moon obscured by the clouds,


161
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,750
I was ambitious.


162
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,420
I made up my mind


163
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,950
that I would get to somewhere higher


164
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,460
to enjoy the star-lit sky.


165
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,630
We first met


166
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,780
in Ling Town


167
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,990
during the Moon Festival.


168
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,750
I had the same ambition.


169
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,020
I also hoped to see what's behind the clouds.


170
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,100
You're the only one


171
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,100
who shared the same goal with me.


172
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,070
We were heading toward the same goal


173
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,950
but we took different paths.


174
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,660
Only at that time.


175
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,430
I was willing to die for Ling Town.


176
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,870
You wanted to fight for Nebula Pavilion.


177
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,140
But after we fought so many times,


178
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,430
we ended up being on the same boat.


179
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,900
Just a coincidence.


180
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,020
You asked Li Mu to take me here.


181
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,020
Wasn't it because you want to humiliate me?


182
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,540
Every time I see the bright moon,


183
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,220
it always reminds me of you


184
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,180
who gave this opportunity.


185
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,100
You're Du Shaoyang.


186
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,870
You don't need my help.


187
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,650
Even if I hadn't requested the extra sword token,


188
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,540
you would still be able to sit here 
 and enjoy the moonlight.


189
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,390
When did you start to respect me like this?


190
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,950
I realised that only if we work together,


191
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,070
can we achieve great things.


192
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,340
We're friends but we're also enemies.


193
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,750
Neither of us is willing to be outshined.


194
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,870
We just can't work well together.


195
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,100
Only one of us


196
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,140
can shine brightly.


197
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,700
But only if we cooperate,


198
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,460
can we fight against the darkness.


199
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,020
In the beginning, you


200
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,140
were just a novice in Ling Town.


201
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,540
But you were willing to


202
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,830
fight hard for what you cared about.


203
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
As the Pavilion Master,


204
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,310
I was always hesitant.


205
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,070
Maybe at that time, I really envied you.


206
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,950
I envied that you were just nobody.


207
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,020
Everyone


208
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,660
can choose what to fight for.


209
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,780
It's terrible


210
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,870
if one doesn't know where his dream is.


211
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,580
There we are, Senior Brother.


212
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,700
You didn't even ask me to join you!


213
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,660
Am I your buddy or not?


214
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,340
Why don't you go to sleep?


215
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,190
It's a lovely night.


216
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,390
What're you talking about?


217
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,070
These nonsense about the moon and stars.


218
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,990
Senior Brother,


219
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,100
you're dashing.


220
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,700
Let me guess,


221
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,580
at least three ladies like you.


222
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,830
Even if Song Tingyu doesn't admit it,


223
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,220
I know she likes you.


224
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,070
Shut up. Let's drink.


225
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,990
I wish I could be as talkative as you.


226
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,020
I've been interrogating Duan all day.


227
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,630
I got nothing from him.


228
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,390
What do you want to know?


229
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,950
Let me help you.


230
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,990
I'll blow him up if he doesn't say anything.


231
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,020
Just stop it.


232
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,900
Those Bombs are expensive.


233
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,460
You think you're playing fireworks?


234
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,190
I don't care about money.


235
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,580
Look at yourselves.


236
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,510
You're dull but women still like you.


237
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,940
I'm rich, handsome,


238
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,820
and powerful.


239
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,540
Why doesn't anyone like me?


240
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,010
That's just not fair!


241
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,020
There there, Brother Chu.


242
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,630
You're Master of Love in the Void Realm.


243
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,700
Please take my respect.


244
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,430
You're flattering me.


245
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,340
Willing to give in like this?


246
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,580
What does that mean, Saintess Song?


247
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,460
Qin Lie already starts to strike up a relationship


248
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,340
with the Terminator Sect and 
 the Illusory Demon Sect


249
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,220
as soon as he comes to the Land of Chaos


250
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,990
from the Scarlet Tide Continent.


251
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,830
Seeing someone who


252
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,140
used to be nothing but a murderer of your father


253
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,190
outshining you,


254
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,740
you must feel bitter.


255
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,870
I always know you


256
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,130
are good at sowing discords.


257
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,430
I'm just wondering


258
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,700
what made you say so


259
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,220
today.


260
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,630
After all, you still love...


261
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,510
Qin Lie?


262
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,070
He's nothing to me.


263
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,089
You really think you're friends now?


264
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,099
You're willing to let go of the grudges


265
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,060
just because you drank together?


266
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,460
I never sell you short, Du Shaoyang.


267
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,790
You're as ambitious as Qin Lie.


268
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,910
What now?


269
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,270
Going to regard him as your Big Brother?


270
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,510
Hoping that he could help you?


271
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,790
Siqi,


272
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,670
why don't you wake up?


273
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,340
You said you were going to stay with me,


274
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,700
no matter what.


275
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,170
I'm so worried


276
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,510
seeing you lying here.


277
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,270
I worry that you might not ever wake up again.


278
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,300
You won't blame me,


279
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,270
teach me,


280
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,940
plot against me anymore.


281
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,750
You said


282
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,460
you didn't want me to make any choice


283
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,940
I would later regret.


284
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,940
What do I have to lose


285
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,940
if I won't feel regret?


286
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,750
Siqi,


287
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,940
as long as you wake up,


288
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,270
you can do whatever you like.


289
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,150
Shaoyang.


290
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,630
Siqi.


291
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,100
I don't want you to go.


292
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,150
Who said


293
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,180
"Siqi, as long as you wake up,


294
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,910
you can do whatever you like."


295
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,580
I see.


296
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,750
Men like you are just liars.


297
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,030
No men will accept


298
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,340
a request like this!


299
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,870
But Yushi is in trouble.


300
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,420
I won't just sit around and do nothing.


301
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,340
That's her own business.


302
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,220
Qin Lie should help her. It has nothing to do with you.


303
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,270
Men can't help with this.


304
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,150
You can't, either.


305
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,460
You just woke up. I can't let you go.


306
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,940
Qin Lie looked down upon you.


307
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,700
I want to stand up for you. So I woke up.


308
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,300
Everyone will soon know about the fact


309
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,220
that we got out from the Graveyard alive.


310
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,820
We can't stay here any longer.


311
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,870
As long as we get back to the
 Heavenly Slaughter Continent,


312
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,150
the Illusory Demon Sect will make sure we're safe.


313
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,870
Let's stick to our plan then.


314
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,550
Don't linger


315
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,270
no matter whether we win or lose.


316
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,030
That's a tough guy.


317
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,510
Thank you.


318
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,100
No worries. Just leave it to us.


319
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,030
I've bought off the manager.


320
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,580
We'll leave this afternoon.


321
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,790
How did you manage to do that?


322
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,390
Duan Qianjie bribed him with 
ten thousand spirit stones.


323
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,820
How much did you give?


324
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,060
Ten thousand?


325
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,100
I offered ten times of this.


326
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,870
Guys, bad news.


327
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,910
They're auctioning


328
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,940
a piece of breaking news at the auction house.


329
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,380
What news?


330
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,340
Our whereabouts.


331
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,940
It's you?


332
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,510
Of course not.


333
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,990
I don't dare to offend him


334
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,510
even if I took ten thousand spirit stones


335
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,060
from Duan Qianjie.


336
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,180
How could you


337
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,580
cover up big news like this?


338
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,790
It's complicated.


339
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,820
Who's selling the news?


340
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,390
Who is the most well-informed


341
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,100
on the Land of Chaos?


342
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,940
My people.


343
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,540
I know how to find them.


344
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,990
Leave it to me.


345
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,340
We need to split up.


346
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,870
8000 spirit stones from the Xiahou Family.


347
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,580
Brother, 10,000 premium spirit stones
  from the Celestial Artefact Sect.


348
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,700
Tell me only it's over ten thousand.


349
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,940
What's the big news they want to sell? That's a lot.


350
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,790
Do you live here?


351
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,340
Who are you?


352
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,460
You've earned so much.


353
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,940
Why don't you buy a house?


354
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,420
That's none of your business.


355
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,630
You will go with me first.


356
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,220
Let us go! Help! Help!


357
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,940
Let go of us!


358
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,060
Let go of us!


359
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,390
Help! Help!


360
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,550
Wanna fight with Yushi?


361
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,340
You like her.


362
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,390
I'm not interested in her.


363
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,670
Well,


364
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,270
how about me?


365
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,060
That's my robe.


366
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,510
It's got your scent.


367
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,810
I don't want to have sex with you.


368
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,750
You're infected by the Voodoo insect.


369
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,910
You don't have that in your heart then?


370
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,460
Then why do you feel butterflies?


371
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,700
I'm thinking about killing you.


372
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,820
Why don't you just


373
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,100
have a bite of me?


374
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,940
Then you can decide if you want to kill.


375
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,820
You're too naive


376
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,550
to seduce me.


377
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,820
I'm just shy.


378
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,750
You're not even good-looking.


379
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,460
You're so mean.


380
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,340
You will only be able to trade 
 a bottle of wine with your body.


381
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,220
Wanna get the Scripture of Nine Hells?


382
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,820
You wish.


383
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,180
Fine.


384
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,100
Shall we make a deal?


385
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,260
You want to bribe me


386
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,220
since you can't seduce me?


387
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,460
What's this?


388
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,460
No one can get ancient dead bodies


389
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,300
from the Graveyard of the Gods.


390
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,990
But one can always get some other


391
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,390
treasures.


392
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,270
There's nothing like this 
 spirit stone in this world.


393
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,460
Since there's nothing like it,


394
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,910
how could it be a treasure?


395
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,460
I'm the Senior Sister of the 
Celestial Artefact Sect.


396
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,990
I'm the student of Master Mohai.


397
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
Even if you have no regard for
 the Scarlet Tide Continent,


398
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,090
you must respect Master Mohai.


399
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,820
I admit he's not bad.


400
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,060
Now you can believe


401
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,300
I am able to recognise it if 
 it doesn't belong to this world.


402
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,100
Tell me about it.


403
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,390
This is called the Shadowless Stone.


404
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,180
You can steal everything valuable


405
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,940
in this world without being detected.


406
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,870
Even masters several levels above


407
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,460
won't find out about it.


408
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,930
Can I trade this for your Scripture


409
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,340
of Nine Hells?


410
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,420
I don't need to steal from others.


411
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,260
It is said that


412
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,750
you can steal women's hearts with it.


413
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,390
You can't win everyone's heart.


414
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,460
Get away from me.


415
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,870
Or I'll take off all your clothes 
 and send you to the manager.


416
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,460
Fine, you win.


417
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,030
What if Sister can't handle those three kids?


418
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,420
She will be fine.


419
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,550
Here they come.


420
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,580
Where are the kids?


421
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,340
They're in the room.


422
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,380
Tang Siqi hasn't returned yet?


423
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,060
No.


424
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,570
Did she fail?


425
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,270
She can't be.


426
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,700
Let's go out and have a look.


427
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,870
What's going on?


428
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,550
It's just a fight.


429
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,460
Such a big audience.


430
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,390
Let's do it quickly.


431
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,300
Wait a minute.


432
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,300
Give us the Scripture of Nine Hell first.


433
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,510
That's unfair if you won't take it out


434
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,150
or give me either.


435
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,510
Right then.


436
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,510
I see. You like it this way.


437
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,450
You were plotting against me?


438
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,420
I told you.


439
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,100
The Shadowless Stone can help you


440
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,220
steal everything in this world.


441
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,030
You didn't believe me.


442
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,100
You can steal women's hearts


443
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,740
with this stone.


444
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,340
You can't win everyone's heart.


445
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,270
I know I'm not good-looking enough


446
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,060
to seduce you.


447
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,030
I was just pretending.


448
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,630
I just let your guard down 
 so that I can steal from you.


449
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,940
Manager.


450
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,090
Here I am.


451
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,700
Wanna escape?


452
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,030
Farewell.


453
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,390
You betrayed me


454
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,790
even if I gave you ten thousand?


455
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,910
Someone gave me twenty thousand.


456
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,180
What's wrong?


457
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,060
We're getting pleased too soon.


458
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Look up.


459
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,420
A bad penny.


460
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,390
Here we are, again.


461
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,270
Who are you, Duan Qianjie?


462
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,150
I forgot to tell you.


463
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,510
These cities near Heavenly Calamity Continent


464
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,700
are also under my jurisdiction.


465
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,300
Our Master once told us


466
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,180
there's a mysterious inspection department


467
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,870
regulating all the sects.


468
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,180
You're the one in charge.


469
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,790
Can we re-launch the teleportation?


470
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,180
Maybe I can help you with that.


471
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,700
We've now returned it to you.


472
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,340
Thank you.


473
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,210
What do you want exactly?


474
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,180
Her.


475
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,550
Duan Qianjie,


476
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,790
we don't want to fight with you.


477
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,910
Besides,


478
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,750
you don't want to kill us, right?


479
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,510
Give her to me.


480
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,060
Or...


481
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,219
The Spirit Pillars.


482
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,750
It doesn't work.


483
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,580
Is yours broken?


484
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,030
Master Duan,


485
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,300
you've always been hoping to compete with me.


486
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,219
How about...


487
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,610
I'm not interested anymore.


488
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,380
I only want her now.


489
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,940
Fine. I'll go with you.


490
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,110
Shut up.


491
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,739
I don't know why


492
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,139
you sent troops to besiege us.


493
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,139
You're spies.


494
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,620
I've never seen someone


495
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,300
so shameless as you are.


496
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,380
You're the one who stole from my sister.


497
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,550
You're just abusing your power to 
take revenge on us.


498
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,830
She's right.


499
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,860
Bullshit!


500
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,380
I don't care if you're in charge here.


501
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,460
I don't know about


502
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,220
this stone, either.


503
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,860
I don't care about who you are.


504
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,380
How could you offend the Chu family


505
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,700
and the Terminator Sect?


506
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,220
Since you killed my people,


507
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,270
I'll charge you with the crime of treason.


508
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,900
Will you be able to


509
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,740
take that?


510
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,990
Ridiculous.


511
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,660
Step aside.


512
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,350
What's going on?


513
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,620
This is the Realm of Ruins outside all realms.


514
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,550
This is the birthplace of the Nether Race.


515
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,220
I'm Chongming, the current Mother of the Earth.


516
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,510
She's my daughter, Wuchun.


517
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,030
He's the successor of the 
 Gongmu family, Gongmu Lie.


518
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,590
You two were forced to sleep


519
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,700
in order to save your race.


520
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,510
Men are born to be kind and evil.


521
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,310
I'm afraid that even if you can wake up one day,


522
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,590
your memories will have been all wiped out.


523
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,110
They can be used by someone evil.


524
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,750
Therefore, I took down your story


525
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,750
with my last power.


526
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,220
I've kept them in the Scripture of Nine Hells.


527
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,180
I've set a rule for it.


528
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,750
The second volume of the Scripture will only open


529
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,350
when Wuchun and Gongmu Lie reunites


530
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,830
and the four spirit artefacts


531
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,550
are collected.


532
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,270
Here are the four spirit artefacts.


533
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,790
The Mother of the Earth rules the Nether Race.


534
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,620
The title gets passed on to each generation.


535
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:34,140
The Realm of Ruins is full of dazzling treasures.


536
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,780
We're grateful to be born on this land.


537
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,070
We don't dare to keep these treasures by ourselves.


538
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,220
We need to make good use of the resources.


539
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,830
Hence, we trade with the leader of the Human Race,


540
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,620
the Gold rank force.


541
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,270
We supply the Human Race with gemstones,


542
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,990
so that their living standard got improved.


543
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,860
I come to find the Mother of the Earth.


544
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,140
Do you recognise me?


545
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,100
The Young Master of the Gongmu family, Gongmu Lie.


546
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,270
You were a kid when we first met.


547
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,070
You're a grown-up now.


548
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,900
Why do you pay a visit again?


549
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,590
I heard that the Ghost Eye Race, 
one of the Nether Race


550
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,180
can collect information of all kinds.


551
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,380
What information do you want to know?


552
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,940
About my father.


553
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,180
The god of war, Gongmu Hao.


554
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,550
It is said that your father died \nduring the war of the God Race.


555
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,930
I don't believe it.


556
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,220
You think


557
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,860
the Gold rank force hid the truth from you?


558
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,830
No one in the Spirit Realm will speak about it,


559
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,460
not even my grandpa.


560
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,860
The world is such a chaos.


561
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,750
That information is true and false.


562
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,350
His spirit never dies.


563
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,350
Stop beating around the bush.


564
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,310
The Realm of Ruins never interfere
 with the Spirit Realm.


565
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,700
The Ghost Eye Race only gather
 information of our race.


566
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,380
If you won't help me,


567
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,700
I'll make one more step further


568
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,070
to destroy the Realm of Ruins.


569
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,660
Where's Wuchun?


570
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,750
She's my daughter. You've met before.


571
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,590
Why's she involved?


572
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,990
Wuchun will be the next Mother of Earth.


573
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,750
I want to know what she will do about this.


574
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,460
I love you.


575
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,270
I am your true love.


576
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:07,980
I am.


577
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,700
I am. I love her more than you do.


578
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,900
Don't force me!


579
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,060
Both of you said you love me.


580
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,220
How...how


581
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,270
would I know who to choose?


582
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,650
What is she doing?


583
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,790
Telling who is sincere and who is not.


584
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,110
She is the most insincere person in this world.


585
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Choose me!


586
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,350
I am the one that truly loves you!


587
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,830
It's not my fault.


588
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,180
Both of you said


589
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,660
you truly love me.


590
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,660
But you run for your life at this critical time.


591
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,510
Gongmu Lie wants us to help him


592
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,340
find about the truth of his father's death.


593
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,180
How are you going to deal with it?


594
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,110
We never interfere with the Spirit Realm


595
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,220
other than supplying them with gemstones.


596
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,270
If we don't agree, he will destroy us.


597
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,990
I thought you would


598
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,510
control your temper as an adult.


599
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,660
Answer my question.


600
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,350
What difference would it make 
even if you know the truth?


601
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,740
You can't find him. You can never get him back.


602
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,590
Why?


603
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,990
Because you don't have enough power.


604
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,350
Unless


605
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,460
you have the Crimson Fire to guide you.


606
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,830
I have.
