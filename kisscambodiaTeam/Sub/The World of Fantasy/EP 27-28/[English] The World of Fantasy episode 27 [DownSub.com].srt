[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:39,150
[Episode 27]


4
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,470
Chu Li, from the Terminator Sect.


5
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,789
Where's Tang Siqi?


6
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,670
Let me introduce him.


7
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,539
This is the Third Heavenly Swordsman,


8
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,750
Yan Baiyi,


9
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,940
the youngest Sword Holder


10
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,670
in the history of Mount Heavenly Sword.


11
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,710
Yan Baiyi.


12
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,110
After we came here,


13
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,539
we went separate ways.


14
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,110
I was looking for you guys,


15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,620
and I found her first.


16
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,180
But she already got poisoned.


17
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,860
The Black Voodoo Cult.


18
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,070
They wanted to take her away


19
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,110
so I fought back.


20
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,430
But I couldn't do it alone.


21
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,590
Luckily, Yan showed up and saved me.


22
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,350
But we couldn't get Siqi out.


23
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,070
Why did they take her?


24
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,590
According to Yan,


25
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,870
The Black Voodoo Cult use voodoo insects


26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,350
to control people,


27
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,340
and turn them into killing machines.


28
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,510
Yan, is there any antidote


29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,540
to the poison?


30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,380
You can kill the person


31
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,820
that placed the insects.


32
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,740
Then the voodoo will lose its effect.


33
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,740
That's the only way.


34
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,740
The Black Voodoo Cult travel secretively


35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,420
and they're good at hiding their identities.


36
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,620
It's difficult to find them,


37
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,020
unless you've crossed paths before.


38
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,260
Please help us, Yan.


39
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,890
We need to find them


40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,230
and rescue Siqi.


41
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,460
If she means this much to you,


42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,710
I will most definitely help.


43
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,310
I will go with you.


44
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,990
Let's go.


45
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,020
Xuanxuan,


46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,540
this is the Ling Borough.


47
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,380
We grow up here together.


48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,260
Do you remember that


49
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,430
we used to play here


50
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,170
and make Qin Lie into a snowman?


51
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,510
Stop.


52
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,430
Could you stop looking at me like that?


53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,510
It's a bit too much.


54
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,100
I'm not your sister, seriously.


55
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,810
You took me for the wrong person.


56
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,590
This is your hometown?


57
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,950
How did we end up here?


58
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,170
Cut this nonsense out.


59
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,070
My hometown?


60
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,230
This is the Graveyard of Gods.


61
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,740
What tricks are you pulling,


62
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,980
bringing me here?


63
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,070
Wait. Don't get angry.


64
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,990
Let me figure out what's going out.


65
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,710
Sis, maybe you got it wrong.


66
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,260
Maybe she just looks like her.


67
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,030
Don't you guys always say that


68
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,590
I look like Hua Yuxin?


69
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,870
It's exactly because you look like him,


70
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,710
that she said you're on her mind.


71
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,820
That just proves


72
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,340
she is Xuanxuan.


73
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,470
I don't follow.


74
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,630
Do you remember 
the Armament Sect's secret state?


75
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,060
The Imaginary Beast.


76
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,870
Yeah, our Spirit Consciousness has great potential.


77
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,750
Everything we see and hear,


78
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,470
everything we think and do


79
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,470
is all controlled by it.


80
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,100
Back then, Qin Lie walked


81
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,100
into the Imaginary Beast's belly first,


82
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,260
so his Spirit Consciousness brought us


83
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,030
to the Purple Mist Sea, the place he yearns to go.


84
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,030
There should be something similar


85
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,380
behind this door.


86
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,220
Xuanxuan was the first


87
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,870
to walk into this door.


88
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,340
Her Spirit Consciousness


89
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,870
brought us to the Ling Borough.


90
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,310
This means that deep down,


91
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,150
she wants to go home.


92
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,820
Oh, I see.


93
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,990
If she's the one who brought us here,


94
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,030
let's just wait and see


95
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,190
where she'd like to go,


96
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,220
and who she'd like to see the most.


97
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,659
I'm sorry.


98
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,780
I just miss my sister too much.


99
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,590
And you really look like her.


100
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,540
So I mistook you for her.


101
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,190
It's fine now, you figured it out.


102
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,660
But,


103
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,430
why did we end up here?


104
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,220
I don't know.


105
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,150
But now that we're here,


106
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,810
we might as well keep walking


107
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,590
and see what we'll see.


108
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,910
Alright.


109
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,710
Deep down,


110
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,940
who is the person you wanna see the most?


111
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,870
Father.


112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,940
He's your father?


113
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,100
So he's her father too.


114
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,930
Xuanxuan.


115
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,500
Xuanxuan.


116
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,150
Father.


117
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,870
Being apart from loved ones is hard.


118
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,470
Being on the other side is even harder.


119
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,540
I can't bear that


120
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,909
I will forever be apart from my beloved family.


121
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,340
The roads ahead of you might be long and lonely,


122
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,540
feeling scared is nothing but normal.


123
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,310
But my daughter,


124
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,990
please be courageous and carry on.


125
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,310
Father, don't you blame me


126
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,030
for leaving the Ling Borough behind


127
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,030
for my selfish pursuit of love?


128
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,030
No, I don't.


129
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,430
A mother's love for her daughter


130
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,190
is obvious and clear.


131
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,990
But a father's love


132
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,429
is like a snowflake,


133
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,780
you need to look closer


134
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,430
to see how beautiful it is.


135
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,990
Where are we? Who does she wanna see?


136
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,580
Yuxin.


137
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
Xuanxuan.


138
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,820
Gee, I do look like him.


139
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,270
You asked me to come here


140
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,900
but kept me waiting for this long.


141
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,270
I'm leaving.


142
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,460
Xuanxuan.


143
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,750
Marry me.


144
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,990
Marry me.


145
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,660
What took you so long?


146
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,580
Do you know how many years


147
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,950
I've waited for that?


148
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,750
My love for you


149
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,780
is as pure as snow.


150
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,700
But you're dead now.


151
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,140
Yuxin.


152
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,460
Xuanxuan.


153
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,830
Xuanxuan.


154
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,460
Yuxin.


155
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,750
Yuxin.


156
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,100
Why did all those men disappear?


157
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,750
Don't disturb him.


158
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,070
Did you hear anything?


159
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,190
Stop asking him.


160
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,580
He would tell you if he did.


161
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,540
I thought you could help us figure things out


162
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,380
so I followed you here.


163
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,100
Who would knew


164
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,950
the great Qin Lie from the Scarlet Tide Continent,


165
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,390
has absolutely no power here?


166
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,090
Can't even protect your woman.


167
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,780
Du Shaoyang, you...


168
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,460
Let it go.


169
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,950
Don't argue with him.


170
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,660
I don't wanna argue with you either.


171
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,900
I should have killed you in the Nebula Pavilion.


172
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,390
I should have never agreed to work with you.


173
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,900
Du Shaoyang, watch your tone.


174
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,310
You're right.


175
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,430
I should have killed you a long time ago.


176
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,220
Looks like you two are not getting along.


177
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,020
Du, let's get out of here.


178
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,580
Wait.


179
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,390
I might have a way.


180
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,430
Do you wanna try it out?


181
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,540
Xuanxuan.


182
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,210
Yuxin.


183
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,020
Yuxin.


184
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,540
Xuan.


185
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,580
Xuanxuan.


186
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
Sister,


187
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,630
Yuxin is dead, isn't he?


188
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,430
I couldn't find him.


189
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,390
I couldn't even find his body.


190
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,830
Yuxin.


191
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,390
Where are you?


192
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,190
I haven't even got the chance 
to tell you I like you.


193
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,190
How could you leave like this?


194
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,630
Yuxin.


195
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,460
Please come back to me.


196
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,140
Yuxin.


197
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,310
Wake up.


198
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,020
You're not Ling Xuanxuan,


199
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,510
you're Pan Qianqian.


200
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,780
Where's Yuxin?


201
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,140
Hua Yuxin.


202
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,870
Come home.


203
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,100
Come home, please.


204
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,390
Come back to me.


205
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,540
Hua Yuxin,


206
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,140
come home.


207
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,990
Yuxin,


208
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,340
come back, please.


209
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,770
You wanna use the Spirit Pillars


210
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,420
to check what's behind that door?


211
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,580
Where am I?


212
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,900
Why can't I remember anything?


213
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,900
My face hurts, why?


214
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,070
We just got attacked


215
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,220
by unknown forces.


216
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,750
We were all knocked out.


217
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,750
Do you really not remember anything?


218
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,900
No.


219
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,430
That's good.


220
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,190
Yeah, that's good.


221
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,140
What's over there?


222
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,900
Yushi. Yiyuan.


223
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,570
Yushi.


224
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,980
Qin Lie.


225
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,220
Xuanxuan.


226
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,660
She's not xuanxuan.


227
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,750
She's from the Illusory Demon Sect,


228
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,950
she just looks like her a lot.


229
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,780
Qin, what are those over there?


230
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,060
They're the bodies of the Ancient Gods.


231
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,700
The bodies from the legend?


232
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,180
Legend has it that the three Masters are


233
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,630
legendary figures in primordial ages.


234
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,060
The Master of Thunder ranked the first, 
the Master of Fire the second


235
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,150
and the Master of Ice the third.


236
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,270
Records show that,


237
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,670
the Master of Thunder is the strongest among them


238
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,630
and found a way to control thunders.


239
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,630
The other two Masters


240
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,820
has also reached the Genesis Realm.


241
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,980
As for their race,


242
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,510
although they're human


243
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,100
but their powers reached the highest realm.


244
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,700
So who do you think


245
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,030
these bodies belong to?


246
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,270
Me.


247
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,810
Alright.


248
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,870
The Third Heavenly Swordsman, Yan Baiyi,


249
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,300
has almost never showed up in public.


250
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,700
Nobody knows his age or appearance.


251
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,180
That's why you chose him to deceive us.


252
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,820
Am I correct?


253
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,460
Young Master of the Black Voodoo Cult, Ye Yihao?


254
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,940
I was watching you guys,


255
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,510
[Ye Yihao, the Black Voodoo Cult]


256
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,150
but I didn't notice


257
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,910
when you found out about me.


258
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,170
The Nebula Pavilion.


259
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,460
The Nebula Pavilion.


260
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,030
What's so special about it?


261
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,910
Tang Siqi was poisoned


262
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,420
but Shaoyang looked calm.


263
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,860
I was already wondering why.


264
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,620
Plus, the first time that


265
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,670
I worked with him against a common enemy


266
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,460
was in the Nebula Pavilion.


267
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,510
I noticed those hints,


268
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,990
so I waited quietly


269
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,820
for an opportunity.


270
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,910
Qin Lie.


271
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,700
I don't know


272
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,300
why you didn't follow us right away.


273
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,670
Perhaps you were waiting for enforcement.


274
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,910
But that gave me the time


275
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,460
to tell him everything.


276
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,180
Then,


277
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,420
I whispered it to Yushi.


278
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,100
You poisoned Tang Siqi,


279
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,580
and used it to threaten Du


280
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,180
to get close to us


281
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,180
and attack us from the inside.


282
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,510
I also told them that


283
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,910
you use bells to control poisoned people,


284
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
so we need to


285
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,220
restrain your hands once we strike.


286
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,030
How impressive given you're 
from the Scarlet Tide Continent.


287
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,300
I underestimated you.


288
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,820
Why plot against us?


289
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,700
You have the Demon Sealing Tombstone.


290
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,940
That's the only way to get out of here.


291
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,700
But, I'm curious about one thing.


292
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,550
I have your girl,


293
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,550
aren't you afraid that I would kill her?


294
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,180
Or maybe, between women and friends,


295
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,670
you choose friends.


296
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,390
Between you and Qin Lie,


297
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,870
of course I pick him.


298
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,030
Such a touching bromance.


299
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,550
Since you've chosen your friend,


300
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,550
don't blame me for hurting your woman.


301
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,940
Siqi.


302
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,940
Xie Jingxuan.


303
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,220
Huang Shuli.


304
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,220
You joined the Black Voodoo Cult?


305
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,670
I follow whoever treats me well.


306
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,210
You conniving bitch.


307
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,670
To think about...


308
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,420
That I even had a crush on you!


309
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,180
I liked you back then.


310
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,990
Qin Lie, let me take the bodies


311
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,100
and use the Tombstone


312
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,820
to open the gate, or I'll kill you.


313
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,460
This is the Graveyard of Gods.


314
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,300
Let us both die here,


315
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,340
right next to the ancient Masters.


316
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,510
What an honor!


317
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,150
Siqi, wake up.


318
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,030
Siqi.


319
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,340
Siqi, it's me.


320
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,820
Siqi,


321
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,270
it's me.


322
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,790
It's me.


323
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,220
Huang Shuli,


324
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,510
how dare you betray your sect and join a cult!


325
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,390
I'll help our Master get rid of scums like you today.


326
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,270
Qin Lie, the Tombstone.


327
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,940
You guys leave. I'll cover for you.


328
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,210
Xuanxuan.


329
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,630
Wuchun.


330
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,270
Turns out, you're me and I'm you.


331
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,790
Hurry. Let's go.


332
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,630
Xuanxuan, follow us.


333
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,790
I got you.


334
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,780
Yushi.


335
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,630
I'm fine.


336
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,940
Where's Xuanxuan?


337
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,170
Yiyuan. Yiyuan.


338
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,390
Stop yelling. I'm right here.


339
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,030
Is everyone okay?


340
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,670
Siqi.


341
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,060
Where's Song Tingyu?


342
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,670
Over there.


343
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,870
Who're you?


344
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,670
Watch out.


345
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,180
He tried to kill us back in the Graveyard of Gods.


346
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,940
Don't.


347
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,340
You can use thunder.


348
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,180
Who the hell are you?


349
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,420
If I wanted to kill you,


350
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,420
you would all be dead now.


351
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,060
Stop talking


352
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,510
or you'll die.


353
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,300
We just overcame great difficulties,


354
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,750
so we'll live a long life.


355
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,340
Follow me.


356
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,940
In your dream.


357
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,100
The Sculptures of Nine Hells.


358
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,270
What?


359
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,220
I heard the Sculptures of Nine Hells.


360
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,550
summoning me from here.


361
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,220
But when I got here,


362
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,330
it already disappeared.


363
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,150
I long heard of the Nether Queen,


364
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,300
Mother of Earth


365
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,870
on the Scarlet Tide Continent.


366
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,990
It's you?


367
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,150
Interesting.


368
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,550
Guess I didn't waste my time coming here.


369
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,870
I trust him.


370
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,750
The Lone Ranger, Duan Qianjie.


371
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,270
Duan Qianjian, your reputation precedes you.


372
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,630
I heard you like to go around picking fights.


373
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,100
Why don't you have a go at me?


374
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,340
I don't mind,


375
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,100
but never met you before.


376
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,050
Well, you met me today. Let's have a fight.


377
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,060
I don't wanna do it today.


378
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,780
Where's the Mother of Earth?


379
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,980
Siqi has a voodoo insect in her,


380
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,790
so she's trying to cure Siqi.


381
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,700
She can deal with voodoo insects?


382
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,940
Interesting, indeed.


383
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,750
I'll wait for her.


384
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,150
You also have voodoo insects?


385
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,270
I wanna have a fight with her.


386
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,750
If she wins,


387
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,500
I'll give this back to her.


388
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,140
Seriously? How shameless.


389
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,630
You're a dude. Don't pick on women.


390
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,270
Please tell her I'll wait for her to have a fight.


391
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,990
Wanna fight me? You're not qualified.


392
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,390
It's not up to you.


393
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,460
You don't get to decide.


394
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,150
The Eye of Frost!


395
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,340
Don't you dare hurt him!


396
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,390
There's a deadly flaw in the Eye of Frost.


397
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,300
You come out at the exact place


398
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,660
where you disappeared.


399
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,670
I just need to wait there


400
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,580
to take your life.


401
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,030
The Eye of Frost? More like the shell of a turtle.


402
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,100
That's why I said, you're not qualified.


403
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,660
How arrogant!


404
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,820
You, go get her.


405
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,510
My power can only


406
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,460
suppress the poison for now,


407
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,820
I can't get rid of it.


408
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,220
You go take care of Duan Qianjie.


409
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,100
Du and I will take over here.


410
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,180
Be careful.


411
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,340
Duan.


412
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,290
She's your sister?


413
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,550
I knew you were following us


414
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,790
in the Graveyard of Gods.


415
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,940
Do you know her?


416
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,460
Why else would I knock her out?


417
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,300
It is because,


418
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,820
there are things you don't want her to know?


419
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,910
You're a smart one.


420
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,820
Yuxin.


421
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,150
Yuxin.


422
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,870
Yuxin.


423
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,630
Yuxin.


424
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,390
Yuxin.


425
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,180
Yuxin? Is he your lover?


426
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,460
He must be.


427
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,630
Yuxin.


428
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,670
So pretty. Follow us.


429
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,100
- Let us take care of you. 
 - Yuxin.


430
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,870
- Let's go. 
- Yuxin.


431
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,910
Stop it.


432
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,420
Attack.


433
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,060
You can't even stand firmly,


434
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,990
yet you dare to do this kind of thing.


435
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,340
You nosy bastard.


436
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,500
You dare to ruin this for me?


437
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,140
I'm in a good mood today.
 I don't wanna kill you.


438
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,220
Don't waste time talking. Let's go.


439
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,910
Go away.


440
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,150
Stop following me.


441
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,270
I thank you for your kindness.


442
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,750
No need.


443
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,550
Didn't know you're a nice dude.


444
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,940
Then why didn't you just take her


445
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,870
to the Ling Borough?


446
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,180
She lost her memory.


447
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,390
Couldn't answer any of my questions.


448
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,820
Was I supposed to put up a missing person notice,


449
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,460
and sort out everything for her?


450
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,990
The Heartless Slave.


451
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,750
Did she get into trouble with Xie Yi?


452
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,100
Xie Yi?


453
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,870
Master of the Eight Extreme Temple?


454
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,510
I heard he's an arrogant moron.


455
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,570
What happened after that?


456
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,180
What else could have happen?


457
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,670
I left her with the Illusory Demon Sect.


458
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,510
They only have women there. 
It was easy for the both of us.


459
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,630
Those in the Illusory Demon Sect 
only practice low-level illusory arts.


460
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,180
Except for the Master, Yu Linwei,


461
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,340
she is the true artist of illusion.


462
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,550
So, Master Yu used illusory arts


463
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,460
to give Xuxuan a fake identity as Pan's daughter


464
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,060
and a disciple of the Illusory Demon Sect?


465
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,550
That's correct.


466
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,940
Any way we can undo that?


467
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,270
No idea.


468
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,100
What does Master Yu think?


469
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,150
No idea.


470
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,090
You know nothing.


471
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,910
So what?


472
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,270
May I ask why you insist on having a fight with me?


473
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,750
You're the only one with real skills


474
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,210
in this group.


475
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,460
But I won't take advantage of you,


476
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,270
you're tired today,


477
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,930
so I'll come back tomorrow.


478
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,180
Is it how people hit on girls here?


479
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,300
Challenge them to a fight?


480
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,300
You talked shit about my brother 
and tried to pull his girl.


481
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,820
No man could put up with it.


482
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,340
Stop talking.


483
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,060
May I ask


484
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,270
if you know Li Mu?


485
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,310
You called my Eye of Frost a turtle shell.


486
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,460
Talk business or get lost.


487
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,110
I asked you to look out for them.


488
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,590
That's how you do it?


489
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,370
What?


490
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,900
I even followed them to the Graveyard of Gods.


491
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,700
That's because


492
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,750
you wanted to check it out.


493
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,990
I just wanted to see


494
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,110
what kind of garbage you brought back


495
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,310
from the Scarlet Tide Continent.


496
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,990
What do you think?


497
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,310
Horrible.


498
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,590
Nobody is good enough in your eyes.


499
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,590
There's somebody.


500
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,110
Ling Shiyu.


501
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,420
I didn't expect the extinguished Nether Race


502
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,130
to have a descendant.


503
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,900
I would really like to see her power.


504
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,110
Qianjie,


505
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,860
The Heaven Fighting Race is coming back soon.


506
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,860
I can sense them coming closer and closer.


507
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,130
Now we need to nurture the talents.


508
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,420
Please don't just think about having fun.


509
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,590
Qin Lie's real identity


510
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,620
might be Gongmu Lie.


511
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
What?


512
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,990
The Graveyards of Gods that everyone wants to go,


513
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,860
is nothing but a trap set up for Gongmu Lie


514
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,510
by someone called the Night Fairy.


515
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,590
It's getting more and more interesting.


516
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,220
You mean,


517
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Duan Qianjie is one of the four people


518
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,310
in the Soul Suppressing Orb?


519
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,310
So he knows Uncle Li...


520
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,830
Duan looks hostile and cold-hearted


521
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,660
but everything he did was to help us.


522
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,990
He also knows about the flaw


523
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,270
in the Eye of Frost.


524
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,620
That's why


525
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,220
I ask him if he knows Li Mu.


526
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,620
Uncle Li is fine.


527
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,860
But I have a complicated relationship with Du,


528
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,180
and Duan is so difficult.


529
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,940
There's a kid, too.


530
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,900
The kid is easy.


531
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,660
Was Sanla easy to deal with?


532
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,070
The good thing is that 
we're now one step closer to the truth.


533
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,410
Four people guarding the Soul Suppressing Orb.


534
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,990
Only the kid


535
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,180
hasn't showed up yet.


536
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,180
It can't be Sanla, right?


537
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,270
I feel like it's a part of god's plan.


538
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,270
Everyone that shows up in your life


539
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,380
has connections


540
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,420
to your past.


541
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,070
The other day when I went inside 
the Night Fairy's subconsciousness,


542
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,590
she called me Wuchun


543
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,900
and wanted to kill me.


544
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,660
In the Graveyard of Gods,


545
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,310
when she heard your voice,


546
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,510
she called you Wuchun and wanted you dead too.


547
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,830
They all call me Wuchun


548
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,940
and you Gongmu Lie.


549
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,180
Is it because we look like them?


550
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,340
Or we are them?


551
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,620
What are the relationships between


552
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,170
the Night Fairy, Wuchun


553
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,990
and Gongmu Lie?


554
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,620
I'm afraid


555
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,030
only the Night Fairy knows.


556
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,420
And she,


557
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,860
she is the first one to call me Gongmu Lie.


558
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,860
Right.


559
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,830
There's one more thing.


560
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,510
What is it?


561
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,070
Never mind.


562
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,590
I just suddenly thought of Xuanxuan.


563
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,660
Don't worry.


564
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,550
I will always be here for you.


565
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,550
We will help you with Xuanxuan.


566
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,270
Hua Yuxin was such a nice man.


567
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,660
No wonder you say I'm a lot like him.


568
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,750
Alright.


569
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,110
Stop crying.


570
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,590
You'll just make Yushi even sadder.


571
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,270
I'm sad too.


572
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,690
Why don't you care about my feelings?


573
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,110
Qianqian, no,


574
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,380
Xuanxuan has suffered too much.


575
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,550
She lost such a great guy.


576
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,510
If I ever lost Lianrou,


577
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,070
how sad would I be?


578
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,110
Oh, I already lost her.


579
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,660
Oh, no. I never had her.


580
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,460
I'm taking her back to the Illusory Demon Sect.


581
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,460
It's better to let her have a fresh start


582
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,660
than reminding her of her losses and sufferings.


583
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,310
It's just that Xuanxuan can't get over Yuxin.


584
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,510
Even if now she lost her memory,


585
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,750
she still has


586
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,310
these indescribable feelings for him.


587
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,940
I know her well.


588
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,460
After she wakes up,


589
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,110
she will definitely get to the bottom of it.


590
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,700
Right.


591
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,750
She will definitely come after me. 
What should I do?


592
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,070
Yiyuan,


593
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,550
I have a favor to ask you.


594
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,860
What favor?


595
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,380
Lie to her.


596
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,890
How?


597
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,070
You're here.


598
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,510
Qianqian,


599
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,180
you're here for Yiyuan?


600
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,030
Yeah. I need to speak with him.


601
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,590
Did I interrupt something?


602
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,220
No, no, no.


603
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,420
Not at all.


604
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,660
You. Follow me.


605
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,220
Don't follow us.


606
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,860
Don't worry.


607
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,750
Yiyuan might look a bit dumb,


608
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,510
but he's actually quite clever.


609
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,220
Just like Yuxin.


610
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,180
I'm just wondering,


611
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,030
if Xuanxuan really forgot about you.


612
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,030
If she remembered me,


613
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,750
she would definitely have me as her sister.


614
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,270
Qin Lie,


615
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,860
go talk to Duan Qianjie for me.


616
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,660
Ask him what happened 
when she was in the Illusory Demon Sect.
