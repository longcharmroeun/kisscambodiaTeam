00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,150
[Episode 33]


4
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:40,420
Father,


5
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,900
I brought him back by mistake.


6
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,259
By mistake?


7
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,390
What do you mean by mistake?


8
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,860
You have nothing to do with this anymore.


9
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,740
Go back to the Terminator Sect.


10
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,789
Why should I listen to you?


11
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,390
I need to protect my brother.


12
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,180
Don't you know that I am


13
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,820
a spirit artifact for Gongmu Lie?


14
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,900
Go back to the Terminator Sect.


15
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,110
I am


16
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,750
a spirit artifact!


17
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,950
Do you want me to send you back then?


18
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,860
No, I don't want that.


19
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,380
I can go by myself.


20
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,870
Tell me if my brother is ok.


21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,010
He is fine.


22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,710
He has nothing to do with you.


23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,620
Will you leave or not?


24
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,950
I'll go right away.


25
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,820
Look after my brother for me then.


26
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,790
I'll leave then.


27
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,710
Don't threaten me with your light!


28
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,460
Father,


29
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,950
have you sorted it out there?


30
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,220
Sorted?


31
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,100
It's just a beginning.


32
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,230
Qianqian,


33
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,740
are you really ok?


34
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,950
Get your hands off me.


35
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,590
I'm alive again.


36
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,230
- I'm alive again. 
- Let go of me.


37
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,260
I was so worried that


38
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,380
- if I couldn't come back... 
- Lianrou is watching us.


39
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,070
How would you cope?


40
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,180
Let go of me!


41
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,540
Lianrou, I...


42
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,950
Although


43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,950
I'm not from the Illusory Demon Sect,


44
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,100
I can still read one's mind.


45
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,990
The first person he looked for after he woke up


46
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,150
must be the one he really cares about.


47
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,230
I've told you.


48
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,990
One's feelings can change.


49
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,660
It's not good.


50
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,260
But this time,


51
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,310
I agree with your choice.


52
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,100
Qianqian,


53
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,810
why are you crying?


54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,540
Why are you crying?


55
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,230
Don't cry.


56
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,180
The man I love is Yuxin.


57
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,940
He's also called Yiyuan.


58
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,990
It's always been


59
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,540
him and him only.


60
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,630
What're you talking about?


61
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,340
But you loved someone else.


62
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,780
You've changed your mind.


63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,990
Yes.


64
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,380
I have. But I  don't love her anymore.


65
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,820
Am I ruthless?


66
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,500
Am I a heartless rat?


67
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,870
No.


68
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,470
I broke up with you.


69
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,540
Remember?


70
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,470
You felt that no one liked you


71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,190
and I was nice to you. So you started to like me back.


72
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,100
In fact, I am kind of nice to everyone.


73
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,630
The man I love better be a real macho.


74
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,660
You're not my type.


75
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,150
A new guy


76
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,150
came here recently.


77
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,940
I think I quite like him.


78
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,500
Feeling sad?


79
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,260
You're not her cup of tea.


80
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,540
How about you?


81
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,500
You're my type.


82
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,310
Me, too.


83
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,430
A lot of problems


84
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,060
were solved with the help of Master Hua.


85
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,060
But here we have more problems.


86
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,340
Right?


87
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,340
I'm getting used to this.


88
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,340
Brother.


89
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,150
Brother.


90
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,780
Qianqian has told me about it.


91
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,300
I am Yuxin.


92
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,940
I grew up with you.


93
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,470
Brother.


94
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,190
Yuxin, I miss you so much.


95
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,030
No matter who I am,


96
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,659
we'll never split up.


97
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,750
Never.


98
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,030
Yiyuan,


99
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,930
tell me about your


100
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,540
resurrections.


101
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,220
Well...


102
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,470
I don't understand it myself.


103
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,909
I haven't figured it out yet.


104
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,060
Let's leave it for now.


105
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,750
What do we do?


106
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,780
Let's go and find Yushi first.


107
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,940
I'm worried about her.


108
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,030
Ok.


109
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,940
How about Chu Li, Du Shaoyang and Tang Siqi?


110
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,340
We just leave them?


111
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,060
I believe my grandpa and Uncle Hua


112
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,780
have all sorted it out.


113
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,820
Don't you think, when we were
attacked at the Purple Mist Sea,


114
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,660
the Golden Force let Tang Siqi and Du Shaoyang


115
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,630
escape on purpose?


116
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,220
Yeah.


117
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,030
Let's go now.


118
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,750
Yushi.


119
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,020
[The Ling Town]


120
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,590
- Yushi. 
- Sister.


121
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,930
Are you alright?


122
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,220
Yushi.


123
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,909
Qin Lie.


124
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,100
You promised to marry me.


125
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,430
But you never kept your word.


126
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,150
All you care about is your dream.


127
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,940
You never took me seriously.


128
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,820
Then why do you pretend to love me


129
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,540
and keep pestering me?


130
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,990
Why don't we just break up?


131
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,340
What's wrong with her?


132
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,820
The Supreme Voodoo Insect.


133
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,060
Sister,


134
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,630
calm down.


135
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,710
That's so nice of you


136
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,380
to call me like this.


137
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,500
If my memory serves me right,


138
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,980
you already knew who you were


139
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,870
when you came out from the Graveyard.


140
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,539
My memory came back to me long ago.


141
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,830
I know I am Ling Xuanxuan,


142
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,900
not Pan Qianqian.


143
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,630
So who is my lover, Qianqian or Xuanxuan?


144
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,539
Do you have to talk about this now?


145
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,460
I gained my divine sense in the Graveyard.


146
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,420
I remembered everything.


147
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,660
But you wanted me to stay as Pan Qianqian.


148
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,630
You didn't want me to be sad.


149
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,190
So I kept pretending it


150
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,070
so that you wouldn't worry about me.


151
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,430
I would rather die than not be able to


152
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,060
call you my sister.


153
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,190
Since we love each other so much,


154
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,660
why don't you come along


155
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,990
and help me exterminate


156
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,990
the Human Race who betrayed us


157
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,390
and make our race great again?


158
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,430
Yushi,


159
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,270
you wanna kill me?


160
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,690
Anyone who stops me from rejuvenating my race


161
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,140
shall be killed.


162
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,900
You guys should back off.


163
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,390
I owe you.


164
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,750
You shall kill me.


165
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,580
But it's not their fault.


166
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,870
It's only between us.


167
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,220
However,


168
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,270
I'm afraid that you won't be able to


169
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,900
kill me even if I am just by myself.


170
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,890
The Spirit Pillar.


171
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,010
The Imaginary Pillar.


172
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,700
Qin Lie,


173
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,430
how's my sister?


174
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,170
[Inside the Imaginary Pillar]


175
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,950
This is


176
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,270
a sea of leaves of heart?


177
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,870
What?


178
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,270
You didn't know about this?


179
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,780
Isn't this your own pillar?


180
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,270
I've never been here before.


181
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,390
How could you confine me in the pillar


182
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,300
you know nothing about?


183
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,070
I don't want to confine you.


184
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,580
I just want to cure you of the Voodoo poison.


185
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,630
Yushi,


186
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,340
don't you think it's strange?


187
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,950
I thought only you


188
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,780
are able to grow


189
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,540
these spirit herbs?


190
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,340
It's full of leaves of heart.


191
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,310
What?


192
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,990
How would I know about this?


193
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,190
Have I seen them anywhere?


194
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,020
What are you talking about?


195
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,700
I don't know.


196
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,860
It's full of leaves of heart there.


197
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,220
Can't you see them?


198
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,830
No, we can't.


199
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,540
Yiyuan,


200
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,190
could this have something to do with


201
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,580
your resurrections?


202
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,990
The first time you died,


203
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,180
you said you saw Wuchun and a kid.


204
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,340
What about the second time?


205
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,630
I can't remember.


206
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,070
What is he doing?


207
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,220
Growing herbs.


208
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,220
Leaves of heart are poisonous. Do not touch them.


209
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,870
Yushi,


210
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,900
what did you see?


211
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,750
I was willing to be your shadow,


212
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,430
chasing after your light.


213
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,330
I was willing to wait for you every time
you travel far away.


214
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,140
Yushi, you remember it.


215
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,750
You woke up?


216
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,100
Look how pleased you are.


217
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,830
Qin Lie,


218
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,830
Those days are gone now.


219
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,340
Do you remember what I told you?


220
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,100
When the second volume of 
 the Scripture appeared,


221
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,020
I saw something.


222
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,530
I saw myself killing you.


223
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,580
It seems that


224
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,630
you already owed me ten thousand years ago.


225
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,310
After all this time,


226
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,540
I still need to kill you again.


227
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,900
Yushi,


228
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,190
since you can open the second volume,


229
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
why don't you have a look at


230
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,750
what happened ten thousand years ago?


231
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,700
There's no need.


232
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,510
I remember it.


233
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,780
That kid was me.


234
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,510
Chubby little kid, running and growing herbs.


235
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,580
I was the one who grew the leaves of heart.


236
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,890
Leaves of heart?


237
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,390
They were grown by me. Got it?


238
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,460
No.


239
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,780
Kill me! Kill me!


240
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,100
What?


241
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,510
I can save Yushi!


242
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,660
I know I can!


243
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,630
Come on.


244
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,340
How?


245
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,390
I don't know.


246
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,020
I'll know if you kill me.


247
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,460
Come on.


248
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,990
Come on!


249
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,140
I want to take my own life


250
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,750
but I can't do that.


251
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,020
I need your help. Kill me!


252
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,010
Are you infected by the Supreme Voodoo Insect too?


253
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,750
Wake up!


254
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,540
Yiyuan.


255
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,220
Yiyuan.


256
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,190
Why?


257
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,300
Because I believe him.


258
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,940
Then I should be the one to kill him.


259
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,390
You love him.


260
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,310
You can't do this.


261
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,270
I don't.


262
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,100
Yiyuan.


263
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,740
Yiyuan.


264
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,540
Will he come back to life again?


265
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,190
His body is getting cold.


266
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,670
Just wait a while.


267
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,090
Are you cold?


268
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,460
Is he dead?


269
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,580
I don't know.


270
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,300
But he is infected by the Voodoo Insect.


271
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,910
He can't be dead then.


272
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,790
He did it!


273
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,030
What do you mean?


274
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,750
A man like this


275
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,300
doesn't deserve your tears.


276
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,700
That's none of your business.


277
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,300
I just want to know


278
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,300
if I really had feelings for you.


279
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,270
Get out.


280
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,340
I don't mean to offend you.


281
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
Get out.


282
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,860
Why are you following me?


283
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,910
I need an answer.


284
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,700
I want to know


285
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,790
why I liked you.


286
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,940
That's funny.


287
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,820
You don't know


288
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,740
that yourself?


289
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,460
What is love?


290
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,670
What does it mean to us?


291
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,220
It's just like a snowflake.


292
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,180
It melts away as soon as


293
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,740
you reach out and catch it.


294
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,270
I've changed from Xie Jingxuan to Tang Siqi.


295
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,180
I've been pursuing my love.


296
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,870
I didn't expect it to be so hard,


297
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,700
so excruciating.


298
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,100
I was always over the moon at first


299
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,220
whenever I saw him


300
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,220
and was thinking of him.


301
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,150
I felt happy for him.


302
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,270
I worried about him.


303
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,990
I worried that he couldn't fulfill his dream,


304
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,940
that he wouldn't give in when he should.


305
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,910
I worried that he might be bullied by others,


306
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,060
that he might give up on himself.


307
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,420
I didn't dare to ask how he felt


308
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,300
or what he was thinking.


309
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,580
I am not what I used to be.


310
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,670
I became humble and timid.


311
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,910
After all this time,


312
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,750
I know he won't be Qin Lie's match.


313
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,340
He will betray all of us one day.


314
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,030
I've been worried about


315
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,750
when that day will come.


316
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,340
I can't have both love and friendship.


317
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,180
What should I do?


318
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,910
Kill him and forget about your love.


319
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,630
Otherwise, he will kill you.


320
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,460
The chaos will end forever.


321
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,550
I tried to kill him.


322
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,940
But he saw through my tricks.


323
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,510
He wanted to kill me later on.


324
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,750
Why do we have to end up like this?


325
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,060
Do you want me to help you?


326
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,300
Yes.


327
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,390
What do you want?


328
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,940
You never had any women before.


329
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,740
How would you know what love is?


330
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,690
If you are afraid,


331
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,580
you can back off any minute.


332
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,420
Close your eyes.


333
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,100
Feel what you want to feel.


334
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,270
Feel what I want you to feel.


335
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,220
Father, will he understand love this way?


336
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,300
I would have understood it so long ago


337
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,670
if it could be done with just a kiss.


338
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,930
You can't do it


339
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,810
without knowing the causation.


340
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,550
You want to give memories back to him then?


341
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,980
Shouldn't he understand it by 
 himself as an artifact?


342
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,580
He is the son of Zhu.


343
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,290
Congratulations on my son's return
after the cultivation.


344
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,140
[Ten thousand years ago, the Revered 
 Thoughtful Mountain in the Surah Realm]


345
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,630
Congratulations on your 
Golden Legion of Titans, father.


346
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,990
Your work has finally paid off.


347
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,270
Qianjie, are you enlightened?


348
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,540
[Zhu You, the Master of Spells]


349
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,270
I've been through a lot.


350
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,420
I've seen birth, death, diseases, love, 
 hatred and departure.


351
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,870
I've had luck, help and justice. 
I've known it all.


352
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,580
Love is the biggest


353
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,910
challenge in the world.


354
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,940
You've also understood it?


355
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,910
When I first arrived in the Colourless Realm,


356
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,790
I met a lady.


357
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,630
I heard both of our heartbeats


358
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,000
when we were together.


359
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,990
I started to know this was love.


360
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,620
I understood why ordinary people


361
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,300
were stuck in love.


362
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,340
Have you ended it?


363
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,450
Yes, I have.


364
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,390
Love is indeed wonderful.


365
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,550
At the end of the day,
it's mere a tiny personal joy.


366
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,390
The deeper you're lost in it,


367
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,460
the more likely you will lose control.


368
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,630
You understand it only if you get away 
as soon as possible.


369
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,150
You're my cleverest


370
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,910
boy among the three.


371
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,580
I named you 'Qianjie'


372
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,460
because I hoped


373
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,670
you could go through all the hardships


374
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,180
and achieve your dream.


375
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,390
The Spirit Wisdom of Titans 
 hasn't been developed.


376
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,390
I'm willing to become a spirit artifact


377
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,670
to lead the Golden Legion and 
 fight against the God Race.


378
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,390
If you want to achieve great things,


379
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,510
you need to climb this mountain
and walk through the Gate of Steps.


380
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,820
Every hardship you've gone through


381
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,420
will would be represented on


382
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,910
each of the steps.


383
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,570
Can you step over them?


384
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,220
Yes, I can.


385
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,060
Qianjie, you're leaving.


386
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,820
Yes, Sang Ying.


387
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,930
Will you remember me?


388
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
No.


389
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,030
Qianjie, I don't expect you to marry me.


390
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,550
I just hope that you can always remember me.


391
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,550
I loved you because I want to give up love.


392
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,390
Let's just forget each other.


393
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,820
Love is hard to get


394
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,990
and hard to forget about.


395
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,550
You only experienced love.


396
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,790
You haven't understood it.


397
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,330
I feel sorry


398
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,460
for Sang Ying.


399
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,990
You are a disgrace.


400
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,150
I might as well end it for you


401
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,870
since you feel so distressed about it.


402
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,630
It really is you.


403
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,790
What do you mean?


404
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,220
Why do you do this to me?


405
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,020
[Inside the Imaginary Pillar]


406
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,100
Qin Lie.


407
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,670
Yushi.


408
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,100
I'm sorry.


409
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,870
It's alright.


410
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,510
You're just lost.


411
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,940
Let me take you home.


412
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,630
What's wrong?


413
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,630
Nothing.


414
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,390
Nothing is more important than


415
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,940
taking your hand.


416
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,220
So silly of me.


417
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,420
This is not the Ling Town.


418
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,790
We're inside the Thunder Pillar.


419
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,300
What gave me away?


420
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,340
When I took your hand,


421
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,510
your palm was cold.


422
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,390
Yes.


423
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,420
Every time you took my hand,


424
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,390
my hand always got warm and my face would blush.


425
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,060
I even felt like my heart was on fire.


426
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,270
No wonder it's the Supreme Voodoo Insect.


427
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,390
Even the Spirit Pillar can't treat it.


428
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,300
Yushi,


429
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,290
I can't let you go out.


430
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,030
You think you can trap me here?


431
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,990
Yushi.


432
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Yushi.


433
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,750
I said I would stay with you forever,


434
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,060
no matter what.


435
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,460
If I couldn't protect you,


436
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,270
I would die with you here.


437
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,420
Kill him.


438
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,690
Yushi.


439
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,270
Yushi.


440
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,420
Yushi.


441
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,990
What's this?


442
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,750
My blood.


443
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,990
The blood of the Queen of the Nether Race.


444
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,510
You will take my order.


445
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,030
Once I'm going to kill Qin Lie,


446
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,150
you will kill me immediately.


447
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,990
You can't have any hesitation.


448
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,030
I worried that because of the Voodoo Insect inside me,


449
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,550
you wouldn't be able to kill me.


450
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,220
I was wrong.


451
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,150
You're always determined.


452
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,220
It's just I didn't expect


453
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,150
you would die with me.


454
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,139
How could you be so hard on yourself?


455
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,350
I hate it when you're so calm.


456
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,110
This is the first time you've cried for me.


457
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,980
There must be another way.


458
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,110
I have a place in your heart.


459
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,139
I have no regret.


460
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,510
It's a pity that


461
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,310
I still don't know


462
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,940
what happened to us ten thousand years ago.


463
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,850
Did we fight against each other


464
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,139
or did we forget each other?


465
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,070
It doesn't matter anymore.


466
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,790
What matters is that


467
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,270
in the future,


468
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,940
no matter where I go


469
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,790
and what I go through,


470
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,990
you will always have a special place in my heart.


471
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,590
You will experience what I see


472
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,140
and feel the way I feel.


473
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,610
[Ten thousand years ago, the Deserted Spirits Realm]


474
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,460
I've already restored this place.


475
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,110
You can leave now.


476
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,940
I want to know the whereabouts of my father.


477
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,540
You didn't keep your promise.


478
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,110
That's the only reason I came here.


479
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,380
I won't give up without fulfilling my goal.


480
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,270
You ignored my determination.


481
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,700
Tong Xin?


482
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,110
What is he doing?


483
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,110
Growing herbs.


484
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,660
He is Tong Xin,


485
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,830
the essence of all plants.


486
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,550
Tong Xin.


487
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,830
He is so hostile. Grow some herbs for him.


488
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,620
Terrified?


489
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,450
He is not terrifying.


490
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,310
The leaves of heart are.


491
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,420
They're poisonous. Don't touch them.


492
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,510
The spirit stones in the Deserted Spirits Realm


493
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,940
have existed ever since the universe was created.


494
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,270
They're shiny and transparent,


495
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,030
small and exquisite.


496
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,620
They reflect people's minds


497
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,790
and their emotions.


498
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,070
Your anger not only


499
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,270
just comes from your determination.


500
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,620
It has something to do with your promise.


501
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,940
You haven't kept yours.


502
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,260
Who are you?


503
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,620
It's nothing noble that so many people


504
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,860
plotting against a child.


505
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,550
Wuchun,


506
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,270
take him away.


507
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,550
Now it's better. No fights and all.


508
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,860
What's this place?


509
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,620
The Deserted Spirits Realm.


510
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,830
Our people live here.


511
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,070
This can be turned into a shooting star.


512
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,110
Have you seen it before?


513
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,350
Who were those people just now?


514
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,220
Why would they want to kill me?


515
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,140
I can't tell you.


516
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
Hiding the truth from me.


517
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,270
Lying to me.


518
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,460
You're just like them.


519
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,070
You're all bad people.


520
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,700
You must be sad.


521
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,420
I am angry.


522
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,460
I believe you are.


523
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,700
But it's mainly sadness that you feel.


524
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,300
You're sad that you aren't trusted.


525
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,420
They don't trust you


526
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,420
no matter how cruel the truth is.


527
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,420
Because you can't protect yourself yet.


528
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,750
If one day


529
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,990
when you're powerful enough,


530
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,460
but they still won't tell you the truth,


531
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,030
You can come to me. I will tell you.


532
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,070
Really?


533
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,790
How far can they fly?


534
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,620
How far do you hope they can fly?


535
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,830
How far do you wish you can fly?


536
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,790
Will you come and visit me


537
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,350
before I get powerful enough?


538
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,750
Yes.


539
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,110
You are not lying to me?


540
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,110
People at the Deserted Spirits Realm 
 will keep their promises.


541
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,300
You've been waiting for me.


542
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,460
You didn't keep your promise.


543
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,930
That's not true.


544
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,660
You forgot me then?


545
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,460
I am busy.


546
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,380
I am the next Mother of Earth.


547
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,070
I need to practise every day.


548
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,830
Liar! You have nothing to do!
