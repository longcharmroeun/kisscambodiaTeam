[The World of Fantasy]


3
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,150
[Episode 32]


4
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,500
I was carrying out a mission


5
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,850
by order of the Master of Heaven.


6
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:45,350
The mission failed due to my lack of competence.


7
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,110
Master Hua, you're my supervisor.


8
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,530
I'm willing to take any punishment from you.


9
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,789
This should be a simple task.


10
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,100
But you failed at it.


11
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,949
It is easy to take your own life but 
 difficult to find a remedy.


12
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,890
It looks like you need help from my people.


13
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,310
Xing.


14
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,620
Yes, sir.


15
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,620
Master Hua,


16
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,180
what're you doing?


17
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,260
Do you really believe


18
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,780
he can come back to life?


19
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,230
I don't have to.


20
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,180
I've already seen it once.


21
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,790
Don't worry.


22
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,740
He'll surely wake up.


23
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,980
He can't bear leaving you.


24
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,820
Maybe,


25
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,350
it's you that he is missing.


26
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,150
Do you know


27
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,740
what our sect are best at?


28
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,100
I know immediately who you're thinking of


29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,510
as soon as I see you.


30
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,820
I've seen who's on Yiyuan's mind before.


31
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,380
It's you.


32
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,820
So, I recognised you at once.


33
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,380
One can change


34
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,460
who he loves.


35
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,590
Others might.


36
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,460
He won't.


37
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,660
Alright then.


38
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,310
Take a look at his mind for me


39
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,950
when he wakes up.


40
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,070
Where are you now?


41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,910
Did I die again?


42
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,100
Where am I?


43
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,909
It's you, again.


44
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,220
Who're you?


45
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,470
You can grow herbs with your feet.


46
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,060
Awesome.


47
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,590
Can you teach me?


48
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,590
No wonder he is the Voodoo Master, 
 one of the Ancient Masters.


49
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,990
She was defeated, as the Mother of Earth,


50
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,060
just by his Supreme Voodoo insect.


51
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,190
It's my fault that I didn't take good care of Yushi.


52
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,190
I understand.


53
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,540
It's not your fault.


54
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,910
What matters most now


55
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,990
is to detoxicate her.


56
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,660
Once she wakes up,


57
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,710
I'm afraid no one can suppress her.


58
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,260
Off you go then.


59
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,870
We'll try our best to protect the Queen.


60
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,590
We'll wait for you.


61
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,659
Shaoyang and Siqi will stay here.


62
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,430
I'll come back as soon as possible.


63
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,340
Night Fairy.


64
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,820
Night Fairy.


65
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,060
I know you're here, Night Fairy.


66
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,750
Come out,


67
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,870
Night Fairy.


68
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,150
Are you so weak that


69
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,870
you can't even pull your body together?


70
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,220
Are you going to kill me?


71
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,340
Just now when Ling Yushi was going to kill me,


72
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,310
it was you that was behind


73
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,750
the spirit diagram?


74
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,909
I couldn't let her kill you


75
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,750
once again in front of me


76
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,540
after ten thousand years.


77
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,659
It's a pity


78
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,909
that I still couldn't do anything to help.


79
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,190
Thanks anyway.


80
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,380
You were the mentor of Gongmu Lie


81
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,030
and his only friend during his childhood.


82
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,910
Every time I think of this


83
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,500
as Gongmu Lie,


84
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,310
I feel that I owe you so much.


85
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,540
Him?


86
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,500
You're him.


87
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,470
You're Gongmu Lie.


88
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,260
I grew up with you.


89
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,540
But you hurt me over and again


90
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
because of Wuchun.


91
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,660
Do you have any idea


92
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,430
that I've been waiting for you 
 for ten thousand years?


93
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,740
No one knows


94
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,030
what this feels like.


95
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,630
I can't tell you about all my sorrows


96
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,470
just in a few words.


97
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,940
But every time when I realise that 
 Gongmu Lie is to me


98
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,150
as Ling Yushi is to Qin Lie,


99
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,540
I know


100
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,220
you deserve to be treated fairly.


101
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,380
Are you talking to me now


102
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,310
as Qin Lie, or


103
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,540
as Gongmu Lie?


104
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,330
I'm Qin Lie.


105
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,150
What do you want to know?


106
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,580
Now even the Golden Force is involved.


107
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,340
I want to know


108
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,590
what happened ten thousand years ago?


109
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,060
I won't tell you.


110
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,430
It wouldn't do any good to you if you knew too much.


111
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,250
Why are you desperate to
 find the spirit artifacts?


112
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,780
I don't want you to find them first.


113
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,940
I don't want you to be the first to 
awaken your bloodline.


114
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,740
I don't want you to know


115
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,030
what happened ten thousand years ago.


116
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,830
Given the current situation,


117
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,580
I won't tell you anything.


118
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,780
Kill me if you want.


119
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,900
I'm on my last breath.


120
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,580
You can easily finish me off.


121
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,340
Well,


122
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,700
can I ask a favour?


123
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,300
Let go of Yushi,


124
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,140
will you?


125
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,700
I can't help you.


126
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,190
Are you determined to kill her?


127
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,990
It's not me that


128
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,700
wants to kill her now.


129
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,020
Who is it then?


130
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,780
My biggest mistake is that


131
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,700
I thought I could


132
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,140
control Du Shaoyang.


133
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,140
It's him...


134
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,210
I'm calling the Ancient Voodoo Insects


135
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,430
sleeping under the land of the Nether Realm,


136
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,510
by order of the Voodoo Master.


137
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,430
Ten thousand years ago,


138
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,540
the Voodoo Master fought for the Human Race.


139
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,310
The Golden Force took the opportunity to persecute him.


140
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,390
In order to protect Voodoo Cult,


141
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,190
the Voodoo Master sent you to hide beneath this land


142
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,100
with his remaining power.


143
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,870
Now, it's been ten thousand years.


144
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,870
Time flies.


145
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,070
Your opportunity has come once again.


146
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm the direct disciple of the Voodoo Master.


147
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,220
By his order,


148
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,580
you'll all answer my calling


149
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,340
and let the Voodoo Race be great again.


150
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,990
What's wrong?


151
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,990
Why?


152
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,070
What is it?


153
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,390
Why don't you answer me?


154
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,390
Siqi?


155
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,340
I've been looking for you.


156
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,950
Why are you here?


157
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,460
Too many things happened recently.


158
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
I just came out for some air.


159
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,700
Since you're here, let's go and grab a drink.


160
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,860
Sure.


161
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,780
What're you doing?


162
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,950
Our future is full of risks and uncertainty.


163
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,510
We don't know whether we can survive tomorrow.


164
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,510
Since we're here like good old times,


165
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,700
I want to be your lover once more.


166
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,190
What's the hurry?


167
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,340
Don't you want to see me


168
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,740
without the veil?


169
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,780
Since you've seen my face,


170
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,990
you're my man.


171
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,340
I need you to remember my face forever.


172
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,540
If our relationship can last ten thousand years,


173
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,070
I hope you can still remember me


174
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,990
after ten thousand years.


175
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,390
The wine is poisonous.


176
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,750
You want to kill me?


177
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,540
You found it.


178
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,020
You're so cruel.


179
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,020
I thought you really loved me.


180
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,130
It's because I love you


181
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,460
that I would rather you died in my hands.


182
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,990
Only if you die,


183
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,390
can Ling Yushi be detoxicated.


184
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,020
Your sins can be reduced.


185
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,310
What gave me away?


186
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,220
You've changed.


187
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,650
You're unaware of that.


188
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,900
But I can feel that.


189
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,660
Where're my earrings? You didn't 
get them back for me?


190
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,660
I forgot.


191
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,950
You left them on the doorknob


192
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,190
just for testing me.


193
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,340
Did I?


194
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,630
Did I want to test you?


195
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,020
I don't know.


196
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,870
What I know is that


197
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,950
if you still love me,


198
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,870
you would surely bring my earrings back.


199
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,310
You've seen what I did just now.


200
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,140
Congratulations.


201
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,100
You've become the disciple of the Voodoo Master.


202
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,700
Qin Lie can never be your match.


203
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,180
Do you want to kill him


204
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,900
or me first?


205
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,090
Since you love me so much,


206
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,700
you won't regret it if you die


207
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,340
in my hands?


208
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,780
You shall run as soon as possible.


209
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,180
No one used to respect me


210
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,460
on the lands of the spirit realm.


211
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,869
I wanted to be friends with Qin Lie.


212
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,990
He looked down upon me.


213
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,910
I obeyed my father.


214
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,300
Even he abandoned me in the end.


215
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,180
You're the only


216
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,380
who never gave me up.


217
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,340
I'm not going to kill you today.


218
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,340
This is a way


219
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,260
to pay your back.


220
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,420
If you ever stop me


221
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,390
when we meet again,


222
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,580
I'll make sure to kill you.


223
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,870
Du Shaoyang,


224
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,220
you fought the war of the Light Pillars


225
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,300
for Nebula Pavilion.


226
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,390
You fought against me with
 the Profound Heaven Alliance


227
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,910
for the Human Race.


228
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,740
Now I realise


229
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,050
you did all these just for your ambition,


230
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,020
just because you hate and envy me.


231
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,390
You finally took me as your friend.


232
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,300
You drank with me.


233
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,220
Now you've found who I really am.


234
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,510
Do you regret it?


235
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,790
Du Shaoyang,


236
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,180
let me tell you.


237
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,420
You're one of the four Spirit Artifacts.


238
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,740
I am what I am.


239
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,460
Don't assume that I am inferior to you!


240
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,870
It's our turn.


241
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,340
There we are, finally.


242
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,580
Shall we do with bullshits first, 
or let's go ahead with fighting?


243
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,780
I can let you go if you let go of Yushi.


244
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,100
Nonsense.


245
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,220
Kill him and my sister will be safe.


246
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,390
Shaoyang,


247
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,580
stop it.


248
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,390
I should have finished you just now.


249
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,660
Won't you just stop talking?


250
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,510
Shaoyang.


251
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,180
Master,


252
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,910
I'm sorry that I underestimated them.


253
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,420
I thought they were just nobody.


254
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,940
It turned out that they were quite powerful.


255
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,870
All our people sacrificed there.


256
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,630
Those boys were finished off


257
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,420
thanks to Yang Yi who fought hard.


258
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,100
Good.


259
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,450
He shall be rewarded.


260
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,060
Thank you, Master. This is my duty.


261
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,940
Where's the second volume of the Scripture?


262
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,020
We didn't find it.


263
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,420
Isn't it in the hands of those guys?


264
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,100
They had no idea of what


265
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,340
they held in possession.


266
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,870
They thought it was just nothing.


267
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,300
We've interrogated them many times.


268
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,180
They didn't even know


269
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,300
where and when they had lost it.


270
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,510
We'll keep on investigating.


271
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,170
Off you go then.


272
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,550
Yes, sir.


273
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,300
Thank you, Master Hua.


274
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,750
Go and get your reward, then.


275
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,870
Yes, sir.


276
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,050
Father,


277
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,990
Du Shaoyang has entered the underground 
of the Nether Realm.


278
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,180
Tang Siqi followed him.


279
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,420
Besides, Duan Qianjie has returned.


280
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,860
It seems that he still cares about her.


281
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,750
How do we deal with them?


282
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,930
Kill Duan first.


283
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,870
Yes, father.


284
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,060
By the time you understand love,


285
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,750
we shall meet.


286
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,630
This is the end of our friendship, but not quite.


287
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,630
Take care.


288
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,000
[On the bridge of the Colourless Realm]


289
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
Qianjie,


290
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,510
I don't expect you to marry me.


291
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,580
I just hope you can forever remember me.


292
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,180
Why her?


293
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,380
Come out!


294
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,390
Come out!


295
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,940
I'm the successor appointed by Jiang Yan.


296
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,620
I'm the new Master of Voodoo Cult.


297
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,990
I'm ordering you.


298
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,990
You shall all obey me.


299
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,940
The ancestors ordered you to forget about love.


300
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,940
You failed.


301
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,300
I'll kill her right away.


302
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,580
You never made up your mind


303
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,030
to kill Qin Lie.


304
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,460
You didn't obey the ancestors.


305
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,060
Why should we obey you?


306
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,030
I'll go and kill him.


307
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,700
I'll kill him right away.


308
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,990
I'll kill them all.


309
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,420
I really admire you guys


310
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,180
who were born with noble identities.


311
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,630
People like me


312
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,990
can't rely on anyone.


313
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,790
All I have is my ambition.


314
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,540
How can I achieve great things


315
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,940
if I don't give up love?


316
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,750
Love is something


317
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,940
I need to get rid of as much as I can.


318
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,390
You suffered so much for Qin Lie.


319
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,390
But he froze you here.


320
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,630
You loved him secretly and deeply.


321
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,180
He was always delayed by other things


322
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,290
to get to you.


323
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,390
Have you ever blamed him for that?


324
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,150
Aren't you tired of it?


325
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,630
You must be tired.


326
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,270
Give up love as I do.


327
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,060
As the Queen of the Nether Race 
 and the Mother of Earth,


328
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,580
you are brilliant


329
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,420
but you achieved nothing.


330
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,340
Your people can only hide underground


331
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,180
humbly and humiliatingly.


332
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,030
They don't get to enjoy the sunshine.


333
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,750
They don't get fresh water, Ling Yushi.


334
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,870
Don't you feel guilty


335
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,810
about that?


336
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,300
Wake up.


337
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,270
Wake up using the power I gave you.


338
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,420
Kill all those who are cruel to you,


339
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,340
who forbid you from rejuvenating your own race.


340
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,420
You're powerful enough.


341
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,820
You don't need the second volume 
of the Scripture anymore.


342
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,580
What have you done to Ling Yushi?


343
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,460
I've removed the Voodoo Insect from her.


344
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,060
She'll wake up soon.


345
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,330
You've come to the right decision.


346
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,940
I didn't.


347
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,790
I just can't give up on you.


348
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,060
Shaoyang.


349
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,790
Come with me, alright?


350
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,630
Ok.


351
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,460
You're still guarding against me.


352
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,580
You should want to kill me?


353
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,550
I can't achieve great things


354
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,630
if I don't kill you.


355
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,150
Duan Qianjie.


356
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,780
Don't kill him.


357
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,090
They want to kill the Queen of the Nether Race.


358
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,620
Tang Siqi is the traitor. Kill her!


359
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,030
Shaoyang.


360
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,620
Shaoyang.


361
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,870
Shaoyang.


362
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Shaoyang.


363
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,670
No, Shaoyang!


364
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,630
Shaoyang.


365
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,750
Follow me.


366
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,670
Let go of me!


367
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,390
Shaoyang.


368
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,180
Where's Qin Lie?


369
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,100
Yiyuan.


370
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,420
Where's Chuli? Brother Chu!


371
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,060
Brother Chu!


372
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,100
This is...


373
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,860
What's wrong?


374
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,790
This is


375
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,340
Ling Town.


376
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,300
This is Ling Town.


377
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,870
Who's there?


378
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,750
Stop! Don't hurt me!


379
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,180
You bastard, it's me!


380
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,410
Uncle Hua?


381
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,750
Uncle Hua.


382
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,510
Uncle Hua, you didn't die?


383
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,700
Don't curse me.


384
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,030
What's going on?


385
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,790
Why are we here?


386
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,630
Did you save us?


387
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,390
Why do you have so many questions?


388
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,420
Which one should I answer first?


389
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,220
She...


390
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,100
She's Xuanxuan!


391
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,300
Me?


392
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,670
Sir,


393
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,060
can you tell us


394
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,460
what's going on here?


395
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,340
What's this all about?


396
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,870
I didn't really die back then.


397
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,580
His grandpa saved me and took me away.


398
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,340
Where's grandpa now?


399
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,210
I don't know.


400
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,270
After he saved me,


401
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,620
he took me to


402
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,150
a nice palace and told me to stay there.


403
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,180
I agreed.


404
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,510
But he told me everyone died


405
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,180
in Ling Town.


406
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,300
I thought I couldn't return


407
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,700
if everyone was dead.


408
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,930
I thought I could never come back.


409
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,990
But then,


410
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,700
he suddenly came to me


411
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,700
and said you were in trouble.


412
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,390
The Golden Force was going to kill you.


413
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,100
He wanted to save you.


414
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,500
He pretended as if


415
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,180
you had been killed by the Golden Force.


416
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,940
He sneaked you into Ling Town.


417
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,460
He can't meet you at the moment.


418
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,860
He asked me to explain to you.


419
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,060
Do you get it?


420
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,030
Why would they want to kill me?


421
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,270
Dunno. He didn't say why.


422
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,820
Why won't my grandpa see me?


423
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,380
Dunno. He didn't say.


424
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,870
Where is he now?


425
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,420
Dunno. He didn't tell me.


426
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,870
Aren't you living with him?


427
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,670
He keeps going in and out.


428
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,100
He is very busy, very busy.


429
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,820
He's occupied.


430
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,670
What do you know then?


431
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,550
I...


432
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,630
I remember.


433
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,150
When I came here, he told me


434
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,940
he knew you would ask this.


435
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,860
He had a message for you.


436
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,060
What is it?


437
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,910
Dunno. He didn't say.


438
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,580
What?


439
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,630
Ah, yes. He took


440
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,910
my hand back then.


441
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,910
He let me hit you with this hand.


442
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,340
Grandpa.


443
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,270
Gran, I miss you so much.


444
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,830
I've been looking for you, Gran.


445
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,830
What's this all about?


446
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,940
Am I really Gongmu Lie?


447
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,659
You're born to be unique.


448
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,940
You have bloodlines of both 
 the Human and God Race.


449
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,860
But now


450
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,750
you're Qin Lie.


451
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,170
You belong to the Human Race.


452
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,310
I let you wake up as Qin Lie


453
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,860
because I want to


454
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,110
train your mind so that


455
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,699
one day


456
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,750
you can integrate into the God Race.


457
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,130
Integrate?


458
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,420
You mean


459
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,310
we share a body


460
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,739
but that isn't me?


461
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:58,510
You were born in the same body but
 you're different people.


462
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,790
In that sense, he's not you.


463
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,830
You said I'm unique.


464
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,660
Who am I?


465
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,860
Why did you make me sleep?


466
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,030
You froze Yushi as well?


467
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,590
Are these all related to the God Race?


468
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,070
Wuchun was frozen by her mother.


469
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,310
In that sense,


470
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,510
they're related.


471
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,510
You sealed me


472
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,660
and Yushi was sealed by her mother.


473
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,310
Was it because we were so naughty


474
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,310
that we annoyed


475
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,660
our neighbour?


476
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,140
They indeed despise you.


477
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,420
However,


478
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,830
you're not naughty.


479
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,460
On the contrary, you're both good kids.


480
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,410
Who is our neighbour then?


481
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,620
Even you


482
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,790
and the Deserted Spirits Realm cannot defeat them?


483
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,310
They're from the Surah Realm.


484
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,590
Lie,


485
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,940
since you've opened the second volume
 of the Scripture,


486
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,750
why don't you train yourselves first


487
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,220
before you go


488
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,380
looking for the answers you want.


489
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,590
The second volume of the Scripture 
 belongs to the royal family of the Nether Race.


490
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,380
What does it have to do with the Gongmu family?


491
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,750
Everything.


492
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,270
Lie, I know


493
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,850
you still have many questions for me.


494
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,460
But I gotta go now.


495
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,460
Maybe you should have the answers


496
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,700
by the next time we meet.


497
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,310
Maybe you will have an answer


498
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,140
in your own mind.


499
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,140
Where're you going this time?


500
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,350
Where can I find you?


501
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,270
You don't need to find me.


502
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,620
You have your own way.


503
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,780
You need to understand love.


504
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,350
Maybe love is the only thing


505
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,510
you have in common.


506
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,110
Only love can help dissolve


507
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,580
the hostility in your bloodline.


508
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,660
I'm not hostile.


509
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,860
My good boy.


510
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,110
You can't find another one


511
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,590
who is more reasonable than me.


512
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,550
Good boy.


513
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,900
Did you understand what he said?


514
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,030
What's so difficult about it?


515
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,820
He just told me not to ask anything.


516
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,310
Ask nothing.


517
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,070
He didn't say anything else?


518
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,550
He did.


519
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,940
He said I'm a good boy.


520
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,830
Shameless.


521
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,460
Your grandfather is just like this.


522
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,310
He can be too cautious about everything.


523
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,350
It looks like you know him well.


524
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,620
What're you implying?


525
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,900
I guess that


526
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,990
you know more


527
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,940
than you told us.


528
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,780
Uncle Hua,


529
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,590
who are you then?


530
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,420
Me?


531
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,510
I'm just an old man without a family.


532
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,140
Both my wife and son died.


533
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,750
I almost forgot him.


534
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,030
This guy lying here


535
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,590
is Yuxin,


536
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,750
but not quite.


537
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,550
What do you mean?


538
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,650
Qin Shan told me another thing


539
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,590
that made me so angry.


540
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,350
You know what?


541
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,590
In order to protect you,


542
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,110
your grandfather took advantage 
 of my wife and son.


543
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,310
Hua Yuxin is


544
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,940
and is not my son.


545
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,830
He isn't even human.


546
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,460
He was a magic stone your grandpa


547
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,420
had put in my wife's belly.


548
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,700
What do you mean?


549
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,750
Hua Yuxin is an artifact cultivated
 by your grandfather.


550
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,590
He wanted to make an upright friend


551
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,930
who could grow up with you


552
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,180
and purify your mind.


553
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,110
But his mind was corrupted.


554
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,660
He couldn't make a pure artifact.


555
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,220
So, he looked everywhere.


556
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,990
In the end, he found him.


557
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,350
He extracted the most innocent part


558
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,310
from him


559
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,750
and cultivated Hua Yuxin.


560
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,140
No wonder


561
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,260
when I first met Yiyuan,


562
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,460
he seemed to behave like a fool.


563
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,030
But later,


564
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,420
he became normal.


565
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,260
Because Yuxi died then.


566
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,700
Therefore,


567
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,700
Yiyuan became normal.


568
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,590
So, you're Yiyuan.


569
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,590
And Yiyuan is you.


570
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,750
It's you that I've always been thinking of.


571
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,860
Yiyuan, come back.


572
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,350
Who called my name?


573
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,620
Yiyuan.


574
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Yiyuan.


575
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,340
Qianqian, are you alright?


576
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,350
I'm fine. I'm fine.


577
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,100
So good that you come back.


578
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,750
Uncle Hua.


579
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,350
Where's he?


580
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,750
Uncle Hua, you can't leave.


581
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,750
Where's Chu Li?


582
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,900
He's fine.


583
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,420
Who the hell are you?


584
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,140
Why do you take me here?


585
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,460
Tell me.


586
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,550
Do you want to kill me or save me?


587
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,660
Just be honest with me.


588
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,790
What are you laughing at?


589
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,660
I said, show some respect!


590
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,850
Did you hear me?


591
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,860
Besides,


592
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,930
where's my Senior Brother?


593
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,130
Where is he?


594
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,750
Say something!


595
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,420
Where is he?


596
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,550
Are you deaf?


597
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,750
Damn it!


598
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,380
You won't say, huh?


599
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,300
I'll blow you up if you don't say anything.


600
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,350
So grumpy.


601
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,270
You're hostile.


602
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,300
Who the hell are you?


603
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,350
Father,


604
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,790
I brought him here by mistake.


605
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,070
By mistake?


606
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,590
I...


607
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,140
What do you mean "by mistake"?


608
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,830
This place has nothing to do with you.


609
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,590
Go back to the Terminator Sect.


610
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,690
Why should I listen to you?


611
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,380
I need to protect my Senior Brother.


612
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,620
Don't you know that I'm the spirit artifact for Gongmu Lie?


613
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,550
Go back to the Terminator Sect.


614
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,790
I'm


615
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,310
a spirit artifact!
