[The World of Fantasy]

00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,150
[Episode 31]


4
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,940
Half of my divine sense waited for you 
for ten thousand years at the Graveyard of Gods.


5
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,620
The other half guarded you for ten thousand years.


6
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,500
However,


7
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,470
you still only have her in your heart.


8
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,150
How are you able to use the First Voodoo Insect?


9
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,070
I have my own way.


10
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,170
The Night Fairy,


11
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,500
get the poison out of Yushi first.


12
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,070
Then let's sit down and talk.


13
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,990
I'll talk with you after she's dead.


14
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,070
Chu, fight back now.


15
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,790
I can't.


16
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,540
Yushi.


17
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,380
Sheng Xie.


18
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,180
Yushi.


19
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,500
Yushi.


20
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,620
Qin Lie.


21
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,900
I'm fine.


22
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,350
Your spirit artifact gave me power.


23
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,220
Because you are not powerful enough.


24
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,660
Unless,


25
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,750
you have the crimson flame to activate it.


26
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,990
I do have it.


27
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,220
The Sword of Sheng Xie


28
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,660
is a spirit artifact forged in the crimson flame.


29
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,060
The sword pledged allegiance to our family.


30
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,990
It is so aggressive.


31
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,700
It is a sword.


32
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,020
Of course, it is very aggressive.


33
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,770
Is the crimson flame stronger


34
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,940
or the murderous sword?


35
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,750
They benefit from each other.


36
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,340
Wrong.


37
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,750
You don't know its true form.


38
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,030
What is its true form?


39
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,190
If I return it to its true form,


40
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,540
can we leave it all behind?


41
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,820
You can go back and forget all about this.


42
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,870
Okay.


43
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,659
I know your sufferings


44
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,310
and your anger.


45
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,190
Sword, kingly way, and integrity.


46
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,659
Establish the gods' stateliness 
and guard people's kindness.


47
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,030
However, benevolent as it is,
the kingly way vanquishes the demons.


48
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,909
It's inevitable.


49
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,870
The more demons it killed,


50
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,630
the more murderous it became.


51
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,460
Till its true form was lost in the end.


52
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,540
It couldn't tell right from wrong,


53
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,500
or good from evil anymore.


54
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,430
The great dignity of the king was gone.


55
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,630
It became a devastating weapon.


56
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,910
Even you can't do anything to stop it.


57
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,540
The earth is inclusive, vast and boundless.


58
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,940
With the power vested in me by the earth, 
I remove its desire for blood


59
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,590
and return it to its true form.


60
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,150
You will be clean and safe.


61
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,590
Are you willing to do so?


62
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,909
You're born with two bloodlines


63
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,060
but they won't merge together.


64
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,260
The Sword of Sheng Xie 
shouldn't have obeyed your commands.


65
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,430
But it happened to be lost in the desire of killing.


66
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,870
So, you were able to use it with your hostility.


67
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,780
From now on,


68
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,030
you need to expel the hostility in your heart


69
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,910
to fully utilize the great power


70
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,710
of this ancient spirit artifact.


71
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,540
I've returned it to its true form.


72
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,150
You can go now.


73
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,030
I want to know the whereabouts of my father.


74
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,260
You broke your word.


75
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,470
I only have one goal.


76
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,780
I'll never give up until I get it done.


77
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,470
You are the one who ignored my determination.


78
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,420
Yushi.


79
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,540
Li Mu.


80
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,650
It turned out that we had such a bond.


81
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,630
No wonder it felt like we're old friends.


82
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,150
My master.


83
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,630
Uncle Li.


84
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,710
What have I done to deserve it?


85
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,260
Please forgive me, my master.


86
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,820
Now Sheng Xie...


87
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,900
I have some loose ends to tie up.


88
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,210
I wouldn't be able to follow you anymore.


89
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,580
Now that you've been awakened,


90
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,460
why are you still so obsessed with it?


91
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,950
Duan Qianjie needs to


92
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,700
choose his own path.


93
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,180
You shouldn't decide it for him.


94
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,580
What?


95
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,690
What is all this?


96
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,830
Years ago, Qin Shan helped me to get enlightened.


97
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,700
At that time, he already told me that


98
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,060
both of you are spirit artifacts
to guard the Soul Suppressing Orb.


99
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,830
Sheng Xie woke up after ten thousand years for you.


100
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,310
Ten thousand years ago,


101
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,100
we met and got to know each other 
in the Gongmu family.


102
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,900
When the family was destroyed,


103
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,580
we took up the responsibility


104
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,540
to guard the Soul Suppressing Orb.


105
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,780
Brother,


106
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,900
I don't understand.


107
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,830
When you learn about what love is,


108
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,690
we will meet again.


109
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,270
Our paths shall separate now 
but they might cross again.


110
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,310
Take good care of yourself.


111
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,180
spirit artifacts don't have emotions.


112
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,780
Why so emotional?


113
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,460
After a journey to the human world,


114
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,340
how can I be emotionless?


115
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,630
I lived up to my loyalty


116
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,270
but failed you again.


117
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,340
Now that you have feelings,


118
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,570
you didn't fail me.


119
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,070
I never knew that the spirit beasts


120
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,990
understand things better than men.


121
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,540
Men have seven emotions and six desires


122
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,270
while beasts are different.


123
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,190
We only have one emotion.


124
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,390
I'll never forget that.


125
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,270
That's enough.


126
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,750
I hope when the master truly is awakened,


127
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,510
he still has humanity.


128
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,340
Since the bloodlines co-exist,


129
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,380
they wouldn't try to suppress each other.


130
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,340
But before that,


131
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,140
I can only guard the master.


132
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,870
There is nothing else I can do.


133
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,220
Please be careful, master.


134
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,540
What do you mean by co-exist?


135
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,260
What exactly is sealed in the Soul Suppressing Orb?


136
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,220
You and Gongmu Lie co-exist in one body,


137
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,950
and he is sealed in the Orb.


138
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,990
What should I do to be awakened?


139
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,660
When the Four Spirit Artifacts are all awakened,


140
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,010
you should be awakened.


141
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,020
How can you safeguard the orb inside me


142
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,830
while showing up in front of me?


143
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,780
Spirit artifacts are able to control their powers.


144
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,340
Father,


145
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,310
the Sword of Sheng Xie is awakened.


146
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,460
Father,


147
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,180
before the sword was awakened,


148
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,870
its murderous power must have leaked.


149
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,340
The Golden Force must have sensed it.


150
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,660
The murderous power isn't a big deal. It's just...


151
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,660
The second volume of
the Scripture of the Nine Hells is out there now.


152
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,390
This could cause some real trouble.


153
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,270
Right.


154
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,580
Go kill Yiyuan.


155
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,220
Father, well...


156
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,020
Go kill him,


157
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,700
and lure them to the Purple Mist Sea.


158
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,990
It's more convenient when they are together.


159
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,870
I'll go to the Su Luo Realm.


160
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,390
Understood.


161
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,980
[Su Luo Realm]


162
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,070
Your highness, this is Hua Tianqiong
from the Sky Mending Palace.


163
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,950
What is it?


164
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,100
Lately, I felt


165
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,660
a spiritual power that is particularly strong.


166
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,860
It's the Scripture of the Nine Hells.


167
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,340
Your highness sensed it as well?


168
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,460
The three volumes of the Scripture of the Nine Hells


169
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,510
were lost ten thousand years ago.


170
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,270
The first and the second volumes showed up successively


171
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,220
with the power of Chong Ming.


172
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,100
Chong Ming?


173
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,750
No wonder it disturbed your highness.


174
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,870
Any thought?


175
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,140
I've sent someone to look into it.


176
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,890
The Scripture is in the Scarlet Tide Continent.


177
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,900
It's taken by some nobodies.


178
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,220
The Scarlet Tide Continent?


179
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,630
The lowest creatures were able


180
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,100
to summon the Scripture of the Nine Hells?


181
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,750
It was just a matter of luck.


182
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,540
They obtained it by accident.


183
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,310
This is a good thing for your highness.


184
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,190
Now you can take back


185
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,950
the Scripture of the Nine Hells effortlessly.


186
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,180
Keep it quiet. No one needs to know about this.


187
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,780
Since they are nobodies,


188
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,870
I'll send someone to handle it.


189
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,010
You should supervise it.


190
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,700
It shall be as you command.


191
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,580
When will you stop following me?


192
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,460
Until you get to the Illusory Demon Sect.


193
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,020
Then I can rest assured.


194
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,390
You'll rest assured.


195
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,900
What about me?


196
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,390
I'm sorry, Qianqian.


197
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,980
I upset you.


198
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,780
But the last person


199
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,630
I want to hurt is you.


200
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,190
Then stop lying to yourself.


201
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,540
I don't want forced love.


202
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,830
You don't need to fake it anymore.


203
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,310
We can be honest with each other.


204
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,540
Don't say that, Qianqian.


205
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,070
I am not faking it.


206
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,010
Instead, I feel touched.


207
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,270
No one cared this much


208
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,020
about me before.


209
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,540
It made me feel that


210
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,430
I'm needed and wanted.


211
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,830
Well...


212
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,750
Can we still be friends?


213
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,630
I won't pester you anymore.


214
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,980
I'm leaving.


215
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,740
Take care on the way back.


216
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,430
I feel tired.


217
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,270
I want to stay at an inn tonight.


218
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,070
Where is the inn?


219
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,460
Right up ahead.


220
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,630
Come on.


221
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,580
Only one room left.


222
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,950
Did you set this up intentionally?


223
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,830
I swear upon my life,


224
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,660
there really is only one room left.


225
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,190
I promise I didn't collude with the owner.


226
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,510
It's fine.


227
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,990
I'm stronger than you anyway.


228
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,990
Yeah, yeah.


229
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,340
I don't have the nerve to do anything
 even if I want to.


230
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,830
But you want to do something?


231
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,870
No, no, no.


232
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,700
I don't want to do anything.


233
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,650
I knew you don't want me.


234
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,630
You only have Lianrou in your heart.


235
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,140
You must be hungry.


236
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,660
What do you want to eat? I'll go get it for you.


237
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,460
Clever move.


238
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,870
You know how to avoid questions now.


239
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,310
You really know about women.


240
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,890
No, I don't. Not at all.


241
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,460
Back in the Purple Mist Sea,


242
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,580
people disliked me because I am dumb.


243
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,310
No matter how hard I tried to please others,


244
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,630
they wouldn't be friends with me.


245
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,190
Except you.


246
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,990
Now, this...


247
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,670
It doesn't work for me, either.


248
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,790
No, it doesn't.


249
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,940
I told you I am dumb.


250
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,270
Are you feeling homesick?


251
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,030
Look,


252
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,579
after I get back to the Illusory Demon Sect,


253
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,790
you can go back to the Purple Mist Sea.


254
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,100
I don't know why


255
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,750
I always feel that


256
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,870
I don't belong there.


257
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,990
However,


258
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,060
I kind of miss it.


259
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,180
Then go back there.


260
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,750
Yiyuan, Yiyuan.


261
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,030
No one from the Purple Mist Sea


262
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,940
can escape from this.


263
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,340
Yiyuan.


264
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,210
Yiyuan.


265
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,790
Yiyuan.


266
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,100
Who are you?


267
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,300
[Tong Xin]


268
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,550
Yushi.


269
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,940
Wu Chun?


270
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,390
Aren't you dead?


271
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,900
Am I dead?


272
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,050
Maybe...


273
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,690
Maybe not.


274
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,420
Who was that?


275
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,100
I don't know, either.


276
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,630
I was trying to fight back.


277
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,060
He just disappeared in a blink.


278
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,100
He said that


279
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,150
"No one from the Purple Mist Sea


280
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,820
can escape from this."


281
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,300
Qianqian, I can't escort you
to the Illusory Demon Sect.


282
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,910
I need to go to the Purple Mist Sea first.


283
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,150
I'll go with you.


284
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,450
What? Li Mu is not human?


285
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,910
He is a spirit artifact?


286
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,050
Li Mu and Duan Qianjie are spirit artifacts.


287
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,820
So, I deduce that


288
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,870
I must be a spirit artifact as well.


289
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,090
Otherwise, why did it feel like


290
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,790
we had been old friends the first time we met?


291
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
Besides, in the entire Terminator Sect,


292
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,220
I am the only one who masters


293
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,300
the Terminator Profound Bomb.


294
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,450
Is it because


295
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,820
the true form of me is
 a Terminator Profound Bomb?


296
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,580
Brother,


297
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,630
this bomb will protect you.


298
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,870
We should all protect Qin Lie.


299
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,990
No.


300
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,060
He's Gongmu Lie.


301
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,750
No, no, no.


302
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,300
He is my master.


303
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,790
Why are you so quiet?


304
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,630
What should we say after you said that?


305
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,060
Master,


306
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,820
how can I help you? Just say it.


307
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,390
Will you stop calling me master?


308
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,150
Then what do you want me to call you?


309
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,870
The Night Fairy must have known that


310
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,220
Wu Chun expelled the murderous power in Sheng Xie.


311
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,510
So, she used voodoo insects on Yushi.


312
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,820
She wanted to make her weak.


313
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,630
Then, she wouldn't be able to suppress the sword.


314
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,340
So Sheng Xie gained the power back


315
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,790
and was awakened.


316
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,330
But what does she want?


317
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,390
She wants to awaken you.


318
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,500
Yeah. That should be it.


319
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,550
And she is not Song Tingyu now.


320
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,870
She is the Night Fairy.


321
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,420
So, the person she loves is Gongmu Lie,


322
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,750
not Qin Lie.


323
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,180
She doesn't want to awaken Gongmu Lie.


324
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,670
Why?


325
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,270
He might be more dangerous if he is awakened.


326
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,750
What do you mean?


327
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,820
Why did you say my brother is dangerous?


328
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,460
According to the second volume,


329
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,300
Gongmu Lie truly is a dangerous person.


330
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,790
Du Shaoyang, I...


331
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,750
He is right.


332
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,750
Maybe that's the reason


333
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,100
my grandfather put me to sleep.


334
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,810
The Night Fairy was stabbed by Sheng Xie.
We don't know if she's dead.


335
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,300
Everything we are saying now is pure speculation.


336
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,210
Only your grandfather


337
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,990
and the second volume know the truth.


338
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,990
I've been suspecting that


339
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,700
the person behind this


340
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,340
is not just the Night Fairy.


341
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,820
There's someone else.


342
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,790
Where is this coming from?


343
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,790
We suspected that her accomplice


344
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,380
was Ye Yihao.


345
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,690
Now that Ye Yihao is dead,


346
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,100
and the voodoo insect in Siqi has been dispelled.


347
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,300
But the voodoo insect is still in Yushi's body.


348
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,790
What's worse, she's in a coma.


349
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,180
So, I assume that


350
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,580
something might


351
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,100
happened in the Black Voodoo Cult.


352
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,100
Or worse,


353
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,300
someone dangerous appeared.


354
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,510
So, what do you plan to do next?


355
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,820
I'll wait.


356
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,460
Wait for the person to give himself away.


357
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,750
We should all protect Qin Lie.


358
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,180
No,


359
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,990
he's Gongmu Lie.


360
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,700
No, no, no.


361
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,060
He is my master.


362
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,630
Master?


363
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,270
Shaoyang.


364
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,510
Come in.


365
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,060
Even Saintess Xie became


366
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,180
a housewife for you.


367
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,660
She knew you don't like the food here.


368
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,180
Well,


369
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,940
she's now cooking for you in the kitchen.


370
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,870
What? You want a free meal?


371
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,450
I want to have a drink with you.


372
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,790
My pleasure.


373
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,990
Why do you suddenly want to drink with me?


374
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,630
It is because


375
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,910
I'm worried about the voodoo insect in Yushi.


376
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,820
Drowning your sorrows?


377
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,510
It doesn't sound like you.


378
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,580
Then what sounds like me?


379
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,420
If it's the old you,


380
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,550
you would fight your way
into the Black Voodoo Cult directly,


381
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,060
or go to the Graveyard of Gods again.


382
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,150
For the love of your life,


383
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,550
you'd kill whoever stops you.


384
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,090
Now that you think


385
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,150
Ye Yihao didn't place the First Voodoo Insect,


386
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,630
how do you want to lure


387
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,300
this person behind it out?


388
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,660
I have no clue.


389
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,980
Nor dare I do anything recklessly.


390
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,790
Yushi is still in a coma.


391
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,460
Song Tingyu became the Night Fairy.


392
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,630
Uncle Li is awakened.


393
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,670
Duan Qianjie has left.


394
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,100
All of these are because of me.


395
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,660
Those are their choices.


396
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,940
It's said in the second volume that


397
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,050
the Four Spirit Artifacts are among us.


398
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,460
But it was stopped by the Night Fairy.


399
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,220
I didn't think too much about it


400
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,180
until Uncle Li awakened


401
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,030
and Duan Qianjie left.


402
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,750
If I had a choice,


403
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,510
I wish they were just my mentors and friends


404
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,510
instead of some spirit artifacts.


405
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,940
Are you suggesting anything?


406
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,030
Do you think it is not enough that


407
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,150
Chu follows you around and calls you master


408
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,220
all the time?


409
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,350
Do you think I am a spirit artifact as well?


410
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,180
If I really were a spirit artifact,


411
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,460
what would you do?


412
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,050
It doesn't matter


413
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,300
what I want to do.


414
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,300
What's more important is what you think.


415
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,580
Spirit artifacts may be valuable.


416
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,420
But for me, friends


417
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,460
are much more important.


418
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,180
Alright.


419
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,460
I finally get rid of Chu Li's nagging.


420
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,180
Let's drink.


421
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,910
I don't know why


422
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,220
I feel that Du Shaoyang is not right.


423
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,060
But I can't put my finger on it.


424
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,390
He keeps everything to himself.


425
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,340
I want to know about him more


426
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,150
but don't know where to start.


427
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,630
Neither can I tell him the truth.


428
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,030
I am a little worried about him.


429
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,090
I only realized it now that


430
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,990
without you around me


431
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,870
to share and discuss everything,


432
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,330
I feel so alone and lonely.


433
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,740
When you were by my side,


434
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,550
no matter what difficulty I faced,


435
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,220
I felt calm and assured.


436
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,380
Yushi,


437
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,550
you must wake up.


438
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,990
Otherwise,


439
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,150
what should I do without you?


440
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,030
Who's there?


441
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,100
Yiyuan is dead.


442
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,420
I'll kill everyone from the Purple Mist Sea.


443
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,580
Yiyuan.


444
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,910
You saw him as well?


445
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,300
Yes, it was a man.


446
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,580
Yiyuan was killed.


447
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,870
That can't be true.


448
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,990
Then it's everyone from the Purple Mist Sea.


449
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,550
Who the hell was that?


450
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,700
He showed up in our rooms at the same time.


451
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,340
What's going on?


452
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,870
Let's go to the Purple Mist Sea.


453
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,220
There was no one on the way here.


454
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,750
They can't all be dead.


455
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,910
Don't worry.


456
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,300
Let's go inside first.


457
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,100
Yiyuan.


458
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,510
Lianrou.


459
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,060
Why...


460
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,820
Why are you here?


461
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,670
To collect some spirit herbs. I just arrived.


462
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,300
What's going on?


463
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,980
Why is no one here?


464
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,630
You finally reunited with her.


465
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,630
Congratulations. Bye-bye.


466
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,990
Qianqian, Qianqian.


467
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,220
Qianqian.


468
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,460
Don't you call my name. Go away.


469
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,750
Come on.


470
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,700
-Qin Lie. 
-Yi Yuan.


471
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,340
-Yi Yuan. 
-What's wrong?


472
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,910
You are alive?


473
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,790
I thought you were dead.


474
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,870
How did you know that I was dead?


475
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,910
What happened to my sister?


476
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,550
Qianqian.


477
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,510
Would you leave us alone for a moment?


478
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,100
Sister,


479
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,420
I'm sorry, sister.


480
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,420
I shouldn't have left.


481
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,060
Neither should I lie to you 
about not remembering you.


482
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,030
If I hadn't left,


483
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,550
maybe I could have protected you.


484
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,340
Even if I couldn't,


485
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,220
at least I could be there for you, just like


486
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,910
when we were in the Ling Borough.


487
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,060
Sister.


488
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,420
Have you settled
the people of the Purple Mist Sea?


489
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,940
They are now


490
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,300
in a place where no one can find.


491
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,630
After all this,


492
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,980
they will wake up


493
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,740
without knowing anything.


494
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,390
Good.


495
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,100
Watch closely later.


496
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,420
If Yi Yuan is not dead,


497
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,670
go after him.


498
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,670
Father, what is it between


499
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,150
you and Yi Yuan?


500
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,100
Nothing.


501
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,670
Then...


502
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,270
People from the Golden Force


503
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,910
should be here soon.


504
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Master Hua.


505
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,460
I have been waiting for you.


506
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,420
The task is simple today.


507
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,270
Just some kids from the Scarlet Tide Continent.


508
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,340
A piece of cake for you.


509
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,030
Rest assured, Master Hua. You have my word.


510
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,790
They would be dead


511
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,180
before they know it.


512
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,790
Yi Yuan came back from death.


513
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,820
People of the Purple Mist Sea are missing.


514
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,100
Why did he


515
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,750
lure all of us here?


516
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,100
Is it because


517
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,700
they want to lead all of us here


518
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,100
so he can finish us off?


519
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,910
With his power, why does he need to do this?


520
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,990
If he wanted to kill us all,


521
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,690
we would be dead already.


522
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,030
Yi Yuan,


523
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,510
if you are worried about Qianqian,


524
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,390
why not go in and check on her?


525
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,100
No, I am only worried about you.


526
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,550
What were you saying?


527
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,420
Careful, everyone.


528
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,510
Look at the embroidery on their clothes.


529
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,030
The Golden Force.


530
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,350
Charge!


531
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,900
I thought they were some random brats.


532
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,750
But it looks like you have some skills.


533
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,460
We have no feud with you.


534
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,790
Why does the Golden Force want to kill us?


535
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,620
Sister.


536
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Sister.


537
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,620
It's me.


538
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,790
Sister.


539
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,980
Father.


540
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,180
They are not


541
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,790
the best of the Golden Force.


542
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,620
But they can't be underestimated.


543
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,990
Aren't you worried?


544
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,590
You think they are the weakest as well?


545
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,750
If,


546
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,660
they can't even defeat the Golden Force,


547
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,660
how could we expect them to fight


548
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,110
against the God Race in the future?


549
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,310
They might as well be dead.


550
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,460
I am now most worried about Ling Yushi.


551
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,900
Yushi.


552
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,420
Qianqian.


553
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,790
Yi Yuan.


554
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,790
Yi Yuan.


555
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,550
Yushi, Yushi.


556
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,790
Let's go.


557
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,310
Qin Lie.


558
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,030
I can't control it anymore.


559
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,510
Don't.


560
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,690
Don't be afraid.


561
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,620
I will try everything to save you.


562
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,420
Don't go, don't go.


563
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,420
Stay with me.


564
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,070
Yi Yuan.


565
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,220
Yi Yuan, Yi Yuan.


566
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,550
What happened to him?


567
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,750
Yi Yuan


568
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,990
was killed by them to protect Qianqian...


569
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,110
Don't worry.


570
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,990
He will wake up.


571
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,060
That man killed him once.


572
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,550
He woke up last time.


573
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,660
Qin Lie,


574
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,270
don't you need to


575
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,790
take my sister to the Abyss?


576
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,300
You can just go.


577
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,420
I will be here for him.


578
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,860
Will he really come back to life?


579
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,270
He will.


580
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,380
I think he didn't really die last time,


581
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,110
not that he returned from death.


582
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,110
No.


583
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,890
He told me that


584
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,140
he even saw Wu Chun and a little boy


585
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,550
after he died.


586
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,990
Wu Chun and a boy?


587
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,590
Maybe Yi Yuan really can be resurrected.


588
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,700
Chu,


589
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,750
you stay here to protect them.


590
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,350
I'll escort Yushi to the Abyss first.


591
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,550
Rest assured.


592
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,700
As your spirit artifact,


593
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,780
I'll protect them


594
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,590
with my life.


595
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,850
Just go.


596
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,500
Girls,


597
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,030
don't be too sad.


598
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,420
Yi Yuan is a good person.


599
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,620
Even if he dies, he...


600
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,030
I will be watching out for you outside.
