1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,100
I'm going to take it now!

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,400
Is your foot okay?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,360
Didn't you see me dancing yesterday?

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,100
That's why I'm asking if it got worse.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,230
You worry over nothing.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,140
Hey, let me see.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,930
- It's her. 
 - Why? Who is she?

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,110
- The ascetic hug yesterday, remember? So cringey.
 - Seriously Cringe!

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,650
You know, that boy who sang.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,400
He's been constantly hitting on her since the beginning of school.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,490
Really?

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,140
But they're still not dating?

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,730
Look at these ascetics! Crazy.

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,720
Ja Rim!

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,730
Ja Rim! What's wrong?

16
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,970
I'm just tired.

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,960
Hey! Yang Min Ji! Picture!

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,010
Ja Rim, drink this on your way back.

 glasses @princess_0: Get up, soldier.

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,410
You know, Ja Rim has been really cold to me since the talent show.

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,890
Hi, Ja Rim.

23
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,590
Hi!

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,940
Do you think I made a mistake at the retreat?

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,810
I don't think she's changed that much. She's always been cold.

26
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,160
- I think she changed about 360 degrees. 
 - Right?

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,250
That means that she's the exact same, dummy.

28
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,610
Her temperature is different. It's gone down by at least two degrees.

29
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,250
Then isn't it pretty much the same?

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,160
Two degrees means ice cold.

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,500
Right now, I feel like I'm standing on thin ice.

32
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,330
No, I doubt it.

33
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,970
I watched Wang Ja Rim when you were singing.

34
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,580
I could just feel it right then and there, that it's over.

35
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,840
I thought that you guys would definitely date if you would just confess.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,700
But I can't really trust you, considering that you've been single your entire life.

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,290
Hey, before I'm a single man, I'm a person.

38
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,750
I have the basic ability to read the room.

39
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,800
Your song wasn't bad.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,930
It seemed okay.

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,260
So when are you guys going to date?

42
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,900
What do you mean date?

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,190
With the whole singing thing, the kids in the other classes think that you guys are already dating.

44
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,480
If you're being honest with yourself, you liked his song, right?

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,220
That's bullsh*t.

46
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,750
No, it showed all over your face.

47
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,950
Do you want me to play the piano with your face?

48
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,860
- The atmosphere was pretty good if I'm being honest. 
 - Didn't that recreation teacher ruin everything?

49
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,780
I know, right?  If it just weren't for the recreation teacher.

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,480
That guy overreacted and so Ja Rim felt super uncomfortable.

51
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,090
You played a part in it too.

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,840
What is that? Idiot.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,560
That was just because I thought I needed to do something to not let her down.

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,050
I thought it was alright. They were manner hands.

55
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,470
Wouldn't it only be considered manners to not raise your arm in the first place?

56
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,400
Hey, hey! Girls love this sort of detail.

57
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,290
Look.

58
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,760
Where are you going?

59
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,940
Are you crazy?

60
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,560
What do you think you're doing?

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,690
Did she dislike it that much?

62
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,430
No, no, no. That's just because it's Kim Byeong Hoon.

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,020
Stop pretending like you don't like him. You say that, but you're really nice to him.

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,270
I saw it all.

65
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,400
- What did you see? 
 - You took off a grain of rice that was on him.

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,060
- What? 
 - Woah.

67
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,630
Then you totally gave him a sign.

68
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,130
No, it's not. I just took it off because it was messy.

69
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,790
- Hey. You could've told him to take it off himself. 
 - Yeah.

70
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,880
Anyway, you don't know what Yang Ja Rim really thinks, so stop it now.

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,720
Just wait and keep your eyes open.

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,650
- You think so? 
 - Yeah.

73
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,470
My hand moved by itself because that rice grain was bothering me.

74
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,270
It's Ja Rim's voice.

75
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,100
At that rate, you would date because you feel frustrated.

76
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,380
Hey, technically speaking, you never cut him off totally and said you disliked him.

77
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,960
Oh, that's right.

78
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,070
Why did you do that? Why can't you cut Gong Joo Yeong out?

79
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,120
I mean...

80
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,460
It's just because I pity him.

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,610
Hey, what are you doing, Gong Joo Yeong?

82
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,640
Oh, wow. You're r-really good at playing the piano.

83
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,210
On this graph, the way you can tell the distance between these x-values is...

84
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,500
 Yeah, everything finally makes sense now. 

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,650
 When we first met 

86
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,750
 and when it rained. 

87
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,030
 When she took the rice off my face, it was all my misunderstanding.   
  - ... Joo Yeong.

88
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,000
To Ja Rim, I'm just a pitiful guy.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,940
- Gong Joo Yeong! 
 - Yes.

90
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,510
What? Yes?

91
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,670
I called your name three times. Pay attention, will you?

92
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,130
Go stand outside.

93
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,630
You feel pity for me too, right?

94
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,750
You could've told me to go down on a plank and raise one leg,

95
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,690
but you've only told me to go stand outside.

96
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,770
With the quadratic function and quadratic equation,

97
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,360
you can find the parabola of the water flow springing out of the fountain...

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,440
Won't you make a proper parabola with your leg?

99
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,730
I'm so hungry.

100
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,530
Are you down to have tteokbokki on our way back?

101
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,700
Don't you want to wear short clothes during the summer?

102
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,020
I don't even have money.

103
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,660
You can eat with the money not spent on clothes.

104
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,030
You're a genius.

105
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,720
Gong Joo Yeong!

106
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,000
Hi.

107
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,260
What's wrong with him? Something's off.

108
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,000
He's never the type to do that. Normally he comes running like, "Ja Rim, Ja Rim," like a puppy.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,020
It's nice that he's not bothering me.

110
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,410
That means he heard.

111
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,710
- What? 
 - When she said she felt bad for him.

112
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,790
Oh, that's right. Yep, that's it.

113
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,200
Are you just going to leave him like that? I think he's upset.

114
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,480
Welcome.

115
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,170
Gong Joo Yeong.

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
Hey. Stop there.

117
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,400
What now?

118
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,970
Did you hear what I said in the music room?

119
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,550
I don't know what you're talking about.

120
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,050
So you heard.

121
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,590
Yes, yes I did! I'm sorry! This pitiful bastard even eavesdropped on you.

122
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,990
No. I'm not blaming you—

123
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,360
Stop! Stop pitying me.

124
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,470
What's so funny!

125
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,650
You're a celebrity.

126
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,190
Are you guys practicing asceticism?

127
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,900
Yang Min: Yeah, I also just saw it.

128
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,970
It must have been someone from our school who uploaded it.

129
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,850
Vegeta: Oh my god, without even asking?

130
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,800
Monk Hye Min: Are they crazy?

131
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,120
How could they do that without permission from the people involved?

132
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,090
Ah Ram: Are you just going to let it go?

133
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,430
Immediately tomorrow: go go...

134
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,460
Nuna! There's a guy here. 
 (T/N: Nuna is used by a male toward an older female)

135
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,900
What does it matter? You also take your shirt off when you're hot.

136
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,680
If you'll keep this up, want me to call you hyeong? 
 (T/N: Hyeong is used by a male toward an older male)

137
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,770
Instead of wasting time talking nonsense, you'd better hit the sandbag one more time.

138
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,030
The competition is next week.

139
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,960
A regional competition is a piece of cake.  I'm damn strong.

140
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,880
Buzz off while I'm saying it nicely. Clear off.

141
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,020
Ah Ram: We have to find who it is and ask them to take it down.

142
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,870
 I'll try to find out from the students in other classes.

143
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,410
Yang Min: I'll also ask Jin Hui and Hye Eun.

144
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,370
Thanks.

145
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,130
Gong Joo Yeong, right?

146
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,540
Yes... Who are you?

147
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,190
You're a good singer. I saw it on YouTube.

148
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,290
- Sorry? 
- Lend me your cell phone.

149
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,180
Why?

150
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,720
I lost mine, so I want to call me. Lend it to me for a minute.

151
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,030
Pick up the phone when you get a call.

152
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,470
Nuna Jang Hae Ri.

153
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,430
Good morning!

154
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,090
You say hello because I look pitiful, right?

155
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,360
What are you talking about?

156
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,060
Forget it.

157
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:45,720
Madam, do you give me a lot of food because I look pitiful?

158
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,720
Here. Thanks, I used it well.

159
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,360
Are you giving me your notes out of pity?

160
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,180
What are you spouting? I'm giving them to you because they're yours.

161
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,390
Then why are you looking at me pitifully?

162
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,020
Stop it! You're going to become neurotic!

163
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,550
Gong Joo Yeong, You need to see this.

164
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,510
Are you guys practicing asceticism?

165
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,590
Heol.

166
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,440
What's this?  Is he making money from filming others?

167
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,560
Apparently, it's some jerk from class 6.

168
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,330
Wang Ja Rim just went to argue with him but aren't you going?

169
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,630
It's also your business.

170
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,320
What's the use of someone pitiful like me going?

171
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,500
This guy has lost all his flavor. Are you really the same guy who went AWOL for Wang Ja Rim?

172
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,260
No matter what I do, I'm just a pitiful guy to her.

173
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,420
- I'm pitiful— 
 - Ah you darned pain!

174
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,630
Why are you spouting all this self-pitying crap since before?

175
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,550
I know! Yeah!

176
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,320
He's completely crazy.

177
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,280
You guys think I'm pitiful, so that's why you guys are leaving without me, right?

178
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,500
What the f*ck do you mean, delete it?

179
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,450
It's up to me because I filmed it.

180
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,090
The one on the video said she doesn't like it.  Don't you know she has portrait rights?

181
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,530
You're nuts. Do you think you're a celebrity or something?

182
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,450
Everyone has portrait rights.

183
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,690
If you don't delete it, I'll have no choice but to report it to Google, so they do it.

184
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,670
I uploaded it on YouTube. Why would you report it to Google?

185
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,930
YouTube is a part of Google, idiot.

186
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,610
Hey.

187
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,320
What? What are you going to do?

188
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,650
Hey, talk to me.

189
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,330
If you don't take it down, we can even ask for your account to be deleted after we report it.

190
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,430
We can stop you from doing YouTube.

191
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,570
F*ck! Then report it!

192
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,820
It's not even a big deal, and you're making one hell of a fuss!

193
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,850
Don't be so ridiculous after you did that to get attention!

194
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,010
Hey, you ba—

195
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,060
Let's just go.

196
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,690

197
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,660
What's with you?

198
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,800
- Are you that ascetic hug? 
 - Yes.

199
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,970
You uploaded the video, didn't you? Hurry and take it down.

200
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,450
How dare you make money off of other people's concerns?

201
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,640
Hey. Calm down. All right! I got it!

202
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,680
Are you agreeing because you pity me too?

203
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,980
What are you talking about?

204
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,770
This is so good! 
 Time to Get That Super Tasty Kimbap

205
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,540
Don't be so ridiculous after you did that to get attention!

206
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,150
Try it. Come on, try it!

207
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,330
- It's delicious though. 
 - Oh?

208
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,380
What's this? The video got taken down.

209
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,210
Really?

210
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,100
I guess he got scared.

211
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,590
Look. It has been taken down. 
  My school's attention seekers who transformed the retreat into an entertainment show. ROFL.

212
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,550
It's gone.

213
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,220
Saturday - 1:02 p.m.

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,510

215

Lee Kaeng

217
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,630
What's up?

218
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,710
- Are you at home right now?
 - Yeah, why?

219
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,030
Then, perhaps, could you go to Gong Joo Yeong's place and check if he's okay?

220
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,030
Why should I?

221
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,790
You live closest to him. He hasn't been picking up his phone since this morning.

222
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,430
He's been acting a bit strange these days.

223
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,850
He's probably doing fine.

224
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,150
All you have to do is go and ring the doorbell.

225
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,690
I don't want to. It's even more weird if I go.

226
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,970
So heartless. All right.

227
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,270
Hey, Gong Joo Yeong!

228
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,560
Pitiful.

229
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,550
I ended up showing my most pitiful side.

230
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,990
I don't want to receive any more pity.

231
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,480
Why the hell are you running away?

232
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,760
Why? Why did you follow me? You should just leave the pitiful one alone.

233
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,640
You should just let a guy like me live a quiet life.

234
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,360
Shut up! You're not pitiful. You're pissing me off, so stop crying!

235
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,250
I said you're not pitiful at all!

236
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,160
I'm not buying it for you because I'm pitying you.

237
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,580
It's in return for getting me the cleansing foam when we went on the retreat.

238
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,940
Seriously. I'm not pitying you, so eat!

239
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,930
Listen to me while you eat.

240
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,890
Listen to me while you eat, I said.

241
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,200
What was it...

242
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,900
When I said I pity you, I didn't mean it like that.

243
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,020
If my words offended you,

244
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,620
I'm so...

245
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,760
Never mind. I didn't say it with that intention, so just forget it.

246
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,590
I didn't sing the song to make you uncomfortable either.

247
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,090
I know.

248
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,190
You were good, actually.

249
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,500
Really? What is it, what am I good at?

250
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,110
I don't know. You're so dirty.

251
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,180
I'm your pitiful puppy. Woof! Woof!

252
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,810
Cut the crap and just eat.

253
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,990
Okay.

254
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,620
What should we do now?

255
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,320
We have to report it.

256
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,560
Do we call? Or do we send it in by email?

257
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,840
But do we have to report it in English?

258
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,070
- I can't say. 
 -  Well, I'll go settle the matter.

259
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,610
Never mind. I don't want to make a big thing of it.

260
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,060
And as an athlete, you shouldn't be fighting.

261
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,430
♫ On this night when the darkness thickens ♫

262
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,000
Love Revoluion - Preview 
 ♫ I look at my phone sleeping quietly ♫

263
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,530
Ja Rim is a tsundere, cold on the outside but sweet inside. The truth is that I'm actually on her mind.

264
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,630
What is that nonsense?

265
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,460
Joo Yeong! Who is that girl?

266
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,620
What business is ...

267
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,310
Even if it's not our business, it's Ja Rim's. 

268
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,000
No. I don't really care.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,710
- Ja Rim? 
 - What is it you wanted to say?

270
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,560
Look at her. She's so disrespectful.

271
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,200
It's Rose Day this Saturday. There's no way Gong Joo Yeong is going to let it pass by...

272
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,410
Accept this. Let's date.

273
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,630
I'll tell you by text.
