1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,800
Darling, did you wait a lot?

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,540
- Don't you have something to tell me? 
 - Huh? About what?

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,770
Did Hyung Seung Jin go to your house yesterday?

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,160
Yeah. He came over. What about that?

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,890
"What about that?" You let any guy in your house?

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,430
Why do you say it like that?

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,130
It wasn't me alone in the house. My younger brother was also there.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,760
It wasn't for a moment. I heard you let him sleep over.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,410
What? I never let him sleep over.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,870
He came over only for a moment!

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,820
The others were right.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,860
What is right? What did they say?

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,750
Leave it. I was the fool for thinking you would apologize.

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,640
Apology? Why should I apologize?

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,130
What did I do wrong?

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,200
You can't trust me?

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,260
He really came over for just a moment!

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,550
Then what about Jo Seung Min?

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,850
What? Why are you bringing Jo Seung Min up now?

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,180
I heard you contact Jo Seung Min. Why would you contact my friend?

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,450
What's with you? Is this as far as your affection goes?

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,560
Whomever I am with, whomever I contact, whatever the  others say,

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,550
if you like me you should believe me.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,710
- Give me your phone.
 - Why my phone?

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,300
Give it to me. If there's nothing with them, you can just show it to me, right?

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,100
I don't want to. Why do you want to see someone else's phone?

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,530
- Give it to me.
 - I don't want to.

28
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,350
I said give it to me!

29
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,990
What the hell is wrong with you?

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,870
Is that important?

31
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,830
Leave it. I'm going.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Love Revolution: Kyeong Woo's story

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,090
#Middle schooler Kyeong Woo #Story #Guy's friendship 
 Min_jji @kyungwoo: Don't act like the hero of a tragic love story

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,580
I know the story that comes after that.

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,880
It was revealed that jerk Jo Seung Min was the one that spread all the false rumors about Nam Yu Ri.

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,820
On top of that, he spread weird rumors about Lee Kyeong Woo.

37
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,530
I think it said that Nam Yu Ri had a hard time because Kyeong Woo was very rash and violent.

38
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,710
Eventually, it spread everywhere and even reached Kyeong Woo's ears.

39
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,690
Did Lee Kyeong Woo come to school? I heard he hit Nam Yu Ri.

40
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,350
How could he do that, with that face of his?

41
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,420
I am getting goosebumps.

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,870
That guy always had a bad temper.

43
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,800
Hey, I was with him for a while so I know. I knew that he would do that someday.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,300
You guys have it hard because you made a bad friend.

45
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,980
Hey! Don't be with him from now on. Why would you be with a guy like him?

46
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,260
Lee Kyeong Woo is a thug and his girlfriend is trash, they suit each other.

47
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,200
- So true. 
 - Hey Jo Seung Min! What is this f*cking nonsense?

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,270
Why are you spreading false rumors here and there?

49
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,980
What do you mean by false rumors? It is true that you fought with Nam Yu Ri and said mean stuff.

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,920
I was just pitying Nam Yu Ri.

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,480
No matter what, you shouldn't hit a girl.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,750
When did I hit Nam Yu Ri?

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,810
I saw it.

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,550
Crazy!

55
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,130
Hey, hey, Kyeong Woo, what's wrong with you? You want to hit me too?

56
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,630
-  F*ck! Let go! 
 - I can't let go!

57
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,680
You might get expelled if you continue this. Don't do this.

58
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,250
Why are you taking his side when you know nothing, you fool?

59
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,280
Why would I take that fool's side?

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,850
I am taking your side. I am doing this for you.

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,040
Buffoon! He can't even hit me.

62
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,920
Hey Gong Joo Yeong! Thanks a freaking ton.

63
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,690
Hey, hey, you don't have to look at me like that.

64
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,520
I will give you some advice. Don't hang out with that jerk too much.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,160
He thinks so, so highly of himself that he will steal

66
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,840
everything that you like.

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,070
After all this, Kyeong Woo suddenly got hospitalized.

68
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,560
Why? Did he get ill from anger?

69
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,050
No, you dumbo.

70
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,590
He was hurt somehow. Did they say he fell?

71
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,950
Ah, I heard it, but I can't remember. What was it?

72
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,860
Nam Yu Ri's ex-husband! They had a fight.

73
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,960
Oh Ah Ram, stop with your over-the-top melodrama now.

74
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,280
Oh right! I heard he got hurt while fighting with Nam Yu Ri.

75
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,360
Does that even make sense? What's this nonsense, out of the blue?

76
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,060
What do you mean by nonsense? A woman's fury has always been scarier.

77
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,130
Hey, even if they fought, would she unleash such fury that he would get hospitalized?

78
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,000
There are many cases of crimes of passion like that!

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,150
It was not Nam Yu Ri.

80
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,220
Then why did Lee Kyeong Woo get hurt?

81
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,170
Gong Joo Yeong, you know right?

82
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,220
Actually...

83
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,590
It was because of me.

84
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,540
You're here?

85
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,370
- Are you okay?
 - Well.

86
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,690
What are you doing? Sit.

87
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,090
It was revealed that all the false rumors about you had been spread by that jerk Jo Seung Min.

88
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,690
It seemed it was revealed because Nam Yu Ri used all her personal connections.

89
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,960
And Jo Seung Min, that b*stard, was embarrassed—

90
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,340
Hey! I know it all.

91
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,840
Even that that jerk Jo Seung Min transferred schools because he was embarrassed?

92
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,470
Yeah. I told him everything.

93
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,430
Hey, but why did you get hurt? Did someone hit you?

94
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,660
Hey, by any chance, did Nam Yu Ri hit you?

95
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,570
According to the rumors, you and Nam Yu Ri had a fight.

96
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,850
Stop with the nonsense and go refill the water. Go.

97
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,490
Seeing that he's changing the topic, I am right. He got hit by Nam Yu Ri.

98
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:59,090
Hey. For real, how did you get hurt? Did something happen?

99
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,020
Ah he fell down the stairs.

100
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,930
Why? How?

101
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,930
I pushed him by mistake.

102
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,160
Ay, this fool. Are you crazy? Pushing a person down the stairs.

103
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,750
You should have been careful!

104
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,840
What? He got hurt because of you, Gong Joo Yeong?

105
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,350
I thought there would be something dynamic. Boring.

106
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,260
I'll say.

107
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,490
The bell is going to ring.

108
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,910
Let's just get up now.

109
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,430
Yeah, let's go.

110
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,680
If it isn't Gong Joo Yeong!

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,360
Hey, I came to see Kyeong Woo but I even get to meet you. So glad to see you.

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,240
Are you still being a good lackey as usual?

113
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,580
I don't have anything to say to you. Just go.

114
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,490
What a man. Is it because there is a girl here?

115
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,490
Is she your girlfriend? She's freaking hot. Why is someone like her dating you?

116
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,450
I said just go.

117
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,920
What?

118
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,840
You grew a lot, Joo Yeong.

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,500
Hey hey, don't overdo it, let's go.

120
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,850
Ah right. You must know because he is your best friend.

121
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,300
About Lee Kaeng's forehead injury. I heard it was from getting hit by his father.

122
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,560
It is not that. I pushed him down the stairs by mistake.

123
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,740
What are you saying? Some say he was beaten up by the guys, and you say it was the stairs?

124
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,250
He said he saw it! Saw that buffoon getting hit by his father with a soju bottle.

125
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,170
Why say that, dude?

126
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,530
Why would you hide it?

127
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,590
I told you that's not it. I said it was me.

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,290
Hey! What are you doing now?

129
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,820
You're just Lee Kyong Woo's lackey, dammit.

130
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,890
F*cking girl.

131
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,380
F*ck.

132
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,080
F*ck. What are you again?

133
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,780
A police car was coming earlier. What happened?

134
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,860
- Seung Min, let's leave. 
- F**k, let go.

135
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,640
Don't make things blow up!

136
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,190
F*cking b*stards, really!

137
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,670
Gong Joo Yeong, are you alright?

138
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,700
I am fine. What about you, Ja Rim?

139
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,600
I am fine.

140
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,710
Is it okay even if you don't go to the doctor?

141
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,720
Yeah. It's okay.

142
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,620
Is what Jo Seung Min said earlier true?

143
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,420
That...

144
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,480
No. Jo Seung Min lied about everything.

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,410
- Really?
 - Yeah.

146
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,940
You swear to me?

147
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,170
- No.
 - So it was true

148
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,450
what Jo Seung Min said.

149
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,640
It's just that Kyeong Woo is a complicated friend.

150
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,620
I understand. I won't ask any more.

151
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,210
For now, get a good rest.

152
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,560
Come out.

153
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,620
Gong Joo Yeong got hit because of you.

154
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,730
Long time no see.

155
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,070
What are you doing?

156
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,030
It isn't even that bad. I heard that was because of your father.

157
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,700
Gong Joo Yeong even told you? Gosh, he never freaking changes.

158
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,780
You said you've been friends with Gong Joo Yeong for ten years. Then you should know what kind of guy he is.

159
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,310
Or are you pretending not to know?

160
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,590
I didn't hear it from Gong Joo Yeong.

161
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,580
Jo Seung Min said it when he came to pick a fight with Gong Joo Yeong.

162
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,870
Gong Joo Yeong wouldn't tell me no matter how much I asked.

163
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,430
He didn't even tell me, so do you think he told Jo Seung Min?

164
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,880
Hey! You really don't have to cover your scar.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,680
Forget it. Do something to your bangs.

166
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,950
Don't you feel suffocated?

167
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,780
I'll go get some water.

168
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,560
Bulletproof Yu Ri

169
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,330
Are you alright?

170
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,560
Hmmm.

171
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,660
I want to go see you at the hospital.

172
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,910
Can I come tomorrow?

173
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,340
Are you still mad?

174
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,030
No.

175
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,740
Then?

176
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,370
Let's stop contacting each other.

177
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,630
Why? I cut ties with all my male friends and—

178
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,560
Is it because false rumors about you are going around in my school?

179
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,100
- I took care of all— 
 - Yu Ri, it's just...

180
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm going through so much at the moment, to the point I can't see you.

181
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,060
I am sorry.

182
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,290
When did you wake up?

183
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,540
Are you feeling alright?

184
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,760
I contacted the teacher.

185
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,910
He said not to worry about school for the time being, because he'll register you as you being sick.

186
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,150
Right, your mother is also here.

187
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,590
She must be talking with the police now.

188
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,070
You don't want to talk, huh?

189
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,720
I saw you're better, so I'll get going now.

190
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,330
Don't go.

191
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,340
Huh?

192
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,620
Hey, is it very painful?

193
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,220
Rate your pain from 1-10. Is it around 5?

194
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,200
Isn't it uncomfortable when you have to wash yourself?

195
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,560
It is a hassle, so just don't wash up till you take the bandages off.

196
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,580
Are you practicing silent meditation right now?

197
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,490
Or did you also get aphasia when you got hurt?

198
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,020
Why did you ask me to stay if you're going to be like this?

199
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,550
Right. I am also regretting it.

200
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,340
Kyeong Min and Sang Hoon are coming tomorrow, so don't ruin the mood then.

201
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Joo Yeong, you're doing so much.

202
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,750
Coming here every day. Thanks.

203
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,430
I have to talk to Kyeong Woo for a moment.

204
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,980
Yes, please talk.

205
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:37,420
Why is it so difficult to see my handsome son's face?

206
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,400
I am sorry.

207
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,300
From now on, let's both

208
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,290
live our lives looking at each other.

209
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,290
What are you saying?

210
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,800
I have decided to divorce your dad.

211
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,860
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

212
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,130
Hey transfer student! That is Lee Kyeong Woo's seat.

213
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,780
The owner of this seat is Lee Kyeong Woo?

214
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,540
The teacher told me to sit here because he is hospitalized.

215
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,350
The owner of that seat has been discharged.

216
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,000
- Yo, you came?
 - Finally, you're back.

217
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,130
- Are you all right?
 - Kyeong Woo, hi!

218
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,400
It's my seat, move.

219
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,150
It seems the teacher didn't know you were coming. He told him to sit here and that they will give him a desk tomorrow.

220
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,870
Thanks for the kind explanation.

221
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,200
You heard, right?

222
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,170
Move over, you fool.

223
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,500
Then where are you telling me to sit?

224
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,490
Is that my business?

225
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,930
What are you doing?

226
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,400
I am sitting because it is my seat. Is there any problem?

227
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,750
Crazy psycho idiot. Are you a nutcase?

228
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,520
Want some?

229
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,890
Okay.

230
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,500
Wow, Lee Kyeong Woo is completely unable to touch him. He's a formidable opponent.

231
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,630
Hey, let's become friends with him to keep Lee Kyeong Woo in check.

232
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,220
On whose watch will we become his friend? I don't want to.

233
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,360
- You want to eat this?
 - Okay.

234
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,150
Good benefits.

235
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,490
Get up.

236
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,390
I said get up.

237
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,270
Can't you just leave when I'm pretending to sleep?

238
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,670
- Hey. 
 - Darn it.

239
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,570
What are you doing?

240
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,190
You also hit me, then. Hit me, you buffoon!

241
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,290
- Hit me! 
 - Dammit.

242
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,030
Dammit, seriously!

243
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,130
Sorry.

244
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,250
Do you see me as a guy who would spread false rumors behind your back? You're so important to me.

245
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,140
I am sorry.

246
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,380
I am also sorry.

247
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,100
Anyhow, I am sorrier.

248
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,500
No, I am sorry.

249
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,590
I said I am sorry.

250
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,970
- I am one time sorrier than you. 
 - And I am double sorry.

251
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,960
I've been sorry since elementary school because I think this is all because of me.

252
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,370
Then I am sorry for saying that you pooped your pants when we were in elementary school.

253
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,740
- Crazy fool. I said I didn't. 
 - Forget it.

254
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,450
Just, whatever it was... I am sorrier.

255
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,900
No, never mind.

256
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,960
Then we don't have anything to feel sorry toward each other about,

257
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,170
because we apologized for everything.

258

00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,360
Teacher! How many details will you give us?

273
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,260
In order to avoid unwanted pregnancy...

274
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,980
