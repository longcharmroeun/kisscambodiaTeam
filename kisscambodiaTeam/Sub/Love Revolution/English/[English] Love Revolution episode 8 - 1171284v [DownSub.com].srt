00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,890
Happy now? F***, you really can't take a hint.

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,290
- Aren't you on weekly duty? Why are you so late? 
 - What?

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,620
- Yeah... 
 - What are you doing? Hurry up inside.

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,300
Wait...

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,090
What?

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,700
Sorry about yesterday.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,420
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,130
If not, then forget it.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,980
Oh, so cute. Why are you so cute?

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,290
What are you doing, making me shy? Put them side by side.

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,460
- Ta-da. 
 - I want to take a pic of this.

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,180
- Then we set this as our backgrounds? 
 - I'm all for it.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,360
Let's also do it like this next time.Okay?

 kyungwoo @princess_0: Whose crime is it?

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,910
- Hi!
  - Hi!

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,060
- Where's Ja Rim? 
 - I think she went to the washroom.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,810
What are you doing?

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,380
Hey, I think you better not look at that.

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,700
No, I just want to see her screen background.

22
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,960
Incorrect pattern

23
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,500
Hey! What are you doing right now?

24
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,940
- No, I... 
 - Are you nuts?

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,660
- Why are you touching other people's stuff? 
 - What? Ah, well...

26
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,300
Sorry. I was just thinking we could get couple backgrounds.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,340
Who do you think you are to touch my phone?

28
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,560
What do you mean who do I think I am? I'm your boyfriend, after all.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,660
So what if you're my boyfriend?

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,890
I can at least touch your phone as your boyfriend, right?

31
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,460
- Plus, I didn't even unlock it. Why are you already getting mad—
 - What kind of nonsense is that?

32
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,780
I can't even have my own personal life if we're dating?

33
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,150
That's not it, but

34
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,820
we can at least share our things, right?

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,590
And I still don't know if we're actually dating.

36
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,890
Then, let's break up.

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,690
Hey! Why are you being like this?

38
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,350
What are you doing here? The bell rang.

39
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,390
Hey. Why is he like that again?

40
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,760
They broke up.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,370
- What? Why? 
 - Be quiet.

42
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,800
Many of these conditions

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,560
can be satisfied that way.

44
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,120
First one...

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,040
having found that, as the last,

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,810
Don't tell me you really meant it?

47
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,510
You just said it out of anger, right? I was wrong.

48
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,680
I'm really sorry.

49
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,470
New text message.

50
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,130
Don't tell me you really meant it?

51
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,230
You just said it out of anger, right? I was wrong.
 I'm really sorry.

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,090
Hey you nutcase. Cut it out! You'll get dizzy at this rate.

53
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,410
Let go! That's what I want.

54
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,140
It's my first time seeing someone trying to get drunk with caffeine.

55
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,700
Just keep going crazy.

56
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,870
It took me so much effort to date her...

57
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,000
She still hasn't read his messages?

58
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,880
You idiot! Are you just going to wait for her messages all day?

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,780
Just go find her first!

60
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,930
It's like you only have fingers and no legs.

61
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,740
But I'm scared to see her face.

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,060
Is that really the punk that sang a confession song in front of the whole school?

63
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,130
Hey! Why are you discouraging our Joo Yeong?

64
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,650
It's alright, you're okay.

65
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,860
Hey, go and talk to her.

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,980
Whatever you want to say, say it to her face directly.

67
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,610
Yeah.

68
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,260
What did I even do that was so wrong?

69
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,340
Hey, Wang Ja Rim!

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,270
You!

71
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,630
Check your KakaoTalk.

72
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,610
That was the wind.

73
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,900
Ja Rim, please answer me.

74
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
 I was wrong for touching your phone.
 Let's talk.

75
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,910
 You didn't mean it, right? 
Ja Rim!

76
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,970
Hey, aren't you going home?

77
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,960
I don't have the energy to go.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,970
You've gone nuts because of a girl.

79
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,030
You go home first.

80
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,610
Come on, let's go.

81
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,770
No.

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,360
I said let's go!

83
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,400
- Give it back. 
 - Hurry and come out.

84
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
Hey, Wang Ja.

85
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,200
Honestly, Gong Joo Yeong didn't make that serious of a mistake, did he?

86
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,010
- Did you have to go as far as breaking up?
 - Then, you...

87
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,730
What would you do if he secretly accessed your game account and took all your equipment and money?

88
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,000
- I'd  beat him up, of course! 
 - Exactly. 
 - Ah, no wait, that's not it!

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
That's for if he actually took them.

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,070
Has Gong Joo Yeong ever caused any harm to you? He didn't.

91
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,660
Is criminal attempt not a crime?

92
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,790
Isn't it common sense to get someone's permission first before touching their stuff?

93
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,290
- That's true. 
 - Are you Gong Joo Yeong's lawyer?

94
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,590
If he has something to say, tell him to talk to me in person.

95
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,960
Is it your hobby to justify a guilty person's behavior?

96
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,680
If I'm guilty, then you are too.

97
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,460
Guilty of the crime of theft for stealing my heart.

98
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,500
You're stealing it right now too!

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,490
You're still able to make jokes right now?

100
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,240
Sorry.

101
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,270
Hey, just make up with him already.
 I'll self-reflect. Let's make up.

102
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,850
- You can at least hear what he has to say. 
 - I don't want to hear anything or say anything to him.

103
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,710
- He's the one who's at fault.
 - That's right.

104
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,620
Gong Joo Yeong really was wrong. But you weren't expecting that, were you?

105
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,190
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

106
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,520
I'll self-reflect. Let's make up.

107
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,110
Ja Rim!

108
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,020
- At least take this. 
 - I said, scram.

109
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,130
I'm really sorry. I really wasn't trying to check your phone.

110
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,370
I just wanted us to have couple backgrounds—

111
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,760
Hey. Just knock it off.

112
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,180
Why would we have couple backgrounds? Are we in that close a relationship?

113
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,080
I just said okay to dating you to be nice. To be honest, I...

114
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,450
No, never mind.

115
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,050
Ah, f***.

116
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,580
F- what?

117
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,860
My hand slipped.

118
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,860
Why are you so surprised? I also know how to swear.

119
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,460
- Are you crazy? 
 - No, I'm completely sane.

120
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,210
Anyway, finish what you were saying just now.

121
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,680
It's because I'm like this that you what? You hate me to death?

122
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,100
Why are you dating me if you don't like me?  Are you doing community service?

123
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,980
- That's because you kept— 
 - Oh, gosh. Thank you!

124
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,320
You were so magnanimous as to agree to date this lowly boor.

125
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,800
It is such an immense privilege! My apologies for annoying you all this time.

126
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,630
- Hey, listen to me! 
 - I don't want to!

127
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,140
Why do I always have to listen to you? I also know how to speak!

128
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,420
People can make mistakes.

129
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,130
Isn't that the process of getting to know each other?

130
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,940
You have to touch other people's stuff to get to know each other?

131
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,380
Whatever. You think I don't have other girls other than you?

132
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,890
Don't you remember the senior who likes me?

133
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,160
Oh, so you're even bringing that up now?

134
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,350
All right. Is this who you are?

135
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,840
So, this is what the real you is like, isn't it?

136
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,830
Then, what? What are you going to do about it?

137
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,740
For a person who says he won't change, you sure changed fast.

138
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,980
No, this is what the real you is like, so I guess you didn't change, right?

139
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,800
It's possible to act like this when you're mad.

140
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,390
But actually you're the one who wanted to say this all along, isn't it?

141
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,970
Then, you should've been like this from the beginning.

142
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,960
Why did you keep making caring gestures and confusing me?

143
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,980
I won't even wish for much.

144
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,200
Can't you at least treat me like a human?

145
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,330
Do you hate me that much?

146
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,330
- It's not that I hate you... 
 - That's what I mean!

147
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,860
Don't talk like that! Just directly say whether you hate me or like me!

148
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah, I hate you. I hate you. 
 "Hate you" ; "Hate you"

149
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,200
I freaking hate you. 
 "Freaking hate you"

150
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,740
- Are you done? 
 - Yeah, I'm done.

151
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,320
Why not swear, too? You're good at swearing, aren't you? F...

152
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,020
F... F- Foot, what do you think about my foot? My f-foot.

153
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,400
These look like flocked shoes.

154
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,460
- Hey, Gong Joo Yeong. 
 - Yes? I didn't swear.

155
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Clean up the banana milk.

156
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,940
Yes.

157
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,440
We said we would meet tomorrow. What time should we meet?

158
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,700
Did we say that?

159
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,200
- I'm not going. 
 - Me neither.

160
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,940
This is awkward. I hate this!

161
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,280
- Then, perhaps we shouldn't meet either? 
 - Sure.

162
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,700
- Why not? Let's just hang out ourselves. 
 - Yeah, true,

163
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,350
the survivors should keep on living, and the ones who can hang out should hang out.

164
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,690
It's better if I'm not there, then.

165
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,700
I'll also head off now.

166
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,480
What should we do about them?

167
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,650
I don't know. I can't get involved in this anymore.

168
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,030
I'm sure they'll handle it themselves.

169
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,400
So, what time are we meeting tomorrow?

170
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,600
Can you not read your surroundings?

171
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,040
That crazy punk.

172
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,110
Is he seriously insane?

173
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,020
Rumors spread quite quickly in schools.

174
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,190
Please go, I'm not in the mood to talk.

175
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,310
Oh dear! But I came to comfort you.

176
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,830
To be honest, you two broke up much faster than I had expected. I was surprised.

177
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,660
I told you she never really liked you.

178
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,820
It's a relief you're finally free from her claws now.

179
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,940
Just consider it a good learning experience and move on.

180
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,770
Let's go, I'll buy you something.

181
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,080
I'm okay, please just go.

182
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,980
What? Don't tell me you're planning to try again with her?

183
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,080
Are you really that oblivious?

184
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,910
From the start, she agreed to date you with the intention of dumping you.

185
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,350
What do you like about that bitch?

186
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,190
Don't insult Ja Rim.

187
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,060
What?

188
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,070
What does it matter to you what she does or doesn't do?

189
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,350
You think I didn't know?

190
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm the one who liked her and was dumped of my own accord, so please just drop it.

191
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,660
I was happy when I liked her.

192
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,830
Wow, you sound like a total loser.

193
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,540
You can go if you've figured it out. Because I'm going to keep living as a loser.

194
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,250
Sure. I'm not that interested in losers like you.

195
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,630
Crazy ass.

196
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,800
Ja Rim should've seen that just now.

197
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,740
I was kind of cool.

198
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm damn charismatic.

199
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,860
This is driving me crazy.

200
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,850
What should I do?

201
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,350
She saw

202
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,790
We're not going to have fun today.

203
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,950
We're not going for fun, either.

204
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,470
We're going to Wang Ja Rim's place.

205
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,300
We're going to Joo Yeong's. He went home first again.

206
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,430
We figured he shouldn't be alone.

207
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,730
We thought we should speak to Ja Rim, too.

208
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,030
Why did those two have to fight and make things difficult for all of us?

209
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,770
Let's go.

210
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,390
What are you doing here?

211
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,680
What are you up to now? Do you have more swearing left to do?

212
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,890
It's not like that.

213
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,770
I was just walking mindlessly but when I came to my senses I was in front of your place.

214
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,390
Damn.

215
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,850
Are you writing a song?

216
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,980
Sorry.

217
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,720
I was just so mad, I spoke too harshly without realizing.

218
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,290
I know you didn't like me back.

219
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,860
Thanks for dating me.

220
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,820
Sorry.

221
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,320
Keep your head down.

222
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,160
I wasn't serious when I said I hated you.

223
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,360
Keep your head down.

224
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,150
I don't really hate you.

225
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,620
I wasn't messing with you, either.

226
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,770
I just don't really know, either.

227
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll go.

228
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,820
Hey, why are you crying?

229
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,530
I thought you would never see me again.

230
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:44,070
That was my original plan, but we go to the same school and live near each other.

231
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,870
So that's how it turns out.

232
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,130
Then, are we dating again?

233
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,690
I guess.

234
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,190
Ja Rim, I really like you.

235
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,560
I know.

236
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,390
What about you?

237
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,540
Okay.

238
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,510
I'll wait until you like me back.

239
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,090
Do whatever you want. Now I really have to go to the market.

240
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,750
- Wait for me. 
- Why would I?

241
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,590
The way to the supermarket is dangerous.

242
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,160
♫ Even if I keep telling myself it’s not real ♫

243
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,510
Okay, from now on I really won't do anything you dislike.

244
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,080
I don't like this stuff.

245
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,330
Can't you reconsider linking arms?

246
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,500
Why don't you just grab my collar?

247
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,970
You still remember that?

248
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,390
How can I forget?

249
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,490
They're practically filming a drama together.

250
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,260
Why are we here?

251
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,940
He's not worth worrying over.

252
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,820
Anyhow, it's good that it went well.

253
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,660
I'm hungry. They're going to the supermarket, right?

254
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,510
- Hey, hey! 
 - Hey!

255
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,690
- Let's go. 
- Go where?

256
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,790
Where do you think you're going? 
 ♫ But the picture you posted today, where was it taken? ♫

257
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,470
I don't care, let's go.

258
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,450
I said let's go with them. Hey. 
 ♫ Why does it make me so anxious ♫

259
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,320
♫ when you are somewhere I’m not? ♫

260
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,230
♫ I like you ♫

261
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,970
Love Revolution

262
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,170
Exclusive News, Exclusive News!

263
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,930
"Let's go surprise Kyeong Woo"? You could just tell me you want to celebrate my birthday, why make up an excuse?

264
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,270
- How can I help y— 
 - Hi!

265
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,140
Did you need me for anything again, dear customer?

266
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,520
Some water.

267
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,510
Could you give me your number?

268
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,660
Everything else

269
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,050
is just so trivial compared to my Ja Rim.

270
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,650
Guys... Thank you.

271
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,350
Happy birthday to you!

272
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,250
- Don't tell me... 
 - You crazy morons, why would you eat that?

273
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,120
It was reserved by a customer to use for a celebration. How are you going to fix this?
