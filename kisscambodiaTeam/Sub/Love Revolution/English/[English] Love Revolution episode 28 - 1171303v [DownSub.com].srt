1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,020
Let's go to the  snack shop. I'll treat you today.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,570
Would you hold still?

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,460
Hurry up and let’s go before break time ends.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,310
You must be hungry.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,180
What would you like? Our Ja Rim's

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,350
- favorite bread is cheese bread.
 - She's quite impressive.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,320
It’s not easy to sponge off someone that much.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,790
I feel sorry for him every time I see them.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,370
Hey, I need to go to the bathroom. Go ahead.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,400
Yeah! All right. I'll meet you at the snack store.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,910
Excuse me. What was that just now?

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,820
- About what? 
- What did you just say?

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,470
You said something about Gong Joo Yeong.

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,590
I feel sorry for Gong Joo Yeong.

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,790
What?

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,860
You're pretending you don't know. You're playing with Gong Joo Yeong.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,620
The rumors have spread in our school.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,620
You should make it less obvious. Every time I see him, he’s always looking out for you.

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,210
Exactly! Let's go.

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,730
Let's go.

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,800
He and Bo Gyeong made such an adorable couple.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,580
Exactly.

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,050
Bo Gyeong? Who is that?

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,990
Love Revolution: The sudden appearance of the ex-girlfriend 
 Episode 28. #Boyfriend'sPast #ItBothersMe #DefinitelyNotJealousy

25
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,390
kyungwoo @prince_rim: Everyone has a past

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,630
That's a pasta restaurant, but the tiramisu they sell for dessert is totally awesome.

27
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,060
That's nice. Are you going home right after we eat that?

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,250
No. I’ll get tickets for a movie too.

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,660
Joo Yeong, I'm Bo Gyeong.

30
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,240
You didn't reply to my DM.

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,610
Why? Is there anything to see?

32
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,210
Nope!

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,970
What is this? How did she know my number?

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,230
- What? Kwak Bo Gyeong? 
 - Yeah!

35
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,420
Suddenly! She hasn't contacted me once all this time.

36
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,680
What's going on? What is this?

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,730
Just ignore her. You have a girlfriend now.

38
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,800
Of course I'll do that. I don’t have any lingering feelings for her.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,480
I blocked her on Instagram, but she kept...

40
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,140
But...

41
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,200
No. I'll put an end to this by myself.

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,790
Don't say anything to Ja Rim.

43
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,470
Why do you have a passbook?

44
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,800
Oh! Did you see it?

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,760
- You took it out— 
 - Ta-da!

46
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,930
This is a couple's bankbook! Let's save 1,000 won here every day

47
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,310
so when we go on a date or on a trip, we could use it.

48
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,800
What do you think? What do you think?

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,780
Bothersome.

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,250
You just need to give me 500 won every day, and  I'll put it in.

51
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,160
Do what you want.

52
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,190
That crazy witch was on the verge of cursing at us too.

53
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,180
I was so scared.

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,410
He has really bad luck.

55
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,010
If he had kept on dating Bo Gyeong, he would never have played around with that wench.

56
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,340
You're right.

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,270
They had a pretty relationship.

58
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,490
Like an artist

59
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm here. Did you wait long?

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,040
Bo Gyeong, big news. Gong Joo Yeong seems to really let others leech off him.

61
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,350
Today also he was like, "Do you want me to buy you something?"

62
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,290
Really? So the rumors were true.

63
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,740
Bo Gyeong, you should go after him. Surely,  Gong Joo  Yeong will be waiting for your call.

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,690
Still, he has a girlfriend. That would be going too far.

65
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,360
This is frustrating. You're too kind.

66
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,590
Hey! Everyone at school knows she’s just messing with him.

67
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,530
What movie do you want to watch?

68
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,620
Ka-talk (message)

69
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,180
Ka-talk

70
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,380
Joo Yeong, where are you?

71
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,190
I'm in the city center. 

72
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,240
What's with her again?

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,160
- Come on, take a look. 
 - Huh?

74
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,070
- What?
 - The movie.

75
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,130
There are 3 at 7 o'clock, let's watch one of these. 
 Ka-talk

76
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,350
Yeah, sure. 
 Ka-talk

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,890
- What are you doing? Look at your texts. Who is it? 
 - What? Ah.

78
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,990
Well, just... a friend.

79
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,160
You nutcase. What did you just say?

80
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,530
 But I can’t tell her it's my ex-girlfriend.

81
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,220
What's the matter?

82
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,760
Oh nothing.

83
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,760
But I have a girlfriend right now.

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,190
It’s uncomfortable for me that you’re contacting me.

86
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,670
I've thought a lot about you.

87
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,850
Can't I just contact you as a friend?

88
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,720
Sorry.i>

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,660
If this continues,

90
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,970
I'll have no choice but to block you.

91
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm only asking you to be my friend.

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,370
Why are you being like this?

93
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,230
Why do you think I'm doing this when I know you have a girlfriend?

94
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,510
I really gathered up my courage because I'm going through a hard time.

95
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,040
Sorry.

96
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,310
I don't want you to contact me.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,050
I even had a hard time forgetting you.

98
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,050
Truthfully, it was because of Song Ye Jin

99
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,810
that I broke up with you unwillingly.

100
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,580
What did Gong Joo Yeong say?

101
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,630
I guess his girlfriend is scolding him.

102
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,310
- Crazy! 
 - What?

103
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,310
I just can't believe it. What about the things she does?

104
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,530
Did you ask him out? You only asked him to stay in contact.

105
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,530
She just can't watch her boyfriend doing that when he's together with her.

106
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,590
She's afraid she'll lose him.

107
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,760
But she has nothing to say even if he's taken by someone else.

108
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,290
It'd be a different story if she was good to him.

109
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,960
Don't say that.

110
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
Did you poop? Why are you coming out so late?

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,990
No, no! I just had to wash my hands also.

112
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,370
Wait, Ja Rim.

113
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,060
Did you book the movie tickets?

114
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,510
No. We still didn't select the movie yet.

115
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm really sorry, but shall we just go home early today?

116
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,300
Okay. You don't seem okay today.

117
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,060
My stomach feels bad today.

118
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,000
Gong Joo Yeong, you are the worst guy!

119
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,760
Ja Rim, I'm sorry. I asked you out first and then...

120
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,890
Instead, let's watch a movie tomorrow without fail.

121
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,580
Pharmacy

122
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,900
Open your mouth.

123
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,930
Drink it.

124
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,500
Your stomach hurts, your face is yellow, and you're burping.

125
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,040
Do you have indigestion?

126
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,110
Ja Rim...

127
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,810
- Or is there something on your mind? 
 - What?

128
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,000
- No. 
 - Let's take a taxi today.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,750
I'll pay.

130
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,070
It's true.

131
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,320
I had no choice but to break up with you.

132
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,590
Why?

133
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,860
What forced you to do that?

134
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,170
It's already late for today.

135
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,500
Let's talk again tomorrow.

136
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,300
What if Ja Rim finds out I'm chatting with her like this?

137
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,880
I really don't feel anything for her.

138
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,260
She'll misunderstand.

139
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,530
Okay. I'll just listen to the reason she broke up with me and completely end things there. Right.

140
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,060
Things will surely end tomorrow.

141
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,710
Gong Joo Yeong!

142
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,010
Will that thing be my life?

143
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,180
Joo Yeong.

144
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,230
Why are you here?

145
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,290
We said we would talk today.

146
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,670
No, but why here?

147
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,710
Sorry. I didn't see your girlfriend was here.

148
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,780
You guys go.

149
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,120
Hey, what are you doing? Dammit, let go!

150
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,470
I told you to keep a low profile.

151
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,990
You're surprisingly tight-lipped. Gong Joo Yeong still doesn't know.

152
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,660
Exactly. Have some sense and don't pretend you're close with Gong Joo Yeong.

153
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,110
But even if Gong Joo Yeong is dating, why did he choose that kind of girl?

154
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,270
I heard Wang Ja Rim dated a big shot before.

155
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,090
Are you talking about Choi Jeong Woo? Know your facts before you blabber about it. They didn't date.

156
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,980
Is that so? But she already has a bad reputation in your school.

157
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,450
Hey.

158
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,960
You're the one who spread those sh*tty rumors about Wang Ja Rim at our school, right?

159
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,380
What?

160
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,020
I never did anything like that.

161
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,060
Those rumors suddenly came about, and you suddenly contact Gong Joo Yeong.

162
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,400
If it wasn't you, who else could it be?

163
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,460
It's a coincidence.

164
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,480
Those rumors only exist because she acts that way.

165
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,200
Because you're so f**king much better.

166
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,780
What about me? I'm so good at maintaining my social relationships.

167
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,690
Keep living like that then. Trouble will come for you one day.

168
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,570
Yes, I will live like that.

169
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,660
Who was that?

170
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,210
Who could it be that you agreed to talk with her and Lee Kyeong Woo ended up dragging her away?

171
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,890
- About that... 
 - It's his ex-girlfriend.

172
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,360
- She's even his first lov— 
 - You're dead you bastard.

173
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,470
Ex-girlfriend?

174
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,700
No. She suddenly came herself.

175
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,220
I really don't have any feelings for her.

176
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,610
She... she kept saying she's having a hard time.

177
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,330
You guys talked on KakaoTalk?

178
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,160
I'll show you. This. We didn't say much.

179
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,620
If you look at it... And I even already blocked her.

180
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,090
I rejected her firmly too, but she kept...

181
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,150
She's not listening.

182
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,060
The point is you contacted her without telling me. You ass, when did this start?

183
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,230
That cow and you, are you two insane? Why are you guys talking?

184
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,260
I feel like the odd man out.

185
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,830
I really don't have any feelings for her anymore!

186
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,760
Trust me, Ja Rim.

187
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,350
He and Bo Gyeong made such an adorable couple.

188
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,890
Exactly.

189
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,230
I'm leaving.

190
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,360
Ja Rim!

191
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,530
You nutcase, you were in contact with her?

192
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,050
This is a problem.

193
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,990
You seriously...

194
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,900
I thought you said you would end things. Why were you talking to her secretly?

195
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,430
No, I told her I would block her,

196
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,530
but she kept saying she was having a hard time.

197
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,070
She said she was forced to break up with me because of Seong Ye Jin.

198
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,000
What? She said that?

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,420
But it is true that she suddenly stopped hanging out with Seong Ye Jin and her friends.

200
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,770
Damn it. So what? So what if it's true? Are you going to date her again or something?

201
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,030
No! What nonsense are you saying?

202
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,230
It's just... I didn't know why we broke up.

203
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,200
I just wanted to know the reason.

204
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,160
You could reject her ten thousand times and it wouldn't be enough.  Everything she says is bullshit, so just ignore it.

205
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,780
Hey, Lee Kaeng. Were you the one who got dumped by Kwak Bo Gyeong? Why do you hate her so much?

206
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,920
Hey, but wasn't Wang Ja Rim a bit strange just now?

207
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,300
- What? 
 - She didn't even get mad.

208
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,350
Usually, if an ex comes and hooks arms with your partner, wouldn't you get mad?

209
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,080
You're right.

210
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,670
Is she nuts?

211
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,760
When she knows he has a girlfriend, why would she seek him out?

212
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,140
I'm speechless. She linked arms with him even though you were right there. Is she crazy?

213
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,000
Didn't she do that for you to see?

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,500
Exactly.  She's outright crafty as a fox.  What's her name? Kwak Bo Gyeong?

215
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,200
I heard she goes to Poongil High School. Show me. I couldn't see her face earlier.

216
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,000
bogyeong232

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,580
- What is this?  What happened to her face?
 - Let me see.

218
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,620
Crazy.  She looks like one hell of a foxy witch.

219
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,170
Hey, stick to the facts.

220
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,670
You should have just grabbed her hair.

221
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,830
Honestly, I'm very angry.

222
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,670
But these days there's a rumor that I'm playing with Gong Joo Yeong, so I couldn't let my anger out.

223
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,320
- Why?  I thought rumors don't bother you. 
 - That's right.

224
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,810
Usually, wouldn't you say "get back together with your ex if you want"?

225
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,180
Hey, she likes Gong Joo Yeong.  She's worried that Gong Joo Yeong is being treated as a pushover.

226
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,650
Never mind. That Kim Bo Gyeong? Don't pay any attention. She's not someone who will shake Gong Joo Yeong.

227
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,420
- Kwak Bo Gyeong. 
 - Yeah, her.

228
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,430
But the thing is, she looks kind of cute.

229
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,890
Since they say that she and Gong Joo Yeong made a nice couple, it feels a bit ...

230
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,160
They look damn great together.

231
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,150
Damn. I really feel like crap, but I don't know why I feel so crappy.

232
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,680
Isn't that just jealousy?

233
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,650
Why is Ja Rim not getting angry? She didn't even ask me more questions.

234
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,330
- Did you finish your homework? 
 - Huh?

235
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,920
You also have English homework today, no? Some text analysis?

236
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes, but I haven't yet—

237
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,720
Copy that. Or you'll lose points.

238
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,770
- Thank— 
 - Do you want to eat this?

239
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,640
- Ja Rim. Why all of a sudden— 
 - Aren't you taking it?

240
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,470
What the? I dropped ranks to Gold four. I'm doomed.

241
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,510
Gosh.

242
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,900
Hey. Ja Rim is strange.

243
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,180
She isn't angry and she's taking care of me.

244
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,600
Even weirder, she gave me candy.

245
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,800
What's going on? Why  is she being so nice to me?

246
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,740
- Must be a farewell present. 
  - Don't say something like that.

247
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,520
Right.  I didn't see Ja Rim swear at you.

248
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,880
Is it because she saw your ex-girlfriend yesterday? No way, don't tell me...

249
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,880
- Jealousy? 
 - Don't say such bullshit.

250
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,420
I don't want to see him breathe in all these false hopes.

251
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,950
A lot already entered the lungs.

252
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,230
Wow.  So that was it.

253
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,900
I really don't want to see this.

254
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,700
Hey.  Wang Ja Rim?  That doesn't make any damn sense.

255
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,090
Why? It's exactly like that. Seeing how she's treating him well after seeing his ex yesterday.

256
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,440
This is a historic day.

257
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,450
Hey, Kwak Bo Gyeong has gotten prettier.

258
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,860
What are you saying?

259
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,330
She is cute. She acts cute a lot, too.

260
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,270
When I think about it, she's the exact opposite of Prince.

261
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,120
Hey, Joo Yeong.  You liked her a lot.

262
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,490
- What are you talking about? 
 - I guess she was your first kiss.

263
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,830
As for the kiss, it was a deep kiss.

264
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,060
Are you guys insane? 
 DANGER

265
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,740
It must have been nice.

266
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,120
- Ja Rim, this is a misunder— 
 - If you follow me, I'll rip your head off.

You guys have a death wish?

270
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,970
You asked us to do it.  We did it for you.

271
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,910
Did I ask you to do it in this way?

272
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,300
- Don't mess— 
 - Does it bug you that much?

273
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,450
Yes, it does.  I am very bothered.

274
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,880
How could I not be.  I heard he had such a good relationship with her.

275
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,900
Even if Gong Joo Yeong doesn't say anything,

276
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,960
he'll definitely compare us.

277
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,060
Hey.

278
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,190
Follow me.  I have something to tell you.

279
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:10,510

- What the hell?!
- Wang Ja Rim went to meet Kwak Bo Gyeong.

284
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,870
- What?!
- Don't come looking for Gong Joo Yeong.

285
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,360
I am only contacting him as a friend.

286
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,810
Friend, my foot.

287
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:34,200
The idiot who is contacting me when he has a girlfriend, or you who is dating that idiot

288

Idiots are meeting each other well.

289
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,170
You want me to stay put when Ja Rim is hearing such words?

290
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,210
- Why are you crying?
- You aren't fine, right?

291
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,190
I am perfectly fine.

292
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,870
