00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,290
Damn, I thought you were Pig Oh, but you're actually Abs Oh.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,430
- What are you saying? 
- An athlete should look like that.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,250
We're not here to play. Let's start by warming up.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,410
Pass it, pass it! Throw!

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,810
Nice!

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,010
Go down. Okay.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,570
If you can't, put your feet together.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,590
Now...

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,300
One, two, three, four...

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,420
Is this the best you can do?

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,060
Don't make me talk.

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,380
Breathe, breathe out. One, two...

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,150
Stop, stop, stop!

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,640
Just a little more, just a little bit. Go down.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,910
- Hello. 
- Good to see you again, Namgoong.

17
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,280
My name is Namgoong Ji Soo, not Namgoong. Ji Soo. Anyway, did you come for boxing lessons?

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,320
We decided to try it out for a day, but I think we can stop now.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,260
Why? You should try it to learn it. It's the best kind of exercise.

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,990
You'll lose one kilogram a week, guaranteed.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,380
- Is it obvious we came to lose weight? 
- We get a lot of people during breaks.

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,260
Hey Ji Soo, if you're done with your practice, can you go through circuits with them in my stead?

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,900
- I'm going to run a lap. 
- Yep!

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,530
And you must pick the easiest routine.

25
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,810
Yes, ma'am! Noonims, this way. 
 (T/N: Noonim is used by a male toward older females)

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,430
- Oh! 
- Are you okay?

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,320
Yeah.

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,200
princess_0 @prince_rim: Ja Rim, you aren't talking about me, are you? ㅠㅠ

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,340
I think I figured out your skill level. This is so boring, it's killing me.

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,740
I'm going. For a fake.

32
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,330
Idiot. How is it a fake if you say it out loud?

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,420
Sorry, sorry! Hey, Lee Kaeng!

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,290
Hey, pass!

35
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,820
- Yeah! 
- Darn it.

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,010
Sorry about that earlier.

37
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,810
I told you to pass.

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,770
How would you have gone through when the center was right in front of you? Stop ignoring your position.

39
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,610
I've got the feeling you must be a spy for the other team.

40
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,870
Halftime over. Let's take a ten-minute break.

41
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,820
Okay.

42
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,260
- Did you see me playing? 
- Yeah, you were cool.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,510
- But when can we leave? 
- In a bit, I'm almost done.

44
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,270
- Why are you mad again? 
- I don't know, it's hot.

45
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,720
What am I doing here by myself?

46
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,480
What did you promise to do while we were together?

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,900
Sorry.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,660
When my lips are bored...

49
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,530
What was that?

50
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,450
I'm bored.

51
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,060
- There are people watching. 
- Who?

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,810
- Rest here for a bit. 
 - Yeah.

53
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,100
Do any of you guys have girlfriends you can call? My Jeong Ah seems bored.

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,050
Jeong Ah? You said your girlfriend's name was Joo Hui—

55
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,990
Won't you shut your trap?

56
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,210
So, nobody has a girl to call over? My Joo—

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,230
Jeong Ah is bored.

58
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,620
Gong Joo Yeong, you said you have a pretty girlfriend. Call her.

59
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,850
I don't think I can call her right now.

60
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,360
He's trying to get close to his girlfriend right now.

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,880
What? Even though you've been dating for months?

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,920
- How far have you two gone? 
- What? For what?

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,670
Physical contact, you fool.

64
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,690
See? He can barely hold her hand.

65
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,200
At this level, you're not frustrating, you're hella pitiful.

66
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,060
Hey, should I give you some tips on how to make progress?

67
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,680
- There's nothing I have to learn from you. 
- Wow, you're making me upset.

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,280
Then what about you, Kyeong Woo? You have a lot of girls. Call one.

69
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,450
- Forget it. I don't have a lot of girls. Do you think I'm like you? 
 - You little punk.

70
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,760
What about you, Jeong Sang Hoon? You don't have one to call over?

71
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,260
What's with him?

72
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,960
Who's left?

73
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,030
There isn't a single one of you who can call a girlfriend.

74
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,230
Hyung, don't look down on us.

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,810
Shouldn't you at least ask us?

76
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,020
Do you two have girlfriends to call over?

77
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,780
- No. 
- No.

78
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,160
- Jab. One, two. Jab. 
- One, two. One, two, one.

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,590
One, two, three, weaving. One, two, one, two. End with an uppercut.

80
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,800
Did you see that? Now you'll follow along.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,330
One, two. One, two, one. One, two, three, four. One, two, weave. One, two, one, two. End with an uppercut.

82
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,260
Good. Very good. Let's try one more time.

83
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,660
One, two. One, two, one. One, two, three. One, two, one, two. Weave. One, two —

84
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,370
Hey! Why the hell are you teaching combinations to first-timers?

85
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,460
Stop acting cocky.

86
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,830
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,860
Ten-minute break.

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,360
Follow me.

89
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,050
Ja Rim, I have a favor to ask.

90
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,680
- Sweetie! 
- No.

91
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,170
- What? But I haven't even told you yet. 
- What is it?

92
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,310
We're playing basketball. Can you come cheer—

93
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,790
I reject.

94
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,950
We're at Ah Ram's gym to learn boxing. That's why I can't go.

95
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,440
- Two. 
 - Two.

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,330
Go away!

97
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,760
Ta-da! Us playing basketball.

98
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
I'm so sorry.

99
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,810
No, it's fine.

100
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,820
Your screen cracked. I'm really sorry. What should I do?

101
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,870
No, only the screen protector cracked.

102
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,560
Thank goodness.

103
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,040
Hey, your girlfriend isn't coming?

104
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,330
Looks like you're the only one who thinks you're dating.

105
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,150
That's not true.

106
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,110
Woman

107
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,400
Gong Joo Yeong: Let me know when you guys are done exercising.

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,480
Let's go eat. Let's go fill our stomaches.

109
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,890
- Me too. 
 - You, leave.

110
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,820
I taught them so diligently.  Is that all you can say?

111
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,790
What are you whining about? Are you a kid?

112
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,370
He whines less than Gong Joo Yeong.

113
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,290
I don't know how he knows we're done, but he's whining I should come to cheer for him.

114
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,200
Noona, that's very important for guys.

115
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,640
Yeah.  Go over and save Joo Yeong's face.

116
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,100
How is this that important?

117
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,870
- Were you waiting? 
 - Yeah.

118
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,570
Oppa, I'm going. See you after my part-time work!

119
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,100
See you later.

120
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,840
Your girlfriend didn't come after all.

121
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,410
She didn't come because she had an important appointment today.

122
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,040
What the!

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,440
Umm. Is Gong Joo Yeong here?

124
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,850
He went to the washroom to wash up.

125
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,490
Wang Ja Rim?

126
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,700
Hey, Wang Ja Rim!

127
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,060
Did Ja Rim come?

128
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,440
Is the girl you are dating

129
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,310
Wang Ja Rim?

130
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,020
Hyung, do you know Ja Rim?

131
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,490
Do I just know her?  I used to date her.

132
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,350
What are you saying?  She said she never had a boyfriend.

133
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,610
She said that?

134
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,490
Well ... I remember going out with her. Maybe not?

135
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,920
Anyway, now I understand how you never had physical contact with her. She's got a huge iron wall up.

136
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,800
So I told you you should learn from me.

137
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,160
Hyung.

138
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,890
Where did Ja Rim go?

139
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,790
That way.

140
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,760
Ja Rim, what happened?  Are you hurt?

141
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,400
Ja Rim, what's the matter?

142
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,480
Sorry.  I'm going.

143
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,070
Wait a minute.  I want to ask you something.

144
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,090
- Later. 
 - Talk to me now.

145
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,510
- Let go. 
 - Just a moment, Ja Rim.

146
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,250
Do you know Choi Jeong Woo?

147
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,710
- I don't want to talk about it. 
 - What does that mean? Are you saying you know him?

148
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,470
Don't annoy me and let me go.

149
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,590
Did you date hyung Jeong Woo?

150
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,670
Ja Rim, please talk to me.

151
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,950
I'm not close to him, he's just someone I know.

152
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,690
His relationships with girls are messy and the rumors also aren't nice about him.

153
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,790
But if you don't tell me anything, like this,

154
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,560
I can only imagine the worst.

155
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,330
Let's talk later.

156
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:51,460
Did Wang Ja Rim go? She looked better with long hair.

157
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,010
That's too bad.

158
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,290
Gong Joo Yeong:  Sweetie, come after your work-out. I miss you.
 I bragged so much about you to the others.

159
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,690
- Please come. 
 - Ja Rim:  Give me the address.

160
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,940

-Joo Yeong: Whoa. Just come to Leesam basketball court!! Thank you, Ja Rim. I love you

161
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,730
I'm sorry I left suddenly. But ...

162
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,310
Two years ago

163
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,420
- I'm first. 
 - I entered first.

164
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,990
What are you gonna do? I'm going to take a dump.   You can stay if you want to smell it.

165
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,940
Hi, Ja Rim.

166
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,230
Can you give me your phone number?

167
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,380
Good bye.

168
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,430
Wait, Ja Rim.

169
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,140
- You dropped this. 
 - Sorry?

170
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,090
Your beauty.

171
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,060
It's not mine. Please leave.

172
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,780
Ja Rim.

173
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,340
A present for you. I'll leave now.

174
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,190
I'm okay

175
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,350
When he said he dated you 
 It's just that you met him for a bit but you didn't actually date, right?

176
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,760
Please read my texts. 
 Say something. 
 I want to believe you. 

177
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,400
Please... 
 Reply to me please. 

178
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,480
♫ The painful season passes ♫

179
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,480
♫ All the autumn leaves fall  ♫

180
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,040
♫ And everything blooms anew  ♫

181
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,630
♫ So why is my season the only one that stays still?  ♫

182
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,260
♫ I'm still the same ♫

183
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,880
♫ What am I expecting?  ♫

184
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,750
♫ Am I still waiting, holding onto the lingering hope  ♫

185
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,290
♫ that you will come back? 
The only things that are still the same ♫

186
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,350
♫ Is this street we walked on together, hand in hand ♫ 
 (T/N: the messages show as unread)

187
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,900
♫ And me alone, wandering everywhere  ♫

188
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,100
♫  looking for you, crying ♫

189
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:38,780
7 unread messages from Gong Joo Yeong

190
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,260
The next day, 1:02 pm

191
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,940
- Who is it? 
 - A damn handsome dude.

192
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,410
- Get lost, Kim Byeong Hoon. 
 - We brought chicken, though?

193
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,450
You could have just put in the code and come in.

194
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,830
You might have been watching porn. We've got great manners, don't we?

195
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,750
Do you think I'm like you?

196
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,040
Eat your chicken and leave.

197
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,620
So did you break up with Wang Ja Rim?

198
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,790
Hey. You shouldn't ask so bluntly.

199
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,520
Why? Does the outcome change if I ask cautiously?

200
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,040
- They didn't break up. 
 - Why are you the one answering?

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,160
I don't know much about dating, but who doesn't have a past? You also had a girlfriend before Wang Ja Rim.

202
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,710
And even if that guy's fishy, what does it matter if they dated? It's all in the past.

203
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:59,220
This punk is totally right. Isn't the present what's important? You like Wang Ja Rim, don't you?

204
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,760
But she doesn't like me.

205
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,600
You haven't gotten any more texts from Gong Joo Yeong?

206
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,770
Gosh, does this make sense? Who knew you'd meet Choi Jeong Woo again?

207
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,790
Hey. Why aren't you saying anything to Gong Joo Yeong? It's not like you even dated that guy.

208
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,490
That jerk was toying with you from the start. How's that dating? Tell Gong Joo Yeong things as they are.

209
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,030
That's right. You should tell him what happened to prevent a misunderstanding.

210
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,720
I'd have to tell him every single detail just to explain that we didn't date.

211
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,750
It's a bit difficult and exhausting, to be honest.

212
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,180
What? If it were me, I'd find it harder to bear if he misunderstands things.

213
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,990
You've done nothing wrong in regards to what happened with that jerk.

214
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,630
Plus you said they know each other. What if he says weird stuff to Gong Joo Yeong?

215
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,760
Gosh, what's all this? You guys were doing fine.

216
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,770
I do like Ja Rim. But she doesn't tell me anything,

217
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,310
so I keep on thinking the worst.

218
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,860
Hey. You say you like her, but is that all you can think of?

219
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,060
If Ja Rim would only tell me that it's not true, I'd believe her.

220
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,330
But why isn't she saying anything?

221
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,660
Because I'm nothing to her. She probably thinks there's no need to tell me anything.

222
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,270
Gosh, I don't give a f***. You end it or you keep dating, it's your problem!

223
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,250
Should I? Should I just break up?

224
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,950
Yeah!  Huh? What?

225
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,610
We're off now. Go back in.

226
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,980
- Bye. 
 - See you.

227
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,930
Wang Ja Rim.

228
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,710
It's been a while. Why did you just leave last time?

229
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,110
I'm your ex-boyfriend, you shouldn't ignore me like this. Let's have a chat.

230
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,640
I'm actually glad to see you. Aren't you?

231
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,200
Who's my ex-boyfriend? I don't know what you're thinking, acting like you know me.

232
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,660
Wow, aren't you speaking too rudely? You're even dropping formalities now.

233
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,040
You used to say you wanted me to.

234
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,180
Was your personality always like this?

235
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,750
You're the one who was rude first. It was right here.

236
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,900
You don't even remember, do you?

237
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,850
♫ I like you ♫

238
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,310
♫ I'm being sincere ♫

239
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,110
♫ I don’t want to stay as a friend to you anymore  ♫

240
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,240
I remember everything about how much of a piece of trash you are. 

241
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,620
Whoa, my Ja Rim—

242
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,360
- I heard you guys broke up? 
 - You want to break up? 

243
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,440
Sometimes he acts like that guy, so it makes me anxious.

244
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,100
I'm telling you not to stay quiet thinking, "It's not me, so I don't care." 

245
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,070
- This jerk.
 - Hey hey! 

246
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,780
 You nuts? What the hell are you doing?

247
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,290
- What's with them? 
 - Let go!

248
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,690
- Is it because of Wang Ja Rim again? 
 - Then you, what do you want to do?

249
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,250
Do you not care if things end this way?

250
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,120
I don't think I'll stay put if you keep on picking on Gong Joo Yeong. 

251
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,080
♫ I do feel a bit worried ♫
