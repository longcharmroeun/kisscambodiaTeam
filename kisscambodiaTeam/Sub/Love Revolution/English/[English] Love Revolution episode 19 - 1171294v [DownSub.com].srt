1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,540
Hey, look at this.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,060
Wow, you're good! How come?

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,420
Hi.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,600
- You came?
 - You cut your bangs?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,560
See, it looks much better.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,190
I know, right. Honestly, you looked like a snotty teen.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,620
Gong Joo Yeong didn't come out yet?

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,910
- Not yet.
- Why are you here?

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,050
To give his game console back. I can't give it to him at school, right?

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,710
- But why isn't he coming? 
- Sorry. Something urgent popped up so I've got to go.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,990
Huh? What's that urgent thing?

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,720
Awkward

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,140
Shall we go wait upstairs? Since I need to return the console anyway.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,860
Shall we?

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,440
What the? Where is he?

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,250
Ahn Kaeng, you're here? What time is it now?

17
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,850
I'm going first.

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,570
Yeah, go.

19
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,360
Hey!

20
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,860
- Don't do it! 
Love Revolution: Shy Boy 
 #not an exhibitionist #sex education time #misunderstanding

21
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,730
prince_rim @princess_0: I'm buying eyes that didn't see that.  
 - Crazy punk!

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,850
Hey Lee Kyeong Woo!

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,570
You came early.

24
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,920
- You cut your hair?
 - Why? Did your heart skip a beat?

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,780
Eh? It was better when your face was half-covered.

26
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,050
You should have covered the other eye and made it balanced.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,310
Your bangs are worse. Grow them quickly and hide your faces.

28
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,860
Seriously.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,600
- Is it strange?
 - No, its pretty.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm going crazy. Did she see? She wouldn't have seen, right?

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,660
I'm not sure. It was brief, but enough time to check it out.

32
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,730
So you think she saw it?

33
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,310
I don't know. Go ask her yourself whether she saw something.

34
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,290
- Can you laugh right now? 
- Then should I cry?

35
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,250
I really feel like crying.

36
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,740
- Ah, Hurry up. 
 - Dammit.

37
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,290
I keep thinking about it and I'm going crazy.

38
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,410
Go to your seat and laugh.

39
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,680
But Gong Joo Yeong was worried. How much did you see?

40
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,390
Hey Ahn Kyeong Min. That's enough.

41
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,020
S-Sorry.

42
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,030
It must've taken three seconds for me to get back to the bathroom.

43
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,580
No, I think it was two seconds. Did she see it in those two seconds?

44
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,430
She couldn't have seen it, right? Right, our eyes met, so she couldn't have seen below.

45
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,330
How can I face Ja Rim from now on?

46
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,410
Where is he going?

47
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,170
And where is she going?

48
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,820
What's going on? Do you need to pee? Go then.

49
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,540
It's not like that.

50
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,910
Yeah, I can't avoid her forever. Let's face it head-on.

51
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,000
What head-on? Seems like you hurt your head pretty badly already. What wrong with you today?

52
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,500
- Where is Kyeong Woo? 
- He left first.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,280
Ah right, I have a gift coupon for chicken. Let's go have crunchy chili chicken.

54
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,860
♪ Byeong Hoon's beloved chili—  
 T/N: chili is a synonym for penis

55
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,820
I...I don't want to go. You guys go.

56
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,460
Why? Chili chicken is super delicious.

57
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,530
I won't eat it. You guys can stuff yourselves with it.

58
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,110
Is this a "try not to laugh challenge"? I'm going crazy. 

59
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,620
I don't feel like it either. I just want to go home.

60
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,300
- Then I will eat their shares. 
- Then pay that much money as well.

61
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,580
I don't have money. Is chili chicken that tasty?

62
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,930
The fragrance from the chili is so...

63
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,690
I...I...I am leaving now.

64
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,030
Bye.

65
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,940
What is this? Did you guys fight?

66
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,870
It's not like that.

67
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,070
Sweetie... Did you go home safely?

68
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,620
The... The thing you saw this morning, my...

69
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,480
To Wang Darling: Sweetie... Did you go home safely? The... the thing you saw this morning...

70
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,420
Hey, is our top gamer dead? Are you broken?

71
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,440
I know, right? I think my head must be broken.

72
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,170
Oh? Should I give you a head massage or something

73
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,770
so that you can focus well?

74
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,470
Yeah. Let's focus.

75
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,830
I have hypo-tension every morning these days so I couldn't see well due to my blurry—

76
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,860
Who are you waiting for, you fool?

77
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,290
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,350
- Where is Kyeong Woo? 
 - He wasn't here.

79
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,900
He keeps on leaving before us these days.

80
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,040
It's a bit awkward to go just the two of us.

81
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,730
- Shall we go?
 - Huh? Yeah.

82
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,920
Since it's hot, let's go without holding hands.

83
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,990
- I think the same. 
 - Okay.

84
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,580
But it's too expensive.

85
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,310
- What? 
 - Hey, you know

86
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,160
your friend Bang... What's-her-name? Give me her phone number.

87
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,870
Last time, you said you didn't want to meet her.

88
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,960
No, well... Just give it for now.

89
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,930
Thank you.

90
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,930
What is it?

91
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,430
I don't know. They will take care of themselves.

92
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,500
Hi. I am Lee Kyeong Woo.

93
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,220
What? He contacted you? Why aren't you saying anything?

94
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,010
Be quiet. Be quiet.

95
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,600
For this creative experience activity, you'll have a special sex education class with an instructor from outside the school.

96
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,050
- Since she's not from the school, she's a guest so be good. Okay? 
 - Yes!

97
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,580
Teacher, into how much detail will she go?

98
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,940
We already know everything we have to know.

99
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,180
Quiet, quiet! Just know that we have to combine classes

100
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,970
because of the schedule. Class 2, come in.

101
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,620
Take seats as you wish.  The sex education teacher will be here in ten minutes so organize yourselves well.

102
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,530
Yes sir.

103
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,190
Hey hey, Mister Gong Joo, what are you doing?

104
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,880
- You should sit next to Wang Ja Rim.
 - I'll just sit anywhere.

105
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,380
- Hey hey! Why take that— 
 - We all know you're together, no need to be embarrassed.

106
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,070
Okay, sit here.

107
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,030
- Hi. 
- Yeah, okay.

108
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,720
In order to prevent unwanted pregnancies

109
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,320
when a man and a woman have sexual relations,

110
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,360
we need something, right? It's contraception.

111
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,200
There are many types of contraception.

112
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,410
First, we'll see contraception for men.

113
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,210
We'll learn how to handle and put on a condom.

114
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,080
I will teach you.

115
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,930
I need a volunteer to come up here.

116
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,910
- Gong Joo Yeong! Gong Joo Yeong, Gong Joo Yeong! 
 - Me, why?

117
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,540
Gong Joo Yeong? Who is Gong Joo Yeong?

118
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,750
Come here.

119
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,210
Okay, now open it and see how it looks.

120
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,580
- Hey, look at him. 
 - Why is Gong Joo Yeong's face so red?

121
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,950
Hey, enjoy being lovebirds!

122
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,250
Teach, looks like Gong Joo Yeong's ears are going to combust.

123
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,170
Oh Oh! It's absolutely not something to be embarrassed about.

124
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,340
Goodness. Where are you going?

125
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,410
Gong Joo Yeong ran and ran again.

126
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,100
If there was an end to the world, he wanted to run to that place.

127
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,510
But then he suddenly realized.  

128
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,110
That he had to go back to the classroom anyway, and he just made it worse by drawing all the attention to himself. 

129
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,670
And that he brought the condom along with him.

130
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,520
What should I do? It's not like we can continue to be this way forever.

131
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,620
Lee Kyeong Woo said he wants to have a meal with you?

132
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,910
Yeah. It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

133
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,970
No, it's nothing. That's good.

134
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,950
You also come along. I'll buy.

135
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,350
Why would I go along? You two should eat together.

136
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,960
Is it a bit weird? I thought it would be fine since you guys are close.

137
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,210
Should we meet separately?

138
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,950
Anyway, thanks.

139
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,520
S-See you tomorrow.

140
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,970
Hey, what is this indecent behavior in our sacred school?

141
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,910
Hey, if you leave like this I will never see you again.

142
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,600
Wow, you've got quite the skill  to incapacitate Gong Joo Yeong.

143
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,970
- Can you just leave? 
 - Why are you like this only with me?

144
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,670
I didn't see.

145
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,480
Lies. We looked each other in the eyes, right?

146
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,690
I only looked in your eyes, but your XX—

147
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,380
Did she just say XX?

148
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,570
Yes, she definitely said XX for sure.

149
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,130
I didn't see Wang Ja Rim like that.

150
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,500
Get lost, both of you.

151
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,030
Hey, I didn't see.

152
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,890
You don't remember? Ahn Kyeong Min covered everything.

153
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,410
- Really?
 - Really. And even if by chance

154
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,760
I did see it, will you be like this forever without seeing me?

155
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,030
You really didn't see? You also kept being awkward.

156
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,130
Look at my eyes. Does it look like I'm telling lies?

157
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,220
No.

158
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,840
Let's go.

159
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,840
Actually, she saw everything

160
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,060
Stop playing with your phone. Eat something before.

161
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,940
Huh? Okay.

162
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,870
I'll just finish this one round.

163
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,030
When I look closer, you really seem like a baby.

164
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,900
Ye Seul what do you like about a guy like him?

165
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,300
At first, I liked him because he is handsome, but what he does is cute.

166
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,920
Cute? This small one keeps acting up.

167
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,130
My birthday is earlier. You want to die?

168
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,690
Sorry, Noona.

169
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,550
Cute. Min Ji, is he always this cute?

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,240
- By the way, Lee Kyeong Woo. At first, you said you weren't interested in Ye Seul, so why did you suddenly want to meet her? 
 - What?

171
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,910
It's just that when I first showed him your picture, he said he wasn't interested and left.

172
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,840
Who does he think he is?

173
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,910
Ah, it's because you weren't interested, that you didn't want to meet me at first?

174
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:59,260
Ah, yeah, I didn't like the picture. You look better in person.

175
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,810
Look at him talk. You make it so obvious that you have many girls.

176
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,290
What are you saying? What girl?

177
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,220
You want to watch a movie at my place?

178
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,180
Then shall we go to the convenience store and buy something to eat?

179
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,620
Okay.

180
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,000
It's 10,500 Won.

181
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,930
Oh! Wait a minute. I have 500 Won.

182
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,410
Ja... JaRim, this...

183
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,930
I...

184
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,360
I have plans at home, so...

185
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,290
Plans at home? B-But...

186
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,900
No it's a misunderstanding Ja Rim.

187
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,880
After that, Gong Joo Yeong developed a habit of

188
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,930
putting his clothes on before coming out of the bathroom no matter what.

189
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,800
Thanks for walking me home.

190
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,780
- No need for thanks. Go in. Text me later. 
 - What?

191
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,110
When you are being like this, it really seems like you're my boyfriend.

192
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,880
Then let's make it that way.

193
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,660
- Do you mean you want to date me?
 - Why do you have to ask that?

194

If that brat raises his average to 70, 

199
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,270
even if you're last, the entire class will be exempted from after-school study. Okay?

200
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,430
Now what should I do?

201
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,020
- Let's start studying. 
 - Three times six? 

202
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,920
Eighteen.

203
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,230
Shall I walk you home?

204
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,450
Then should we go to the station together?

205
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,340
What am I supposed to do if you need after-school class?

206
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,820
"How can I get to Changdeokgung palace?"

207
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,430
How do I go to Changdeokgung?

208
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,170
But why are you guys following me? I don't know such things either!

209
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,760
Hey Lee Kyeong Woo. You put the same answer everywhere and slept, didn't you?

210
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,360
We taught you so diligently. How can you do this?

211
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,400
Ah! Please, let's stop this. Please!

212
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,100
♫  I can do all this and more ♫
