00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,200
We've got exams next week, so in preparation for that... we should go to the internet cafe, right?

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,060
Hey. what about Gong Joo?

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,850
I don't know. You guys go, I have to study.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,180
Shit. You don't have money? Let yourself be treated!

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,940
By Kyeong Woo.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,840
Crazy fool.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,770
No, I really have to study.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,180
If I don't raise my grades this term, my mom said she will throw away my computer at home.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,540
Idiot, do you believe that?

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,190
My mom always says that but she never does it because it would be wasteful.

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,290
You don't know my mom.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,540
When my father was crazy into fishing, she said she would throw it  away if he ever went again.

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,340
The fishing gear?

14
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,420
She threw Dad in the ocean.

 I'm a Teen, My Hair Has Started to Grow!

00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,770
 Essential Sex Knowledge for Teens 
 Because This Is my First Time With Sex 
 

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,850
Yes.  Are there any books as helpful to life as these ones?

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,950
All of this is going to be of crucial help—

22
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm sor—

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,750
Oh, are you okay?

24
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,470
May I help you?

25
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,230
-  I guess you like this sort of thing. 
 - What?

26
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,740
 Just like this, if I impute the wrong to her,

27
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,950
she will say it's not hers and will run away leaving the books behind.

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,760
Now, take off and leave the books behind.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,260
- Yes. I do like them. 
 - What?

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,670
Thank you. 
 My Hair Has Started to Grow!

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,820
I'm doomed. Does she really intend to read them?

32
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,640
 Then I can't have them. If I can't have them...

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,720
then I'll have to study!

34
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,680
I ...

35
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,230
- I guess you like them? 
 - What?

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,800
Yes.  I do.

37
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,680
One, two.

38
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,150
Go.

39
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,830
One. Two.

40
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,200
One. Two.  Hey, aren't you paying attention?

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,110
Go empty your heard.  One hundred burpees.

42
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,900
Yes.

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,120
What is it? Did you get scolded?

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,820
You're going to the National Sports Festival. How can you compete with such a poor performance?

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,710
What's wrong with it?  No matter what, I'm better than you.

46
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,350
That's bragging. We're in different weight classes, so you are naturally stronger.

47
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,800
Even if I were in your weight class, I would be stronger.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,980
Noona. Would you like to see who finishes doing 100 burpees first?

49
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,260
What are we betting?  I won't do it unless there's a bet.

50
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,960
- Buying a meal. 
 - Deal.

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,700
Then we'll have to eat together, you know?

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,010
Of course. You have to eat with the one paying.

53
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,570
Okay, start.

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,100
One.

55
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,370
You seem to be a high school student. How old are you?

56
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,510
I'm threshold.

57
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,660
You're sure you're not bold?

58
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,530
Then are you: behold! A ray of sunshine?

59
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,670
I'm ask-me-anything-but-my-age old.

60
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,170
The flow of this conversation has gone up threefold.

61
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,700
You're so adorable.

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,080
Do you come here often?

63
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,170
Yeah. Nearly every day? I like doing my homework here.

64
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,180
So you're a college student.

65
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm in the exam period too, so I think I'll be coming often.

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,990
Really? Oh yeah, I just made an eating buddy.

67
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,870
Not just eating buddies.  Let's be Boo-Bud. Book cafe buddies.

68
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,870
Wow, kids these days make shorter versions for anything.

69
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,320
- Shor-ver! 
 - Shor-ver.

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
Come on!

71
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,190
Ninety-nine.

72
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,450
- Ninety-nine. 
 - One hundred.

73
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,970
One hundred. Urgh, I’m so tired.

74
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,920
I lost.

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,200
I'll treat you. Let's go.

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,720
What? Right now?

77
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,220
It's time to eat.

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,110
- But I came dressed like this today. 
 - Does that matter?

79
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,640
Can we eat tomorrow instead of today? Tomorrow is Saturday.

80
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,800
I have other plans today, actually.

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
Really?  I'll see you tomorrow then. Decide on the time and text me.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,720
Yes.

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,110
I'm so freaking hungry.

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Dummy! Why insist on tomorrow? Why must it be on a golden Saturday?

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,020
Today would have been fine! What's special about eating with that Noona?

86
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,460
Why did I suddenly tell a lie?

87
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,460
What am I doing now? Let's behave the same as usual. 

88
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,650
You called me to study with you, but you're sleeping?

89
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,310
Still,  a finger flick was too mean.

90
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,450
It's to wake you up.

91
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,450
Waking me up with a kiss would wake me up more.

92
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,160
A punch would probably wake you up perfectly.

93
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,060
Even so, I did do a little studying.

94
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,070
If you were to smack me with your lips, I would be blessed by inestimable grace.

95
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,840
What? Why is it so silent?

96
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,410
Why did you come?

97
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,570
Oh! Did I interrupt you? Shall I come again later?

98
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,160
- It's not like— 
- It's not like that. Get lost.

99
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,380
I should change my password. So why did you come?

100
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,540
To borrow some clothes.

101
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,570
It's exam time but you're going out?

102
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,170
To study.

103
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,890
Why dress up if you're going to study? Did you get a girl?

104
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,320
That expression is a blatant "yes."

105
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,340
Really? You? You sure it's not your imagination?

106
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,210
No, we aren't dating. I just like her.

107
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,000
So you want to look good in front of her?

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,760
I know that feeling very well.

109
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,980
So you came to me because I am a senior in dating?

110
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,590
- Brat. 
 - Senior?

111
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,980
It's different from kids dating. The girl is an adult.

112
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,560
So you, elder, want to borrow clothes from this kid?

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,360
But, do Gong Ju Yeong's clothes even fit you? The height...

114
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,870
Is not important, of course.

115
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,140
- Wang Ja Rim also treats you like a kid. 
 - That's not true!

116
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,670
Don't worry about pants, just lend me a top. You have some big ones you bought for when you'd grow taller—

117
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:17,420
Go. Get lost. Get lost! Get lost with all your strength!

118
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,270
Thanks!

119
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,110
That's 100% going to end as an unrequited love.

120
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,880
Why would an adult date him? He is also a kid.

121
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,960
Don't mind that. Let's study.

122
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,620
Darling, shall we also go out to study?

123
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,170
When is she coming?

124
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,870
Hey, kiddo!

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,780
- Noona, did you just wake up?
 - No. Do I have sleep in my eyes?

126
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,430
No, I mean, why did you come in such comfy clothes?

127
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,040
I'll be going to the gym right after lunch anyway. You won't?

128
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,570
No, I'll go too. I usually wear this style.

129
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,620
What are you saying?! So, what are we going to eat?

130
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,090
- What you want to eat. 
 - Really? Gosh.

131
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,900
This is the weather for gukbap (rice soup). Let's eat gukbap.

132
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,060
Pizza! Let's eat pizza.

133
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,530
Pizza?

134
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,940
- Hi.
 - Oh. You're already here.

135
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,160
- You want to sit here? 
- Yes.

136
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,640
You're studying the human body today too?

137
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,590
It is your book. If you keep doing this, it'll be awkward.

138
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,430
What are you saying?

139
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,190
Wow! It is real. I can't believe Kim Byeong Hoon is being this friendly with a girl.

140
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,240
- You really have to live long to see sich a sight. 
- Is this why you wanted to come out?

141
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,280
What? Well, I'm also going to study.

142
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,170
But still, I'm curious.

143
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,280
- I'm going somewhere else. 
- No, Ja Rim!

144
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,980
Eh? Why are they here?

145
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,110
These idiots!

146
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,190
Noona, I'll go to the restroom.

147
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,750
Okay.

148
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,830
What are you guys doing here?

149
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:36,690
That's what we want to ask you. Instead of studying like you're supposed to, you dare to hit on a girl!

150
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,990
We came to study. Don't make such a fuss.

151
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,790
But she was really pretty. Who is she?

152
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,580
Isn't she a social worker?

153
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,430
Look at her spending time with him. It is filling up her volunteer hours.

154
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,560
Dammit, that's not true! You told them, didn't you?

155
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,430
No? I really came here to study. It somehow turned out this way.

156
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,700
Friends. This is really important to me. I don't want to miss out on this.

157
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,410
Will such a thing ever happen to me again?

158
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,760
- That's why we came to help you. 
 - Buzz off.

159
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,960
Anyway, you guys just try and stop me. I'll hate you forever.

160
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,550
It took you long. Was it number two?

161
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,620
It's because I'm so healthy. Strong bowels make a strong country.

162
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,380
You really say just anything. You should fill it up now that it's empty. Let's go eat, my treat.

163
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,690
You don't have to...

164
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,240
You're already standing up, though.

165
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,500
What was that? Let's go.

166
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,440
What's so funny about what this buffoon says?

167
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,450
She's full of laughter. Honestly, am I not a better smooth-talker than him?

168
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,610
Do you think girls like funny guys? They find guys funny when they like them.

169
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,840
When you look at it, he's all right. He's tall, and his personality is the best of all of you.

170
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,360
Him? He always farts, burps,

171
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,390
and says nonsense. But such a guy can get a girlfriend?

172
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,070
Garlic, garlic.

173
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,390
It's nice to see you eat.

174
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,150
What's with this nausea-inducing sentence?

175
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,240
What? No, just... I think you'd be really popular if you filmed yourself eating.

176
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,190
I hear that often.

177
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,340
- Aren't you eating? 
 - Just eat a lot, Noona.

178
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,170
What? You're already full? Don't bet meals from now on. You can't even get your money's worth.

179
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,970
You've got such a weird personality.

180
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,650
Come to think of it, you aren't asking me to introduce you to a girl these days. You used to ask all the time.

181
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,160
- Well... 
 - Did you find someone?

182
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,820
- Well, I guess. 
 - I see.

183
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,310
- Noona. 
 - Yes?

184
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,880
Should I order one more garlic sauce?

185
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,750
Gosh, Ji Soo, why didn't you do that earlier?

186
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,380
Let's go now. There's nothing more to see.

187
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,840
Should we? They seemed to get along well. I hope it works out for them.

188
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,730
Oppa, you really came. I thought you were just saying that.

189
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,020
- It's on my way home, after all. You were still studying? 
 - Yes.

190
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,650
- Where are you sitting? 
 - Over there.

191
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,240
Really? What do we do? If the three meet, I think Byeong Hoon will be super shocked.

192
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,610
I know. Shouldn't we tell him in advance?

193
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,240
Right, I knew it. Finally, the world is going as normal. This is how it's supposed to be.

194
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,260
Don't you feel bad for your friend?

195
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,170
- Let's talk! 
 - What the? You guys still haven't left? I'm busy.

196
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,860
- Hey! Why did you only get one for her? Buy us some too! 
 - What are you doing?

197
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,880
Let's go to the karaoke! Should we call the others?

198
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,640
Forget it! You guys are trying to stop me, aren't you?

199
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,580
Why are you trying to ruin my life? Do you hate it that much, seeing your friend doing well?

200
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,820
Just let him go. He wants to ruin his own life, let him be.

201
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,250
I'm off.

202
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,450
Thanks for the food! Even though I'm the one buying.

203
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,290
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Let's go now.

204
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,020
- You're going to the gym, right? 
 - Nope. Jin Hui called me, so I'm going to see her.

205
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,960
- Hey... 
 - Yeah? 
 - I mean, aren't you having any dessert?

206
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,190
So disappointing! I thought you'd bet for ice cream at least.

207
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,880
You're right. Now that you said it, I'm craving some.

208
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,410
Forget about betting. I'll buy some for you since you treated me.

209
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,810
Gosh, then I'm grateful. Let's go.

210
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,880
- Noona. 
 - Yeah? 
 - Introduce me to a girl.

211
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,000
Like usual. Let's act as usual. 

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,130
Out of the blue? But you said you found someone.

213
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,740
Yes. That girl is you. 
 Like I've always acted. 

214
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,680
Do you want to be introduced to me? 
 This is my way. 

215
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,300
No.

216
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,640
- You're not even thinking it over? 
 - No.

217
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,230
Cancel. Pretend you didn't hear anything.

218
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,960
Idiot.

219
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,900
I'll pay with this.

220
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,670
Thank you.

221
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,070
- Aren't you coming? 
 - What? You turned me down.

222
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,630
That's one thing, but you said you'd buy ice cream.

223
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,080
Then, can we keep being the same as before?

224
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,100
Does getting turned down allow you to break promises? Hurry and get up. One, two, three, come out.

225
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,400
- You're back? 
 - Yes.

226
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,180
- This person is... 
 - He's a senior at my school.

227
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,290
And this is Byeong Hoon. I met him here, and he's a really funny boy.

228
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,550
Hi. Are your final SAT revisions going well?

229
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,570
Come on, he's a first-year in high school. He's far from his SATs.

230
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,720
- Maybe it's because he's so tall? 
 - Maybe.

231
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,600
Hello, I'm the funny boy.

232
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,650
You two must be dating, you look really good together.

233
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,350
It feels like two people who were meant to meet. Just like Rain and Kim Tae Hee. 
  Whatever-Spouting Feast

234
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,960
What are you saying? No, we're not.

235
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,100
Hearing you talk, you're indeed a high school first year. I get why you find him funny.

236
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,510
It's because I'm the funny boy.

237
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,610
These are gifts for you two.

238
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,550
What's this? Thank you.

239
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,900
- I have to go, actually. 
 - What? Already?

240
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,860
- There's a drama I'm watching these days. 
 - Oh, there's something on air these days? What is it?

241
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,870
It's called "The delusion of the funny boy."

242
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,860
- There's such a drama? 
 - Yes, it's a new series.

243
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,790
It's very... sad.

244
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,050
Then, I'll take my leave.

245
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,250
Noona... she must like that guy, right? 

246
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,320
That's right, even her gaze was different. 

247
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,070
I'm just a funny boy. 

248
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,020
I'm nothing more than funny. If you're funny, just go be a comic. Why try to date? 

249
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,410
What is it? Did you follow me to make fun of me?

250
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,970
You're really...

251
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,170
It's okay. You're alright, you're okay.

252
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,950
Half of the world's population is women. It's all right.

My mom is taking away my room because my grades went down. 

259
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,380
Say you'll go, but leave the place as is. 

260
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,450
- We're having a room-away party at Gong Joo's. 
 - What's a room-away party?

261
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,060
- Why did we gather if this is how it's going to be? 
 - Ta-da!

262
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,910
Does she even take care of her boyfriend's grades?

263
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,560
- What did her boyfriend do wrong? 
 - Was his name Gong Joo Yeong?

264
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,820
- Long time no see. It's nice to see you. 
- Right.

265
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,270
I have someone who I like.

266
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,650
I do think it's a pity. 

267
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,740
Uh? What?

268
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,490
We all pitched in to prepare this. 

269
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,800
Ja Rim suggested it.

270
