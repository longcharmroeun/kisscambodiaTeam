1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
The cakes here are delicious!

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,230
- What's that? 
 - It's nice, but don't eat it.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,290
- Don't eat.  
 - Let me take this call.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,520
What is it?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,010
Are you still at the cafe? Should I come over?

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,330
Why? I thought you said you're going to the internet cafe with your friends.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,880
I already went. We played a few games but I missed you.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,010
The game I want to play the most is a dating simulation game with Ja Rim.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,970
Do you want this game to get a "bad ending"?

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,200
We said we would meet our own friends today.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
You can keep having fun. I just came because I missed you.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,050
How impressive. You guys have been dating for a few months now, and your heart still hasn't changed since the start.

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,400
No, it has.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,810
I like her even more than before!

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,660
Like this...

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,360
A sweet cake and...

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,900
Cake...

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,640
- Our sweet relationship! 
 - Ja Rim is making a sour face, though.

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,810
Just go. I can't hang out with couples. I don't want to see them at all.

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,470
There's another couple here too.

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,080
Yes, but at least she's not like someone, who comes saying "I miss you" and tags along.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,950
Aren't you going to meet Jeong Sang Hoon?

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,070
Yeah, have you guys even met after you started dating? I never saw that.

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,370
We both had exams. We should meet soon.

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,040
Oh, right. Why do I feel like I didn't have exams? Did I want to deny it that badly?

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,060
- Why? Did you flunk? 
 - I don't know. I didn't even bother looking at my average.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,820
Our Ja Rim's grades improved a lot.

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,990
- It seems like you guys studied quite a bit together. 
 - His grades got worse than before.

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,870
I studied with Ja Rim, but why did my grades go down?

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,090
It's exactly because you two studied together. Would you even look at your books with her around?

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,230
- Bingo. 
 - You're saying that so shamelessly.

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,320
Mom

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,910
Mom.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,480
bang_H @princess_0: The lie detector is the truth

36
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,270
What's with your expression? Is something wrong?

37
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,480
Sweetie, we might not be able to meet like this anymore.

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,350
If we don't meet like this, then are we going to meet like that?

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,170
That's not it.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,950
I...

41
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,120
have to move out of my place.

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,790
What?

43
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,240
Cham, cham, cham!

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,820
Cham, cham, cham!

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,280
What are you doing after school today? Do you want to meet if you're free? 

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,260
Exams are over now, so I guess we should meet, right?

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,560
We are dating, after all.

48
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,080
Yes, I think I did well. Should we meet this weekend?

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,350
Sorry,  I already made plans this weekend.

50
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,490
Oh, I see. With your friends?

51
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,690
Yes. We made plans to hang out after our exams.

52
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,290
Oh, then what about tonight? Do you want to eat together before I go to tutoring school?

53
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,550
Sorry. I said I'd eat with my friends after studying.

54
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,480
Sang Hoon, if I screw up on my exams this time, I'll get scolded. Can I contact you after the exams?

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,450
I see. Sure. Good luck on your exams! If you're feeling down, message me anytime.

56
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,730
Did you do well on your exams? I heard the guys say their exams are over. I found out late.

57
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,400
Just so-so.

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
- What? Really? 
 - Yeah.

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,580
Mom told me she's taking my studio away because my grades dropped.

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,100
She said it looks like I've only been playing after she let me live alone.

61
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,180
Your mom is also someone who really does what she says.

62
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,780
Exactly like my Ms. Shin (his mom).

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,560
This is heartbreaking.

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,900
If Gong Joo Yeong moves out, then where will we hang out now?

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,090
Hey, just tell her you'll leave, but don't stop renting the flat.

66
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,900
Don't tell me you'll have to transfer schools too?

67
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,990
Over my dead body! Don't worry, no matter what, I'll take care of that.

68
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,580
It takes one hour by bus from my parent's home.

69
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,140
If I want to go to school with Ja Rim, then I'll have to wake up a little earlier.

70
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,650
Forget about that. What's so important about going to school together? It sounds tiring  just hearing it.

71
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,400
It's not tiring at all! I'm going to do it because I want to.

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,280
Just sleep a bit more and come straight to school.

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm really okay with it!

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,450
It's because I'm not comfortable with it. That's why I told you to study!

75
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,070
- And you said you had to improve your grades.
 - Sorry.

76
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,040
Wow, is she even monitoring her boyfriend's grades now?

77
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,840
How hilarious. So, she'll only date people who are smart?

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,560
She's already being picky with people's education? Honestly, I don't even think she's that pretty.

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,810
She just looks hella rude.

80
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,240
Why? I like her, she's pretty. I like that kind of face.

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,670
It's because of girls like you that she thinks she's all that.

82
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,070
That's true. What did her boyfriend do wrong? Even I feel sorry for him just watching him.

83
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,570
- Oh, that guy who confessed at the school retreat? Was his name Gong Joo Yeong? 
 - That's right.

84
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,250
- She heard us. 
 - Let's go.

85
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,970
Who cares? Let her hear us.

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,960
What are you doing after school today? If you're free, want to meet?

87
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,720
Sure. What time do you finish?

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,830
- Hey, do you guys want to come today too?
 - To what?

89
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,760
- Gong Joo Yeong's room-away party today. 
 - What's that?

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,570
We're holding a party before Gong Joo Yeong gets his place taken away.

91
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,930
His mom told him to move out and go back home.

92
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,150
Oh my gosh. Then does that make Gong Joo Yeong and Ja Rim star-crossed lovers now? (Folktale: The Cowherd and the Weaver Girlâ€”forbidden lovers who could only meet once a year.)

93
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,050
We'll still see each other at school all the time.

94
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,840
If it's a party, we're eating good food, right?

95
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,590
- I'll come then. 
 - Me too. It's my first time going to a guy's house.

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,760
You?

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,730
I'm... meeting Sang Hoon.

98
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,780
You're finally meeting?

99
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,290
Is that so? Then enjoy your date.

100
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,450
No, but we're just going to eat, so...

101
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,380
Forget it. Don't come. I don't want Sang Hoon cursing at me.

102
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,000
Those who are coming, remember to bring money for the food.

103
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,780
Gong Joo Yeong, when you move, you must have to throw out a lot of things, right?

104
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,250
Yeah, I looked through my stuff and there are a few things indeed.

105
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,870
Hey, why don't you throw this out to me? It seems heavy.

106
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,700
Are you nuts? Why would I give you my computer?

107
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,430
What about this?

108
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,240
Boys, you know I'm just leaving this neighborhood, not this world, right?

109
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,080
No. I'm just worried that if you take your PlayStation with you, your mom will scold you.

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,350
Leave these behind too. You won't have time to play when you go back home anyway.

111
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,860
That's enough. We're here for a farewell party, not to steal stuff.

112
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,410
Exactly. Hurry up and eat.

113
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,720
She's already eating.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,130
I said I'm taking a photo!

115
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,000
- Hey! 
 - Stop her!

116
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,150
Should I have told him to meet up tomorrow instead? 

117
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,040
Forget it, he'll know I was with the others anyway. 

118
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,370
Min Ji.

119
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,800
Oh, hi.

120
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,010
Long time no see. It's nice to see you.

121
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,950
I know. Sorry. I had a lot of things to do all this time.

122
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,560
No, it's fine! I'm just saying I'm glad to see you after so long.

123
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,110
Ah...

124
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,440
- Should we go have lunch? 
 - Sure.

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,320
Is it right to do this? 

126
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,410
If you are playing with him, put an end to this soon.

127
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,690
Why did we even gather then? Is there nothing we can play all together?

128
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,260
Ah right! I was forgetting that I brought something for us to play.

129
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,630
Ta-da! What might this be?

130
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,470
It's a lie detector! This'll be so much fun. Come on, guys!

131
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,190
Why did he bring that stuff?

132
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,890
After I saw it on TV, I wanted to try this first thing once I came here.

133
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,500
So as soon as I moved here, I bought it at Artbox.

134
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,730
Gosh. I guess they don't sell this in those backwoods of Gwanggok-ri you lived in.

135
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,730
Okay, tonight is the night of truth. We'll go clockwise.

136
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,940
I'll be the first batter and test the machine.

137
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,110
"Kim Byeong Hoon is the most handsome of everyone here." Yes.

138
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,490
Oh, it's accurate then! I'll join.

139
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,960
"On Monday last week,

140
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,730
I stole Oh Ah Ram's dried squid."

141
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,040
No. I don't know about this.

142
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,620
The test is done. Who wants to ask the next question? Should I?

143
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,950
What do you want to ask that's making you so excited?

144
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,500
"I currently have someone I like."

145
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,530
You call that a question? There's no one.

146
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,630
What? You're already over Bang Ye Seul?

147
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,920
Let's check it out.

148
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,870
What the? There is someone, then!

149
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,080
This punk, he was pretending to be over her.

150
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,580
That's not true! There's really no one! The machine must be broken.

151
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,530
- What was the question? 
 - What?

152
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,900
Prince, your turn.

153
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,190
Don't you dare ask something weird.

154
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,590
"Honestly, I know that my food tastes awfully bad."

155
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,650
- Come on!  
 - Whoa!

156
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,840
You're going hard.

157
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,090
Honestly, I think it's edible.

158
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,150
For real?

159
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,490
It's even more shocking that it's the truth. How can the truth lack conscience so much?

160
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,870
- She's my friend, but I'm still astonished. 
 - Stop teasing me.

161
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,360
No, Ja Rim. I think the food you make is the tastiest in the world.

162
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,080
Okay, then here comes the lie reader.

163
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,550
- Hey, wait. 
 - Honestly, Wang Ja Rim's food tastes bad.

164
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,850
I don't know about others, but it tastes delicious to me. Really.

165
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,150
I think this punk is holding it in.

166
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,940
Look at his eyes trembling.

167
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,000
No! This was fabricated! It's a trap! Kim Byeong Hoon, was it you?

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,050
- Why are you like this to me? 
 - You're the one who brought it over!

169
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,540
It's not true, Ja Rim. The lie detector is lying. I swear.

170
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:53,490
Yeah, I can't make myself like him, so it's probably better to stop it here, right? 

171
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,950
He has probably felt it all this time as well. 

172
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,750
What's wrong? Do you not like it?

173
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,910
No, it's delicious here.

174
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,840
Really? I searched online and this was the top result.

175
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,660
I'm really fine. If you don't like it, should we go somewhere else?

176
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,340
- No, that's not it... 
 - Then...

177
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,210
I have something to say...

178
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,170
This was prepared by this man. Enjoy your time here.

179
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,450
We hadn't seen each other in a while,

180
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,200
and you worked hard during the exams, so I was wondering what I could do for you.

181
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,770
It's too sudden, right? Is it bad?

182
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,980
You don't have to take it if you feel burdened.

183
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,450
No, I'm not. Thank you so much.

184
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,770
I like the flowers.

185
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,560
I'm glad.

186
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,110
May you always be happy. 

187
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,620
We have a lot of memories in this room.

188
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,150
Gong Joo Yeong. Do you remember when you stood stark naked in front of Wang Ja Rim?

189
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,710
- Right over there. 
 - What? Really?

190
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,730
Shut up! We had barely forgotten about it, dammit.

191
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,250
Why forget it? Why forget that pee-peeâ€” I mean, that precious memory?

192
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,660
Hey.

193
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,130
Honestly, this place is the one I'm most attached to after my house.

194
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,070
I feel my body odor permeating from every corner.

195
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,620
Sh*t, you farted again? Goddammit!

196
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,930
No wonder, I was thinking it was weird since earlier.

197
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,570
What the heck are you doing in front of Ja Rim?

198
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,610
Smell it to your heart's content. You won't be able to in the future.

199
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,550
You also fart at school, darn it!

200
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,100
What are you saying?

201
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,090
That's you. Stop putting the blame on me.

202
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,560
What?

203
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,390
- Come here. 
 - Dammit.

204
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,820
What time is it?

205
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,300
I'm going to tutor you according to your level. Should we start with multiplication? Three times six is?

206
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,800
Ta-da. Enjoy!

207
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,030
It does feel sad.

208
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,760
Wow. I can't believe Wang Ja Rim said that.

209
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,470
That's how bad I feel, Joo Yeong. Do you get it?

210
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,320
What was that? It's not like you.

211
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,490
I feel like this happened because of me.

212
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,300
I wonder if I prevented you from studying properly.

213
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,500
No, it's not your fault. Don't say that.

214
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,300
Gosh, how do I say it? 

215
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,520
Your turn, go on.  
 [Ten minutes before]

216
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,560
Ten Minutes Before

217
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,780
Next one!

218
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:38,210
From Father: Joo Yeong, good news! You don't have to move out of your studio. 

219
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,680
I persuaded your mom. 

220
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,240
I trust you to study hard from next time on!

221
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,320
Hang in there, my son!

222
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,060
Fighting!

223
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,690
Yes, let's tell them right now. 

224
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,930
What's this?

225
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,000
We all pitched in to prepare this. Ja Rim suggested it.

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,140
Ja Rim...

227
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,530
I just felt like I should do at least this much.

228
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,170
Thank you.

229
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,760
I'm also getting sad now.

230
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,730
You've never been here before, so how come?

231
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,870
Hey, I also made good memories just now! Come on, let me be included.

232
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,250
What's so sad about this, making me tear up?

233
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,690
How can I say it in this atmosphere?

234
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,930
They gathered their money to throw me a party and get me a cake.

235
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,230
And even Ja Rim is doing this.

236
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,630
What are you doing? Hurry and blow out the candle.

237
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,540
- Prince's arm is going to fall off. 
 - What? Ah yes.

238
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,630
What's with your face?

239
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,630
Why do you look like you've just learned you can keep your studio, after acting all miserable all this time?

240
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,130
- That's true. 
 - What?

241
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,200
- Really? 
 - What? Yeah.

242
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,030
That's how it turned out.

243
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,270
Dad sent me a text saying he persuaded my mom.

244
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,650
Sorry. It turned into a party for nothing.

245
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,700
â™« I wonder about every single thing about you  â™«

246
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,730
Well, then... Today was the farewell party. Let's have a "cancel the farewell" party tomorrow!

247
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,420
Okay!

248
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,750
What "okay"? Is this your house?

249
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,930
You'll be staying here, then?

250
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,090
Yes. Sorry for making you worry over nothing.

251
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,060
It's okay. It's a relief you don't have to go through that trouble.

252
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,080
Of course! Now nothing will pull us away from each other.

253
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,020
We'll only be getting closer.

254
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,990
If we get married, we'll be living in the same house. How many kids shouldâ€”

255
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,560
You need to learn when is the appropriate moment to stop.

256

So delicious. 
 â™« Pit a pat â™«

259
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,720
I couldn't say it, in the end.

â™« Like that, the painful season passes â™«

265
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,300
If I had been a bit more honest back then, maybe things wouldn't have ended up like this.

â™« So why is my season the only one that stays still?  â™«

269
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,650

00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:00,800
â™« I'm still the same 
 What am I expecting? â™«

271
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,990
â™« Am I still waiting, holding onto the lingering hope that youâ€™ll come back? â™«

276
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,180
My mom said I'd be seeing a ghost today. 

277
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,000
- What does your mom do? 
 - She's a psychic.

278
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,010
I want to go on a courage test. 

279
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,220
- What kind? 
 - Having to bring back a hidden object.

280
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,830
I'm most scared of the music room because of the story about the piano ghost. 

281
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,900
- Hey, hey!
 - Stay away a bit. 

282
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,540
Your boyfriend told me to guard you. 

283
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,050
- What's that? 
 - Gosh!

284
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,280
Ja Rim, what's wrong? Did you get attacked by a ghost? 

285
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,090
What's this? Who hasn't left yet?

286
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,150
What is it? 

287
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,260
But what about Min Ji?

288
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,220
