00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
- What am I doing? 
 - What are  you really doing?

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,330
What is it?

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,470
- Go. 
  - Why?  Is something wrong?

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,900
Don't worry about it.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,530
I heard about Ja Rim fighting with Gong Joo Yeong's ex-girlfriend.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,640
Because of them, you and I have had a hard time all the while, right?

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,450
Right.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,720
I was the one who did it all.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,380
Hey, what can you say you did? You were busy dating.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,460
What? Do you have a complaint?

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,690
Don't sneakily try to take credit.  It's my doing.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,010
- Where are you going? 
 - The bathroom.  Why?

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,250
Just that we're talking and you're suddenly leaving.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,300
Then, do you want me to do it while talking to you?

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,500
Please don't say that.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,410
Kaeng! Kaeng! Kaeng, Kaeng!

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,160
Kaeng. I have a favor to ask of you.

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,620
You're here too.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,390
I guess it's something I shouldn't hear.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,850
Anyway, I was leaving.

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,220
- What I'm asking is— 
 - Is it another surprise event?

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,190
What?  How did you know? I haven't told anyone. How can you?

24
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,670
The tone of your voice. It's different when it's to prepare an event than when it's for a game.

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,660
What event is it?

26
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,360
It's not her birthday. And it's past your 200 days.

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,300
Wow.  Do you remember all of our anniversaries?

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,830
You talk about them all the time.

29
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,920
You said "it's been 100 days" on your 100th day and the same thing on your 200th day.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,060
I bet no one knows what tomorrow is.

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,070
Because it's our very own special anniversary that I created myself.

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,830
When Ja Rim finds out, she is probably going to be so touched. Help me a little, please.

33
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,980
I don't want to! I'm not helping.  I have no intention to! Go back now!

34
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,120
- Where are you going? 
 - I don't want to. I have to pee!

 prince_rim @princess_0: Let's be happy

37
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,160
- Shall we take a picture together? This weekend. 
 - Why?

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,250
My cousin is opening a studio and needs to take pictures to display.

39
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,340
If I bring my friends, he'll take friendship pictures for us for free.

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,740
Then pictures of our faces will be hung there.

41
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,470
That's true. What's wrong with that? You're pretty. You should use your face.

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,480
I'll get him to take our ID pics for free too. We need it for our IDs anyway.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,990
My cousin is a damn good photographer.

44
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,860
Free ID pics is icing on the cake.

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,550
Oh, Min Di Min Di.  Let's take friendship pictures this weekend.

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,370
Jin Hui's cousin will take our pictures for free.

47
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,860
Really? Well, sure.

48
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,590
But, just among us?

49
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,640
Who else? Song Hae and Bae Ji?

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,510
No. I think Gong Joo Yeong would want to do it if he knew about it.

51
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,360
Oh, the boys too?  I'll ask in the group chat.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,820
Gong Joo Yeong will want to do it for sure.

53
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,190
I know. He'll go crazy about how it's practice for wedding photos and all.

54
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,760
Don't say something like that. He's really going to do that.

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,310
Yes! We're practicing wedding pictures for free! Yahoo!

56
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,100
How come you never do something different from what I expect?

57
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,490
I'm happy. Tomorrow we have a date.

58
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,590
The day after, a wedding picture. It's a perfect weekend.

59
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,500
It's not wedding pictures.  It's just a picture.

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,090
Why are you even more excited than usual?

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,950
Day of the Event

62
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,190
Sorry? It's already sold out?

63
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,860
Yes.  It's a very popular product.

64
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,330
I placed another order, but I'm not sure when it will come.

65
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,790
Yes, I understand.

66
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,230
This is bad news from the start.

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,200
- Yes? 
 - Hey. Where are you?

68
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,960
On the way to the internet cafe. Why?

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,810
Great! Ja Rim is near the waterside shopping center. I need you to be with her for ½ hour.

70
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,260
What? What are you doing?

71
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,640
It's been a mess from the start.

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,400
I was going to buy a cake but they are all sold, so I have to look elsewhere.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,310
Then tell Prince to come to where you are.

74
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,360
Are you nuts?  Then she will catch on to the event.

75
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,760
Damn. Why me? What about the other guys?

76
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,960
They're at my place, but I think both of them are asleep.

77
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,800
You're the only one who answered. Please, I don't have anyone else.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,700
Never mind.  Just tell her to wait.

79
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,390
Why should I be with her?  Is she a kid?

80
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,070
Time goes more slowly when you're made to wait alone. For sure, she will get mad.

81
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,400
You, you can play that game together. There's that game you both play.

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,550
Meet her and do that.

83
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,220
Where are you?  I'll get the cake.

84
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,160
You can't bring it with you anyway.

85
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,040
I'll just pay for it and go right away. I'll tell the others to bring it later.

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,830
All right.

87
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,450
Thanks. I'll be there right away.

88
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,220
Okay. I get it.

89
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm really sorry. Kyeong Woo will come to you. Stay with him for a little bit.

90
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,520
Huh?  Why Kyeong Woo?

91
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,720
All right for now.

92
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,090
I'll be right there.  I'm really sorry. Yeah.

93
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,820
Why did you come? You didn't have to come.

94
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,190
I was on my way to the internet cafe anyway.

95
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,060
Then go. I'll be fine alone.

96
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,350
No ... well ...

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,260
Aren't you thirsty?

98
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,230
That punk ... what the hell is he doing?

99
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,560
What? He prepared something again, right?

100
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,160
No ... I meant, what is he doing that's taking so long?

101
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,390
How many days has it been for you two?

102
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,230
It's 244 days.

103
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,930
It's been a long time. It feels like it was just yesterday he grabbed you by the collar on the bus.

104
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,330
You sound like you saw it.

105
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,790
What the?  I was there too. You didn't know?

106
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,700
I didn't.

107
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,680
Is it that you have poor memory, or ...

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,750
that you only had eyes for him since back then?

109
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,720
It would have been nice if I'd liked him since back then.

110
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,190
Right. That's true.

111
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,620
Are you going to take those pictures? What we talked about in the chat group?

112
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,160
Yes.  Aren't you going to do it?

113
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,760
It would be better to leave me out.

114
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,280
What are you saying?

115
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,230
Never mind.

116
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,900
It's time for him to arrive. I'm off.

117
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,990
Bye.

118
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,740
Darling, I'm so sorry.

119
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,770
It's okay.  Why did you run?

120
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,000
No.

121
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,390
If we're going to see a movie, we should eat now. Shall we go?

122
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,140
Okay.

123
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,980
What about Kyeong Woo?  Didn't he come?

124
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,730
- He just left.  
 - He grumbled a lot, I'm sure.

125
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll make today a perfect day to make up for being late.

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,900
The first course is a famous restaurant I've found in my research.

127
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,890
This place doesn't accept reservations and—

128
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,930
- But it's closed. 
 - What?

129
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,290
We are temporarily closed due to interior renovations. See you next week!

130
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,260
It can't be helped.

131
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,490
Are there good places to eat around here?

132
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,610
There's another place I've found. Wait. There's one 20 minutes away.

133
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,990
Twenty minutes to get there? It's tricky if we want to be on time for the movie.

134
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,990
Shall we just eat what is sold at the movie?

135
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,840
But I wanted you to have something nice to eat.

136
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,120
We can eat that next time. Let's go.

137
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Of all days, why is this happening today?

138
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,000
When did I fall asleep?

139
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,360
Dude, wake up!

140
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,060
- Do we have to go out now? 
 - No.  Not yet.

141
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,390
What the hell are we doing?

142
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,670
I'm spending my precious weekend helping Gong Joo Yeong for his surprise event.

143
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,150
So what did you have planned, sweetie?

144
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,730
Don't call me "sweetie."  It's disgusting.

145
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,790
I guess the movie isn't over yet.

146
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,270
He told us to pick up the cake later.

147
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,760
Then we have time for one round before we go.

148
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,540
The person in front was annoying.  Did he come for the movie or to use his phone?

149
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,960
That's true. But the movie was fun.

150
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,100
I'm sorry.  I should have chosen better seats.

151
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,600
For what? The seats were fine. We were just unlucky with the person in front of us.

152
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,640
I just keep having the worst luck.  Why do these things keep happening?

153
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,210
 Even so, that much should go well at least ...

154
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,130
- They're coming down, hurry up! 
 - Be quiet!

155
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,030
- You're distracting me! 
 - Now! 
 New message from Gong Joo

156
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,330
- Go now! 
 - Be quiet!  
 New message from Gong Joo

157
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,270
Hey. It's time.  It's H-hour.

158
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,450
You should have listened!

159
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,500
Why haven't they come yet?  I told them over and over...

160
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,520
Get ready when I text you around 4:30! 
 - Okay.

161
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,340
Hey. It's time. It's H-hour. 

162
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,490
What are you doing? Hey. Hello? Reply, you nutcases. 

163
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,560
Save me 
 (T/N: all the messages show as unread)

164
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,750
- Sweetie. I have to go to the bathroom. 
 - Sure.

165
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,810
Something must not be going according to plan again. 

166
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,020
You can get a penta kill here. Do a penta, go!

167
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,990
- That was so close!  
 - You couldn't even do that?

168
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,660
He's calling.

169
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,970
- It's already that late? 
 - Yeah.

170
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,130
Joo Yeong, we're on our way.

171
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,590
What are you doing? The movie ended long ago. Don't you check your texts?

172
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,170
We're almost there.

173
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,650
- Where are you guys, honestly? 
 - Well...

174
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,800
Your place?

175
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,230
Today has already been ruined. Come on, please help me.

176
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,540
Got it, dude. We're setting off.

177
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,030
Let's go.

178
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,380
Gosh, and we still have to get that cake.

179
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,390
Hello?

180
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,120
- You're done? 
 - Yes.

181
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,580
- Then let's go now. 
 - Yeah. What?

182
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,790
- Where are we going? 
 - Follow me for now.

183
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,750
Let's take that bus.

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,030
Follow this bus. 

185
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,180
"This is a bus."

186
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,480
If you shake that, you're dead. 

187
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,040
A stomach earthquake? "I'm hungry to death"?

188
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:58,340
Take a taxi. I'll give you the fare. 

189
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,460
He says to follow him and he'll pay us back the taxi fare.

190
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,760
Darling, I'm sorry.

191
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,630
All my plans fell through and today was ruined.

192
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:31,350
What do you mean, ruined? It's only the beginning.

193
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,560
What? Beginning of what?

194
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,740
You idiot. Why do you think we came here?

195
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,620
Huh? Weren't we going home?

196
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,930
This is where we first met.

197
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,600
- What became of your habit to attach meaning to everything? 
 - What?

198
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,440
Actually, I... 
 [To him, they first met in front of his place when he moved in.]

199
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,190
I guess if I tell her, it'll completely destroy the mood.  
 [To him, they first met in front of his place when he moved in.]

200
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,600
Close your eyes.

201
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,160
Open your eyes.

202
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,820
It's a present for our 244th day.

203
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,860
This wasn't part of your plan either, right?

204
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,840
You also knew?

205
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,750
I couldn't figure out why, but you wrote it all over your profile.

206
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,070
♥︎♥︎♥︎ D-Day ♥︎♥︎♥︎ Our very own anniversary ♥︎♥︎♥︎♥︎

207
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,460
Teehee.

208
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,690
I thought you would've prepared something again, so I did something too.

209
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,260
So what is special about our 244th day?

210
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,560
The first time I met you, we took bus 244 together.

211
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,760
You really go beyond anything I can imagine.

212
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,280
- What are you doing, Lee Kaeng? 
 - Can we go now? When they're like this?

213
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,960
This fool can't catch the right timing! What is he doing?

214
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,070
Ja Rim. Thank you so much. I'm super touched.

215
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,400
I would never have imagined you would have prepared something like—

216
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,370
What's that?

217
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,200
This is something I p-prepared.

218
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,590
I told you not to come!

219
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,240
Enjoy your time together!

220
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm the idiot for asking them to do that.

221
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,750
It's been shaken.

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,770
This is...

223
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,610
Take them following the numbers on them.

224
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,890
In March, the day I first met you, you were so pretty when you paid for my bus fare that I fell for you. 

225
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:45,360
In March, the day I first met you, you were so pretty when you paid for my bus fare that I fell for you. 

226
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,290
In April, at the school retreat, I practiced dancing and sang a song to make a good impression on you. 

227
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,940
In May, I finally confessed to you and it was a big mess.

228
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,120
But we started to date and I was so happy.

229
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,040
In June, because of my foolish mistake, we fought. 

230
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,760
In July, we went on a trip together for the first time and I talked nonsense after getting drunk. 

231
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,840
In August, I got to know you better and I was happy I could comfort you. 

232
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,430
In September, I was really touched by your heartfelt efforts to make me a delicious lunch. 

233
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:25,600
And in October, we had our unforgettable first kiss. 

234
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,420
I was extremely happy and I will continue to love you very much in the future. 

235
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,520
I love you, Ja Rim. 

236
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,910
♫ Then it will always be paradise  ♫

237
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,390
♫ My dear ♫

238
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,540
I think we must really be a match made in heaven.

239
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,750
I prepared a silver ring. It's a set!

240
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,500
♫ You are my one and only ♫

241
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,960
Darling, why are you crying?

242
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,390
I'm not.

243
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,860
♫ Are you all right?  ♫

244
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,890
Thank you. 
 ♫ How are we? ♫

245
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:08,480
♫ I know this above anything else:  ♫

246
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,570
If you're thankful, give me a peck. 
 ♫ I love you ♫

247
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,190
A peck, come on.

248
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,970
♫ I love you ♫

249
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,560
How the heck can I do that here? 
 ♫ I will be able to say it now ♫

250
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,810
- One more time, one more time. 
 - Stop it.

251
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:32,120
Okay. From today on, it's one kiss a day. It's an obligation.

252
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,380
Why would I?

253
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,320
Not you. I'm the one who'll do it.

254
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,690
I don't want to. From today on, it's zero kisses a day. It's an obligation.

255
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,360
I'm going to do it anyway.

256
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,830
I love you, darling.

257
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,200
Thank you to the entire Teenage Love Team @ Viki.com

258
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,840
Who is it?

259
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,800
Who told you to suddenly appear behind me?

260
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,270
Hey. Are you okay?

261
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,930
Go away.

262
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,350
- Do you like me, Ja Rim? 
 - No.

263
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,690
Then I guess you love me?

264
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,950
You're so shy.

265
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,300
Thank you to Channel Manager: Klore6

266
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:38,100
Hey! Look at this, a couple ring and a couple necklace. Aren't you envious?

267
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,890
People would think you've been dating for years.

268
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,490
With your couple ring, couple necklace and idiotic nonsense.

269
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,570
That's true. There's someone else who has been dating for a few years.

270
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,580
- The homeroom teacher is coming!  
 - He's here, you punk!

271
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,170
Why do I smell class 2 here? Come out.

272
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,240
Sh*t, he scared me!

273
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,390
There's one more.

274
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,950
I apologize.
