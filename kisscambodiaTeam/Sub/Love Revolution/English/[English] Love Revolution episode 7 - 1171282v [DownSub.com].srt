00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,360
Okay, okay!

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,780
Okay! Okay!

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,490
I got it, I got it!

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,800
What? What?

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,320
- Oh, sh*t. 
 - Give it back.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,030
Here, here! Give it to me.

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,120
Wait, wait!

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,930
Ja Rim... We'll reveal it in two week—

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,430
What the? She said, "Let's date."

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,490
Let's date then.

00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,640
Your house isn't on fire.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,650
What's on fire... is my heart!

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,200
Go away!

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,620
Why?

16
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,580
Ja Rim, thank you so much.

17
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,170
I'm sleeping.

18
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,630
Okay, I promise I'll do well!

19
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,660
Good night.

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,660
Wang Ja-nim  ("Respected prince")

21
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,200
Wang Darling. 
(T/N: Play on words with the name "Wang Ja Rim".  Ja Gi = Darling)

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,190
Wang Darling

23
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,790
I'm dating now.

24
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,240
Really? First of all, congratulations!

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,450
Don't congratulate me.

26
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,420
Who knows when we'll break up.

27
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,220
Gee, why are you thinking like that?

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't tell me you're dating him because you felt forced?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,180
I don't know.

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,940
Things have blown up.

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,490
Why? Gong Joo Yeong is a pretty nice guy.

32
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,940
Other than the fact that he overreacts.

33
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,970
We'll see.

34
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,840
Anyway, since you've decided to date, try to get along well.

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm not sure.

36
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,120
My heart is fluttering, I can't sleep!

 glasses @princess_0: Then I'd be the top student.

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,270
Darling...

40
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,290
Don't call me like that.

41
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,320
Can... I hold your hand?

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,660
You may not.

43
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,920
Then...

44
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,760
I'll put my arm around your shoulder.

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,300
Hey.

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
I'll go to school by myself starting tomorrow.

47
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,370
We have exams next week. Are you getting along with your studies?

48
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,250
I want to get along with them, but my studies hate me.

49
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,120
Hey, should I teach you?

50
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,040
You always got hit because of your report cards in middle school. Where is that confidence coming from?

51
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,190
I was still building up my energy back then!

52
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,260
Don't you know what a ki blast is?

53
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,400
I'll show you how I crush the whole school in one blow.

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,750
What ki blast takes a year to build up?

55
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,250
But where is that punk, Gong Joo Yeong?

56
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,630
Where else could he be?

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,310
Is this an exhibition or something? He keeps coming to admire her at every break time.

58
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,940
I think we can even start accepting admission fees.

59
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,740
I knew this would happen.

60
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,970
You guys look good together!

61
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,090
Hey. Stop staring at me.

62
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,150
The more I look at you, the more I want to keep looking.

63
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,060
Can I hold your hand?

64
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,560
No.

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
We're dating, but I can't even hold your hand?

66
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,090
Is there a rule that you have to hold hands when you're dating?

67
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,230
That's true. Then, should we hold hands when we go on a date?

68
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,560
Ta-da!

69
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,210
This is our dating schedule.

70
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,360
For now, let's have six dates a week. Four hours on weekdays and eight hours on weekends.

71
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,170
In total—

72
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,370
Are you crazy? Who goes on dates every day?

73
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,020
Don't you know we have exams next week?

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,660
Right.

75
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,530
Then, we'll go on dates after the exams.

76
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,360
We'll see.

77
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,390
I thought things would be different now that we're dating.

78
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,520
From the look of things, it's more like you got scammed rather than you're dating.

79
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,400
Don't make jokes. I'm being serious.

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,190
But to put it bluntly, it was hilarious. Wang Ja Rim is pretty impressive.

81
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,860
She's consistent.

82
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,120
If that's how it's going to be, why did she say yes?

83
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,670
No, it's just because it's still a bit awkward.

84
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,430
If we spend a little more time together...

85
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,440
Anything, then?

86
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,160
Ja Rim!

87
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,030
Ja Rim!

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,150
We're going to the library to study.

89
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,110
What? Us?

90
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,650
Yeah. We said so earlier.

91
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,340
Studying happens at the library, of course.

92
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,440
Don't just play around there.

93
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,550
Then, if I get an average over 60 this time, we get to hold hands, okay?

94
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,520
Why are you setting the conditions yourself? Plus, what's so impressive about 60?

95
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,530
How bad are your grades exactly?

96
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,120
That's why I'm going to the library!

97
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,390
If I go to the library, I'll be able to concentrate,

98
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,660
and there are a lot of books there.

99
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,860
Ja Rim, let's go study at the library too.

100
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,500
Why? I thought we're going to your house to study.

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,600
If we go to my house, we might just end up watching TV.

102
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,320
Right?

103
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,960
Yeah. Let's go to the library.

104
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,440
♫ Friend, what are you doing? I’m curious. What do you like? I’m curious  ♫

105
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,360
♫ I wonder about every single thing about you ♫

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,000
♫ May I ask? May I approach you? ♫

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,590
♫ I keep on getting excited ♫

108
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,550
♫ All day long, seeing you and your smile puts me on a roller coaster ♫

109
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,220
♫ My mood goes up then down, on a roller-coaster ♫

110
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,090
Hey, aren't you going to study?

111
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,980
Stop staring me and look at your textbook.

112
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,210
I am studying.

113
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,250
Studying you.

114
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,430
The Law of Ja Rim.

115
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,080
Don't go too far.

116
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,220
Hey, where did all the other kids go?

117
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,700
♫ As you wish, as you wish, la ♫

118
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,240
Do we have to go this far for them?

119
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,860
I thought you were pushing them together too?

120
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,580
If they decided to date, it's done. What more is there to do?

121
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,060
They need to share the same feelings for it to be done.

122
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,200
Wang Ja doesn't even like him. Why did she agree to date him?

123
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,170
Rather than saying she doesn't like him, it's just complicated.

124
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,940
Does Wang Ja Rim even want a boyfriend?

125
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,000
She seems completely indifferent to dating.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,950
That's not true. She wasn't always like that.

127
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,260
She wanted a boyfriend, too.

128
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,190
Wang Ja wanted a boyfriend?

129
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,330
What? Then why is she acting like this now?

130
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,020
I don't know.

131
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,000
- Ja Rim, Ja Rim, look at this. 
 - Damn it.

132
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,230
What about it?

133
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:52,290
I feel like you're even colder to me after we began dating.

134
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,460
I was always like this.

135
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,160
So, you don't like it?

136
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,760
No. I'm going to turn you into a total cutie monster.

137
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,210
That's never going to happen.

138
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,480
Just wait. I'm going to be super good to you.

139
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,680
I'll just make you melt softly.

140
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,810
Do you like me that much?

141
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,450
Yeah. Extremely.

142
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,730
How long do you think that'll last?

143
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,720
Forever.

144
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,370
Don't say that so easily. People change.

145
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,580
Then you can change, too. Into a cutie monster.

146
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,690
I'm an exception.

147
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,850
Then I won't change, either.

148
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,970
I'm not saying this carelessly. I'm going to like you forever.

149
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,260
You laughed. Thanks.

150
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,430
I was scoffing.

151
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,540
That's still laughter.

152
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,200
Can you laugh one more time?

153
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,000
Stop following me. I'm going to go to the bathroom too.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,550
I want to buy a drink, too.

155
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,430
Here. Drink this, and good luck!

156
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,400
I'm already hungry from dancing.

157
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,280
Where were you two?

158
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,570
You said you wanted to study.

159
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,160
We're going to start now.

160
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,400
How was your library date?

161
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,620
Stop it, already. Why are you two like that, too?

162
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,850
I'll deal with him on my own.

163
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,080
Here, drink.

164
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,780
No.

165
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,960
Oh my goodness, Oh Piggy turned down food?

166
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,190
Gong Joo Yeong gave it to you.

167
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,880
If you don't like him, it's not too late to break up with him now.

168
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,750
What are you doing when you agreed to date him?

169
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,020
Hey, Ah Rong.

170
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,920
I don't dislike Gong Joo Yeong.

171
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
Then?

172
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,610
Hey, that trash is different from Gong Joo Yeong.

173
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
I don't know.

174
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,300
Exam Day

175
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,800
Could I get another answer sheet?

176
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,540
Ja Rim  00:12:55,490
You have ten minutes left.

Ja Rim, let's go on a date since exams are over.

181
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,580
- I already made plans. 
 - What?

182
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,380
What plans?

183
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,030
We're going to karaoke together.

184
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,360
That sounds fun. I can just go with you guys then!

185
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,450
Why? Someone who doesn't know you is coming too.

186
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,220
Even more reason I should come. You can introduce your boyfriend.

187
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,070
Right?

188
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,660

 - Here you go.

195
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,410
This is my treat.

196
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,080
Hey, Joo Yeong is a really great guy. You two get married.

197
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,860
Shut up.

198
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,930
This is my friend from middle school, Bae Ji Yeon.

199
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,030
Hi. I go to Yeokdong High School.

200

- Hi. 
 - Hi.

201
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,890
I'm Gong Joo Yeong, Ja Rim's boyfriend.

202
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,030
I know. Hey, he's much cuter in person!

203
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,370
- Another one. 
 - I don't know that one. 
  - This one then.

His name is Kyeong Woo, right? How come he's so handsome?

213
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,250
What? You like that type of guy?

He does look good.

215
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,450
But those bangs of his are a bit...

216
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,270
- I know, right? 
 - Hey.

217
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,580
Should we move it out of the way?

218
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,720
- I'm so curious. 
 - Let's do it.

219
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,750
You do it.

220
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,950
- Me? 
 - You do it.

221
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,000
You go and just, like that, casually.

222
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,430

'We Fell In Love' - Ga In & Jo Kwon

227
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,370
Ta-da!

228
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,150
What's this? I don't want to.

229
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,780
Why? Let's sing it together.

230
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,020
I told you no.

231
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,780
You still have a lot of time left in this room.

232
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,880
- Where were you? 
 - In room 7.

233
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,290
- With the guys from class 2. 
 - Hey!

234
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,490
You can do it, go.

235
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,570
- Don't you have a mic for me? 
 - Nope.

236
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,560
- Why? 
 - I don't want to listen to your voice.

237
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,510
Ugh, your breath smells.

238
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,820
So close!

239
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,080
He's like an insurmountable fortress.

240
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,370
I'll go to the bathroom. Think of some ideas.

241
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,850
Okay.

242
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,250
- Hey. 
 - What?

243
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,020
You don't know I'm being patient with you all this time, do you?

244
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,730
Happy now? F***, you really can't take a hint.

245
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,360
That was so funny!

246
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,870
Something's wrong. Should be a hundred points.

247
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,040
Come here.

248
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,860
- You're embarrassed, aren't you? 
 - Min Ji!

249
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,390
Seriously.

250
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,860
- Again, again. I'll do another one. 
 - Hey.

251
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,320
It's weird, the machine is strange.

252
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,360
Hey. I have a super awesome idea to do it in one strike.

253
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,810
Let's stop, it's no fun.

254
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,970
Why?

255
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,360
Just. Let's stop.

256
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,790
If we go down—

257
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,160
Shut up. Shut up!

258
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,860
Hey, let's go to an internet cafe.

259
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,720
- And Joo Yeong? 
 - Let's go.

260
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,590
Let's just go. Hurry up.

261
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,560
- Hey, let's go to Olive Young. (T/N: Cosmetics chain)  
 - All of a sudden?

262
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,880
Wait, what about me?

263
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,370
What should we do?

264
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,200

283

It took me so much effort to start dating. 

284

You should make up now. He was wrong.

You weren't waiting for that, were you? 

286
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,860
