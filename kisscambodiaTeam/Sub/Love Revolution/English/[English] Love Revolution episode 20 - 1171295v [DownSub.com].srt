00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,740
- See you after class. 
 - Study hard.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,770
Right back at you.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,250
I guess they are finally dating.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,790
If he was going to be like that, then why did he play hard to get at first?

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,500
Don't talk behind people's backs first thing in the morning.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,730
Well, it's because Ye Seul is totally out of your league.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,170
- Congrats on getting a girlfriend. 
- Thanks.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,800
You guys also should do something that is worth congratulating.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,720
I'll put my heart and soul into giving you congratulations then.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,670
What the hell? Annoying first thing in the morning.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,470
Wait and see. I'll receive your congratulations with all my heart and soul.

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,460
Hey Lee Kyeong Woo! I have something that is worth congratulating.

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,520
Oh really? Did you get a boyfriend?

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,840
Yeah. A boyish friend. Whom I'll beat up now.

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,440
Jerk.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,570
The midterm exams are coming up. You must be very worried.

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,800
You need to avoid your class getting last place at all costs, this time.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,550
I don't want to judge my students based on their grades only.

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,320
Education should aim to be well-rounded.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
Yes, that's true. What you're saying is right.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,020
It would be great if the principal had the same outlook as you.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,130
I'm worried about what he'll say if you come in last again.

24
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,050
You are already worrying like this. You will be embarrassed if our class's average increases.

25
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:16,080
That won't be something to be embarrassed about. It will be something to congratulate.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,450
Look, Teacher. For these midterms,

27
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,550
what about the teacher of the class with the lowest average treats the other to pizza?

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,940
Do you guys know that it is exam time? Are you guys studying properly?

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,270
No.

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,290
And do you know how severe our class' average is?

31
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,810
We don't know.

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,790
How would you feel if we place last again?

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,580
Comfort from finding our place.

34
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,000
I wonder if you know that you'll have to take after-class study if you come last again on these midterms.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,030
What?!

36
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,250
- After-school study?!  
 - This is not right!! 
 - No way!

37
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,920
No sir, no sir.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,140
Do you know who plays the biggest part in smashing our class average to the ground?

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,560
I am sorry, I was in the restroom.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,500
He's come. He's here.

41
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,690
The punk who pinned our class average to the ground.

42
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,840
Let me make you a proposition.

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,080
If that brat raises his average to 70,

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,940
even if you place last, you are all exempted from after-class study. Okay?

45
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,940
Get ready for class.

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,010
Gosh, we're doomed!

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,670
And he's sleeping again!

Love Revolution: When Kyeong Woo studies 
 Episode 20. #Full-blown #NoAfterClassStudy #Project

49
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,000
glasses @kyungwoo: Use the time you write this stuff to study instead

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,690
What should I do now? Should I drop out?

51
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,940
Friend. Don't despair. Let's all gather at room 101 and study together.

52
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,360
Hey, but that's my place.

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,150
- I am going to the library with Ja Rim today— 
- We know the password, do you think we don't even know that?

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,840
- Yeah, but it's my hous— 
- Lee Kyeong Woo, you are going to study with us right?

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,630
What are you saying? You guys study hard yourselves.

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,850
It's because if it doesn't go well, our whole class will have to attend after-class study.

57
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,580
Right! You absolutely can't have after-class study.

58
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,150
Then there'll only be the weekends for Ja Rim and me to go on dates.

59
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,720
Lee Kyeong Woo, you need to study no matter what.

60
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,340
Friend, don't worry.

61
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,840
For the happy future of our class, I brought a tutor.

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,650
The most sought-after tutor of Yisam Information High School, Kim Byeong Hoon!

63
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,880
Hey! Who do you want to teach? Aren't your and Lee Kyeong Woo's grades almost the same?

64
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,740
How can you say such an upsetting thing? My average on the last finals was no less than 75!

65
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,240
Oh really? It's totally unexpected.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,520
Yeah! Then you guys can study hard and increase the class grade average.

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,900
Then I am going to meet Ye Seul.

68
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,520
Don't worry. I explained everything to Ye Seul. She wants us to make sure you study.

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,760
She also won't like you having night study.

70
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,170
Okay. Then let's all go to Joo Yeong's house and you guys can learn from me.

71
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,710
I am not looking down on you, but can we really get tutored by a guy who got 75 marks?

72
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,850
Don't worry. I recruited a real top student for us.

73
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,920
I should call him over to my home. You're eager to know, aren't you?

74
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,490
- The top student was Jeong Sang Hoon? 
 - Yup.

75
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,120
Hey! Do you really study well?

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,250
Well... yeah a bit.

77
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,270
This person lives in a totally different world from you guys.

78
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,420
He's one of the top ten students at Mowon High, the most prestigious school in the area.

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,060
He's basically a future Seoul National University student.

80
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,560
It is impressive, but why are you the one bragging?

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,510
Because he is my friend.

82
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,480
And he could become someone's boyfriend.

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,720
Hey, hey! Let's start studying.

84
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm going to tutor you according to your level. Should we start with multiplication? Three times six is?

85
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,800
Eighteen! Am I a kindergartener? You think I don't even know the multiplication tables?

86
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,740
Okay, so you know the basics. We'll get into algebraic identities right away.

87
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,930
The simplest and most used algebraic identity is '(a + b) squared.'

88
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,880
When you resolve it, you get 'a squared + 2ab + b squared.' You got it?

89
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,450
No.

90
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,550
Okay, don't try to understand, just memorize.

91
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,710
You solved it well until now. For the next problem, you need to use an application.

92
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,290
Try to put it into the formula and solve it.

93
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,790
I'll let you know if there's any mistake in how you solve the problem.

94
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,190
Ooh! Jeong Sang Hoon, are you tutoring Yang Min Ji one-on-one?

95
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,560
No, it's just that Min Ji makes the fastest progress.

96
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,750
Don't pay attention to others, and focus on your own studying.

97
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,530
Should I also learn from Sang Hoon? He's being darn nice.

98
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,940
Hey! You're not on the level to learn from Sang Hoon. Just learn from me.

99
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,670
- Dammit. 
 - Next is the quadratic formula.

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,460
I freaking don't want to study. Aren't you guys hungry?

101
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,210
Yeah! Honestly a bit.

102
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,190
- Right?
 - Yeah.

103
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,400
Then shall I make a night snack?

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,140
No! Uhm, j-just study. You have exams too, so you should concentrate.

105
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,540
- Yeah. 
 - Right, let's all pitch in and order delivery.

106
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,640
- Yeah, sure! Delivery! 
 - Delivery.

107
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,040
What a waste of money. Why order delivery? I'll cook. What's in the fridge?

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,830
No. Well... I didn't do any grocery shopping, so there's nothing in the fridge...

109
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,320
It's full, though?

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,460
Did my mom come or something?

111
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,780
Be honest. You're being like this because my cooking doesn't taste good, right?

112
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,950
No. If it is you who made it, I could even eat a rock.

113
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,660
Ja Rim, do you know how to make braised spicy chicken? There's chicken in the fridge.

114
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,930
Yes, I make a decent one. It won't take long. You guys keep studying.

115
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,480
Okay! Cutting up a chicken is difficult, so I'll help you. Hey, you can only improve if you cook more, you know.

116
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,400
You should've stopped her! Are you going to eat it all?

117
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,430
I stopped her but she said she would cook. It's because you said you were hungry!

118
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,050
But she said she makes braised spicy chicken well. Maybe we should trust her. Plus, Ah Rong is helping her.

119
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,880
She just said she's helping with the cutting.

120
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,060
Wow, that smells amazing.

121
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,740
Hey, I... think I have to go to the washroom.

122
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,200
Oh, I also have to go and wash my hands before eating.

123
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,870
Oh, right, my mom told me to call her. I totally forgot.

124
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,330
Wow, the soup tastes great too. It makes me want to eat a ton!

125
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,330
The meat is super fleshy too. Wang Ja Rim sure can cook!

126
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,020
It's really delicious.

127
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,930
Even Jeong Sang Hoon said that? Could it really be tasty?

128
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,710
Seriously... Does she really make good braised spicy chicken?

129
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,950
Why aren't you guys eating? Hurry and come to eat.

130
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,030
- Oh, okay. 
 - Yeah, sure.

131
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,430
- Yeah, we should eat. 
 - Of course.

132
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,760
I think it really turned out well this time.

133
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,500
Yeah, totally.

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,720
So tasty. We have to clear everything.

135
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,310
Gong Joo, open up.

136
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,780
You should eat some too.

137
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,450
This is really delicious!

138
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm going first because I'm late for the gym training.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,620
- Have a safe trip there! 
 - Bye!

140
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,370
- We're leaving too. 
 - Kyeong Woo, go over what you learned today before sleeping.

141
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,750
Hey, the fate of our whole class depends on your brain.

142
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,500
- Adios. 
 - Go, leave.

143
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,810
I'm leaving too. Sang Hoon, you're good at teaching. Thanks for today.

144
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,310
No problem. I also got to study thanks to you, so it was good.

145
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,110
Sang Hoon, you should take her home.

146
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,850
- Should I take you home? 
 - Then shall we go to the station together?

147
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,160
Let's go.

148
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,040
Should we go too?

149
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,900
- I'm going to the internet cafe. 
 - What about studying?

150
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,660
- I can't. My brain is overloaded, it'll explode.
 - True. You did all your life's worth of studying.

151
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,860
By the way, don't wait up for me to go to school tomorrow. Just go ahead first.

152
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,700
- Why? We should go together. 
 - Are you planning to go with Ye Seul?

153
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,400
Sure. I'm leaving now.

154
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,670
- See you. 
 - See you.

155
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,500
Whose is this?

156
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,400
- It's mine. They're questions that may possibly appear on the exam. Make sure you look at them. 
 - Why should I?

157
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,980
Kyeong Woo, I summarized the key points of Korean class. Want to copy it? No wait, I'll copy it for you.

158
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,740
Do you know the scope of our English exam? Should I tell you?

159
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,090
That's okay, I'll figure it out myself.

160
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,920
Hey, Kyeong Woo, you haven't memorized the chemical symbols yet, have you? I'll teach you an easy memorization method.

161

Always Cause Silliness."

163
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,760
What do you think? Easy, right? Try memorizing it like that.

164
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,430
- What the hell are you guys doing? 
 - Where are you going?

165
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,050
- But it's simple! 
 - Hey!

166
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,720
For English, you just have to memorize the vocabulary.

167
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,100
Hwang Jin Yi's poem, "Long November Night," goes, "Lain under the blanket warm as the spring breeze..."

168
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,490
When you have two letters, if you look at the transformation of the algebraic identity...

169
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,060
Why are you guys following me? I don't know any of this stuff!

170
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,060
If you don't know, then you should learn. You just have to open up your ears.

171
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,880
- Just be quiet!
 - No...

172
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,750
- Listen! 
 - The formula...

173
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,450
The bell for class is going to ring soon.

174
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,490
I have a headache, so don't talk to me.

175
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,720
Then let me tell you an interesting story. Listen as you rest.

176
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,900
After all, history is like a story. History. The main work of art of the Unified Silla—

177
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,060
Why are you like this too?

178
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,170
Your grades have to go up so that Ja Rim won't get after-class study. Then, I won't need to wait until she's done.

179
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,110
If your grades improve, you'll make your mother proud. Ja Rim won't have after-class study, so we'll both be happy.

180
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,510
Is that not killing two birds with one stone? Right. While we're at it, let's memorize four-character idioms too.

181
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,900
Similar to idioms like "killing two birds with one stone," include "best of both worlds," "killing two birds with one arrow"...

182
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,610
Please stop! Please!

183
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,220
Please is spelt "p-l-e-a-s-e" in English.

184
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,090
- Stop. 
 - Stop is "s-t-o-p" in English.

185
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,200
Stop please, you son of a gun!

186
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,820
Translation unavailable.

187
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,900
Every time I went to your class during break, you weren't there. Where did you go?

188
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,620
I hid to avoid everyone. They try to get me to study whenever they see me. I feel like I'm going to die.

189
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,400
Our little sweetie is having a hard time because of his friends?

190
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,040
I have to vent this out. Shall we go and sing karaoke?

191
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,740
- Shall we? 
 - Yeah, let's go.

192
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,890
What the heck? Why are you guys here?

193
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,460
Could it be...

194
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,120
Sorry, Kyeong Woo. This is better than playing now and ending up having after-class study.

195
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,390
What will I do if you have after-class study?

196
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,470
What are you guys doing? Let go!

197
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,080
- I said to let go! 
 - We're arresting you on the scene. Karaoke and internet cafes are off limits to you during the exam period.

198
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,530
Who do you think you are? It's my freedom whether I want to play or not!

199
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,720
Do you think it's okay if the whole class suffers because of you?

200
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,220
That's why you guys should be studying! Hey, Bang Ye Seul, seriously!

201
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,740
Hey, you! Seriously...

202
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,650
- At this point, you should give up and study. 
- What?

203
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,240
Taking into consideration the effort they put in, shouldn't you at least pretend to study?

204
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,190
Keep resisting and you'll strain your friendships. If it still doesn't work after all this, we'll blame your brain.

205
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,680
- Do you want to die?
 - Okay everyone, don't get worked up, and let's study.

206
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,900
Since we did math last time, let's do English this time.

207
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,270
Ok. Hmm.

208
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,690
Excuse me sir, how can I get to Changdeok-gung Palace?

209
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,300
How can I go to Changdeok Palace?

210
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,450
Hmmm. Let me see, take line number 1 and go for three stops.

211
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,790
Let me see, take line number 1 and go for three stops.

212
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,700
Thank you for being nice to me.

213
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,090
Thank you for being nice to me.

 Math (9:00-9:50) / Science (10:00-10:50) / English (11:00-11:50)

215
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,950
Pass it back.

216
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,020
Lee Kyeong Woo. Show me your test sheet so we can check our answers.

217
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,470
There's nothing to even check. Lee Kyeong Woo, you put answer 1 for everything and slept, didn't you?

218
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,150
We taught you so diligently. How can you do this?

219
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,360
I don't know the answers!

220
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,190
We taught you everything! What's the binomial identity?

221
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:15,390
(a + b) squared gives a squared + 2ab + b squared.

222
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,380
So you know it! So what was the answer to question 1?

223
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,560
I think he memorized the formula, but couldn't apply it.

224
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,700
- You didn't teach him how to use the formula? 
 - Ah right, application.

225
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,170
Dammit, I only made him memorize them. What do we do?

226
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,070
You buffoon, so this is your fault. How do you expect him to apply it, with that brain of his?

227
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,270
Let's just let it go and assume we'll get after-class study. Teaching my puppy at home would be more worth it.

228
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,520
Are you going to say whatever you want when I'm in front of you?

229
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,780
No. I invested so many hours in him.

230
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,750
Our Kyeong Woo can do well. You just have to do well from now on, so let's go over the questions quickly.

231
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,960
Ah, please, let's stop this. Please.

Little Nasty Kids Behind Maggie’s Backseat

234
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,420
Always Cause Silliness.

235
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,910
Silliness.

236

How can I get to Changdeok-gung Palace?

238
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,300
Hmmm. Let me see, take line number 1 and go for three stops.

239
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,230
Thank you for being nice to me.

240
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,290
One week later.

241
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,400
Teacher Jo of class 3 is buying, so eat as much as you want.

242
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,330
- Yay. 
- Yahoo.

243
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:14,400
Once you're done eating, the ones who played around with the short-answer question in math,

244
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,850
number 3, number 8, number 11, number 16, and number 19. Come to the teacher's room.

245
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,070
The midterm results are out.

246
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,220
What's this? I'm the one who had to buy pizza for the other class, so why are you the ones looking like you're in mourning?

247
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,700
We all know how Lee Kyeong Woo took the exam, that's why.

248
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,870
From when are we going to have night study, sir? Till what time will it be sir?

249
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,790
No. Lee Kyeong Woo's grades increased a lot.

250
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,710
The guy who usually gets a 30 point average got 60 points.

251
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,300
Looks like you guys helped a lot.

252
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,710
But not only did Lee Kyeong Woo improve, you all have increased your grades as a whole,

253
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,800
so in these midterms, our class got no less than...

254
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,840
third place in the entire first-year grade.

255
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,230
Wow!

256
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,370
Third place from last.

257
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,650
Anyway, we avoided last place. Quiet, Quiet!

258
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,950
So, we'll forget about after-class study.  Get ready for your class.

259
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,120
- Yay! 
 - Awesome!

260
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,820
I thought we would have to attend night study. What happened?

261
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,900
- I thought that only my grades increased. 
 - Me too.

262
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,130
I did study harder than usual just to teach Lee Kyeong Woo.

263
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,020
We killed it.

264
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,310
Kyeong Woo, want me to tutor you again for the next midterm? Looks like your brain isn't a rock, after all.

265
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,520
Have you gone mad? If you guys do that again, I'll drop out.

266
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,100
Okay, good job!

267
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,260
Go easy on us, Joo Yeong. I got scoldings from my mom today so I'm already annoyed.

268
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:03,080
Wah! Did you tell your mom about your grades? I lied that they didn't come yet.

269
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,610
Why isn't Lee Kyeong Woo coming? His mom must be very happy because his grades went up.

270
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,410
Now that it's all over, stop talking about the grades. My sugar level is dropping.

271
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,480
Darling, me too. Ahh.

272
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,800
It tastes sweeter since my darling is feeding—

273
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,380
Darling, really?

274
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,620
What is wrong with you?

275
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,710
Yes, Mom. No, nothing big. Just that my grades increased.

276
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,890
Sixty marks.

277
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,980
It's amazing?

278
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,320
Dinner?

279
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,760
What about you, Mom?

280
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,440
Then I want bulgogi.

281
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,180
Well, I studied according to the textbooks, and it turned out well. Yeah.

The picture looks good because the guy is taller.

288
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,910
Well, this much is average height. 

289
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,510
It is in a higher place, so...

Once we're all grown up and graduate, Ja Rim will wear high heels since she'll be an adult. Then she'll be the same height as me. 

298
