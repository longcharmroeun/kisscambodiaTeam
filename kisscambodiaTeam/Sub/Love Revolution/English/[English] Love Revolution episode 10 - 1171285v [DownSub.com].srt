Platform

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,600
They're here!

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,120
- Hi! 
 - A couple look!

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,620
- It looks good on you guys! 
 - Right, right?

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,590
Shut up.

00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,400
Two hours ago

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,770
Hey, what are you going to wear today?

Subtitles brought to you by Teenage Love Team @ Viki.com

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,560
What is Ja Rim wearing today?

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,990
Thank you! Thank you!

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,860
Such a coincidence, right? We didn't even plan it!

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,370
We really are a match made in heaven!

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,000
Like hell, it's coincidence. Be quiet and stay away from me.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,890
But it's our first couple look.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,900
Gong Joo Yeong, what the heck? Wearing a couple outfit with me?

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,800
Wow, we're the Korean flag! We got two patriots here.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,790
- ♫ Until that day when... ♫ 
- Hey! Don't you dare come near me.

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,120
Ja Rim! Wait up!

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,560
- Why are those guys all late?
 - Sorry, we came from the internet cafe.

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,210
Why would you go to an internet café on the day we made plans?

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,370
But who is that?

23
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,960
We went to the same middle school. Jeong Sang Hoon. He's coming with us.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,900
These boys with long hair are Yang Min Ji and Hong Jin Hui.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,770
- Hi!
 - Hello.

26
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,710
Hello!

27
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,970
Is Ah Ram not coming?

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,640
Let's just go. Her coming will mean less food for us.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,930
It could also mean one less mouth to feed. Got that?

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,620
Hi, Hyung! 
 (T/N: hyung is used by a male toward a close older male)

31
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,080
What the? What are you doing here?

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,120
Hey, you punk. Why don't you say hi to me?

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,420
What? Do you know each other? He's my junior from the gym. He said he wanted to come too.

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,010
Did we ever say okay? Did we even discuss it?

35
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,590
We talked about it between us. Plus, we're going with boys anyway.

36
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,190
Is there any difference if another one comes along?

37
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,040
Jeez. What about our opinions?

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,760
You knew Noona? I had no idea I'd see you at a place like this.

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,190
Yeah, it's been a while.

40
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,250
Hey, say hi to my friends.

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,230
- Such a childish kid like you has such grownup friends? 
 - He's so cute.

42
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,130
Hi!

43
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,910
Noona, can I date your friends?

44
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,190
- Hey, he asked if he can date you guys.
 - How can you  just tell them that?

45
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,030
Cute! You're tall and you work out?

46
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,060
Pass!

47
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,340
I'll have to see.

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,290
Hey, Lee Kyeong Woo!

49
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,960
What?

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,590
Gong Joo Yeong hasn't come out of the washroom.

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,310
Go and take a look.

52
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,710
What is this?

53
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,200
Hey! Hey! There's no tissue in my cubicle! 
 [One missed call from Gong Joo Yeong]

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,860
Save me! If you tell Ja Rim, or she finds out, you're dead!

55
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,260
- Come alone!
 - What? Did he say there's no toilet paper?

56
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,450
Just pretend you didn't know.

57
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,750
She already found out.

58
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,890
Hi, Hyung.

59
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,920
- What the heck? Why are you here? 
 - I came along with Noona Ah Ram.

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,700
Let's talk later. It's time now, so let's go.

61
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,060
Turn around guys. Let's go, let's go.

62
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,510
- I'm taking the back seat! 
 - Me too.

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,710
I feel like we're forgetting something.

64
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,980
Whatever.

65
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,250
Oh? I'm the first one!

66
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,110
Love Revolution: Valley party without a valley.  
 Episode 10 #ValleyTrip #WithJaRim #MistakeMeansDeath

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,850
glasses @princess_0: Just die, moron

68
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,950
Announcement: boarding for the express bus starts now.

69
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,770
I'm here!

70
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,480
Aigoo! My boy!

71
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,390
Baeng Hoon, my little puppy!

72
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,550
My grandson, why are you skinny?

73
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,190
I'll have to fill you up.

74
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,200
- I've gained two kilograms since last year— 
- You have something on your lips there.

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,750
- Hello! 
- Hello there, welcome.

76
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,130
You guys are still as pale as ever.

77
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,310
This one seems useful, though.

78
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,020
Goodness, who are these puppies?

79
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,830
Oh, goodness. You're very sturdy so you must be pretty strong.

80
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,500
Do you have any plans of marrying my Byeong Hoon?

81
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,820
I don't. I came because he said you would make us a lot of delicious food.

82
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,760
Somehow lost 
 Look at how bold you are.

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Oh my. You have such a delicate face and a slim figure.

84
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,720
You remind me of my prime years.

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,970
Gosh, don't say such nonsense.

86
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,670
Anyway, thank you for coming! Come in! Come in!

87
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,170
Yes!

88
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,050
Ja Rim, this is the puppy I told you about. It's so cute. Do you want to see it?

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,430
It was really tiny last year...

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,080
How did it get so big...?

91
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,560
Hey, let's hurry and go to the valley!

92
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,810
The valley? You can't go there now.

93
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,000
- Why not? 
- It rained so much last night.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,460
So the valley is flooded. It's forbidden to go.

95
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,470
Grandma, you should've told us that before we left!

96
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,510
Well, I thought the water would have gone once the sun rose today.

97
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,300
Come in, come in.

98
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,990
Come in, come in!

99
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,570
Ja Rim, I'm sorry.

100
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,490
I'm the one who suggested coming here but we can't even play in the water.

101
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,200
It's okay. You didn't make it rain.

102
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,940
What if it's still off-limits tomorrow? Do we have to go home?

103
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,370
I used it up. I'm doomed.

104
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,460
Hey.

105
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,720
Real Barrier - Intense Moisture Cream

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,030
It looked like you used it often.

107
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,130
- It's that one, right?
 - Yeah. It... it...

108
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,300
Real Barrier Extreme. How did you know?

109
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,410
Don't look at me like that. I'm paying you back for the foam cleanser.

110
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,110
Wang Ja Rim, so sweet.

111
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,530
Did you observe what he uses every day?

112
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,200
Hey, come out! Let's play with water!

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,420
- Hey! 
- What are you doing?

114
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,870
Come here, you!

115
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,550
Hey! This shirt isn't for playing!

116
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,320
It's the same for me! Once it's wet, it becomes a swimsuit anyway.

117
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,120
Hey! What does this become when it gets wet?

118
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,100
A w-water snack?

119
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,870
- You're done for, darn it. 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

120
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,510
So annoying. Are they elementary schoolers or what?

121
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,440
Hey, the water! I've run out.

122
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,330
- Come here! 
 - Wait, wait!

123
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,300
- Time! 
 - Come here, come here.

124
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,720
- You were going to spray that on me, weren't you? 
- What?

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,350
No. It was for me.

126
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,690
Whoa, Joo Yeong. Your ice bucket challenge is a big success!

127
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,220
When you see Byeong Hoon, his body and all isn't too bad.

128
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,500
Hey, get over here!

129
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,700
Hey, Byeong Hoon! This place has great dried daikon (radish)! It's too delicious.

130
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,690
Can you pack me some to take home? It's so good.

131
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,100
Yeah, yeah. This is the perfect wrap.

132
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,360
That was well wrapped.

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,130
Ta-da. I made this specially for you, sweetie. Open wide.

134
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,160
Why is it so big? It's fine, I'll make my own.

135
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,340
Mosquito!

136
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,280
This is the beauty of nature. What would a city girl like you know about it?

137
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,270
A bug!

138
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,360
Yes, yes. Our amazing country city guy has made his entrance.

139
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,400
- Apply some ointment. 
- Thank you.

140
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,640
Wang Ja, you're fine without any?

141
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,810
Gosh, there is plenty of meat left so don't be shy and eat to your heart's content, alright?

142
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,680
- Thank you! 
- Sure, sure.

143
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,510
You need to be full to use your strength.

144
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,060
The weather is great. Today will be another fun...

145
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,320
farm work.

146
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,740
Hey, did you call us here to do work?

147
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,090
We need to harvest it all before the rainy season.

148
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,260
Were you all planning on just eating and leaving?

149
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,040
You should've told us sooner.

150
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,260
Whatever. This sort of experience is fun too, I guess.

151
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,850
Ja Rim, here's water.

152
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,880
Hey, does anyone have Coke? I want something fizzy.

153
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,670
If there were, I would've drunk all of it.

154
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,120
Guys, let's finish quickly so we can play!

155
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,100
Where was the bathroom again?

156
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,830
The bathroom...

157
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,800
This should be good enough, right?

158
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,210
You evil punk.

159
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,790
- What? 
- What do you mean, what? Go pick chili peppers, you're getting in the way.

160
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,590
How am I getting in the way? I'll figure it out.

161
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,880
Don't you have a boyfriend?

162
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,890
Why are you suddenly asking that? Why do you want to know?

163
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,420
I mean, don't you need a boyfriend to lift this stuff for you?

164
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,410
Not really, I already have a boyfriend-like friend who can carry this for me.

165
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,190
Noona, leave this stuff to me.

166
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,950
Wow, you're pretty strong.

167
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,040
Out of my way.

168
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,570
- Give me one more. 
- Really?

169
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

170
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,110
Does anyone have water?

171
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,890
No.

172
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,340
Ja Rim, I'll go get water for you.

173
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,930
- Seriously, what's wrong with you? 
- What?

174
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,290
Why do you keep getting in my way? Do you want to beat me that badly?

175
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,670
What bullshit is that? Is it my fault you're weaker than I am?

176
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,800
Who's weak?

177
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,730
Is that water?

178
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,130
Yuck, it's alcohol!

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,010
Ugh, this one too.

180
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,540
Why is Gong Joo Yeong taking so long?

181
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,970
- I know right? He left to get water over half an hour ago. 
 - Oh!

182
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,430
Speak of the devil.

183
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,590
What's wrong with him?

184
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,950
Hey, water. I brought water.

185
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,480
You moron, this is alcohol.

186
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,230
Hey, Jeong Sang! Take him back with me.

187
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,810
I have to give water to my darling. Where's my darling?

188
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,250
Hey, let's go. Let's go.

189
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,290
What's wrong with him?

190
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,050
He must have drunk alcohol.

191
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,410
My darling is here.

192
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,140
Let go of me, let go!

193
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,890
Hey Wang Ja Rim.

194
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,720
Don't live that way.

195
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
Hey, hey, don't do it.

196
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,430
Don't do what?

197
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,090
Hey. Even if I like you more,

198
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,400
you're always "don't do this," "don't do that."

199
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,930
We're dating but I can't do anything. What the heck?

200
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,680
What's this, huh?

201
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,140
- Hey, hey.
 - Let go of me. 
 - Let's go.

202
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,610
- Let go of me! 
 - Let's go, come on.

203
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,290
- Hurry. 
 - Let go of me!

204
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,590
Gong Joo Yeong is getting a mileage boost to his compilation of embarrassing moments.

205
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,950
Did you see what he said to Wang Ja Rim earlier?

206
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,910
That guy pretends he's fine, but he's got something pent up, I tell you.

207
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,870
Did your grandparents not say anything? He drank alcohol, after all.

208
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,640
No, on the contrary, they were worried.

209
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,890
What about Gong Joo Yeong?

210
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,690
If you're worried, go see for yourself.

211
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,670
- He must be fine then. 
 - Think whatever you want.

212
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,160
One, two, three, four, five!

213
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,850
Buongiorno! Hand over 13,810,000 won!

214
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,020
Bankruptcy

215
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,130
Ciao ciao, ciao ciao.

216
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,890
I'm doomed.

217
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,390
Noona, should I try to save you?

218
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,930
Hey. Do you think she'll survive? Huh?

219
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,700
Hey. Where's Gong Joo Yeong?

220
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,640
- In the room. 
 - He's not in there.

221
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,350
There's no way we wouldn't have seen him get out of the room.

222
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,880
Hey. Where's this moron?

223
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,030
- Gong Joo Yeong! 
 - Gong Joo Yeong!

224
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,090
Gong Joo Yeong!

225
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,730
- He's not there? 
 - No.

226
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,730
- He's not here either. 
 - Where did this punk go?

227
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,560
Did you find him?

228
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,630
I don't think he's around here.

229
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,760
Did he leave his phone behind?

230
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,390
Hey, let's split up and look for him.

231
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,750
Everyone take your phones, and you girls stay here.

232
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,600
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

233
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,060
- Hey. Do you have anywhere in mind?  
 - Me?

234
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,890
Yes, he's your boyfriend. Can you think of anywhere he might go to?

235
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,030
Hey, Gong Joo Yeong. Hey, wake up.

236
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,320
Found Gong Joo Yeong. At the supermarket.

237
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,000
What the? Are you waking up?

238
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,720
What are you doing?

239
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,940

244
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,520
I like you so much, but... 

245
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,990
I like you more than I did at first. 

246
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,290
Is that kind of stuff nice? 

247
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,280
In the future, if you've got something pent up inside, say it right away.

248
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,500
- What's this? When did you become close? 
- I'll kill you.

249
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,910
- You keep looking down on me, so let's battle it out.
- Deal.

250
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,780
- At this rate, they'll end up dating. 
 - Rather than them...

251
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,970
I think another couple will be born.

252
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,880
Did you not eat anything?

253
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,630
Shouldn't you eat hangover soup or something?

254
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,660
Ah, well, this tastes like something you can only eat in heaven.

255
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,670
Ah but, why do you like Yang Min Ji?

256
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,330
Why didn't I notice anything?
