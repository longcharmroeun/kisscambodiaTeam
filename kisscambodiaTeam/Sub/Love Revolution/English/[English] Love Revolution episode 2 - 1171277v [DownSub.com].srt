00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,340
- I'm washing up first. 
 - I put my foot in first!

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,000
Unni, you need to learn to give in to the younger one.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,170
How convenient for you to treat me as an older sister at times like these.

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,390
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors. 
 - Rock, paper, scissors!

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,630
Don't you dare let water splash on the toilet seat!

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,870
My butt got all wet again yesterday!

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,790
That's right. The love letter was a little impulsive. It's actually a relief that she didn't see it.

9
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,760
Love...

10
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,090
is about timing.

 Episode 2 #White Day (T.N. when men give women candy) #Confession #Candy

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,890
We see each other often nowadays.

14
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,100
It's because our homes are close.

15
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,150
Hey, I'm blocked here.  Can you solve it for me?

16
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,380
Wow, you've reached quite a high level.

17
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,610
Wow, that's how you do it?

18
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,410
Don't talk to me. This is a hard part.

19
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,210
Hey, there's a bomb here.

20
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,770
- It's done. 
 - Thank you.

21
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,250
Do you play Daijo? I'll let you win  a round in exchange.

22
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,460
I don't play that.

23
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,290
Hey, Ja Rim.

24
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,440
Will you let me know your phone number?

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,580
- We haven't been able to get each other's numbers yet. 
 - Sure.

26
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,670
Did you know it was White Day today? I prepared it for you.

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,630
Look in the bag too.

28
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,990
Don't talk to me.  This is a hard part.

29
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,550
Here.

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,690
What about your number?

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,790
The bus is here.

32
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,930
Okay. I'm halfway there.

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,810
Halfway where? Is that the thing you prepared?

34
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,250
It's White Day, how could I just let it pass? Hey, the bus!

35
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,890
Mister!

36
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,300
I'm too happy!

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,180
Put them down. They're not yours.

38
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,210
I won't eat them.

39
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,390
As expected. I knew you'd receive some.

40
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,250
There's more here.

41
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,450
Amazing. There's so many.

42
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,380
Gong Joo Yeong is so pitiful. He doesn't know you don't like sweets,

43
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,730
nor does he know you won't eat them.

44
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,230
How did you know it was Gong Joo Yeong?

45
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,820
Huh?

46
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,990
That's... Didn't you tell me?

47
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,550
I didn't tell you.

48
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,650
How do you know Gong Joo Yeong?

49
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,110
- What did you mean by you knew I'd receive some? 
 - Hey, wait a second.

50
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,170
- Why are you being like this to me? 
 - Hey, it seems he must really like you.

51
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,090
He only picked out and bought the most delicious ones, strawberry and chocolate. He's so—

52
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,820
not devoted.

53
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,860
At the bus stop, I poured lollipops on top of her head.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,470
Hey, you're screwed.  Come quick.

55
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,800
- Huh? 
 - Quickly, quick!

56
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,810
- What? 
 - I slipped up, sorry.

57
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,590
That worked out well. I was going to confess to her anyway.

58
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,070
Now I can tell her frankly.

59
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,790
Right now isn't the time.

60
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,320
She doesn't intend to date anyone.

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
Why? Why doesn't she intend to date?

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,130
Because... uhm.

63
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,980
That's... I don't know.

64
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,350
- Anyway, until I give you the signal—-
 - Then you don't know.

65
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,260
This is all for you...

66
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,810
With Ja Rim's personality, you'll be ignored now.

67
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,430
Why?

68
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,160
Oh, Ja Rim!

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,470
I didn't get your phone number this morning.

70
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,900
But,

71
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,900
is Ja Rim avoiding me?

72
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,030
Don't get too shocked.

73
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,270
Then, I can just approach her!

74
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,910
Don't get too not shocked either...

75
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,960
07:02 AM

76
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,090
Wow, you came out early today?

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,390
How long has he been waiting here, seriously?

78
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,060
Since around 6 a.m, I think? Yeah.

79
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,600
I wasn't asking you. Will you not talk to me?

80
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,170
I fell for you.

81
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,700
What are you doing?

82
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,880
You said not to talk.

83
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,260
I'll split you in half.

84
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,440
Wow, you're playing along! (TN:  They were both signing homonyms for what they wanted to say).

85
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,900
Then,

86
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,120
could you give me your number, please?

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,930

93
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,900
Give me a break.

94
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,660
Then... ♫ 0, 1, 0—♫

95
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,570
I said stop!

96
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,090
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

97
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,230
- I'm okay. 
 - Let me see.

98
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,200
What's your number? (upside down)

99
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,880
What's your number?

100
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,730
Hey Lee Kyeong Woo. You give him my number.

101
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,770
- Okay. Hey. I'll send it to you. 
 - Hey, don't send it!

102
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,580
- It's the same whether you receive it from me or her. 
 - It's different.

103
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,400
- I said it's the same. 
 - I said it's different.

104
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,510
Hey. What can you do if she is this hell-bent on not giving it to you?

105
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,930
- You should know when to give up. 
 - Give up? Give up?

106
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,160
"Giving up" is just for counting cabbages. 
  (T/N:"giving up" is a homonym for the counting unit for cabbages.)

107
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,260
I sent it. Whether you save it or not is your problem.

108
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,500
This jerk, I said I'd get it myself, darn it.

109
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,060
Alright. Tell me about your symptoms.

110
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,560
I can't express this with words.

111
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,680
Then express it with your body.

112
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,370
When I just think of that girl, my chest feels tight

113
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,970
and my heart bounces.

114
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,800
I feel like I'm going crazy.

115
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,680
Your symptoms are much more serious than I expected.

116
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,170
As I see it, your ailment right now seems to be this.

117
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,840
Don't be shocked. 
 Bullsh*t disease

118
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,660
Doc! You're being too much to a sick student. What happened to the Hippocratic Oath?

119
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,710
The Hippocratic Oath? Do you know about the Fibbocratic oath?

120
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,450
It's "I swear to make unwell the one who fibs about being unwell." I should just!

121
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,840
Doctor! How can you do this to a sick student?

122
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,620
Please give me some sort of medication or something.

123
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,810
Alright, just a moment.

124
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,590
- Here. 
 - A ruler?

125
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,210
Go, quickly. Are you not leaving? Get going!

126
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,450
Will you please not talk to me?

127
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,660
Let's date.  (T.N. He's signaling 4 "sa" -ear "kwi" - ruler "ja" = sakwija/let's date.)

128
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,530
Hey. It's raining outside.

129
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,480
That's right, like my heart.

130
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,890
Stop bullsh*tting and listen up. Wang Ja Rim didn't bring an umbrella.

131
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,710
So what?

132
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,870
- That's right. We can just use an umbrella together! 
 - That's right.

133
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,300
- Lend me yours. 
 - Why mine?

134
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,270
You're going to the internet cafe with the others anyway. You can share with them.

135
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,740
- Genji is with you. 
 - Hanzo at your service.

136
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,900
Kyeong Min: Genji / Byeong Hoon: Hanzo  (T/N: Overwatch characters)

137
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,720
Oh, but what if her friends also have umbrellas?

138
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,180
- I don't want to. 
- Hey, you thought of it. You have to be responsible all the way.

139
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,200
Damn ...

140
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,580
Darn... the rain will probably stop later, right?

141
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,000
Use my umbrella with me. I knew you wouldn't bring one, so I prepared for us three.

142
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,720
Let's have a look.

143
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,430
Huh? I definitely packed it though. What is this?

144
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,220
- Do you not have it? 
 - No.

145
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,480
Don't worry, because I have an umbrella too.

146
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,970
Right here! Tada!

147
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,660
Huh? It was here, but it's not anymore!

148
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,170
Hey! Which jerk stole the umbrella that was here?!

149
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,700
Shall we just get a taxi?

150
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,410
It's fine. The bus stop is only a short walk ahead.

151
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,560
Go.

152
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,470
Shall we use the umbrella toge…?

153
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,090
Hey, Wang Ja Rim!

154
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,320
Okay.

155
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,500
- It's you then, the umbrella thief? 
 - Bag.

156
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,830
Ah Ram, go.

157
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,290
Round 1: Ah Ram VS. Kyeong Woo

158
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,460
Fight!

159
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,420
Will you approach? Or should I go?

160
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,700
Hey. We can just use it together.

161
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,370
I said I don't want to.

162
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,500
- At this rate, you'll catch a cold. 
 - Never mind.

163
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,490
- Oh! Wait! 
 - K.O! (Knockout)

164
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,710
Oh, nosebleed!

165
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,400
Hey!

166
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,360
Oh no.

167
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,330
Ouch, oh my goodness.

168
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,450
Get a hold of yourself.

169
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,180
Hey, hey, hey.

170
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,860
I get it, so just use this and go.

171
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,010
I won't bother you anymore.

172
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,700
Why would I use your umbrella, you crazy jerk?

173
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,490
I'm saying just use it! You'll catch a cold.

174
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,360
I don't want to!

175
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,980
Seriously, you're so stubborn.

176
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,460
Hey, won't you bugger off? Why would you follow me here?

177
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,050
I'm just avoiding the rain for a moment.

178
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,450
Is that not an umbrella in your hand? You can just use that and go.

179
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,830
It was thrown to the ground so many times, it's ruined now.

180
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,500
Mind your business and go home.

181
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,380
Code keypad out of order

182
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,750
Oh!

183
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,300
- This is Ja Rim's. 
 - Shoot!

184
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,560
Excuse me... if you're cold, would you like to go wait for a bit at my house?

185
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,590
You can charge your phone, too.

186
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,940
Are you crazy? Why would I go there?

187
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,240
- Hey, at this rate you'll catch a cold! 
 - I'm fine, so go.

188
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,030
You're bothering me.

189
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,770
I'm going, I'm going! Whether you catch a cold or not, do what you want.

190
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,430
So good.

191
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,950
- It's good, right? 
 - So good.

192
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:07,210
That's right. Since I made a mistake toward you girls, it's my treat. I'll treat you...

193
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,000
but what are you guys doing?

194
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,720
- The most unseemly thing to do is complain after you offered to pay. 
 - Right, you spend money and get cursed.

195
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,830
I said I'm not buying for you guys!

196
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,850
- It's uncool, Kyeong Woo. 
 - It's thoughtless.

197
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,190
Don't we need to go give her the keys?

198
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,820
- Would that be disturbing them? 
 - Disturbing? Disturbing what?

199
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,350
Ah, don't tell me...

200
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,310
Oh my! I don't have a key!

201
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,580
Dear me! There's no one at home.

202
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,660
What? That means you can't go home despite all this rain...

203
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,740
I'm cold and hungry.

204
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,960
Won't you be catching a cold at this rate?

205
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,140
What to do? Then, Ja Rim,

206
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,710
come to my house.

207
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,270
- Hey!  
 - What the heck.

208
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,500
No, it's nothing.

209
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,640
What? Why?

210
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,300
I picked it up.

211
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
- Why did you come? 
 - I was worried.

212
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,010
Isn't that obvious? Your face is pale.

213
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,360
At this rate you'll really catch a cold.

214
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,170
What about you? Aren't you cold? Do you not have an umbrella at home?

215
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,380
That's right, I don't have one.

216
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,270
I must have not packed it when I moved.

217
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,420
Quickly, at least dry your hair.

218
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,220
Let's go, to your house.

219
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,110
Hey. Are you not coming?

220
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,260
Wait here for a bit.

221
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,790
Wear this.

222
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,310
I'll wash yours and return it to you.

223
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,160
What are you doing? Put it on. You have three seconds.

224
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,770
Okay.

225
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,120
Drink it. Three, two, one.

226
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,000
- Go now. Three, two— 
 - Okay.

227
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,550
Hey.

228
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,740
If you catch a cold I'll kill you.

229
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,270
Ja Rim's scent...

230
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,780
You're back?

231
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,780
Unni, was the person in the lobby your friend?

232
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,150
-Has he not gone yet? 
 --He's gone.

233
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,930
But... that's my hoodie, you rude-ass witch!

234
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,280
Love Revolution

235
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,670
- Have you decided what to do for the retreat? 
 - Retreat?

236
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,900
What the hell are you doing?

237
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,220
- These punks say they'll participate in the talent show at the retreat. 
 - Of course we will. 

238
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,390
It's an opportunity to appeal to Ja Rim. 

239
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,350
Wang Ja Rim says she has zero interest in you.

240
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,170
Dammit, I almost forgot...

241
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,670
Will you marry me?

242
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,150
Wow, how sweet!

243
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,450
Everyone, raise your hands above your head! Close your eyes! 

244
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,270
Open your bags and wait.

245
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,600
I didn't bring it.

246
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,740
They're going to check again?

247
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,270
Hey, we don't need to. Looks like it was Gong Joo Yeong. 

248
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,270
♫ I like your smiling face the most ♫
