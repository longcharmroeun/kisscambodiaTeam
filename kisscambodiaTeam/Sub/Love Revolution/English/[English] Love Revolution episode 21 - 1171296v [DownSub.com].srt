1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,020
Is it going well with Bang Ye Seul?

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,330
More smoothly than for you.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,730
Look.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,000
Seems pretty nice.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,200
Wait.

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,820
What is the difference? Why does this side look better?

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,720
Are you asking because you really don't know?

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,660
Oh, that's it. The guy is taller, so it looks better.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,180
Could that really be the reason?

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,670
Wait.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,590
Did you grow taller?

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,940
Did I? I'm not sure.

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,950
It seems like you grew 1cm more since we entered high school.

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,230
What's the big deal with height? They say our height varies by one to two centimeters between the evening and the morning.

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,570
What? Not a big deal? Jeez, you are already tall.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,590
Hey, even 1cm is precious to me.

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,210
Try harder. At this rate, won't Wang Ja Rim grow taller than you?

18
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,020
Hey! Don't say stuff like that!

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,360
Sorry, did you wait long?

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,900
No, it's okay.

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:31,210

00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,470
- What are you looking at? 
 - Huh? Ah...

23
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,060
- Nothing. Just... 
 - What is it?

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,700
Ja Rim, have you perhaps...

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,260
Wang Ja, have you grown taller?

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,100
I've grown around 1.5cm since I started school here.

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,070
What? Really?

28
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,540
Ja Rim, so you're still growing?

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,470
It seems so. Let's hurry and go.

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,810
Love Revolution: How tall are you?
 Episode 21. #ShortGuy #Complex #HowToGetTaller

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,670
bang_H @princess_0: Want to exchange my height for your face? 

32
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,150
Ja Rim, should we go to the snack store?

33
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,130
Oh, what? You already went. But why did you buy so much?

34
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,460
- I've been craving food these days. 
 - She's eating as much as I am these days.

35
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,420
Oddly enough, she doesn't gain any weight. Has it all gone to her height?

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,650
You guys are so lucky. I'm envious you can eat without worry.

37
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,980
Hey, eat and exercise afterward. Why stupidly starve yourself?

38
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,890
- Do you want a bite? 
 - No. I'm not made for exercising.

39
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,370
- Give it to me. 
 - No!

40
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,060
- What the? Why?  
 - Are you scared she'll grow taller or what?

41
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,990
That's not it! I just wanted to suggest going to buy something tastier.

42
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,640
Something tastier? What is it?

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,060
Let's go.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,430
Hey. What's with you?

45
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,470
Ja Rim.

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,990
Why don't you gain weight instead?

47
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,530
What the heck? Didn't you say we're going to buy some delicious food? Where are you going?

48
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,620
So, how tall is Wang Ja Rim?

49
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,650
- 163cm. 
 - What about you?

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,330
-  173cm. 
 - That's the average height then.

51
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,910
Is it okay to be average? If it were grades I would be in the 5th tier.

52
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,880
If you say it like that, I can see what you mean.

53
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,990
But there's still a 10cm difference between you and Wang Ja Rim. That's good enough.

54
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,660
That's the case now, but if she keeps growing taller, at this rate,

55
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,960
Ja Rim will be taller than me by third year.

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,700
Do you think Ja Rim is a giant or something?  Why would she keep growing?

57
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,570
Who knows what will happen?

58
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,830
Once we're all grown up and graduate, Ja Rim will be an adult and start wearing high heels.

59
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,560
She'll be the same height as me then.

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,680
You really think you'll be dating until then?

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,520
- We're going to get married! 
 - Gosh.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,920
Oh my god.

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,430
Ja Rim can't be taller than me at our wedding!

64
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,400
- So embarrassing! 
 - Wedding my foot!

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,690
Did she say she'll marry you? Why in the world are you worrying about stupid stuff like that?

66
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,840
Anyway, my current height won't do.

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,830
No matter how much you grow, it's no use when you're Gong Joo Yeong.

68
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,730
Look at this turd. He's tall, but because he's Kim Byeong Hoon, he doesn't have a girlfriend.

69
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,710
What about you? You're short and you don't have a girlfriend. You should at least have the height.

70
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,100
What's wrong with my height? What?

71
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,640
I'm just the right height! I'm taller than Gong Joo Yeong! Jeez!

72
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,300
185cm

73
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,790
176cm

74
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,720
181cm

75
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,170
Why am I the only one not growing?

76
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,310
Wang Ja didn't even say anything about you being short. Why are you uselessly worrying?

77
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,390
- Still...
 - Hey.

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,090
The teacher has sent me for an errand. Can you help me?

79
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,170
I have to get something from the science lab.

80
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,790
Okay! I'll help you!

81
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,890
But...it's somewhere up high.

82
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,320
Kim Byeong Hoon, can you help me?

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,720
Okay.

84
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,340
So, I can't help because I'm short?

85
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,460
Sh*t!

86
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,910
How to grow taller. 

87
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,360
Stimulate your growth plates with regular exercise. 

88
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,140
To exercise in a restricted space, "sergeant jumps" are the best. 

89
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,010
Light jumping exercises are the best kind for stimulating the growth plates. 

90
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,410
- Who is this?
 - I live in the house below.

91
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,510
Why is it so noisy in the middle of the night? I thought some construction work was happening.

92
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,560
Sorry.

93
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,570
Sweetie, if you're tired, sleep for a bit.

94
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,390
I'll sleep for a bit.

95
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,000
Ja Rim, did you just grow taller?

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,520
They say you grow taller while you're sleeping.

97
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,990
No. Wake up!

98
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,430
You can't sleep! Hurry and wake up!

99
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,510
Stop sleeping, Ja Rim!

100
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,740
I need to become tall.

101
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,570
If that was how you could get taller, the entire nation would be 180 cm tall.

102
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,280
Then you? How did you become so tall?

103
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,570
I ate well and pooped well.

104
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,000
So you're saying your genes did all the work.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,480
You've been blessed with it, how can you understand how I feel?

106
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,480
What's this now? Treating your athlete's foot?

107
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,750
Ah, it's an acupuncture point for growth. I have to press on it.

108
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,910
You're really doing all sorts of things.

109
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,140
If you're going to say such stuff then get lost.

110
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,530
Or help me. Massage my back.

111
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,840
- Where do I have to press? 
 - Press along my spine.

112
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,330
Ah, that's good.

113
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,470
You are doing well. Ah.

114
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,740
Gong Joo Yeong!

115
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,260
You look busy.

116
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,740
Oh, Ja Rim! This is only a massage.

117
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,700
- Where shall we go after class? 
- I'm not sure.

118
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,790
- Internet cafe? 
- Internet cafe?

119
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,470
I don't know how to play any games.

120
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,610
- What about Kart? 
 - Ah right, I can play that one.

121
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,620
Okay. Then let's play that.

122
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,810
See you later.

123
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,550
Min Ji, I looked into it thinking that it might be of some help,

124
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,690
and rather than suddenly changing your diet, 

125
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,690
changing your food little by little while maintaining a regular diet is better. 

126
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,150
They say that way you can keep doing it consistently, and that if you starve yourself, you'll definitely get the yo-yo effect. 

127
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,820
There won't be a problem as long as you eat according to your basal metabolism.

128
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,250
I don't know your specific requirements, but they say the average basal metabolism for women is 2000 calories. 

129
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,120
and that it's good to intake all the essential nutrients within those 2000 calories. 

130
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,890
That will be more helpful for your diet. 

131
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,430
Truthfully, for me you look good as you are now.

132
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,170
I hope you won't push yourself too much. You even like spicy foods. 

133
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm worried now that you can't eat them during your diet.

134
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,090
Wow. It's amazing!
 Thank you, Sang Hoon.

135
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,950
What is it?

136
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,430
Teacher, I have such huge worries that I can't sleep well.

137
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,930
- How can I become taller— 
 - What, you punk?

138
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,260
Sorry?

139
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,240
Gosh...

140
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,310
Hey! You want to die?

141
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,990
You're blessed to be over 170 cm. Are you making fun of me?!

142
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,810
N-No. Sorry.

143
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,750
Teach, they say doing sergeant jumps help in getting taller.

144
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,120
My growth plates closed, you brat!

145
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,870
What a weirdo!

146
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,430
Have you seen any movies recently?

147
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,190
The one released this time seemed fun.

148
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,820
No, I haven't watched anything recently.

149
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,910
Then this weekend,

150
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,210
Then this weekend,
 Do you want to go see a movie?

151
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,780
Weekend Morning

152
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,140
Growth gymnastics for the evening: the plow pose

153
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,580
This helps to grow?

154
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,210
- Who is it? 
- It's me Jeong Sang.

155
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,020
0323 star.

156
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,300
What's up?

157
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,820
- See if my clothes are fine. 
 - Why?

158
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,450
What's this suddenly?

159
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,760
Hey! What the hell?!

160
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,940
Wow, did you go through a hand-me-down clothes box?

161
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,810
- It's new.
 - It's new?

162
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,240
Did you take a time machine and go to the past for shopping?

163
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,900
- Is it that bad?
 - Yeah!

164
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,910
It's crazy bad.

165
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,820
But why do you suddenly want me to check your clothes?

166
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,390
Are you going to meet a girl?

167
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,730
- Yeah.
 - Eh? Really?

168
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,100
Who?

169
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,730
Min Ji.

170
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,480
Ah right! Oooh! Wait up.

171
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,430
- You guys finally going on a date?
 - Yeah.

172
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,240
Then I should put in some effort for you.

173
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,660
Monk Hyemin: Min Ji, are you downtown? 

174
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,260
Yeah. To meet Sang Hoon

175
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,580
Vegeta: So you're meeting him in the end.

176
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,690
Monk Hyemin: Ah, that prim guy? 

177
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,080
Ah right! F*ck!

178
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,250
Vegeta: LOL, hella funny. 

179
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,510
What will you do if he wears what he wore last time?

180
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,750
Ah his clothes. I didn't think of it.

181
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,780
Please just wear something simple. 

182
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,360
I'd rather you wear a tracksuit, even. 

183
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,170
Min Ji.

184
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,350
Hi.

185
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,070
Oh! Hi.

186
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,150
- Are you hungry?
 - Do you want to eat?

187
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,160
Shall we go eat?

188
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,260
You came? The food is almost ready.

189
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,010
We could just eat outside. It's bothersome.

190
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,200
No, not at all. It's because I want to cook for you from time to time.

191
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,780
The food is almost ready, so just wait a little.

192
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,960
- I'll use your laptop a bit. 
 - What? Okay.

193
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,150
I guess you must have hidden your porn well, then.

194
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,860
No, I don't watch that stuff.

Huh? What did you say?

Okay, let's eat now.

Why is yours like this?

210
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,010
I'm craving these sorts of things these days.

I want to treat you here.

227
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:08,430
It's the first time we're having a meal together, and I thought I'd feel better if I'm the one paying.

228
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,350
I'm buying to make myself feel good.

229
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,200

What's this? Are you finally dating?

235
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,520
Really? He's your boyfriend, Min Ji?

236
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,400
No, it's not like that.

237
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,760
Yeah, we just agreed to see a movie together.

238
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,120
So it's a date. Wow, Jeong Sang!

239
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,630
Hey, do well. He's Jeong Seong Hoon, overflowing with devotion, after all.

240
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,830
Your name is really Jeong Seong Hoon? 
 (T/N: jeongseong means devotion)

241
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,460
No, it's Sang Hoon...

242
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,290
You do well yourself. Hurry and go on your way.

243
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,110
Right, let's not disturb them and go.

244
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,960
- Have fun. 
 - We're off.

245
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,150
Min Ji.

246
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,800
Yeah?

247
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,590
Should we go?

248
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,140
Yeah.

249
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,000
I must be crazy. 

250
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,190
Hey, I heard Min Ji went on a date with Jeong Sang Hoon?

251
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,610
It looks like she wants to make it work, after all.

252
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,430
I thought she wasn't interested.

253
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,950
Let's go to the snack bar.

254
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,170
I don't really like tall guys.

255
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,330
What are you saying out of the blue?

256
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,160
Isn't just over 170 cm a nice height?

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,230
When did you get here?

258
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,260
Ja Rim!

259
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,420
What? What is it?

260
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,500
I'm going to the snack bar.

261
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,760
She must have eaten something funny.

Are you not doing sergeant jumps today?

265
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,820
No thank you.

266
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,290
What the...? You said you wanted to grow taller. You gave up?

267
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,930
Ja Rim says she doesn't like tall guys. She says she likes guys just my height.

268
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:31,420
As long as I look good to Ja Rim, I'm fine.

281
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,390
Look at how he talks. He's a complete addict.

284
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,500

288
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,200
Gong Joo Yeong doesn't play anymore. He's different from you. 

289
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,690
As expected, the rumors about you being One Bang Man weren't lies. 

290
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,470
I used my brain, of course. You can't play games if you're ignorant.

- Is something wrong? 
- I'm chewing on the bitter taste of defeat.
