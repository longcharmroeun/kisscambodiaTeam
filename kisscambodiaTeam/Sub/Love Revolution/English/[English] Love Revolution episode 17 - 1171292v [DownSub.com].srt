1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,140
If you act cute again while singing, you're dead.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,500
It also makes me cringe when you force your voice to be lower when singing, you know.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,080
Dammit.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,910
- What is that? Isn't that Lee Kyeong Woo? 
 - Huh?

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,450
♪ Stars flood the sky ♪

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,060
♪ So what you think about that? That, baby what do you think? ♪

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,630
♪ So what you think about that? I'm so curious about you ♪

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,430
♪ So I can feel your love, So I can smile ear to ear ♪

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,240
♪ Only think about me. Oh baby would you only look at me? ♪

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,990
Ugh, I'm so tired.

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,240
Who was it?

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,280
It was yours? Sorry.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,060
Do you want to have this then?

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,270
It's empty!

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,080
I can just buy you something right? Is anything fine?

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,700
Anything? Let's go together.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,740
One popsicle for me while you're at it!

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,430
Shut up.

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,230
But Joo Yeong wants a popsicle...

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,540
- Hey. 
- Yeah?

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,100
Shut up.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,330
- I think I should change my name to "shut up" from today. 
 - Yeah, suits you well.

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,650
Shut up.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,020
One minute. It's my mom.

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,050
Yeah, I am at the karaoke with my friends.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,070
Yeah, I'll be back before 9:00 pm. Hmmm.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,580
Hey!

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,700
- Hi. 
 - Yes?

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,940
Aren't you Lee Kaeng's girlfriend?

30
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,950
I saw you guys together earlier. What is our Lee Kyeong Woo's new girlfriend's name?

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,930
Hey. What does that matter? Let's just go.

32
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,640
- Who are you? 
 - Me? Oh, I'm Kyeong Woo's friend.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,170
Tell him you saw Jo Seung Min. He'll know.

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,260
Ah, why does his girlfriend not know anything? F*ck.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,340
She's not my girlfriend.

36
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,030
- This one is my girlfriend, you idiots. 
 - Do you want to get hit? Why am I your girlfriend, you crazy fool?

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,680
No, it's just that she was with you earlier.

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,540
Wow! You have a lot of girls.

39
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,480
Is it dating if we are together? Are you a kid, you fool?

40
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,370
Hey, but your girlfriend looks like she does some sports.

41
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,400
Look at that hunk.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,100
Crazy bastard.

43
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,810
How did you know? She does some sports.

44
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,440
Who is he?

45
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,110
You don't need to know. Hey, go inside with her.

46
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,040
- Ah, this f*cking girl. 
 - Hey hey hey! I was kidding. She's not my girlfriend.

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,470
Ah but... Why the f*ck do you act like you know me?

48
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,830
This punk! Meeting again after so long and you're being rude.

49
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,370
Ah, this is a shameless punk.

50
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,530
Ah, I saw Gong Joo Yeong too earlier. Shall I go greet him?

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,440
- Mind your business and go your way. 
 - Yeah. Let's just go.

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,650
The room they all went in earlier, was it there?

53
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,210
I told you to go, goddammit.

54
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,520
Go.

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,480
I just wanted to say hi. What's with the serious face?

56
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,750
Are we that close that you'd say hi?

57
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,330
Wow! Your bangs grew a lot.

58
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,240
What?

59
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,030
I heard your eye being like this isn't from getting beaten up by the guys.

60
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,130
I heard it was your dad who hit you.

61
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,630
I didn't even know that and felt sorry for nothing.

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,950
You should have told me.

63
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,590
If I'd known it, I would have understood.

64
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,250
- How did you know? 
- Is that important?

65
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,600
- F*ck.
 - What? You're going to hit me?

66
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,980
Hit me, hit me, you fool.

67
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,820
Hey what's with you?

68
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,980
Step out, you son of a b*tch.

69
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,300
I should go if he asks me to. Things haven't been that fun in a long while.

70
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,960
Love Revolution: Unprecedented case of Kyeong Woo's absence.

71
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,550
Episode 17. #LeeKyeongWoo MIA #Misunderstanding #Fight

72
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,000
bang_H @kyungwoo: Are you eating properly? ㅠㅠ

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,390
Kyeong Woo's absent today again.

74
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,930
He's not opening any of my texts, either.

75
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,560
Why is he suddenly out for two days in a row? This has never happened before.

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,580
This won't do. Let's find Kyeong Woo. We'll go to his house first.

77
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,370
Detective Ahn, get ready. We're going on a stakeout.

78
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,210
Gosh, there he goes again with another concept.

79
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,400
Hey, forget it. I'll just go and see.

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,620
You said he didn't open the door when you went yesterday.

81
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,030
Let's go together. We are in the same neighborhood anyway.

82
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,450
I'm going to the gym today. Ask him what the big deal is for me.

83
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,310
What's the point in walking around in a big group like this?

84
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,520
Should we choose some places where he might go and search there?

85
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,220
Fine. Then, Detective Gong and Detective Wang go to the internet cafe,

86
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,310
Detective Yang and I will check out the billiards place.

87
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,590
The suspect is very dangerous, so make sure to be careful —

88
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,210
Can you chill with your unfunny concepts already?

89
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,460
Joo Yeong!

90
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,170
Oh, hello ma'am. She is Kyeong Woo's mother.

91
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,320
Hello ma'am.

92
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,930
You guys are Kyeong Woo's friends? Did Kyeong Woo not finish at the same time as you?

93
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,310
- Uh that is, Kyeong Woo... went to study. 
- He went to the internet cafe.

94
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,610
Ah, he just left before us because he had some other plans.

95
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,050
Is that so? Goodness, where is he roaming around?!

96
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,800
Ma'am. Actually, Lee Kyeong Woo didn't come to school for the last two days.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,740
Huh?

98
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,550
This is not stuff to hide. These things should be told.

99
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,420
He didn't come to school? He surely wore his uniform when he left this morning.

100
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,660
Then where did he go?

101
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,900
Oh my, did he go cause trouble somewhere?

102
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,540
Oh, don't worry ma'am. Kyeong Woo doesn't get into trouble.

103
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,360
He is very diligent at school. I know it very well.

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,770
Is that so? Anyway thanks for telling me.

105
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,980
I've been working late the past few days so I couldn't take care of Kyeong Woo properly.

106
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,610
I think I should talk to him.

107
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,790
Yeah, Mom.

108
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,510
Rice, rice, rice. 
 (T/N: playing a game called "Barley-Rice")

109
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,030
Two plus... minus...

110
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,730
Hey what happened to you?

111
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,260
Hey, aren't you too much? You're ignoring my texts, calls, now even my words.

112
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't you have anything to tell me?

113
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,090
I am talking to you now. Ah. Did you eat anything?

114
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,840
- Uh? 
 - Are you like this because you don't know?

115
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,220
What are you saying? Did your mom scold you a lot yesterday? Is it because of that?

116
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,550
That was you too?

117
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,450
I was the one who told your mother.

118
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,220
F*ck, leave it. What can I talk with you about?

119
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,160
It's fine as long as I disappear.

120
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,090
Why was Lee Kyeong Woo like that earlier? Do you guys know?

121
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,210
We are also frustrated because we don't know.

122
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,880
It's strange. It's damn strange.

123
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,950
Lee Kaeng isn't someone who gets angry for no reason. What could it be?

124
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,370
Happy now? F*ck, you really can't take a hint.

125
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,600
Lee Kyeong Woo seemed to be sensitive about his bangs.

126
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,460
Yeah, that's right. He's hella sensitive about his bangs because of the scar on his forehead.

127
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,780
So we're finally putting together the unsolvable puzzle.

128
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,100
Lee Kyeong Woo's bangs were actually like a bomb that could go off at any time.

129
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,960
You better cut this unsightly hair immediately.

130
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,610
Shoot, I guess this is how I get caught in the end. 

131
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,420
Gong Joo Yeong, where are you? Save me!

132
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,260
You came for me, my friend!

133
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,700
Teacher! I have the hair clippers here!

134
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,730
This could happen. One hundred percent possible.

135
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,500
I'm 100% sure it's bullshit, idiots.

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,330
No, I'm sure it's not the bangs. In my opinion,

137
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,570
sseeing that Lee Kyeong Woo hurt his hand, he surely fought someone.

138
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,540
During the party, at the karaoke. That hell of a mean-looking jerk. Remember?

139
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,150
- Jo Seung Min? 
 - How do you guys know Jo Seung Min?

140
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,050
He was trying to start a fight with Lee Kyeong Woo.

141
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,350
He said he was Jo Seung Min, his middle school classmate.

142
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,340
You guys know him? You guys were also friends during middle school.

143
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,690
I don't really know him, because I transferred to that school only in the second year.

144
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,480
Jo Seung Min was trying to start a fight with me too, saying I seemed close to Lee Kyeong Woo.

145
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,920
Something like that might happen again.

146
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,250
Fill me in. I need to know so I can be prepared.

147
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,310
Did something happen between him and Lee Kyeong Woo?

148
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,670
Gosh. We also don't know everything.

149
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,220
In middle school, Lee Kyeong Woo

150
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,400
went around with Jo Seung Min's crew and didn't have much to do with us.

151
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,600
2 years ago, Ilsam Middle School

152
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,350
Gong Joo Yeong followed Lee Kyeong Woo around on his own and worried a lot about him.

153
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,180
Because actually, Jo Seung Min kind of—

154
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,790
So he liked Lee Kyeong Woo.

155
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,210
What bullshit is that?

156
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,940
What nonsense are you saying, seriously?

157
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,380
With my deep experience in investigation, I can sense something.

158
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,820
Shall we start from the time we met Jo Seung Min at the karaoke?

159
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,540
- She's not my girlfriend.
 -  At that moment,

160
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,150
- This one is my girlfriend, you idiots. 
 -  I got a hunch as soon as I saw the look on that guy's face.

161
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,580
Anyone could see what it was:

162
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,480
"This person is your girlfriend?"

163
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,820
Jealousy, of course.

164
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,300
In that case...

165
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
Jo Seung Min liked Lee Kyeong Woo,

166
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,270
and Lee Kyeong Woo liked Gong Joo Yeong,

167
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,090
but Gong Joo Yeong liked Jo Seung Min.

168
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,520
But Lee Kyeong Woo liked Gong Joo Yeong and Gong Joo Yeong liked Jo Seung Min,

169
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,950
but Lee Kyeong Woo liked Gong Joo Yeong.

170
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:09,480
And thus Lee Kyeong Woo, after learning all about this tragic tortuous love, grabbed Gong Joo Yeong by his collar today.

171
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,900
You guys should stop playing detective.

172
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,410
Why? It's possible. What do you think about my deduction, Gong Joo Yeong?

173
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,800
It's nothing like that.

174
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,790
Still, you guessed that Lee Kyeong Woo had a girl that he liked, I'll give you that.

175
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,540
Someone that he liked? Who?

176
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,640
I'm not sure. Lee Kyeong Woo didn't really tell us.

177
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,770
Gong Joo Yeong, you must have heard something, right?

178
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,380
Her name was...

179
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,210
Nam Yu Ri 
 ♫ The only place where I could rest ♫

180
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:52,400
♫ You alone are enough for me ♫

181
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,300
Hey give me your phone number.

182
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,000
What will I get if I give it to you?

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,070
You'll make a nice friend, that's all.

184
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,040
I have a hell of a lot of friends. Buzz off. 

185
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,660
Ah you will play hard to get? I will just ask Hyeong Bae then.

186
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,190
♫ Every day, every moment ♫

187
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,970
♫ Let's be together ♫

188
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,590
- That was crazy! 
- You're already so handsome!

189
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,520
Really! Why do you also sing well?!

190
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,400
My heart skipped a beat. I'm fainting.

191
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,530
I have to go now.

192
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,560
You are going already? Shall I walk you home?

193
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,990
Do you think I can't find my home?

194
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,350
Hey Lee Kyeong Woo! You walk me home.

195
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,910
Hey Nam Yu Ri! You said you don't need anyone to walk you home.

196
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,450
I know my address well, but I want Lee Kyeong Woo to know it as well.

197
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,910
Sure.

198
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,830
Your father isn't coming home tonight. You will come home, right?

199
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,230
Waaaa! Gosh!

200
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,940
What the heck, Lee Kyeong Woo? You're a total scaredy-cat!

201
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,960
Dammit. No, I'm not. Tie your hair, will you?

202
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,790
Ohhh you aren't? Then will you watch a horror film with me next time?

203
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,180
Why would I go watch a movie with you?

204
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,450
Why not? Do you have a girlfriend, by any chance?

205
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,780
 - What if I don't? 
 - I should seduce you.

206
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,970
- If I do? 
 - I should steal you from her.

207
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,200
Wow, you're spunky.

208
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,470
And you? Will you come to me if I seduce you?

209
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,150
I am not sure. I may or may not come. Depends on what you do.

210
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,840
Hey!

211
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,230
Hey hey hey hey hey, this is minus100 points. Hey, ah, don't do this.

212
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,320
Hey Lee Kaeng. We are going to the gaming cafe, come with us.

213
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,350
I have plans.

214
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,990
Nam Yu Ri?

215
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,190
Look at him smiling. This punk is dating!

216
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,190
Hey, how long has it been? How long?

217
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,920
Hey! Let's leave him and play just the three of us.

218
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,230
Hey! If I am born again

219
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,380
then I want to be born as Lee Kyeong Woo. The girls like only him.

220
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,140
Right. I am darned envious of you.

221
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,450
Hey can't you share your face?

222
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,950
Shut up.

223
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,700
Lee Kyeong Woo was probably the happiest at that time. He really liked Nam Yu Ri.

224
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,860
Then why did they break up?

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,400
That is... because of Jo Seung Min.

226
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,360
So it is a tragic love story. I was right, see?

227
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,850
Well, to some extent. Actually, I think Jo Seung Min liked Nam Yu Ri.

228
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,130
So he told weird stuff to other girls and made them spread rumors on purpose.

229
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,090
It's obvious what kind of rumors they were.

230
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,830
Kyeong Woo did you hear the rumor? 
- What rumor?

231
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,060
- Nam Yu Ri is already married.
 - Her second marriage too.

232
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,860
But her ex-husband came back alive. 

233
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,210
Hey!

234
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,020
What the hell is wrong with you? Did you eat something weird?

235
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,080
But if it was the reason for their breakup, then it must not have been a good rumor.

236
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,750
Yes, that is... It was saying Nam Yu Ri's relationships with guys were a bit problematic.

237
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,630
What a very pathetic rumor.

238
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,600
So? Lee Kyeong Woo believed that?

239
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,310
Back then we were young, so...

240
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,920
The rumor was one thing, but Jo Seung Min was the main factor, driving a wedge between them.

241
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,060
Hey! Did you hear the rumor? Nam Yu Ri and Hyeong Seung Jin—

242
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,870
Don't butt in. It is none of your business.

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,620
I was in contact with Nam Yu Ri, but it felt uncomfortable.

244
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,210
What are you saying?

245
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,880
Well, it is a bit awkward to say it myself,

246
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,950
but on the day we first met the girls from Baekchil Middle School, she contacted me first.

247
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,100
At first I thought she was interested in me

248
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,240
but after a few days, she started dating you. Honestly, I was baffled.

249
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,840
But now I am just interacting with her as a friend.

250
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,930
Ah f*ck. Friend? Interacting?

251
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,860
Hey. Whether you like her or not, she is dating me so shouldn't you have stopped contacting her?

252
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,360
I didn't contact her first. Today also she contacted me first.

253
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,820
Then you just don't have to reply.

254
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,880
Hey, you're making me upset. I am telling you because I'm worried, as your friend.

255
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,600
Nam Yu Ri is known to lie to get whatever she wants. I also almost fell for it a few times.

256
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,110
Hey Jo Seung Min, what are you trying to do since earlier?

257
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,730
Hey I am telling you because I am worried about you.

258
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,780
F*ck.

259
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,380
Wow, she's freaking pretty.

260
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,060
The advent of the crazy witch Nam Yu Ri. 

261
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,420
 Crazy bitch LMAO

262
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,180
Why is it so hard to see you these days?

263
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,300
Noona, read my message.

264
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
Darling! Did you wait long?

265
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,060
- Don't you have anything to tell me? 
 - What?

266
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,570
About what?

267
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:51,300

Then it was revealed that all the bad rumors at school about Nam Yu Ri were that jerk's doing.

271
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,110
On top of that, he also made bad rumors about Lee Kyeong Woo.

272
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,130
After that, Kyeong Woo suddenly got hospitalized.

273
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,450
Then how did he get hurt?

274
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,010
