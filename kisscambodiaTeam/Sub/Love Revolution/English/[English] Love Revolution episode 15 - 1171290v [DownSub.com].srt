00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,730
Wake up. You said you wanted to go together.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,540
♫ I wonder about every single thing about you  ♫

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,680
♫ May I ask? May I approach you? ♫

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,210
Hello birdies! 
 ♫ I keep on getting excited  ♫

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,630
Hi to you also, tree! Hi to you also, stairs!

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,980
Hi to you too trash!

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,450
Hello! It's a very good morning right?

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,650
- Hello, Ajumoni!
- Hey!

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,390
We're late. If you are done with this, let's go.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,740
Hi to you too, Darling!

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,570
It's hot. Stay away.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,960
Okay.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,300
You didn't miss me? I missed you a lot.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,390
- We saw each other yesterday. 
- But we didn't see each other in our dreams.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,490
What did you do yesterday? Were you very busy?

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,970
It's your fault that I didn't come in your dream.

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,640
Ah, so it's like that. I'll invite you more often then.

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,690
Where is the bracelet? Did your love cool down already?

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,120
It will be confiscated in school.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,510
Ah right!

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,100
You thought that much about this? I am touched.

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,450
Then let's wear it till we reach school.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,200
It looks good on you. Now, merge!

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,080
- Only till we go to school. 
 - Okay.

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,200
Love Revolution: Discount date 
 Episode 15.  #Collecting #JaRim's #Love #GrainAfterGrain

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,820
glasses @princess_0: Collect grains, you beggar 

28
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,650
We have to go separate ways already? How can I wait till recess time?

29
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,100
Why am I not in the same class as you?

30
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,720
- It would be nice if we were together. 
- We decided to go on a date this weekend, right?

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,940
- Lets watch a movie.
 - Yes, we did.

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,680
- I will book the tickets. 
- Go quickly.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
Okay.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,410
The bell sounds so sorrowful today.

35
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,840
It sounds better than the sound of your life ending because you're late on your first day.

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
Ja Rim!

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,310
Thankfully it looks like you guys all came through the holidays unscathed.

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,780
Yes!

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,960
Raise your hand if your homework has been left unscathed as well.

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,040
Who is the class president? Is it you?

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,550
Sorry? No, sir.

42
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,990
Teacher, it's me.

43
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,430
Ah right, it's you.

44
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,400
That was a bit too much...

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,180
Write down the names of those who didn't do their homework. Each will get two penalty points.

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,410
- Come on, Teacher! 
 - Be quiet.

47
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,850
Hey, that was too cruel.

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,500
Insufficient balance? 
 Ticket purchase - You have insufficient balance

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,760
Wait, what the?

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,510
Remaining Balance: 4,168 won (≈ $3.5)

51
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,760
What? Why do I have only this much left?

52
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,630
Did I get hacked?

53
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,580
Spending over the past few days:

54
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,710
100th day celebration couple bracelets - ₩80,000 (≈ $70)

55
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,230
Good mood on 100th day, bought snacks for friends - ₩31,000 (≈ $27)

56
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,110
Played the claw machine until I got a plushy to give to Ja Rim - ₩23,500 (≈ $21)

57
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,800
Bought lettuce under the insistent look of the street vendor grandma - ₩30,000 (≈ $26)

58
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,030
So I did use all this money.

59
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,580
What are you doing? You look like someone who's just been hit by reality.

60
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,370
Look at my remaining balance. I'm a total beggar this month.

61
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,040
Hey, so you have ₩4000.

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,920
- It is perfect for you to buy us each bread. 
- Shut up.

63
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,860
I have to go on a date with Ja Rim this weekend, but I'm screwed right now.

64
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,640
- Ask your parents for pocket money. 
- I can't.

65
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,130
I already feel bad about living on my own.

66
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,130
If they know I used up all my money I'll get scolded.

67
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,510
Part time job.

68
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,650
What kind of part-time job pays in advance?

69
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,310
- The date is this week. 
- Ask Wang Ja to pay.

70
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,590
- It's damn simple. 
 - Hey I can never do that! So embarrassing.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,110
Won't you help out a pitiful friend of yours

72
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,850
who is short on money for his date?

73
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,090
Just 40,000 won will be enough. Please lend me just 40,000 won, respected hyungnims! 
 (T/N: hyungnim is a respectful term for an older male)

74
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,720
If you only help me with 40,000 won (≈$35), I will treat you my whole life as my respected—

75
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,930
Where did they go?

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,050
- Did you book the tickets? 
- Huh?

77
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,260
Oh, uhm. No, not yet.

78
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,700
- Shall I do it? 
- No no no, I'll do it.

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,200
Hey, aren't you hungry? Should we go eat ramyeon at the convenience store?

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,150
- Shall we? Do you also wanna go? 
 - Huh?

81
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,990
Ra-ramyeon?

82
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,040
Remaining balance after eating convenience store ramyeon at ₩1500: ₩2668.

83
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,670
I should go and book the tickets quickly. What if they get sold out?

84
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,060
Ja Rim I'll contact you later.

85
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,290
You can just book the tickets with your phone, right? Why does he go home to do it?

86
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,380
- I'm so hungry. 
 - Me too. Let's go.

87
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,560
Last year I hid 10,000 won somewhere.

88
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,340
In this very book.

89
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,200
The bookmark...
 Seoteve Jobs

90
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,980
Hyung thank you, I'll use it well. 
Your loving brother Gong Jae Min

91
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,190
You're dead when I go home.

92
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,650
I'm out of rice too.

93
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,650
How will I manage?

94
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,970
What happened to this? Is it broken?

95
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,080
I don't even have money. I'm going crazy.

96
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,450
Father

97
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,790
Son, what is it this late in the night?

98
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,280
The air-conditioner is broken.

99
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,510
Oh no. Oh dear. 

100
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,590
Call after-sales services asap tomorrow.

101
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,530
It hasn't been a year since we bought it, so it will be free of cost.

102
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,700
Really?

103
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,150
Then right now...

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,730
Right, it's too late.

105
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,490
Are you sick?

106
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,770
Why do you look so terrible?

107
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,930
I stayed up all night because my air-conditioner is broken.

108
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,340
On top of that, I'm out of rice so I couldn't even eat one meal.

109
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,670
Now it is not Prince Wang Ja and Princess Gong Joo, it should be Prince and Beggar.

110
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,130
On this note, Kim Baeng... Could you lend 20,000 won to your pitiful friend

111
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,690
- out of the kindness of your heart? 
 - Yeah no, I'm a beggar too.

112
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,910
I'm so hungry.

113
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,380
Is it far till lunchtime?

114
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,770
The monitor at that internet café was, and I'm not even kidding, this big!

115
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,900
What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?

116
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,050
This... Sorry.

117
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,850
Hey Gong Joo Yeong! Let's go to the snack bar.

118
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,640
- Snack bar? 
- Yeah let's go.

119
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,840
N-No. I-I'm fine. I think I ate too much this morning, I don't feel too good.

120
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,730
What is wrong with him? Usually, he won't stay away from you for even one second.

121
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,060
Hey! He looks like he has starved for quite a few days.

122
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,950
- What are you guys watching? 
- Gaming broadcast.

123
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,820
I know that much. I meant to ask what game it is.

124
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,670
- LoL. 
 - Who is playing? Let's watch it together!

125
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,700
Pfft. Would you understand anything from watching?

126
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,450
Hey, I also like LoL!

127
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,880
Really? What's your tier?

128
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,100
Uuh, what was my tier again?

129
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,260
If you're that uninterested in it, then you're definitely Iron.

130
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,010
Does it mean you're good if you're Iron?

131
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,490
No, if you're Iron, Gosh...

132
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,020
If you don't know that also can you just get lost?

133
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,210
How about an iron-fist?

134
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,050
Hey Yang Min Ji. If you play LoL, want to come to the internet café this weekend?

135
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,090
This weekend? Shall I?

136
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,310
Okay. Then I'll contact you this weekend.

137
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,740
Okay.

138
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,250
Are you good at LoL?

139
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,330
I'm in power save mode, please don't bother me.

140
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,240
Hey! Help me!! I've helped you a lot all this while, right?

141
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,570
Plat 4 Support. Main chara Karma.

142
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,350
Does it mean you're good?

143
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,330
Well, to some extent?

144
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,890
Really? Then help me out please.

145
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,160
Thousand won per ten minutes.

146
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,410
Hey! Are you saying you are going to take money from your friend?

147
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,160
Three hundred won.

148
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,880
Customer, there is something called the market price. If I do it for this much, rumors will spread.

149
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,530
Five hundred.

150
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,780
Deal.

151
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,220
Deal.

152
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,200
- Tell your mother thank you for dinner. 
 - It's 10,000 won.

153
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,390
Are you crazy? I couldn't even eat properly.

154
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,890
Thinking about how I'll have to see Ja Rim without money, I couldn't swallow the food.

155
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,880
What are you saying when you even ate my share of the food?

156
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,200
Hey, stop wallowing in self-pity. You have many nice clothes.

157
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,270
Sell a few on second-hand goods sites. It should get you enough money for your date.

158
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,580
Oh! You are a genius!! Thanks, friend!

159
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,200
By the way, what is your mom making for tomorrow's breakfast?

160
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,570
You even want us to feed you breakfast too?

161
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:37,900
This is the t-shirt I wore on my first date with Ja Rim.

162
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,040
This is the one that Ja Rim selected for me.

163
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,470
This is the one I wore when I saw Ja Rim for the first time.

164
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,100
I had this?

165
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,020
Okay. I choose you.

166
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,650
Okay.

167
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,260
I wore this twice. It's in best condition. Bought it for 70,000, selling for 40,000, in person. 

168
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,960
I'll buy it.

169
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,180
Remaining balance: ₩4,168

170
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,680
Remaining balance: ₩44,168

171
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,130
(Youth tickets at 10,000 - discount of 2,000) * 2 = 16,000 

172
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,680
Balance: ₩44,168 - ₩16,000 = ₩28,168

173
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,380
It's the air-conditioning repair services!

174
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,960
Yes.

175
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,450
- Hello.
 - Hello.

176
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,410
- It is there. 
- Ah yes.

177
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,460
- It's over there? 
 - Yes.

178
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,000
I got it.

179
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,330
Let me have a look.

180
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,330
Ah, customer, I'm sorry but the model mentioned and this model

181
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,660
- are different.
 - Pardon?

182
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,750
The model mentioned is L and the model here is N.

183
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,560
- It's not possible. 
 - Take a look.

184
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,860
Ah sorry. Maybe I saw it wrong.

185
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,930
What to do? The free repair period for this model ended three days ago.

186
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,790
Then how much would it cost to repair it?

187
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, I'd have to open it but it'll probably be at least 50,000 won.

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,490
What would you like to do? Should I try to fix it?

189
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,430
Money left from buying the movie tickets: ₩28,168

190
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,050
No, I don't want to fix it.

191
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,210
Pardon? Will you be alright? When the room

192
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,030
- is this hot? 
- Ah. Well,

193
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,630
I was born on a hot day so it reminds me of my youth, I like it.

194
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,470
Ah, yes. Is that so? Well, all right then.

195
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,650
You just have to pay for my travel expenses then.

196
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,120
- Sorry? Travel expenses? 
 - Yes.

197
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,790
The travel expenses fees are normally waived during the free repair period, but that just ended.

198
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,530
- It's 20,000 won. 
 - 20,000 won?

199
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:24,500
Spending for travel expenses without having fixed the air-conditioning: Balance ₩8,168

200
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,730
Popcorn and cola are a must when watching a movie, but I'm too tight on money. If I buy only one cola—

201
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,670
What time does the movie start?

202
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,030
At 1:10.

203
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,320
We still have a lot of time. Let's just simply eat something and go.

204
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,430
- Food?
 - Yeah.

205
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,110
Aren't you hungry? Didn't you say you skipped breakfast?

206
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,360
I am fine though.

207
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,660
Do you want your stomach to gurgle out loud during the movie?

208
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,390
Let's eat and go.

209
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,090
Did you already start?

210
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,430
Ah, you came? You also join quickly. Loser buys lunch.

211
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,870
Deal.

212
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,970
Seafood risotto, please.

213
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,140
Did you choose?

214
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,950
Carbonara, 9000 won. Seafood pasta 22000 won. Pizza margherita 25000 won. 

215
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,720
Sh*t. It would be cheaper if I go to Italy and eat it!

216
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,280
You still didn't choose?

217
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,700
Uh, no, just...

218
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,250
- Give me one kids meal set. 
 - Pardon?

219
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,310
This one. The kids meal set.

220
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,360
I'm sorry, but we can only sell the kids sell for preschool children.

221
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,160
I've had a problem with herbal medicine...

222
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,130
- Give us rose pasta for him. 
 - Yes.

223
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,930
You like rose pasta.

224
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,650
Yeah, I do like them.

225
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,380
Wow, did you show off even though you're unranked?

226
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,410
I told you earlier that I created a new id because I forgot my password.

227
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,050
And such a high-ranked person lost to a minion? How many meals do you plan on buying me?

228
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,860
It's because I haven't warmed up enough yet. Let's get to it some more.

229
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,130
Leave it. I have to leave because I have an appointment.

230
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,320
Huh? You're leaving? We played only one game though.

231
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,920
Not to worry. The next contestant is waiting.

232
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,740
He's right on time.

233
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,630
Hi.

234
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,750
Then I am passing the lunch I won to Sang Hoon.

235
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,400
Hey Sang Hoon! You can just let Yang Min Ji buy you food.

236
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,830
- What? 
- No it's fine, you don't have to buy food.

237
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,860
- Ignore Kyeong Woo.
 - You guys figure it out.

238
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,370
I'm off.

239
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,370
Sorry. I came because Kyeong Woo called me, but I didn't know that the situation was like this.

240
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,570
Are you uncomfortable because of me?

241
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,090
- Shall we just leave? 
- Ah, no.

242
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,540
It's not like that. It's okay.

243
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,400
Then shall we play together?

244
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,940
Shall we?

245
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,560
Gosh you're damn bad at this. Stop playing you crazy cow. 

246
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,870
Hey you f***ker! You have a death wish!!?

247
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,680
- I want to use the restroom. 
- Okay.

248
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,110
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

249
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,540
Could you make me credit and I pay later, please?

250
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,750
If I leave this with you...

251
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,900
- No. The payment has already been done. 
 - Pardon?

252
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,620
The girl already paid.

253
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,940
Thanks for the meal.

254
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,860
You bought the tickets, it's a given I should buy lunch.

255
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,460
Still...

256
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,630
You're out of pocket money, right?

257
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,190
- Uh? 
- Why didn't you tell me?

258
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,780
- Because I was embarrassed.
- Why is this a thing to be embarrassed about?

259
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,170
Do you really like me? In a relationship where both like each other,

260
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,010
there shouldn't be any secrets, don't you think?

261
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,530
Sorry for making you concerned.

262
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:06,520
Just tell me next time. This makes me more concerned. And I am buying the popcorn and cola.

263
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,420
- You were the one who bought our food so I'll feel too bad— 
- Shut up.

264
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,210
- I'm buying everything today. I have only been receiving from you all this while— 
- Thank you, Ja Rim.

265
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,100
It's hot.

266
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,710
Ah but earlier didn't you say that it is a relationship where we like each other?

267
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,840
Then do you mean you also like me?

268
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,200
- Did I?
 - Yeah.

269
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,030
So you also like me now?

270
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,290
I don't know. Think whatever you want.

271
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,240
Anyway, having no money is nothing to be embarrassed about. So don't hide it from me.

272
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,330
Okay. Then...

273
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,240
What does Ja Rim think of as embarrassing?

274
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,890
Walking like this right now.

275
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,450
Our Ja Rim even talks in a fun way.

276
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,140
Where in the world is that fun?

277
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,790
♫ I like your smiling face the most ♫ 
 ♫ But the picture you posted today, where was it taken? ♫

278
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:09,010
♫ Why does it make me so anxious 
 when you are somewhere I’m not? ♫

279
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,590
♫ I like you  ♫

280
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,200
Love Revolution

281
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,920
Wang Ja Rim and Lee Kyeong Woo will

282
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,610
take pictures with the customers.

283
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,360
Hey you're totally pulling for us to be slaves!

284
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,730
Where is the handsome guy from your class?

285
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,730
Are they talking about Lee Kyeong Woo?

286
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,670
Exactly how many pictures are they going to take?

287
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,790
If I get some of the guys going to class 3 to come here instead,

288
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,100
there'll be fewer guys hanging around Ja Rim. 

289
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,120
Ja Rim, it's a concept, a concept! It's not for real! 

290
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,770
- What are you doing? 
- Can you set me up on a blind date?

291
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,070
Don't set him up on a blind date. 
- Why?

292
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,260
You like Lee Kyeong Woo right? 
- What?!
