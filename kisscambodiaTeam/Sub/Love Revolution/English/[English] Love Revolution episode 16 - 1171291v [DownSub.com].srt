1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,440
Guys, give some ideas for the class meeting. No one?

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,460
Come on, participate a bit. I'm tired. 
 Class meeting: Festival preparations

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,130
Each class gets a 200,000 won support fund, right?

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,750
Then what about choosing a representative for each class and holding a combat competition? Awesome.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,890
Amazing, right? I, we've got the victory unconditionally secured, I tell you.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,860
We take an admission fee and make people bet too.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,180
Hey, if we give food to her as her fighting fee, then it'll be cheap for us!

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,960
I don't need fighting fee to make you guys shut up.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,070
Hey, this might be fun. We will get reported for school violence also. Don't joke around.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,440
Let's do nail art. There are many people in our class that go to beauty academy.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,830
Ah I like the idea. Let's do nail art.

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,550
Nail art? It does sound good, but everyone in the class should have a role.

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,720
Let's keep that on the side for now and think of what to do as the main activity.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,680
Let's just do a cafe just like other classes. Hey Lee Kyeong Woo you have worked part-time in a cafe, right?

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,820
"Customer what would you like to order?"

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,780
Your fake capitalistic smile was quite something.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,500
Right, he's good at it. You can just teach the others.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,560
Shut your trap.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,000
Many classes are already doing a cafe so it would be nice if we had a concept...

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,710
Something enough to attract people, isn't there anything like that?

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,010
For a cafe, we need a hot guy and hot girl part-timers.

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,600
Where would we have such hot girl and guy in our class?

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,730
Ah yeah! Those two over there.

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,120
You both can do the advertising.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,300
On a closer look, don't they look good together?

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,140
- Crazy.
- What the hell are you saying to a girl with a boyfriend.

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,980
Just that both of them are the prettiest and most handsome ones, right?

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,460
What is so handsome about Lee Kyeong Woo? Such a snotty teenager.

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,420
I think it will be better to do a cafe with a pretty photo zone where we take photos for the customer.

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,130
Hm, nice idea. You are clicking pics with them, right?

31
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,070
- Uh? 
- You said uh, that was a yes.

32
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,710
This doesn't sound bad. Then whoever the customer requests has to take a picture with them.

33
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,800
Okay good.

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,100
Okay. Then.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,760
Wang Ja Rim and Lee Kyeong Woo will both advertise and take pics with the customers.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,720
Hey hey hey hey hey! This is total slave treatment.

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,260
It's okay. Fighting.

38
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,420
- Fighting!
 - Yaaay!!

39
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,550
Let's choose something from the ideas Teach Dokgo suggested. A reading game classroom,

40
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,840
a math quiz classroom, or a smoking prevention activity.

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,080
- Gosh, that went to far. 
 - I really hate it.

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,030
What about an atomic and chemical attack experience game? I have enough gas ready.

43
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,590
- Gosh, stop that. 
 - Someone stop him.

44
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,890
Then a massage parlor? The Thai way.

45
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,110
Sawasdee khap, khop khun khap. 
 (T/N: "Hello" and "Thank you" in Thai.)

46
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,730
Hey stop him right there.

47
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,020
Ah, let him be. Listening to him, it's better than the ones recommended.

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,080
- Is there anything fun? 
 - Hey Gong Joo Yeong. Don't you have any ideas?

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,930
Right! What happened to you?

50
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,960
Ja Rim isn't even here.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,490
You guys do it yourself.

52
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,600
Then we should just do what Dok Teach tells us to do.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,490
There's the smoking prevention awareness I mentioned,  the scientific experiments,

54
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,740
- and the business management board game... 
 - Gosh, that's no fun.

55
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,290
Damn.  Why am I not in the same class as Ja Rim?

56
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,960
Oh? Then your class is also doing a cafe?

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,880
Nope. At first, it was supposed to be a cafe but it changed to a no-alcohol cocktail bar.

58
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,380
Your class is doing a cafe?

59
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,620
The homeroom teacher barely gave us permission. You should come by!

60
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,200
I think I'll be busy serving for our class.

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,470
Then I'll come over.

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,990
As you wish. I am going to sleep now.

63
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,700
Okay. Sleep well and let's meet in our dreams.

64
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,250
Do dreams go according to your wish? Just sleep.

65
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,960
Dream of Ja Rim. Ja Rim should appear in my dreams.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,910
Love Revolution: Festival 
 Episode 16. #TheStar #OfTheFestival #IsMe #It'sMe

67
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,530
princess_0 @bang_H: Yup today's wallflower is you

68
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,120
The day of the festival.

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,030
The 8th Yisam Art Festival

70
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,870
Yisam Information High

71
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,230
DIY Perfume

72
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,300
Come to the corridor of class 7

73
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,550
- Don't eat it! 
 - I didn't eat any!

74
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,450
- Oh, 5,000 won (≈ $4). 
 - No, it's 10,000 for you (≈$9).

75
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,820
"You just have to do it." "Patience is bitter but its fruits are sweet."

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,760
Gosh, your classroom is quite a sight to see.

77
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,820
What the hell is your class's concept that you look like this?

78
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,410
Headband— Ugh.

79
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,320
It's a cocktail bar where we take pictures.

80
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,810
I have to take pics like this with the customers.

81
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,670
One minute. Everyone in your class is like this?

82
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,080
- Yeah. 
 - Every single one?

83
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,430
Yeah.

84
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,220
What the hell. Where is Ja Rim?

85
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,640
Inside.

86
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,780
Where is Ja Rim?

87
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,200
There.

88
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,330
Heart attack.

89
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,770
Hey, what made you collapse?

90
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,830
Ja Rim, you are so pretty. Let's not take this off forever.

91
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,170
Are you out of your mind? I am being forced to do this.

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,310
Ja Rim Ja Rim. Pic pic pic.

93
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,690
- Look here. 
- Don't do this!

94
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,360
- There. One, two, three. 
- If you give 500 won,

95
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,930
we take professional quality pictures for you in the photo zone over there.

96
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,590
Okay.

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,820
Hey here's  ₩5000. Take 10 pics of us for me.

98
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,480
Customer, let me escort you this way.

99
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,660
Ja Rim, I paid for it so take pics with me.

100
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,590
Really!

101
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,130
Just click some, he even paid money. Don't think that it's Gong Joo Young.

102
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,590
With this amount, he's a big investor for us.

103
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,960
Think of it as "for our class." There!

104
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,390
A bit affectionately.

105
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,540
Smile a bit. Yeah yeah yeah, you look really sh*tt—

106
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,170
No no no, you look very good. I'll take it now. One, two, three.

107
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,360
Okay. One, two, three.

108
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,100
One, two, three.

109
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,160
One, two, three.

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,360
- It's coming out well right? 
 - Yeah it's coming out very well.

111
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,170
- Hey should we also go and ask to click pics? 
 - Please click some pics for us also.

112
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,590
Okay. Give me your phone, your phone.

113
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,090
Hey, actually,

114
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,080
I'll take ten more pics after these ten. Take mine first!

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,860
Ah, wait a bit. I'm sorry but wait a few more minutes.

116
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,710
- I'll take some more. One, two, three. 
 - Then it's me first.

117
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,430
Nice nice nice.

118
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,710
Ah, she's freaking pretty.

119
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,520
Is she human?

120
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,560
It's running smoothly.

121
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,910
It's running very smoothly, without their homeroom teacher even having to lift a finger.

122
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,900
Then I guess you have lifted all ten fingers, Teacher Dok. Which results in this.

123
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,830
But why are you laughing?

124
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,460
My students show unity, it's quite nice to see.

125
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,020
You must be happy they are so calm and quiet.

126
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,450
- Let me go, let me go! 
 - Stop it, come on.

127
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,510
Obstruction of business? What the hell are you talking about?

128
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,330
You've got over 10,000 won with just what I spent in your class. Don't talk nonsense— Oh!

129
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,620
Good morning.

130
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,100
Sure.

131
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,890
Your class is increasing our classroom's performance. I'm so thankful.

132
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,540
Okay, done.

133
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,440
Have a cocktail before you leave. The people who had nail art have a 10% discount.

134
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,410
- Hello. 
 - We got a discount coupon.

135
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,510
Ah, yes thank you. Please go that way and wait for a bit.

136
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,940
- You have to pay in advance. 
 - Here are your drinks.

137
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,380
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy. 
 - Thank you for coming. Welcome.

138
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,270
It looks so good!

139
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,120
Please take a good picture.

140
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,380
Hyung Byeong Hoon!

141
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,820
Oh Namgoong. Did you come to have fun?

142
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,090
Yeah, Noona Ah Ram told me about this. But, where is Noona's class?

143
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,260
I know, I know. Sit here for now.

144
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,080
- Sit down. Remove your shoes. 
- Why? What are you doing?

145
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,670
When you do sports, meditation is a must.

146
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,160
Follow my lead. I'll teach you how to breathe with your brain.

147
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,620
Ah Hyung, I am fine. I'll just go to Noona's class.

148
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,220
You do sports! So you have to clear your mind.

149
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,790
Get in position. Breathe in.

150
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,890
Breathe out while rotating your head.

151
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,000
Breathe in.

152
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,620
Breathe out rotating your head to the right side.

153
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,910
Breathe in.

154
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,460
Breathe out and rotate to the left again.

155
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,290
I thought I was going to die. It's some brain respiration but you have to rotate your head so much.

156
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,130
Why didn't you just die? What are you going to drink?

157
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,100
Don't you have Hawaiian punch?

158
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,610
If you don't want to get hit by a Korean punch then choose from the menu.

159
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,600
I don't know anyway. Just give me anything.

160
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,490
- Here you go. 
- And by the way,

161
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,300
can you take a pic with me?

162
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,010
Aigoo, come this way. One pic is  ₩500.

163
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,510
- Take one with me too. 
 - I'll take it now.

164
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,490
- One, two, three.

165
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,500
Damn.  How many does she have to click?

166
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,750
Will you really take pics with us if we come?

167
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,280
- Yeah yeah.
 - Really? 
 - Ah but it's expensive!

168
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,650
What's wrong with him?

169
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll take it. One, two, three.

170
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,280
- Should we do one more each? 
 - Should we?

171
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,840
Not even an ant is coming to our class.

172
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,060
Did you see Dokgo Moon's face earlier? He looked so sour.

173
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,110
Hey, hey. Shouldn't we do something?

174
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,830
I don't care.

175
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,730
Oh hey, by the way, lend me some money.

176
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,100
I have to click pics with Ja Rim, but I already ran out of money.

177
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,420
Do you think you can use money to handle the problem until the end of the festival?

178
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,480
It'd be easier to stop the guys from going there.

179
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,340
If we steal some male customers from class 3,

180
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,840
then there will be fewer guys sucking up to Ja Rim.

181
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,150
Anything we can use here?

182
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,940
Hey hey hey. I got a pretty nice idea. Come here.

183
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,110
Hey! There's a super fun event in class 2 right now, come quickly.

184
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,700
- Ah come quickly! 
 - What is it?

185
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,460
- Come and see. 
 - Let's go see!

186
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,570
What is it?

187
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,100
- Where are you going? 
- To the restroom. 
 - To the restroom.

188
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,040
I have a stomachache.

189
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,000
'Human sandbag'
 We take your hits. 500 won for 1 minute. 

190
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,650
A boyfriend who cheated

191
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,400
Ah, wait a second, wait.

192
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,330
Hey. We change places every 30 minutes. No running away.

193
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,520
I got it. How many times will you tell us?

194
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,260
But isn't this idea too old-fashioned?

195
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,560
Look. I think all of class 3's customers are here now.

196
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,380
Don't you know "oldies but goodies"?

197
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,660
But why am I "a boyfriend who cheated"?

198
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,030
There is nothing better than this to attract a woman's fist.

199
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,760
Hey! I can get hit by a man too. Are you looking down on me?

200
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,600
Then do you want to change with me?

201
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,980
Ah you scared me. What is this? Take it away.

202
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,050
I will let you hit me.

203
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,090
Take this, take it!

204
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,280
- A bit more. 
 - You've gone over one minute!

205
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,540
- Okay, get this! 
 I will let you hit me 

206
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,580
 Human sandbag

207
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,180
Wow! Gosh.

208
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,230
Hey. Doesn't it hurt?

209
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,690
Hey. It actually doesn't hurt a bit, but I have to act like it hurts so that customers come.

210
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,200
He says so. I think you can hit him as much as you want.

211
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,720
Hey, if you bring in a real fighter...

212
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,560
then what do I do?

213
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,070
Yes yes yes. One minute is over.

214
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,300
Okay, next customer.

215
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,870
Ja Rim this is only a concept. It's not true. 
 Boyfriend who cheated

216
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,670
What are you doing? You don't have anything better to do than to get hit for money?

217
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,530
Ay customer, if you're going to hit him then you must pay first.

218
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,760
- Why are you asking for money? 
- We should collect what has to be collected.

219
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,210
Hey, I am reserving him for 20 minutes.

220
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,140
Y-You aren't hitting me?

221
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,090
No way. Is it because you don't like to see me getting hit?

222
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,570
Think as you wish.

223
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,370
- Thank you. 
 - Don't.

224
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,860
The others are all here.

225
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,950
Then let's go somewhere else. Let's go see what the other classrooms are doing.

226
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,090
- Hey, where are you going? 
- Hey, Ja Rim gave  ₩10,000.

227
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,770
Awesome.

228
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,760
I have been reserved for 20 minutes. Help me get this off.

229
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,020
Hey! Next person.

230
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,280
- Ah quickly. 
 - You do it quickly.

231
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,370
Min ji.

232
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,100
Oh hi. Did you come to hang out?

233
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,640
Yes, because we have some time and I heard that your cocktails are tasty.

234
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,290
Ah, you just have to order here and get it from Ah Ram.

235
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:55,020
Hey, where is the handsome guy from your class? Was his name Lee Kyeong Woo?

236
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,060
- Come on. 
- Why?

237
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,690
Why him?

238
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,490
- Ah to click a pic with him? 
- No it's fine if he's not there.

239
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,010
- Ah Ram. An apple mojito for me. 
 - Okay.

240
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,680
Hey. I think it is him. What are you going to do?

241
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,760
Stop it. Wait.

242
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,430
- Hey. 
 - Yeah?

243
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,460
She wants to click a pic with you.

244
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,120
- It's mandatory to buy a drink. 
- Here.

245
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,160
Oh Ye Seul is here. Hi!

246
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,480
Ja Rim hi.

247
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,070
What? You guys know each other?

248
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,530
We went to the same middle school.

249
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,960
- I'll clean this up for you.
 - Hey, aren't you leaving now?

250
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,910
What? I feel like not even five minutes have passed.

251
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,240
I already ordered a drink. Take a boyfriend-like picture, please.

252
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,730
Okay.

253
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,460
Enjoy!

254
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,540
One, two, three.

255
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,560
Your cocktails are really tasty.

256
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,050
Ah Ram makes them well.

257
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,660
Min Ji, are you close with Lee Kyeong Woo?

258
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,390
- Just a bit I guess. 
 - He doesn't have a girlfriend, right?

259
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,830
Can you introduce me to him?

260
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,370
- Him? 
 - Yeah. By any chance does he have a girlfriend?

261
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,880
He probably doesn't. But he's not that good.

262
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,670
Why? He seemed a good guy.

263
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,220
Right, he hangs out with Gong Joo Yeong so he won't be a bully.

264
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,830
I'm not sure, I don't really know.

265
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,140
For now, just ask him. I'll go now.

266
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,530
Okay.

267
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,300
- Don't set them up. 
 - Huh?

268
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,960
- Lee Kyeong Woo, don't set him up. 
 - Why?

269
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,680
You like Lee Kyeong Woo, right?

270
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,090
What? What the hell are you saying? Why would I? You crazy?

271
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,280
Really? If not, then fine.

272
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,690
No! What is there to like about that snotty teen idiot?

273
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,370
The girl who likes him is the weird one.

274
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,870
Hey, if it's not so, it's not so.

275
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,910
Overreacting much?

276
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,040
- What is it? 
- You

277
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,060
want to go on a blind date?
 - Suddenly?

278
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,420
- I don't. 
 - Hear the whole thing before you answer.

279
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,500
It's the girl from before, the one who took a pic with you.

280
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,080
Were there 1 or 2 people that took pics with me? I don't want to.

281
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,830
Just take a look at her before saying this.

282
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,930
It's her. 
  Ye Seul

283
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,060
Ah her?

284
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,900
Not interested. Work hard.

285
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,320
Hey, this is considered pretty!

286
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,620
Forget it, tell her I have a girlfriend. I'm off.

287
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,490
He doesn't even have a girlfriend, so why?

288
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,170
Hey, I couldn't try it. Can I try now for ₩500?

289
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,820
No way! After Oh Ah Ram hit me I got PTSD. 
(Post Traumatic Stress Disorder)

290
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,830
Hey Wang Ja, what was that earlier? Paying ₩10,000 and taking Gong Joo away?

291
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,130
Don't tell me you didn't want your boyfriend getting hit?

292
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,830
Yeah, that's right. It was to save me.

293
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,760
She is my prince. My prince, when will you go on a date with your princess?

294
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,480
Do you want to get hit now for the ₩10,000 that I paid?

295
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,860
If you act cute again while singing, you're dead.

296
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,930
It also makes me cringe when you force your voice to be lower when singing, you know.

297
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,400
- Gosh, seriously. 
 - Dammit.

298
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,310
What is that?

299
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,130
- Isn't that Lee Kyeong Woo? 
 - What?

- He didn't come today either. 
- Ah this bastard, suddenly skipping for two days.

306
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,860
Seeing that Lee Kyeong Woo's hand is hurt, he surely fought someone.

307
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,230
- Cho Seung Min?
- Hi. You're Lee Kaeng's girlfriend right?

308
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,250
- She's not my girlfriend. 
- Your eye.

309
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,720
- You said that you didn't get hit by those hyungs. 
 - F*ck.

310
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,560
I think he is a bit sensitive about his bangs. 

311
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,710
It's like trying to solve a difficult puzzle.

312
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,330
Lee Kyeong Woo was probably the happiest at that time. He really liked Nam Yu Ri.

313
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,420
Will you come to me if I seduce you?

314
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,270
I am not sure. Seeing what you do.

315
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,340
Then why did they breakup?

316
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,950
