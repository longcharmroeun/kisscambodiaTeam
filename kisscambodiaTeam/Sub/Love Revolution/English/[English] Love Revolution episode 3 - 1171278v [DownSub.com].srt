00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,340
I'm still half asleep.

3
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,360
It's 8 degrees hotter than it was at this time yesterday.

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,990
Due to the abnormally high temperatures, we anticipate a very hot day.

5
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,070
The cause of the abnormally high temperatures 

6
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,460
is my burning love for you.

7
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,150
I need to sleep. This is all because I'm tired.

8
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,420
What's all the fuss, so early in the morning? Did you have a dream?

9
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,020
What the hell are you doing in my room?

10
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,630
Stop touching my things!

11
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,670
Goodness. You lent my clothes to someone else, and now what? Nice double standard there!

12
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,860
Your pimples have sprouted in such nice locations!

15
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,630
- Have you decided what to wear for the retreat? 
 - Retreat?

16
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,470
- Don't we all just wear our gym uniforms? 
 - No, I mean on the way there.

17
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,510
Also, even with our gym uniforms, we have to make it seem like we effortlessly look good.

18
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,880
Is it possible to do that with our school's gym uniforms?

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,260
I am capable of accomplishing that very difficult task.

20
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,720
Ja Rim!

21
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,870
- Hello! Hi! 
 - Hi.

22
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,920
- I dreamt of you yesterday. 
 - I didn't ask.

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,330
Should I tell you what kind of dream it was? Aren't you super curious?

24
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,880
I really don't care at all.

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,290
Really? Then I'll just cherish it all by myself.

26
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,240
Anyway, it made me so happy. Thanks for coming out in my dream.

27
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,300
- Then give me my appearance fee. 
 - An appearance fee?

28
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,630
Okay, I have an appearance fee for you. Appearance fee...

29
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,190
Tada! This is a very precious thing

30
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,160
that my mother prepared especially for me. It'll probably be good for acne, too.

31
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,590
I happened to have something like this on a day your acne was acting up.

32
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,620
As expected, we are meant to b...

33
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,970
Hey!

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,910
Ah Ram likes it. Bring some again next time, too.

35
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,770
I brought that for you.

36
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,370
Wang Ja, something happened on the day it rained, huh?

37
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,900
What the hell are you saying?

38
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,660
I'm just saying because you and Gong Joo Yong seem to be a little different these days.

39
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,360
I think you're kind to him.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,270
Are you sure we were walking together? When was I nice to him?

41
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,260
Even just a few days ago, you ignored him. But now you respond to everything he says.

42
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm not responding to it, but retorting.

43
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,100
Good. On a scale of 0, no interest, to 10, would date, where are you?

44
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,980
- Zero. 
 - Awesome!

45
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,800
What the hell? I said zero.

46
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,670
I mean, you always start at -10, so 0 is quite far.

47
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,460
If it continues like this, you'll be dating in no time.

48
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,260
Stop talking about Gong Joo Young. Why do you keep trying to pair us together?

49
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,310
It's just because it's good to see you get along with him.

50
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,060
There's no reason not to get along with him, since he's not a bad kid.

51
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,410
Then there is at least a small chance you could end up dating him.

52
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,630
Be quiet. A rat is listening.

53
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,950
Hey, Lee Kyeong Woo. You're awake, aren't you?

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,300
♫ Careless, careless, shoot anonymous, anonymous  ♫

55
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,700
♫ heartless, mindless, no one who cares about me ♫

56
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,750
♫ I've lost it ♫

57
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,010
What the hell is going on here?

58
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,570
These punks are going to participate in the retreat talent show.

59
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,020
You slaves for attention.

60
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,310
Isn't that a given? It's a chance for me to appeal to Ja Rim.

61
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,880
You doing a courtship dance? Plus, the stage will look hella empty if it's just the two of you dancing.

62
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,220
Hella lame, too.

63
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,780
We have three people though.

64
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,320
One, two, three!

65
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,680
Are you crazy? Why would I participate in your class's talent show?

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,230
The kids in my class would curse me.

67
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,810
Nah, if you're the Kyeong Woo I know, you'll definitely help me.

68
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,950
We're real friends, aren't we?

69
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,150
You only ask for loyalty when it's in your favor.

70
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,860
Here. This is loyalty.

71
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,530
Holy...

72
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,610
I really didn't want to dance, but...

73
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,360
Anything for a friend.

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,860
Jesus, he's a slave to capitalism.

75
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,270
I can't just give this to you. I'm going to take video proof.

76
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,760
Vow to participate in the retreat talent show.

77
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,880
Hey, do we have to do this? Between us?

78
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,560
I, Lee Kyeong Woo, vow to participate in the retreat talent show with Gong Joo Young.

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,090
Happy?

80
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,600
Hmm... Don't you have more?

81
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,650
- I guess I'll just use these. 
 - Okay, okay!

82
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,090
I'll raise you to diamond level.

83
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,420
Are you crazy? How could he become diamond?

84
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,420
It's already unbelievable that you're platinum.

85
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,340
Okay! Here.

86
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,130
You're a real friend, knowing when to spend.

87
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,580
We're going to practice at my house later, so swing by, okay?

88
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,450
Why would you practice at home? Let's just practice right here, you jerk.

89
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,710
Yang Min: How is this?

90
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,620
It's a bit agressive.

91
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,460
Ah Rong: What about this instead?

92
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,320
LOL. You're crazy.

93
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,990
Is this a competition to see how aggressive we can look?

94
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,950
Wang Ja, what are you gonna wear? 

95
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,510
I dunno. I'll just decide whatever when the day comes.

96
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,420
Whatever what? We can't match.

97
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,630
Hurry up and give a pic.

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,420
I almost forgot about this.

99
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,940
No way. Are you giving this to me?

100
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,660
It was originally yours, you know.

101
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,870
I'm so touched. I understand your feelings.

102
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,360
Then, I have something to give you as well.

103
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,800
Please marry me.

104
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,360
Why do you overreact every time I'm just a little bit nice to you?

105
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,030
Hey, Wang Byeol Rim.

106
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,010
What?

107
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,210
What is it?

108
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,130
Hey, what are you doing? We need to practice.

109
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,360
Ten-minute break.

110
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,960
We've been on a break after practicing for 10 lousy minutes.

111
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,610
I'm in a feeble state right now.

112
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,970
A trusted friend stabbed me in the back.

113
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,890
Stop and help me out. This is really important to me.

114
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,730
I'm going to sing a confession song after I dance too.

115
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,210
Are you out of your mind?

116
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,940
If you do that now, it'll have the opposite effect. Events like that only work when the time is ripe, you moron.

117
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,000
I also think that's a bit ... rushed.

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,120
Exactly. But this punk has messed up his timing from the beginning anyway.

119
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,810
Goodness, hey!

120
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,400
You don't even know what happened between me and Ja Rim on that rainy day.

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,160
Ja Rim's heart has already moved towards me. Then I have to go meet her on the other end.

122
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,800
Hey, Wang Ja Rim says she has zero feelings for you.

123
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,300
Emotional Quotient: 0

124
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,920
- What do you mean? 
 - I wasn't going to tell you, thinking you'd be disappointed,

125
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,170
but I heard the girls talking about it in the classroom earlier. On a scale of 0-10 of her feelings for you,

126
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,910
she says she's at zero.

127
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,250
Emotional Quotient: 0

128
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,490
Hey, th-that's just her hiding her feelings in front of her friends!

129
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,260
Idiot...

130
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,910
Wang Ja Rim: Come out.

131
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,910
Hey, Ja Rim texted me to come out.

132
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,330
She says to come out. Is this a zero? Is it?

133
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,310
I'm off, ya losers.

134
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,930
Oppa, are you Gong Joo Yeong?

135
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,760
Huh? Yes, but who...

136
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,670
I'm Wang Ja Rim's—

137
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,490
I'm Unni Ja Rim's younger sister. She says to give this to you.

138
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,870
This...

139
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,130
Don't you have something to give me?

140
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,190
Hey, what did she say? Did she ask you out?

141
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,590
You met Wang Ja Rim, so why the long face?

142
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,240
That's an expression you would make when you expected to see Wang Ja Rim,

143
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,980
but saw her younger sister instead. That kind of vibe.

144
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,750
I saw it with my mind's eye.

145
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,190
You guys really... Let's maintain some privacy.

146
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,720
Tell your sister thanks, I used it well.

147
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,580
These are my clothes, though.

148
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm back!

149
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,060
Money.

150
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,160
But is he really your friend? Be honest.

151
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,340
What the hell do you mean?

152
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,860
You even let a guy borrow some clothes. So out of character!

153
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,370
It's not like that.

154
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,750
At the very least, he definitely likes you.

155
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,730
- Is that what he said? 
 - Nope!

156
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,200
Look at this! I mean, why did he package borrowed clothes that he's returning?

157
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,100
That's hella funny!

158
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,600
Wow... He even sprayed perfume. This isn't any ordinary devotion.

159
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,490
Even my heart is all fluttery!

160
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,920
Then you can date him.

161
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,990
Poor him. Why did he have to like Wang Ja Rim?

162
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,360
- This one? 
 - Please load it up for me.

163
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,040
I'll put it in for you.

164
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,560
Ja Rim!

165
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,260
Peanuts

166
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,780
Eat some in the bus when you get bored. Nuts are good for acne.

167
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,790
Wow, how thoughtful.

168
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,600
It's for Ja Rim.

169
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,540
Rude. Let's go, Min Ji.

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,190
Everyone put your hands above your heads!

172
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,060
Close your eyes!

173
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,330
I ask all students hiding forbidden objects to reveal them now, voluntarily.

174
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,960
If you hand them over now you won't be liable.

175
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,550
However, if they are found after investigating your belongings, there will, of course, be penalty points

176
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,270
but also an excruciating physical training.

177
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,010
Alright. At ease!

178
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,610
Teaching assistants, guide them.

179
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,920
Class 3. Open your bags and wait.

180
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,550
- They're snacks. 
 - Of course, they're snacks. Anybody could see that.

181
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,620
Close your eyes.

182
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,630
Pringle Potato Chips

183
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,830
It's smoke snacks?

184
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,780
Why are there so many? Are you operating a business?

185
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,560
Do you think it's the first or second time I'm dealing with guys like you?

186
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,130
I know all of your methods, so just take them out in advance.

187
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,950
I didn't bring it.

188
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,370
- What?  
 - Cleansing foam.

189
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,780
Can't you just use mine?  I use hypo-allergenic too.

190
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,680
My skin is sensitive when I have pimples, so I can only use my products.

191
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,400
- I'm totally screwed. 
 - Hey, let's go.

192
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,740
Why are you guys coming only now?

193
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,270
What's with our homeroom teacher all of a sudden? Everyone else is resting but we're the last ones out!

194
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,770
Hong Jin Hui (17/High School student) 
 The one with long arms and legs

195
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,380
It'll already be dinner time in a little bit.

196
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,750
All students are to stand out in the hallways against the walls. We will take attendance.

197
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,310
Take attendance again? They did it already.

198
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,940
Hey, apparently someone disappeared.

199
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,300
I think it's Gong Joo Yeong.

200
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,030
Lee Kyeong Woo was asking where he was.

201
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,630
Why? Do you know him?

202
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,940
It is getting late, so we will proceed to dinner.

203
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,300
We will move according to classes.

204
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,050
Left, face!

205
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,330
Forward march!

206
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,720
Yes, sir!

207
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,400
Kim Baeng. Did he not say anything to you? You're in the same class.

208
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,580
I'm not sure. He was there when we were emptying our bags, but all of a sudden he was nowhere to be seen.

209
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,490
What is he? He normally doesn't do this.

210
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,850
- Surely he didn't go to buy alcohol— 
 - Come on!

211
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,740
So you ordered him to... and then you're pretending not to know...

212
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,100
- Hey, Wang Ja. Did he not say anything to you?
 - He didn't.

213
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,970
I don't know about you guys but Gong Joo Yeong really didn't seem like that type of kid.

214
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,230
What do you mean, "I don't know about you guys"? I live a very proper life, you know?

215
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,910
- A properly smooth-talking life, you mean? 
 - I don't smoke!

216
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,890
Good for you. Why'd it come out of your bag, then?

217
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,100
I only brought that to sell it.

218
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,290
- Why isn't he answering his phone? 
 - Maybe there's no signal?

219
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,930
We're in the mountain in the middle of nowhere, he could have no phone signal.

220
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,670
Hey, there.

221
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,780
Wow, that bastard really...

222
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,660
Where did you go, princess? ( T/N "Gong Joo" is a homonym for "princess.")

223
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,720
He's Cinderella, Cinderella.

224
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Why doesn't he come back as the clock strikes midnight, while he's at it?

225
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,200
- Where did you go?
 - I ...

226
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,200
- I went to buy something I had forgotten to bring. 
 - What is it?

227
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,760
There are no stores nearby here, exactly how far did you go?

228
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,800
To the city. I didn't know it would be that far. I thought I could come right back.

229
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,960
Whether you go far or near, unauthorised outings are prohibited!

230
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,180
This will go on your record, you know?!

231
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,030
I'm sorry.

232
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,230
Since we're not at school right now,

233
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,740
let's follow the rules of this retreat center.

234
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,960
Instructor, I'll leave him to you.

235
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,230
Oh, right.

236
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,450
Do 50 squat jumps first.

237
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,120
- STAT! 
 - Yes.

238
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,300
Hey, hey.

239
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,820
Bonajour Milk Cleanser

240
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,470
Where did you get this? Is it yours?

241
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,300
No, somebody said to give this to you and then left.

242
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,230
Hey, that bowl cut dude...

243
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,910
He's Gong Joo Yeong, isn't he?

244
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,190
Hey.

245
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,650
You went out unauthorized to buy this, didn't you?

246
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,650
Yeah.

247
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,420
Who told you to break the rules over something like this?

248
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,260
I know. I wasn't thinking of doing that either...

249
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,030
but it seemed like you needed it.

250
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,750
Don't do anything like this again, it doesn't make me happy at all.

251
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,970
Okay.

252
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,740
Hey, Gong Joo Yeong.

253
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,190
Drink it.

254
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,850
Thank you.

255
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,760
- What about food? 
 - Food?

256
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,420
Ah, food. I couldn't eat...

257
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,950
The penalty exercise was so extreme I felt nauseous.

258
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,890
Did this get stuck on its own, then?

259
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,460
Anyway, thanks.

260
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,540
♫ Even if I keep telling myself it’s not real ♫

261
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,080
♫ Every morning when I wake up, I can only think of you ♫

262
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,590
♫ I used to sing only sad songs ♫

263
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,090
♫  But now there’s something I realized ♫

264
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,850
Love Revolution

265
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,260
- Ten! 
- Aw...

266
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,060
It's not me! We're all being deceived!

267
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,240
- What's he going on about? 
- He's gone crazy.

268
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,490
You should go now.

269
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,430
Is this a melodrama or a thriller?

270
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,170
- Do you like me? 
- What the hell?

271
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,370
Hey, your boyfriend must be planning something!

272
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,540
You're not going to take pics of your boyfriend?

273
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,190
He's not!

274
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,250
- What's going on? 
- What's happening?
