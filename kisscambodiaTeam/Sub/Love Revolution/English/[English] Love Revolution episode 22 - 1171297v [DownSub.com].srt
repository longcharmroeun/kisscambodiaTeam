1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,190
- It's a draw. 
 - No, it's in.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,510
Yeah, stop the crap.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,110
What's that? Panchigi? 
 (T/N: game: flipping coins over by hitting the book they are placed on)

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,140
Ah, that? It's panchigi using chicken coupons. They call it chicken-chigi.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,350
All the guys are playing it.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,890
Okay, nice! Thanks for the food!

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,780
Gosh, I only needed two more of these coupons.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,010
It's so noisy! Why are you guys like this? Please get caught and have these taken away.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,730
Let them be. They'll get caught sometime.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,150
Do the teachers still not know? The guys in the other classes are all doing that too.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,880
If we also get scolded because of them I will get really mad.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,670
Oh, okay, nice!

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,190
- Your boyfriend doesn't play that?
 - He probably doesn't. If he's thinking straight.

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,440
What if Gong Joo Yeong is also like that?

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,450
I think I'll start to dislike him if he also plays that—

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,170
Hey, Ahn Kyeong Min! Prepare to cough my twenty coupons back up.

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,560
Did you start disliking him?

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,010
Oh Ja Rim! One minute!

kyungwoo @Arong_fighter: Share some of your winnings...

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,560
No wonder you were sending fewer texts than usual. Is this what you were doing?

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,040
- Were you looking forward to my message? 
- No!

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,810
Also, where did you get this?

25
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,440
I borrowed this from Kyeong Woo—

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,060
Uhm, this... don't worry.

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,850
Once I win my coupons back from Ahn Kyeong Min, I'll repay everything at once.

28
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,600
Look at the way you're talking. It's no different from an addict.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,690
Right. I am an addict.

30
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,780
A Ja Rim addict.

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,990
Hey. I'm not in the mood to crack jokes, you know.

32
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,710
Just for today. I'll only play today.

33
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,680
If I don't repay Kyeong Woo his coupons by tomorrow, I have to give him three game items.

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,800
What if you lose more this way? Then you either end it with this game,

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,250
or end it with me!

36
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,610
I got it.

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,890
- Gosh. 
 - How is he so good?

38
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,850
What will you do? You lost everything.

39
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,880
Can you lend me ten more again?

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,970
- Not for nothing. Put up collateral.  
 - Collateral?

41
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,260
Write your name and the item you'll put as collateral here.

42
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,100
Do we have to go to this extent?

43
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,020
Of course. How can I trust you enough to lend to you just like that?

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,000
Admitted. Are strength stones okay?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,570
Do you have some between levels 81 and 89?

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,240
What? You also want to join?

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,600
How do you play this?

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,820
Do you even have a coupon?

53
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,970
- This? 
 - If you want to join, come. It's a "one-in" game anyway.  
 (One-in: Beginner's match where each bets only one coupon.) 

54
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,870
Here we go, we got one more dupe joining the game.

55
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,230
- What the? You're also playing "one-in" games. 
 - Let's decide who goes first.

56
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,490
Not playing is losing. Rock, paper, scissors!

57
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,190
Well, everyone starts by donating, after all. Getting into debt on the way.

58
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,360
- Then these are all mine, right? 
 - Huh?

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,450
- Yeah. 
- Wait, what are you?

60
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,010
One Bang... She's One Bang Man! 
 One Bang: Flipping everything at once. 

61
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,730
That's going too far. Does this make any sense?

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,740
Hey, did you hear that? There's a girl in class 3 who's winning all the coupons.

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,750
Yup. I heard she takes it all as long as she goes first. One Bang Man has appeared.

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,290
Oh shit. I'm never playing her.

65
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,070
Five chicken for today's lunch...

66
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,850
It's her.

67
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,650
Oh Ah Ram, Oh Ah Ram. Help me out just this once, okay?

68
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,670
I got those from Kyeong Woo by putting my game items up as collateral.

69
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,280
Save me just this once, okay?

70
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,750
Lee Kyeong Woo? Collateral?

71
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,470
Huh? Yeah. Lee Kyeong Woo has more than 200 coupons.

72
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,470
More than 200? Twenty chickens!

73

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,640
You got a lot.

79
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,830
Since you're going around taking all those, my business is doing great.

80
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,440
- What are you doing? 
 - Let's do a "20-in" game. 
 (20-in: Expert's rule where each bets 20 coupons.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,280

82

We can't play against each other! Don't you know we should help each other? There's an unspoken rule here.

83
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,360
Are you scared? Afraid you'll lose everything?

84
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
Let's go for thirty coupons.

85
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,110
Okay, I'm putting five coupons for the next game.

86
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,130

88
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,110
You guys are all dead today.

89
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,850
Why can't you do this, seriously?

90
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,480
- Hey.  
  - No but—
 - Oooh!

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,170
Uhm, Ja Rim...

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
Hey, where are you going?

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,910
Where are you going?

94
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,360
Ja Rim. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done it. I won't play again, forgive me.

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,430
Why is this so hard to stop?

96
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,910
What are you going to do in the future if you're this weak to addiction?

97
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,150
In the future? So you're worried about my future. As though you're going to marry me.

98
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,050
Hey. Why would the topic change to that? You're trying to sneakily skirt around it again.

99
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,490
No, don't worry. I'm not addicted. This is also all for you—

100
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,030
What the hell are you saying? You want to feed me chicken using this game? No thanks.

101
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,800
No but, before, you said...

102
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,810
Huh? Why is Bonajour on here?

103
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,600
- What's that? 
- The makeup brand I use.

104
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,260
It says they'll give me a Bonajour set if I collect 30 coupons from '232 Chicken'. What a random collaboration.

105
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,080
Really? But why with 232 Chicken...

106
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,600
Exactly. How funny.

107
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,020
But, is it okay for you to use cosmetic products? You said you have sensitive skin.

108
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,350
I use their moisturizer.

109
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,870
I like their Green Tea Water Bomb but it's hard to get.

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,840
What. I just said that in passing but you actually remembered?

111
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,350
Of course. I remember everything you say.

112
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,330
If you were my teacher, I would probably be the top student in the school.

113
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,240
Anyway, that's why you did that?

114
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
Yeah. It turned out to be kind of fun,

115
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,370
so I might have become a little addicted.

116
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,780
But it's too bad. I was winning everything on that game just now.

117
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,660
- Rock, paper, scissors, set shoot! 
 - Darn it.

118
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,440
Sure enough, the rumors about her being One Bang Man weren't for nothing.

119
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,500
If she goes first, Oh Ah Ram wins no matter what.

120
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,760
Instead, if I go first, I have a chance to win.

121
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,590
- Rock, paper, scissors, set shoot! 
- Oh, sh...oot! Hey, won't you do it right?

122
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,010
Sorry, sorry. My voice grew louder because I was excited.

123
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,990
- Damn, what a crook. 
 - That was wrong.

124
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,890
- Good game. 
- Fucking bastard, what did you do?

125
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,990
Hey, I just used my head. You can't play games if you're dumb.

126
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,260
You should use that great head of yours to study.

127
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,520
Whatever. Keep your boyfriend under control first.

128
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,190
Gong Joo Yeong's not doing it anymore. And he actually had his reasons.

129
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,360
He's not like you.

130
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,350
I'm even seeing Wang Ja Rim defend Gong Joo Yeong?

131
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,460
Am I dreaming?

132
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,190
What's his problem...

133
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,320
Gong Joo Yeong's not doing it anymore. And he actually had his reasons.

134
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,560
He's not like you.

135
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,420
I'm hungry. Let's eat quickly.

136
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,310
- Do you want chicken? 
- What? We said we'd go to the popular place I found.

137
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,550
Did we? I won a lot of coupons today, so let's have chicken.

138
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,020
Ye Ye Chicken, Gunnae Chicken or 232 Chicken? What do you want?

139
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,040
Well, whatever you want.

140
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,930
Okay then. Let's go to Ye Ye Chicken. I've got many of their coupons, so I have to use them.

141
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,510
Noona, what's wrong with you today?

142
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,030
You're acting weird. Did something happen?

143
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,830
I'm tasting the bitter aftertaste of defeat.

144
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,890
Wow. You can lose at something? Was it those gamers' IRL fight?

145
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,690
Who did you fight with? A guy?

146
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,790
Shut your nonsense. Why would an athlete fight?

147
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,710
You're dead.

148
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,680
Damn it! I can't do this.

149
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,780
For a long game, I need to be able to flip just one at a time.

150
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,130
So you lost at panchigi? What's the big deal?

151
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,940
You try losing 12 chickens.

152
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,760
Should I teach you? I'm the ace in my school.

153
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,070
If there were a nationwide competition for this, I would take gold.

154
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,700
Really? Try it.

155
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,490
Sh*t! Hey, how do you manage to flip just one?

156
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,470
I can do them all at once, but not just one.

157
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,840
Look. It's a game of refinement. If you have to flip this one here,

158
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,150
you pick the right position and, rather than power, use a clean tap.

159
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,450
Control your strength! Look at my hand carefully.

160
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,760
Damn it!

161
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,040
Why do you keep using your strength? You don't get it at all.

162
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,280
Do you want to get hit with that strength? Speak nicely.

163
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,530
Why are you threatening me? Whatever, I'm not teaching you anymore.

164
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,670
- Teach me please. 
- No.

165
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,000
Hey.

166
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,930
Lee Kyeong Woo. Let's have a revenge match.

167
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,180
What, you want to lose again? I don't like to knock a weak person's mental state down.

168
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,260
- I don't want to be hated. 
 - Don't you know about the courage to be hated? Shut up and let's decide who's first.

169
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,190
I was going to protect your last bit of pride, but well. Deal.

170
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,690
- Rock— 
 - Not playing is losing, rock paper scissors!

171
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,280
From now on, if you don't put anything out then I'll assume you lose and go first.

172
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,010
What's this? Her vigor is completely different from yesterday.

173
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,960
- Rock, paper, scissors! 
 - Rock, paper, scissors!

174
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,960
Fighting, go for it!

175
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,860
Dammit, it's freaking cold.

176
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,380
Two, four, six, eight.

177
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,480
Here you go. I've repaid my debt now.

178
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,720
Yes, thank you.

179
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:14,860
Nothing's changed. Oh Ah Ram can still do 'one bangs' only. 

180
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,780
It's getting tiresome. Let's finish things off quickly.

181
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,010
Hey. Looks like this won't finish today. What about an 'all-in' for this round?

182
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,380
What nonsense is that? You don't even have half as many as I do.

183
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,200
This is my ledger. I have over 200 coupons loaned to the others.

184
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,550
I'll make it my duty to get them all back. Deal?

185
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,670
Deal.

186
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,360
- It's an all-in game! 
 - How many are there in total?

187
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,740
Isn't it 400? This is crazy.

188
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,170
My coupons are probably in there as well, right?

189
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,640
I figured out your pattern. 

190
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,380
Oh Ah Ram putting out a fist on the first round has a probability of 80%. 

191
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,570
I suffered huge loss until now just to check this, 

192
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,280
but let me turn things around with this one game. 

193
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,220
Even if she puts out scissors, I can insist we're following the 'muk-jji-ppa' rule. 

194
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,050
You dunce, who only knows to use one-bangs will be finished in this fight of probabilities. 

195
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,690
Not playing is losing, rock paper scissors!

196
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,930
I won. I can flip four coupons maximum. 

197
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,210
Oh Ah Ram. You'll do a one-bang for sure. 

198
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:40,610
Then on my turn I just have to flip over four of them. 

199
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,930
The victory of refinement. 

200
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,070
What was that just now?

201
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,650
- Wow, this, this! 
 - Incredible!

202
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,540
As expected of you. To think that you're repaying the humiliation like this.

203
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,060
What? How did you do this? Weren't you unable to flip them over one by one?

204
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,170
What are you, how did you do it?

205
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,230
What's wrong with you? So undignified.

206
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,830
Kyeong Woo. Want me to lend you some coupons?

207
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,000
You're supposed to perceive the feeling for this.

208
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,940
But I have no way to teach that to you, it's frustrating. 

209
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,600
A way? 

210
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,270
- Stand up. 
 - Why?

211
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,310
Stand up. Sit down here. 

212
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,520
Give me your hand. Hit it while holding my hand, so you can communicate the feeling to me. Come closer. 

213
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,130
One...

214
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,040
Okay. So it's this kind of feeling. 

215
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,100
Whoa, it's amazing.

216
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,980
- Wow. 
 - Whoa, that was...

217
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,970
The news leaked!

218
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,930
Give this.

219
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,800
Give it to me!

220
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,330
My calculations were perfect. What was that smile earlier?

221
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:30,820
Was it her plan? No way, that makes no sense. How could a muscle piggy like Oh Ah Ram design a plan?

222
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,990
Green Tea Water Bomb

223
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,090
- Oh, what's going on? You bought a new one? 
 - I didn't buy it, it was given to me.

224
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,520
Ah, it's the one you use all the time, right?

225
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,950
But you said it was all sold-out. Where did you get it?

226
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,150
Gong Joo Yeong got it for me.

227
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,360
Whoa, really? He's such a sweet loving boy.

228
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,740
- I'm so envious.  
 - Don't touch it.

229
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,300
Why? You've got three.

230
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,080
You've been using this a whole lot without me knowing, haven't you? The ones I bought before were out in no time.

231
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,900
Come on. Let me use just this one. I have to use this if I want my makeup to apply well.

232
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,000
Just buy your own. I don't even have enough for me. Buzz off.

233
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,230
- Hands are faster than eyes! 
- Hey! Bring it back!

234
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,250
Five, four, three!

Awesome! I won!  Go for a double date with Bang Ye Seul? 

239
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,660
Four of you? People like you would like to hang out only the two of you, right?

240
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:04,200
I can hold hands with Ja Rim to my heart's content, link arms, and when we're in front of the merry-go-round we'll ki—

241
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,220
It's annoying. How did things become this way?

242
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,390
Whoa, then what about your progress? 

243
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,940
Right, we can't not speak about this!

244
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,360
We did kiss.

245
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,020
- Ohhh. When? 
 - Where?

246
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,050
You also want to do it? 
I'll give you three seconds.

247
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,100
- Three. 
 - What? 
- Two. One.
