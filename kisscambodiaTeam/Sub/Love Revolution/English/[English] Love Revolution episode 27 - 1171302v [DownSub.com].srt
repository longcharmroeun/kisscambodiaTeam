1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,560
This idiot screamed even when there wasn't anything. I couldn't watch the movie properly because of him.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,300
No, but I was scared because of the sound!

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,880
If we talk about that, he's even more of a chicken. He was wearing his headphones and playing games.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,980
I don't like fantasy. Why do you watch stuff about ghosts that don't even exist?

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,050
How would you know they don't?

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,920
That's right. There are pictures of spirits and even real stories.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,900
If there really were, it would be all over the news. Do you believe those?

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,390
They do exist. Actually, my mom said I would see a ghost today.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,110
What does your mother do?

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,900
She's a psychic.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,410
No wonder, I was feeling sweaty today.

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,040
You're always sweaty. This is all psychological stuff—

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,050
What's happening? A blackout?

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,570
What the hell is happening?

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,600
Gosh.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,980
Lee Kaeng, what are you doing?

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,070
Mandu, mandu, mandu, mandu, five! 
 (T/N: game of guessing the number of fingers open.)

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,240
Gosh, look at him flipping out.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,650
Dammit, won't you get up?

20
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,320
- Did you guys hear? 
 - Hear what?

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,650
All first-years are having after-class study today.

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,320
What? Why all of a sudden?

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,660
Someone cheated on the math performance test and Dokgo Moon threw a fit.

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,730
So all first years are getting a re-test.

25
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,650
- The heck. 
 - Whoa, he's gone nuts.

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,690
- Why are we also retaking it? 
 - In case there's someone else who cheated. I'm so mad.

27
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,940
He said he'll supervise each test, so every class will take it one after the other.

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,730
- Will our class take it first, then? 
 - They said they're starting with the top floor.

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,980
Then we're the last... What are we going to do until then, seriously?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,590
Love Revolution: Boo! A ghost in school! 
 Episode 27. #Where'sTheGhost #What'sTrueStory #BattleOfFear

31
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,130
bang_H @princess_0: I just love scary stuff!

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,090
What was that?

33
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,990
Quiet, quiet! You're all grown-up. Why are you making a fuss over this?

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,250
- Hey. 
 - What?

35
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,430
- Did your mom really say you would see a ghost for real today? 
 - Yeah. She said to be careful because I was going to see one.

36
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,180
Big boys like you still believe in ghosts?

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,450
In movies, those people are the first ones to die.

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,870
How long do I have to fool around with these punks? 

39
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,060
He just had to hold a retake test. 

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,040
Dokgo Moon. He really lives up to his name. 

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,290
He is so dogged, really. 

42
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,910
Why do I also have to work overtime—

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,280
People usually turn around in these situations. But I won't. 

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,860
- What's that! 
 - What is it?!

45
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,050
Gosh. What are you doing?

46
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,420
That's what I want to ask.

47
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,490
Why are you here?

48
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,930
Well, I just... I came because it's class 3's turn to take the test.

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,200
- Right, go ahead. 
 - Right.

50
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,720
All the questions are different from the other class's tests.

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,790
So what you were told by the kids who took it first is no use.

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,530
So?

53
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,030
I flunked. I didn't even try the last one.

54
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,610
- I didn't even have the courage to do it. 
 - I flunked too.

55
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,840
- You scared me! 
 - Ja Dim, Ja Dim! Did you do well?

56
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,850
It's super dangerous outside. Let's go now. Dangerous, dangerous.

57
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,870
We've never been in school this late before. I somehow feel like doing a courage test.

58
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,850
- Want to do one? 
 - You're in? I'm in.

59
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,740
- How do you do it? 
 - Like they do on TV—having to bring back a hidden object.

60
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,070
What do you get from doing that?

61
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,090
What about we all bet one thousand won (≈ $1) and one person gets it all?

62
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,060
- It's freaking not worth it. 
 - Why? Are you scared? If you aren't, it's easy money.

63
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,420
- What a chicken. 
 - Okay, let's do it.

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,760
What do we have to get back, and from where?

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,620
Let's do the music room. That room is the scariest for me, because of the piano ghost's story.

66
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,010
Why the heck are you mentioning a piano ghost? You have a death wish?

67
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,690
Good idea. Then we'll decide on the order by rock paper scissors.

68
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,940
Let's go by teams of two.

69
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,820
Teams of two?

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,570
Ja Rim won't expect me to protect her anyway. 

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Ja Rim, I'm so scared!

72
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:00,170
In that case, this is a golden chance to say I'm too scared and cling onto Ja Rim. 

73
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,810
Okay. This is one team.

74
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,020
Nonsense. Let's play the hand-flipping game, to be fair.

75
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,340
We're obviously one team since we're a couple.

76
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,300
- Palm up, palm down! 
 - Up!

77
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,390
- Palm up, palm down! 
 - Down.

78
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,890
Palm up, palm down.

79
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,360
First Team

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,680
Second Team

81
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,220
Third Team

82
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,070
Fourth Team

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,320
Does this make any sense? Exchange with Ja Rim, please.

84
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,750
Let's go like this. Min Ji also has a boyfriend, if you look at things that way.

85
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,810
That's right. This is the most peaceful way. I'll go first and hide it.

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,580
You will just have to bring this back. Okay?

87
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,810
Hey. Come.

88
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,560
Wait, wait for me!

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,300
Hurry up and come.

90
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,610
Hey. I thought you had made up your mind?

91
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,170
I left the pencil case, so next team, go!

92
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,820
Since it turned out like this, let's empty their wallets.

93
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,480
What a joke. Just don't faint like last time.

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,570
Hey, you better protect Ja Rim well, Lee Kyeong Guard!

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,200
Hey, wait, wait!

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,300
Can you get off me a bit?

97
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,330
Well, uhm, your boyfriend told me to protect you.

98
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,470
Don't people usually protect from the front? I've never seen anyone do it from behind.

99
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,130
Well, you're seeing it now. Me protecting from behind.

100
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,290
Gosh, seriously.

101
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,230
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

102
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,310
Darn, it's super dark in here. Can you see anything?

103
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,550
- I found Jin Hui's pencil case. 
 - Okay, let's hurry up and leave.

104
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,850
Sorry.

105
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,210
Hey. Want to hide and scare the others?

106
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,840
What? You like this stuff?

107
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,290
- I just thought of something super funny. 
 - What?

108
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,620
The piano ghost Kim Byeong Hoon told us about...

109
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,630
- They should be back by now. 
 - Don't you think something happened to them?

110
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,530
What's this? A blackout?

111
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,040
Gosh, the lights don't even work. They must be scared and looking for me—

112
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,500
I don't know about Lee Kyeong Woo, but there's no way Ja Rim would.

113
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,020
This won't do. I'm too worried. I'm going first!

114
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,400
Min Ji, go with him!

115
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,930
Dammit. Gong Joo Yeong, we should go together!

116
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,270
Next team is starting!

117
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,780
Want to go together?

118
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,540
Gosh, that startled me. What's wrong?

119
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,880
Why is it so dark?

120
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,370
The music room. It was in the music room, right?

121
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,470
When will we arrive at the music room?

122
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,680
Should I have gone home instead? It's much darker than I thought.

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,290
The music room...

124
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,820
Be quiet! Your voice is even scarier!

125
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,240
- What's that? 
 - Dammit! 
 - There was a piano sound!

126
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,560
What sound? I didn't hear anything!

127
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,500
Am I the only one who heard it? Gosh. Wait a minute.

128
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,490
The music room is the scariest for me.

129
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,910
- Don't tell me... 
 - Because of the piano ghost's story.

130
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,360
What? Are you scared?

131
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,780
No, I'm not. Stay away—

132
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,990
Wait, why are you pushing me?

133
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,320
Ja Rim? I'm here.

134
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,520
You're the one who played the piano, right?

135
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,540
I don't think they're here.

136
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,700
I told you!

137
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,870
That was damn funny.

138
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,560
My legs are falling asleep. Let's go.

139
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,330
- Thank you. 
 - Ah, sure.

140
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,030
Are you okay?

141
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,790
Just hold onto me.

142
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,910
I'm fine. It's not like I got hurt.

143
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,930
What are you doing there?

144
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,170
I went to the music room, you see? There was no one, for sure!

145
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,090
But the piano went "ding"—

146
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,800
Ja Rim! What's wrong? Are you hurt? Did you get attacked by a ghost?

147
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,920
I saw a ghost. I really—

148
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Hey! My legs just went numb.

149
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,230
Why did they go numb?

150
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,410
What?

151
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,790
But what about Min Ji?

152
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,990
What the heck, Gong Joo Yeong?

153
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,340
I ran away on my own, so I don't know.

154
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,700
You darned chicken! It's dangerous to leave her alone!

155
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,090
Ah Ram, let's look together!

156
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,980
Where were you two? You were outside, I'm sure.

157
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,090
We should have bet ten thousand won (≈ $10). Those punks—

158
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean, those guys. They don't get into it because it's just for one thousand won.

159
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,510
Just hold onto me.

160
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:11,190
Am I really nothing to him?  
 ♫ It is difficult for me ♫

161
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,160
It's annoying. What's so great about him?

162
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,880
♫ Everything  ♫

163
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,400
♫ feels unfamiliar ♫

164
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,100
♫ But nevertheless ♫

165
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,500
Drink some. 

166
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,490
♫ When I think of you, there is only one answer ♫

167
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,310
If you act cute when singing, you're dead. 

168
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,620
And it totally makes me cringe when you lower your voice when you sing. 

169
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,270
♫ I guess I love you ♫

170
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,520
What was that? When did you become so close? 

171
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,580
What's it to you? 

172
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
Do you like him?

173
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,840
But what were you going to ask earlier?

174
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,380
Whether you gave your number to Sang Hoon or not. 

175
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,030
Then I'm letting Sang Hoon have my lunch coupon. 

176
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,910
Sang Hoon. You can get treated to lunch by Yang Min Ji. 

177
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,030
So annoying.

178
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,190
What's even more annoying

179
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,050
is that I still wished

180
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,060
you were the one to come find me.

181
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,860
I'm annoyed at myself the most. 

182
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,640
You're quite amazing for holding a retake exam on such a day, of all days.

183
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,660
As a teacher, I have to teach the students what responsibilities they bear when they do wrong.

184
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,410
Yes, you are impressive. Thanks to you, I am lucky enough to admire the night scenery.

185
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
What? Which kid hasn't left yet?

186
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,360
What will you do if it's a school staff member?

187
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,230
Just until inside the room, please. It's too dark!

188
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,350
Just go in.

189
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,000
What a coward.

190
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,540
I'm serious! I heard the piano even though there was no one. Why doesn't anyone believe me?

191
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,690
I believe you since I'm the one who played it.

192
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,100
What?

193
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,060
But...

194
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,280
For real? But why tell me now?

195
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,090
I kept talking about it since earlier, so why...

196
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,770
- Sorry about earlier. 
 - What?

197
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:10,100
I bought it for you some time ago. I didn't know I would give it to you while apologizing.

198
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,360
It's just that I thought you might have used up the one I gave you before.

199
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,830
Ja Dim... I'm so touched.

200
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,550
They say there's always light at the end of the tunnel. That was true.

201
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,460
Thanks to you, I've completely recovered.

202
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,360
Again, you're exaggerating.

203
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,990
My lovely Ja Rim, would you like to shoot the kisses?

204
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,880
Shoot what, you idiot. Want to die?

205
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,340
Okay.

206
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,320
Hi everyone. The product I am presenting to you today

207
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,350
is Real Barrier Extreme.

208
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,240
It's great for— Why did you turn off the light?!

209
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,180
Come on!

bogyeong232 liked your picture

218
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,680
From Bo Gyeong: Joo Yeong, it's been a while haha. How are you doing? ^^

219
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,330
What's your number? 
All my contacts disappeared TT

220
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,720
Why is she suddenly...

221
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,360
Something scarier than the piano ghost was coming toward me. 

222
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,180
♫ Your name I used to call so often  ♫

223
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,310
♫ Only now do I long for it ♫

225
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,050
What? Kwak Bo Gyeong?

226
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,260
She hasn't contacted me all this time. What's going on? 

227
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,000
Bo Gyeong was really pretty. 

228
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,010
- I know. 
 - Gong Joo Yeong! We agreed to talk today. 

229
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,800
No but why here, now? 

230
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,870
Sorry. I didn't see your girlfriend was next to you. 

231
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,800
Isn't she crazy? Why come see him when she knows he has a girlfriend?

232
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,540
So that means you contacted her without telling me a word of it. 

233
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,260
Hey, stick to the facts. 

234
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,310
I really feel like crap, but I don't why. 

235
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,760
Jealousy? Gosh, stop your bullsh*t. 

236
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,980
This is a historical day.

237
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,240
♫ I can do all this and more ♫

238
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,040
♫ After breaking up with me ♫
