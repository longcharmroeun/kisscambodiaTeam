00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,920
- Hey, let's go to the snack bar. 
 - You already have lots of snacks.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,020
We need to stock up to last until the afternoon.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,300
Are you a squirrel getting ready for winter? Oh, wait, and Ja Rim?

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,820
What about Ja Rim?

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,680
You already know that I like you,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
but I haven't been able to tell you the important part.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
Without realizing I might have been afraid to say it.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,470
But, I think I can tell you clearly today.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,470
Do you want to go out with me?

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,380
I've been waiting for you to say that.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,510
Hey, hey, hey!

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,710
Don't get too immersed in practice. The mood got weird.

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,710
Hey. Why are you practicing that, you idiot?

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,970
If she likes you, it will work out even if you're not smooth. She doesn't like you, that's why it's not working.

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,490
I'm sure she likes me.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,400
After yesterday's meeting, I could see what kind of girl Ja Rim is.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,360
She looks cold on the outside but she is sweet inside, a tsundere.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,090
The fact is the more she seems not to like me, the more she actually cares for me.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,530
What the hell are you on about?

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,900
It's true! Yesterday while  she treated me to a meal, she said I was like a puppy.

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,500
Aren't puppies adorable? She was looking at me as adorable.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,190
Don't you mean you are like a dog?

24
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,870
Don't tell me.  Didn't  you misunderstood son of a bitch as puppy?

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,350
Correct  Answer. 
 - Damn.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,600
But if Gong Joo Yeong confesses, it's likely to work.   It also made my heart pound.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,880
Why are you getting excited?

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,250
Then you two can just date, F***.  You'll make a totally crazy couple.

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,340
What a joke.

Joo Yeong! Why don't you pick up?

32
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,820
Let's go to the snack bar. I'll buy you something.

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm okay.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,890
I am not okay. Let's go!

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,190
- Who is she?
 - What's going on? That punk and a girl.

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,600
It seems obvious that she's trying to hit on Gong Joo, right?

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't believe such a delinquent is flirting with a naive boy like Gong Joo Yeong.

38
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,380
She should flirt with me instead!

41
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,730
This Saturday is Rose Day, 
 (T/N: May 14th, 
 a day couples exchange roses.)

42
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,330
and there is no way a boy like Gong Joo would just let it pass. I look forward to it, Ja Rim.

43
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,380
Don't look forward to anything. I want to spend at least this one weekend calmly.

44
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,620
With his personality, he is probably preparing a surprise.

45
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,730
- Calmly.  
 - Are you talking about Gong Joo Yeong?

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,730
Actually, He asked me when Ja Rim and I were going to hang out on Saturday.

47
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,290
Don't you think he will be waiting until Ja Rim goes out on Saturday?

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,370
- That's why I'm planning on staying home.  
 - Really?

49
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,830
How disappointing. You should accept it sometimes when he does something for you.

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,500
Let us experience it vicariously through you.

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,520
If he confesses, maybe you should try dating him for a while.

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,170
Am I supposed to date anyone just to please you guys?

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
Are you going?

54
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,790
- Like it? 
 - Give me some too.

55
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,510
Give me some too! Give me!

56
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,540
Oh? It's Gong Joo Yeong.

57
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,270
Who is that girl, the one stuck to Gong Joo Yeong?

58
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,840
She must like him.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,130
She is a second-year at our school.

60
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,890
Ja Rim!

61
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,400
Are you going somewhere? I see you're on the way from the snack bar.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
If you'd told me, I would have bought it for you.

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,920
- Hi! 
 - Hi!

64
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,000
It looks tasty. Let's go.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,200
- Ah Rong, let's go. 
 - Yeah.

66
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,500
Okay, tell me.  Who is she?

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,170
I have so many women that I don't know who you are talking about.

68
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,160
Did I ask about your relationships with girls?

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,650
I'm talking about the girl who was stuck to Gong Joo Yeong before.

70
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,690
Oh, Jang Hae Ri.  She's a second-year at our school.

71
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,180
What's her connection to Gong Joo Yeong?

72
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,550
She has been acting close for several days but I have no idea.

73
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,220
Do I look like a dried squid vending stall?  Don't touch it. I'll rip your hands off.

74
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,220
But does Gong Joo Yeong just allow that?

75
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,760
If it's nothing bad, should he tell her to piss off?

76
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,430
Even so, while he likes Ja Rim, isn't getting involved with another girl a little ...?

77
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,090
Hey. She's coming on to him as she pleases. What do you want him to do?

78
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,130
And what business is it of yours whether Gong Joo Yeong does it or not?

79
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,900
Even if it isn't ours, it is Ja Rim's.

80
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,810
Hey Wang Ja. do you care? You're not even dating.

81
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,660
No, I don't really care.

82
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,480
See. Don't do this to me.  Go complain to Gong Joo Yeong.

83
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,270
But again, does he have any reason to stop someone who likes him?

84
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,420
She says she doesn't care.

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,530
You're put in front of a case and have to decide

86
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,360
wether it's an opportunity or a crisis...

87
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,890
Noona Jang Hae Ri: Joo Yeong, want to meet at recess?

88
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,290
Fourth: Crisis management. There's a danger...

89
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,660
Why aren't you replying?

90
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,460
Power-off

91
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,590
Ja Rim, what are you doing on Saturday?

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,700
I'm staying home. What's it to you?

93
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,870
No ... because I'm free too, so I thought we could hang out together you andâ€”

94
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,700
I'm busy.

95
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,330
You just said you're staying home.

96
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,300
I'm busy at home

97
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,120
Noona Jang Hae Ri

98
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,440
This noona, really ...

99
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,750
It must be that unni from before?

100
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,660
Did you see her? Ja Rim.

101
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,920
Just in case you might misunderstand, I don't have any relationship with her.

102
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,610
Is that so?

103
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,180
Ja Rim.  You really don't have a misunderstanding, do you?

104
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,800
That's not it. I'm just busy on Saturday.

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,320
I'm free on Saturday.

106
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,020
As for me, I am busy.

107
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,930
What are you busy with?

108
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,980
That is ...

109
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,140
You seem like you need to talk.  I'll leave.

110
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,820
No, no. I have nothing to say to her. Wait for me.

111
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you doing? The bell rang, go to your classroom.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,260
Ja Rim, do you really have no time on Saturday?

113
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,490
- I think I might. 
 - Really?

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,590
- But you don't have time. 
  - Huh?  M-Me? Why?

115
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,510
- You're meeting her. 
  - Why would I?

116
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,000
I have nothing to do with her. Truly.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,700
Don't follow me around for nothing and date someone who likes you.

118
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,280
Then, you should also date someone who likes you.

119
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,370
Me! Hmm?

120
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,290
Hey. The bell rang. We have math.

121
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,960
I don't want to.   I'm not going until you reply to me.

122
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,300
Ja Rim?

123
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,370
Can we talk?

124
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,670
It's okay.  Go on ahead.

125
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,370
Aren't you eating?

126
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,040
You're freaking pretty.

127
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,380
Are you glaring at me like so I acknowledge that?

128
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,680
What do you want to say?

129
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,380
Before that, I need to deal with your eyes.

130
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,010
Can you soften your stare?  I just admitted you were freaking pretty, no?

131
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,840
Just say what you need to say.

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,940
Look at her. She's freaking rude.

133
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,840
Is that why you're rudely toying with Gong Joo Yeong?

134
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,790
I don't think I ever did that.

135
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,490
Well, I'm a pro at toying with boys, so I know it when I see it

136
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,560
But you're a bit different, actually.

137
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,160
What should I say? You're one hell of a cow.

138
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,900
Oh my.  Did that offend you? It's too vulgar, isn't it?

139
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,640
Sorry.

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,540
So can you please make your position clear so we don't have to see each other too often?

141
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,470
How?

142
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,800
What is she saying? Are you asking because it's difficult or because you don't know?

143
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,550
I'm telling you to reject Gong Joo Yeong in a clear and definite way.

144
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,900
I clearly and definitely reject you.

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,550
I reject your rejection. Ja Rim, let me like you.

146
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,670
I really have no realationship with her.

147
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,220
Incoming call: Gong Joo Yeong.

148
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,270
Bye.

149
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,720
Hey, you won't date him anyway. Will you?

150
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,030
That little, seriously. Toying with him until the end.

151
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,270
You don't want to have Gong Joo Yeong but it's a waste to let someone else have him.

152
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,260
F***.  Why am I getting all steamed up instead of her?

153
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,990
I don't know much about this, but are you sure this is how you confess? Is this really the trend nowadays?

154
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,510
This is the least I should do! Ja Rim keeps getting the wrong idea because of Jang Hae Ri or whatever

155
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,150
so I have to make myself clear so there aren't any more misunderstandings.

156
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,360
By the way, why is it 99 flowers? Shouldn't we fold 100?

157
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,020
Kyeong Min told me something, that's why.

158
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,790
You fool, there's a reason for everything. Read a book!

159
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,980
Yeah, read a book.

160
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,520
If you date according to a book, aren't you 100% screwed?

161
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,130
I think going with 100 flowers would be better.

162
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,960
Really?

163
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,390
This is making me think seriously.

164
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,520
Lee Kaeng, what do you think?

165
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,260
Hey, Lee Kaeng! What do you think?

166
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,000
About what?

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,190
Weren't you paying attention? What's better, 99 flowers or 100?

168
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,200
It won't matter. I told you at school.

169
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,940
How you confess doesn't matter if she doesn't reciprocate your feelings.

170
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,130
That's why I'm checking her feelings through this confession.

171
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,920
Come on, which one is better?

172
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,780
You really don't plan on dating another girl?

173
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,070
Absolutely not. Isn't that a given? Who else would I date besides Ja Rim?

174
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,690
Jang Hae Ri?

175
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,980
Definitely not her. She's not my type, whether or not Ja Rim is involved.

176
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,190
She stinks of cigarette smoke and keeps linking arms with me.

177
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,690
She's kind of scary and all.

178
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,990
But, you're speaking as if you expect me to get rejected.

179
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,170
It's not like that.

180
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,470
But if Wang Ja has no intention of going out with you,

181
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,990
what are you going to do?

182
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't know. I'm not going to think about that right now.

183
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,360
I just want to show Ja Rim my true feelings.

184
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,000
Finally!

185
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,420
I think I can go on a TV show as a master of paper rose folding.

186
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,470
Hey, did you actually contact her?

187
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,830
I bet she'll come out easily.

188
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,660
She will.

189
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,430
It's so good!

190
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,170
What happened? I thought you weren't leaving your house?

191
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,450
I thought about it, and I wondered why I had to be stuck at home because of Gong Joo Yeong.

192
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,790
Yeah, it's not like he's a terrorist.

193
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,300
But did nothing happen when you came out? Gong Joo Yeong wasn't there?

194
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,590
Nope, nothing happened.

195
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,300
Does he plan on doing something when you go back home, then?

196
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,600
He's not the type to sit still on Rose Day.

197
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,580
Ja Rim! Your apartment is on fire! There are firetrucks and everything!

198
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,010
- Hey! 
- What is it?

199
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,340
Hey, Gong Joo Yeong, are you serious?

200
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,230
Yeah, I am. I saw smoke coming from your apartment and I came over.

201
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,150
Looks like things have calmed down now, but shouldn't you still stop by?

202
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,190
- Okay. 
- Okay.

203
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,160
- Mister! 
- Hello, ma'am.

204
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,150
Did something happen here?

205
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,350
One pot burned,

206
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,260
but the firefighters came over and there was such a big fuss.

207
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,200
- I had such a hard time. 
- Gosh, I thought it was something serious.

208
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,850
- You can go up. 
- Okay, keep up the good work!

209
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,780
Goodbye!

210
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,790
- Kids, you don't plan on using fire, right? 
- No, Sir.

211
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,390
- Be careful with fire! 
- Okay. Thank you!

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,830
Hey, wasn't the fire part too extreme?

213
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,560
No, it's a relief that there wasn't really one. And fire trucks really did come.

214
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,350
You're a lucky guy.

215
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,060
Wang Byeol Rim, there was a fire at our building. Come home right away.

216
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,710
Wow! I see. Anyway I'm sorry, but I'm watching a music show

217
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,500
so I don't have time to watch the fire.

218
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,990
I'm not kidding!

219
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,030
Whoa. Really? What about Mom and Dad?

220
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,500
- They're not picking up, either of them. 
- Okay, I'll go right away.

221
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,870
Where's the fire?

222
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,540
Ja Rim.

223
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,500
Your house isn't on fire. What's on fire...

224
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,490
is my heart.

225
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,360
What did he just say?

226
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,040
Is it fun to lie?

227
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,550
The fire trucks really did come.

228
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,740
It wasn't a big deal, though.

229
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,590
Today's Rose Day. Please accept this. It's a hundred roses.

230
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,440
Huh? There's a flower missing. Where is it? It was the prettiest one, too.

231
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,030
I hope you don't plan on saying that Wang Ja Rim is the last rose!

232
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,440
- Hey, stop it. 
- Why not?

233
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,400
The last flower...

234
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,180
is me!

235
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,590
- Hey, let's go out. 
- What?

236
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,410
- Really? 
- I'm just kidding.

237
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,000
How do you feel when you're the one being tricked? Don't pull something like this again.

238
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,790
Ja Rim, what do you mean I was kidding? My confession isn't a joke.

239
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,480
Let's go out. I'll try really hard.

240
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,390
Are you guys making a drama or something?

241
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,940
Is the title "Playing With Fire"? 
 (T/N: also a metaphor for having an affair)

242
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,680
- Let go. 
- No, give me an answer.

243
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,930
I'll give you an answer. I'll text you.

244
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,510
Can't you just tell me now?

245
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,660
In my current mood, dating you is the last thing I want to do.

246
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,040
I'm sorry, ma'am. Please take your time.

247
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,530
Take this one at least.

248
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,380
It's pretty.

249
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,640
It's pretty entertaining.

250
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,930
Yeah, this drama is fun.

251
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,200
Hey, so is Wang Ja Rim

252
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,350
really going to text him an answer later?

253
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,210
- For now, let's go to Joo Yeong's house and see the outcome. 
- Sure.

254
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,050
Hey, let us know how it went when you get the answer.

255
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,670
Okay.

256
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,670
Hey, are you going out with your phone?

257
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,270
Yeah, punk. It's only been a few minutes since we got home and you're so jumpy. I'm getting more anxious than you!

258
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,740
Then go home. Why are you guys still here?

259
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,950
How can we miss out on this fun spectacle?

260
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,250
Hey, hey, since we're bored, let's make a bet. I bet 100 won that Gong Joo Yeong is rejected.

261
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,630
Hey, hey, hey. Why are you gambling on a matter of life and death?

262
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,490
What do you mean, life and death? You're so overdramatic.

263
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,540
Give me ramen!

264
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,400
You want ramen?

265
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,980
Hey, you want ramen? Ramen? You want to eat ramen?

266
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,330
You want ramen? It sounds good, right?

267
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,340
Should I make you some ramen? Do you guys want, too?

268
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,030
Who was it?

269
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,020
- Not me. 
- Me neither.

270
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,600
It's not me.

271
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,170
So freaking frustrating. Are you dismantling a bomb?

272
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,420
I'll check for you.

273
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,330
Hey! Hey, come on! What did she say?

274
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,000
What?

275
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,220
Hey.

276
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,720
Don't be too shocked.

277
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,490
- Why? 
- Wang Ja... said...

278
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,660
To be revealed next week!

279
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,240
Hey, you SOB!

280
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,230
- How dare you pull such an old trick! 
- Why would you bring up a joke from January 8, 2014? (T/N: The webtoon episode that this scene is from was released on this date.)

281
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,340
You crazy jerk!

282
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,720
â™« Even if I keep telling myself itâ€™s not real â™«

283
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,830
What the?

284
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,510
Ja Rim, thank you so much. I'll be really good.

285
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm so excited, I can't sleep!

286
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,230
- Hey, get your arm off. 
- You two look good together!

287
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,980
How's your studying going for the test next week?

288
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,230
- Aren't you going to study? 
- I am studying.

289
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,340
Studying you. The rule of Ja Rim.

290
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,920
Happy now? F****, you're freaking clueless.

291
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,300
If you don't like him, break up with him already. What are you doing right now, when you told him yes to dating?

292
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,640
- I don't dislike Gong Joo Yeong. 
- Then what?

293
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,220
â™« I like your smiling face the most â™«
