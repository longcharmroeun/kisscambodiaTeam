Nine.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,680
Ten.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,750
- What the...? 
 - Aren't you going to focus?

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,660
Twenty jumps this time. Same thing, do not say the last number out loud!

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,300
Start!

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,300

Eighteen.

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,590
Nineteen.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,730
-  Twenty! 
 - Gosh! Who is it?!

Hey, Kim Byeong Hoon, it's you isn't it? You jerk!

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,760
No, it's not me! Everyone is being tricked!

19
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,650
Let's go for lunch, come on. Stop it, guys.

20
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,240
Who is making noise? Do you still have strength left?

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,890
This time, it's a hundred jumps!

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,180
- How many? 
 - Hundred.

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,900
One-hundred jumping jacks. Start!

00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,830

Three. Four.

27
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,090
What's Gong Joo, that jerk, doing?

28
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,780
Six.

29
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,140
My brain is secreting to much endorphin.

 bang_H @princess_0: Aren't you going to practice?

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,720
You idiot, you can't even do that?

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,660
- It really wasn't me! 
 - You were the furthest one in the back! Who else would it be?

33
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,940
I'm telling you it was your homeroom teacher!

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,700
It sounded just like your voice.

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,660
Hey, you guys have known me for three years and you don't even recognize my voice?

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,880
Of course I do! Your voice sounds super old. Like a grandpa.

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,220
That's because my voice broke early with puberty.

38
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,690
Hey, Gong Joo.

39
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,410
There is a grain of cooked rice.

40
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,390
Who do you think you are to get rid of my grain of cooked rice?

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,180
What's this, why the sudden lurch?

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,190
What's the matter?

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,470
- What the heck is he doing? 
 - He's lost his marbles, that's all.

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,180
Ready?

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,800
- Ah Rong, new attempt! 
 - Ooh, will she really make it?

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,220
Oh Ah Ram! Oh Ah Ram!

47
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,880
Ja Rim!

48
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,720
- What is it?
 - Ja Rim.

49
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,610
Go while I'm talking nicely.

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,390
Master, what might this be?

51
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,210
That grain of rice on his cheeks, the desperate look,

52
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,390
and Ja Rim's disgusted expression. If we put all that together...

53
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,680
- I think he's asking her to take off that rice for him. 
  - No, no.

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,860
It's degeneration due to lack of affection. Friends, prepare for suction.

55
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,580
Ja Rim, just this once please.

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,530
Take care of it.

57
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,570
Wow, that's level up!

58
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,500
- It would have been better if Ja Rim did it. 
 - If I did, I probably would've kicked your face.

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,410
It's fine. Since if I get kicked by you, it's a physical exchange of affection.

60
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,680
If getting kicked is physical affection, then boxing matches must be blind dates?

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
- Then UFC must be s— 
 - Socks, like these ones. 
 - You crazy girls!

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,200
- Let's stop here. 
 - Anyway, he's nothing ordinary.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,200
- I also want a guy to obsess over me. 
 - I hate this. Come here.

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,880
Hey, you should go now. Free time is almost over.

65
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,160
Yang Min Ji, good luck!

66
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,340
Here I go.

67
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,810
Hey! Don't do that.

68
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,100
Is that a melodrama, or thriller?

69
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,170
It's definitely not a melodrama.

70
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,390
Hey.

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,350
It's not as feasible as I thought. I'm actually the only one who didn't fall in the water.

72
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,090
Gosh. Anyway, just don't clown around and get hurt for nothing. Okay?

73
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,500
If you guys get hurt, my confession is doomed. Got it?

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,640
- Hey.
 - Hey, hey.

75
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,550
- Are you okay?
 - Hey, hey!

76
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,120
Hey! It really hurts. It really hurts.

77
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,280
- I'm not the one who did this. 
 - Hey, that was totally attempted murder there.

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,590
What the heck.

79
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,800
Oh? What's wrong with him?

80
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,460
What is this? Lee Kaeng, did you get hurt?

81
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,760
- He was messing with Ah Ram and she retaliated. 
 - Thanks to her, I'm off the boot camp training so it's nice.

82
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,680
I asked you not to get hurt!

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,130
Thank you for your warm-hearted words of worry, you jerk. Dammit.

84
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,300
Doest it hurt a lot?

85
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,500
♫  Careless careless. Shoot anonymous anonymous ♫

86
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,990
♫  Heartless mindless. No one who care about me.  ♫

87
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,500
♫ In a state of loss  ♫

88
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,440
How is it? Don't you think I would look like the visual of the group if I danced with this?

89
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,680
So much bluffing. It's fine, forget it. I'm fine, so don't push yourself.

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,070
For the dance... we'll do what we can.

91
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,520
- How? 
 - We should do it just the two of us, I guess.

92
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,620
But Kyeong Woo's part will be empty. And there are movements we put together for three.

93
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,740
We don't have choice then. I'll have to take action.

94
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,890
- If Gong Joo takes my part— 
 - No, he can't.

95
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,040
He has the part just before, the moves will clash.

96
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,580
Don't ignore me! I watched you practice all the time.

97
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,730
I even completely memorized all the moves.

98
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,640
The longer you think about it, the more I get hurt.

99
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,720
- Let's try to do it for now. 
 - Great.

100
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,510
Hurry up. You in the center, you on the right.

101
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,050
I didn't even stick it in yet.

102
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,190
- You're boring a hole in my scalp! 
 - Bear it, bear it. Done.

103
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,020
One more.

104
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,030
Hey Ja Rim, your cleanser is nice. It's light like a lotion and has a nice scent.

105
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,510
It's nice, right? I want to change to that one too.

106
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,730
Done! All done, Ah Rong. 
 (T/N: Ah Rong is Ah Ram's nickname)

107
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,520
- Give me that. 
 - What is it?  
 - Hey, this side is a bit higher.

108
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,420
N-No! Look. Like this.

109
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,470
No! Hey, look at this objectively. How is it?

110
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,660
- It's cute. It suits you well. 
 - You're really good at tying hair into buns.

111
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,550
- Okay, out now, Ah Rong. 
 - Okay.

112
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,470
Okay, next! Ja Rim. You need to look good in front of your boyfriend.

113
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,230
Are you nuts? Who's whose boyfriend? I'm fine, so do it for Jin Hui.

114
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,970
Okay, come here.

115
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,180
- What do you want? 
 - Buns too.

116
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,320
The talent show will start soon. All students are to go to the assembly hall. 

117
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,830
Hey. Hey, are you a motorcycle?

118
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,740
Let go! Do you want to get hit by a motorcycle? I should just stab you with this.

119
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,890
- Hey, you almost got stabbed for real.  
 - Wow, I almost died.

120
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,670
By the way, Gong Joo Yong prepared something, right? I caught a glimpse of him earlier, and he was all dressed up.

121
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,290
Hey. You absolutely can't tell Wang Ja, okay?

122
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,010
Gong Joo worked super hard to surprise her.

123
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,430
Of course, I won't! But Gong Joo Yeong is really unlucky.

124
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,250
Class 4 is before them, but there's one guy in that class who used to be an idol trainee.

125
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,590
Even if they do quite well, they'll get crushed.

126
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,230
- Hey, hey, help me. 
 - Don't wanna.

Hey, Ahn Gaeng. Don't be nervous. You're stressing me even more.

I never realized I have stage fright.

 - You scared me. What's going on with you?

Drink this and relax.

143
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,630
You drink it, Gong Joo.

144
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,910
Why am I trembling like this?

145
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,080
Don't be nervous. I'll do it.

146
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,760
What about your foot?

147
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,410
- It'll be fine for two minutes. 
 - Are you really okay?

148
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,480
Worry about yourself. Since you decided to do it, push through to the end.

149
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,970
I won't make you say it was ruined because of a mistake.

150
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,270
Then... I'll leave it to you.

Wow, it's crazy! The crowd is on fire!

152
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,970
It was amazing. Come on, give a big round of applause for class 4.

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,640
It's really amazing. What's this? I thought you were Yisam Information High School.

166
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,700
♫ In a state of loss, it's like I am looking away ♫

167
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,500
♫ I can only hold it in ♫

168
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,230
♫ Though I shut my eyes ♫

169
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,180
♫  Your Highness, answer me now  ♫

170
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,750
♫ Tell me why people have changed  ♫

171
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,710
♫ Tell me if there really ever existed a time that was beautiful  ♫

172
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,040
♫ Now they even forgot how to love  ♫

173
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,670
♫ And lost their thoughtfulness as well  ♫

174
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,920
♫ Too busy living with their backs turned to each other  ♫

175
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,300
♫ The mask of anonymity hides a jealousy filled with murderous intent  ♫

176
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,060
♫ Even with the end in sight, they seem hungry ♫

177
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,690
♫ We are satisfied now ♫

178
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,500
♫ Will we never face each other again?  ♫

179
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,150
♫ Will we never communicate?  ♫

180
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,600
♫ Won't we love? ♫

181
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,330
♫ The painful reality ♫

182
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,360
♫ Makes me shed tears once more ♫

183
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,060
♫ We are able to change it, we can just change it.   ♫

184
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,780
♫ Say so, Your Highness. Your Highness.  ♫

185
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,330
What's happening?

186
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,940
What's going on? Darn it.

187
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,210
Let's just go.

188
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,210
Gong Joo what are you doing? Let's go down.

189
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,160
What the hell is happening?

190
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,970
They must be planning something.

191
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:47,600
♫ I want to get that star and place it in your two hands as a gift. ♫

192
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:54,460
♫ I want to gather everything I have and give it to you ♫

193
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,500
♫ Sometimes I cry, afraid I'll lose you ♫

194
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:10,540
♫ Sometimes I feel you sleeping in my arms ♫

195
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:19,120
♫  I promise you on the day of the first snow ♫

196
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,000
♫ I promise with you.  Together with you ♫

197
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,600
♫ as we stroll through the day hand in hand  I will shout ♫

198
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,870
♫ "I love you." I hope those two hands holding each other ♫

199
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,060
♫ won't ever know of the passing of time. ♫

200
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,410
What the? He was hella nervous, but he's good.

201
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:05,500
♫ I want to keep all your warmth in there ♫

202
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,000
♫ That's how I feel, for a long time ♫

203
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,700
♫ Sometimes I cry, afraid you will forget me ♫

204
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:26,880
♫ Sometimes I feel you gently closing your eyes. ♫

205
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,360
♫  I promise you  on the day of the first snow♫

206

209
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,220
I'll give five hundred points to the one who gives the loudest applause!

210
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,370
Class two! Class two!

211
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,810
Okay, class one. I'll remember you.

212
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,730
Wow really, isn't this school's level far too high?

213
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,300
- He did really well, didn't he?  
 - Yes!

214
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Okay, great. You've done well. You can step off the stage now.

215
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,490
That's what you thought I'd say, right?

216
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,700
If I just let him go down, I can just quit my job as the recreation instructor, no?

217
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,300
Yes!

218
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,630
Okay, then. The student who thinks they are the one

219
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,950
he sang this song for, please hurry up to the stage.

220
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,500
Go up! Go up!

221
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,840
No matter what, I think it was for me!

222
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,850
I knew he would get hit, I knew it.

223
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:06,200
Okay, the girl from class three who wears red!

224
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,620
If you come up to the stage now, I'll give you a thousand points.

225
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,250
If you don't come, you'll get minus thousand points!

226
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,410
- Hey Wang Ja Rim, go up. Go. 
 - Hurry up and go.

227
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,920
- Hey, go up. 
 - Hurry.

228
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,000
The points are meaningless anyway.

229
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,830
Come on, go up.

230
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,700
Hey, go up.

231
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,130
Here. Go.

232
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,580
- Good! 
 - Go, go!

233
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,620
- Okay, stand on this side. 
 - You look good together!

234
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,870
Can you each tell me your names?

235
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,210
I'm Gong Joo Yeong.

236
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,670
Gong Joo Yeong. You have a pretty name.

237
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,200
And you, what's your name?

238
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,500
She's Wang Ja Rim.

239
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,760
You're Wang Ja and Gong Joo? 
 (T/N: homonyms for "prince" and "princess")

240
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,630
Wait, I got goosebumps right now. You didn't set this up, did you?

241
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,490
No!

242
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,480
So they're a match made in heaven!

243
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,690
Alright, then. How long have you been together with your boyfriend?

244
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,790
He's not my boyfriend.

245
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,830
He's not your boyfriend? What's this, what's your relationship?

246
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,190
Give me the mic, and do this.

247
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,340
Okay, today is their first day of dating!

248
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,940
Alright then, as a celebration of you becoming a couple,

249
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,220
should we have a duet?

250
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,180
Can't you stop?

251
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,130
Kiss!

252
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:52,260
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

253
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,450
No, no! They can't kiss! Their homeroom teacher is here at the back.

254
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,810
He's staring directly at them, they can't kiss.

255
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,910
What? I got it. Okay then, since it's their first day of dating,

256
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,640
they can hug. If you hug each other, you can get off the stage.

257
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,280
Hug! Hug! Hug! Hug!

258
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,430
Let's not drag this out! It's boring!

259
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,840
Hey, shut up.

260
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,610
- But they're no fun.  
 - Won't you shut the hell up?

261
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,440
Shut it!

Hey, don't do it.

264
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,930
Hey.

265
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,870
- What's that? 
 - Is that a hug?

266
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,590
- What are they doing? 
 - No fun.

267
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,740
Are you guys practicing asceticism?

268
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,780
Now that I'm in here,

269
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,680
I feel like I'm being protected.

270
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,590
His arms really give a sense of security.

271
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,520
Okay, give him another round of applause!

272
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,940
Alright, next contestant is class five! Class five, come up the stage!

It's her, the ascetic hug. Hella cringe-worthy.

278

Cringe!

279
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,950
Have you gone nuts? 

280
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,100
Ja Rim is really cold to me since the talent show.

281
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,810
So when are you two going to date? 

282
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,200
Stop the nonsense, what date?

283
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,070
- You're Gong Joo Yeong, aren't you? 
- Who...? 

284
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,120
- That means it was uploaded by someone from our school. 
 - Unbelievable. Are they nuts?

285
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,080
- Are we going to stay put? Let's go tomorrow right away. 
 - Fuck it, delete what?!

286
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,270
- Do you think you're some bloody celebrity? 
- Hey. 

287
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,140
Wang Ja Rim did just go to argue about it, but it's also your business you know. Aren't you going?
