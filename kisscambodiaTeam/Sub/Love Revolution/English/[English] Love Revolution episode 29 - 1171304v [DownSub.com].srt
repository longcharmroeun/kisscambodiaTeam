00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,550
Gong Joo Yeong used to go to tutoring school diligently, but who knows what garbage that b*tch told him.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:18,340
He stopped going to tutoring school one day. His grades weren't bad before.

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,030
He even sold his favorite shoes to buy stuff for her. Sh*t. 

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,840
Is that called dating? He was more like her underling.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,540
But that idiot still thinks she dated him because she liked him.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,180
But she knows he's soft-hearted, so she probably contacted him to take advantage of him again.

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,170
I'm sure about that.

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,660
You said she didn't date him because she liked him?

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,900
Their group of girls were fighting or something,

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,370
and one of them spilled the beans to me. From the beginning... Damn it.

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,150
She was trying to get introduced to some other dummy at first.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,150
It didn't work, so that's why she went to Gong Joo Yeong.

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,560
What are you saying? She went after Gong Joo Yeong because she couldn't get another guy?

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,060
How are they related?

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,260
I have to protect that dummy's identity too. 
 [That other XX]

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,320
I'm speechless. I know he looks naive, but still...

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,840
I did find it strange when Gong Joo Yeong started

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,710
going around borrowing money.

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,840
Are you mad?

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,980
That b*tch.

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,100
Sweetie, are you mad?

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,070
You don't believe what the guys said just now, do you?

24
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,960
They're all lies! Seriously, nothing happened between us.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,910
Are you mad?

26
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,230
 How can I not be mad? 

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,920
Should I tell Gong Joo Yeong?

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,610
Then those rumors about you will stop too. That b*tch will be screwed over too.

29
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,060
What is this? Why is she like that?

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,990
Does she believe them?

31
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,160
I know it's not true.

32
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,370
- What? 
 - Stop letting me have my way all the time.

33
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,470
And no need to be so cautious around me.

34
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm dating you because I like you too.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,460
Ja Rim.

 glasses @princess_0: I'm hella envious

38
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,980
- Hey, let's go. 
 - Yeah.

39
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,790
Bo Gyeong: Joo Yeong, I'm in front of your school.

40
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,140
Let's talk today for sure.

41
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,990
- Kwak Bo Gyeong said she's waiting for me again. 
 - Gosh.

42
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,460
What do I do? Should I just meet her and make things clear to her?

43
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,760
Forget it. Just go. I'll tell her to scram.

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,200
Apparently, Kwak Bo Gyeong came to our school again.

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,420
Leave through the back door with Gong Joo Yeong.

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,440
Tell Joo Yeong I left with the girls already.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,620
- What? Why? 
 - I have something to say to her.

48
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,620
Hey, I know how you feel, but she won't get it. You'll just be getting into this mess for nothing.

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,190
Even so,

50
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,060
I can't just leave this mess be.

51
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,860
Should I tell Gong Joo Yeong?

52
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,010
Then those rumors about you will stop too. That b*tch will be screwed over too.

53
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,250
Don't tell him.

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,800
- Why not?
 - He'll know she never liked him.

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,300
He'll be really hurt.

56
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,990
What about the rumors about you?

57
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,960
Never mind about that. It's better than him finding out about this.

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,910
You absolutely must not tell him. I'll handle it.

59
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,120
It looks like when she slightly disliked someone, she would spread gossip like hell.

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,800
But what, events?

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,170
Gong Joo Yeong didn't know any of that. She ordered him around.

62
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,390
Let's talk.

63
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,150
I have nothing to say to you.

64
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,630
But I do.

65
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,890
Hey! What the hell?

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,130
Quick, come.

67
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,100
- Why? 
 - Wang Ja Rim went to see Kwak Bo Gyeong.

68
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,790
What?

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,100
Why did you drag me all the way here?

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,480
What is it? Scared that there will be bad rumors about you again?

71
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,710
How do you know that there are sh*tty rumors about me in our school?

72
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,460
It's like you spread the rumors.

73
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,350
What about you, nothing you feel guilty about?

74
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,400
Did you hear something from Lee Kyeong Woo?

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,300
Since you know, don't come looking for Gong Joo Yeong. Don't even contact him.

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,360
Why should I stop? I'm just contacting him as a friend.

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
Friend? What b*llshit.

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,960
Do you not have a conscience? It seems you're trying to take advantage of him again because he's nice.

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,380
He's not someone you can exploit however you want.

80
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,530
You're so funny. Seeing how Gong Joo Yeong behaves, I think you aren't any easier than me.

81
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,310
Did I extort money from him or something?

82
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,420
He opened his wallet on his own because he liked me.

83
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:37,330
But seeing him spend his money on another girl, it felt like such a pity.

84
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,520
When it's thanks to me that he gets called a romantic boyfriend.

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,500
I didn’t want my efforts to be in vain so I contacted him.

86
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,690
And he replied to me.

87
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,650
He still likes me, you stupid wench.

88
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,100
The idiot who's keeping in contact with me while he has a girlfriend, and the idiot that you are for dating that idiot...

89
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,170
You idiots sure have such a nice relationship.

90
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,060
Wait, no. You're also playing Gong Joo Yeong, so you're not an idiot.

91
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,870
You're a b*tch like I am.

92
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,860
Except I'm not a sl*t.

93
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,220
I heard you dated Oppa Choi Jeong Woo.

94
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,720
You did everything with that man-whore, and now you're playing with Gong Joo Yeong.

95
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,700
Is your life comfortable? I'm quite something, but you're also impressive.

96
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,980
Don't do it.

97
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,210
Let go. Ja Rim has to hear such words, but you're telling me to just do nothing?

98
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,390
Wang Ja Rim was the one who said she wanted to meet her first.

99
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,600
She must have her own plan. Just step back for now.

100
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:53,240
Yeah. There are nasty rumors about me. But that's probably because I'm pretty.

101
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,730
But you’re not pretty,

102
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,820
so I’m not surprised there were no rumors about how you played with Joo Yeong.

103
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,270
It's you guys who made sure of that. Do you think I don’t know you stay quiet because you don’t want that pushover to get hurt?

104
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,480
It's clear, seeing how you haven't told him yet. What? Do you want me to tell him?

105
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,110
No, you don’t need to do that.

106
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,390
- Because I have recorded everything.
 - Crazy witch.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,100
It's a lie. Looks like you are actually scared of being found out?

108
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,270
- Ja Rim, are you okay? 
- Joo Yeong, did you see that?

109
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,890
- She was telling me not to see you— 
 - Yes, I saw. All of it.

110
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:48,970
Still, it's a relief you didn't actually like me. Don’t contact me again.

111
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,660
- Bo Gyeong, are you okay?
 -  Wang Ja Rim, are you crazy?

112
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,660
- I'm okay.
 - You crazy bitch.

113
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,520
So it's not only your boyfriend you treat like crap, you're a real thug.

114
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,280
Who do you think you are to beat her? Should I report you for school violence?

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,620
Your friend hit her first. She’s a total psycho. We heard everything.

116
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,070
What the hell? We saw Wang Ja Rim hit her first.

117
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,610
Don't cover up that kind of thing.

118
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,110
You're defending her even when you saw who hit whom.

119
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,790
As Gong Joo Yeon's friends, you also only care about looks, right?

120
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,200
I usually don’t care about looks. But thanks to you, I plan on doing that as of today.

121
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,730
Appearance and personality are proportionate to each other.

122
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,150
What about you? The ugly ones like you always butt in to look cool.

123
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,290
I know. Look at him wearing brand-name shoes to try to impress.

124
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:47,160
And who's that dumb-looking beanpole next to him? Are they playing a couple of fools?

125
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,260
I hear this all the time, so it has no effect on me now. And what you just said also includes you two.

126
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,550
You are a... Jeez...

127
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,520
Forget it. It’s not worth fighting with them.

128
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,030
You used "forget it" and also "worth." You've got nothing else to say now, have you?

129
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,980
Jeez, you crazy fool.

130
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,020
Just take her and leave now. It's true she was the first to hit the other.

131
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,310
Then what did we see? We saw Wang Ja Rim was the one who hit her first.

132
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,200
My hands are trembling. She told me she didn’t want me near her boyfriend.

133
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,040
Did I extort money from him or something? He opened his wallet on his own because he liked me.

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,880
But seeing him spend his money for another girl, it felt like such a pity.

135
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,320
When it's thanks to me that he gets called a romantic boyfriend.

136
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,810
As soon as I told her I had recorded everything, she hit me.

137
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,550
You told me it was a lie, you crazy punk!

138
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,300
- Wang Ja Rim, well done. 
 - PotG, right? (PotG: a game-changing action) 
 - Yep.

139
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,420
Do you hear that? Girls, why don't you say anything?

140
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,020
The atmosphere has suddenly turned cold, right?

141
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,210
Kwak Bo Gyeong, I never want to see you again.

142
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,260
Girls, that was—

143
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,700
Bo Gyeong, I'm sorry.

144
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,490
But we'll get going first.

145
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,410
What's that? It really was Kwak Bo Gyeong's voice, right?

146
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,540
Seriously, this gave me goosebumps. She's a psycho.

147
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,660
A real psychopath. I got the chills.

148
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,260
- Let's go.
 - Jeez.

149
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,940
Wang Ja Rim, are you crazy?

150
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,190
- You crazy bitch.
 - So it's not only your boyfriend you treat like crap, you're a real thug.

151
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,160
Who do you think you are to beat her? Should I report you for school violence?

152
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,430
Still, it's a relief you didn't actually like me.

153
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,550
They probably won't do that anymore, I guess.

154
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,960
Thank goodness the misunderstandings have been cleared.

155
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,170
Are you okay now?

156
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,840
And you. Are you okay?

157
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,190
Me? Why do you ask?

158
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,800
Uh...

159
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,640
- The thing about her not liking you. 
- What?

160
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,430
- What does that matter? It's actually a good thing. 
- What?

161
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,400
To me, you’re the only one!

162
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,950
It would be extremely complicated if someone else liked me.

163
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,970
And...

164
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,430
I’m sorry I played the recording in front of the guys.

165
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,540
What are you sorry for? You did a good job. That made me feel relieved.

166
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,060
Don't apologize. I should be the one apologizing.

167
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,690
I didn’t know she was like that, and I made you suffer for nothing.

168
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,810
I'll make your favorite cream pasta today! I'll put a lot of shrimp in it

169
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,840
Let's go.

170
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,300
What's wrong with you? This makes me embarrassed.

171
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,580
Ja Rim?

172
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,410
Don't move!

173
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,830
♫ Are you all right?  ♫

174
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,910
I don’t want to.

175
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,430
♫ How are we? ♫

176
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:16,740
♫ I know this above anything else:  ♫

177
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,680
♫ I love you ♫

178
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,060
Why are you crying?

179
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,980
You aren't okay.

180
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm totally fine.

181
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,300
I don't care at all what she used to think of me...

182
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,980
because you're hugging me like this right now.

183
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:38,620
♫ If you would only stay by my side ♫

184
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:46,310
♫ Then it will always be paradise, my dear ♫

185
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:57,080
♫ Let's be together now. ♫

186
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,710
I love you, Ja Rim.

187
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,020
- I think now I know what it really means—  
- I know.

188
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,930
to like someone.

189
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,980
No, no. You should say "Me too"! Let's do it again.

190
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,660
I love you!

191
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,260
Do you have shrimp at home? Or Should we buy them?

192
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,550
Come on! Don’t change the topic.

193
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,490
How much are shrimp these days?

194
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,780
I don't know!

195
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,040
Me too.

196
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,690
Eh?

197
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,990
Do you know where to buy shrimp for cheap?

198
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,680
I don't know. What was that? You just replied "Me too", right?

199
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,030
Did it sound like I was answering you?

200
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,590
I don't know.

201
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,510
Me too.

202
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,550
Come on!

203
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,500
Let's stop by the grocery store. I'll buy the shrimp.

204
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,060
Okay.

205
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,560
You thought I'd just let it go, right?

206
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,690
I told you not to tell him but you made him hear everything directly.

207
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,250
But in the end it all worked out.

208
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,250
Are you feeling better now?

209
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,600
You should have thrown one more punch at her.

210
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,990
Because I didn’t want to get my hands dirty.

211
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,160
Eat it. It's your reward.

212
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,090
Ja Rim.

213
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,490
Hurry, let's go to the snack store before the bell rings.

214
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,060
Okay.

215
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,660
Ja Rim?

216
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,520
What? Did Prince just take his hand first?

217
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,690
And at school?

218
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,120
What's wrong with her?

219
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,390
I'm suddenly confused. Is this a dream?

220
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,260
Hey, let's check if it's a dream or not.

221
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,190
Why do you have to check through me?

222
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,630
What's going on? Did something happen?

223
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,010
You're right. What's wrong with our puritan Miss Wang?

224
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,190
Hey, be quiet you guys! Ja Rim is going to bleed from her ears.

225
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,230
Hey, you be quiet!

226
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,920
Okay!

227
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,650

228

♫ I'm still the same ♫

229
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,550
♫ What am I expecting? ♫

230
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:37,400
♫ Am I still waiting, holding onto the lingering hope that you will cone back? ♫

233
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,500
I bet no one knows what day it is tomorrow.

234
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,540
It's a special anniversary day created by me just for us.

235
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,160
I'm already screwed from the beginning.

236
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,570
Did you only have eyes for him since back then? 

237
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,800
It would have been better if I had liked him from that day.

238
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,990
- This place is very famous but does not take reservations. 
- But it's closed.

239
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,800
Geez! What the hell are we doing?

240
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,630
It’s time. H-hour.

241
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,330
Reply, you crazy punks!

242
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,450
 Sorry, Darling

243
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,140
 All the plans went wrong and today is ruined.

244
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,200
 What do you mean ruined? This is just the beginning.

245
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,530
 Close your eyes.
