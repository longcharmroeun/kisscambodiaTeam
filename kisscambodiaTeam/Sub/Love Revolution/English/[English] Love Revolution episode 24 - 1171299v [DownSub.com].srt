1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,080
You're not going to eat?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,810
Snacking is a big no-no. I'll just eat a salad for dinner, too.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,510
How can you live like that? Just eat. You are already thin.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,420
Hearing that from skinny people doesn't comfort me one bit.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,440
You've never had flab. You wouldn't know what it's like.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,750
Still, didn't you lose some weight?

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,210
About, well, 1.5 kilograms?

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,600
Hey, don't you lose that much after you take a dump?

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,500
Good for you if your poop is big.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,470
Just eat and exercise. Don't make the girls feel uncomfortable for eating.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,710
Exercise...

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,530
Hey, there was an accident in the canteen so they're making emergency repairs.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,820
Then what do we eat today?

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,970
We have to buy something at the snack store. Oh yeah!

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,960
What "Oh yeah," you bonehead? The entire school will be going to the snack bar.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,580
The place will burst.

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,950
Subtitles brought to you by Teenage Love Team @ Viki.com

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,870
So stingy, did you have to clear out the store?

19
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,260
Hey, what's this?

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,260
We were going to tell you to order in, but you guys ran out before. We don't have time to queue at the snack bar.

21
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,330
Dammit, I ran for nothing.

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Ja Rim! The pizza and pasta are here!

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
Put it there!

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,730
Thank you, how did you know I wanted pizza?

25
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,000
Let go, it's for Ja Rim!

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,240
So it's fine if your friend starves to death?

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,360
What an exaggeration. Just eat a little.

28
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,990
I'll take this one.

29
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,470
Nope, it's mine.

30
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,280
Go eat with your girlfriend! Why come here and be annoying?

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,160
That's true. I haven't seen her today.

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,430
What, did you guys fight?

33
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,060
What the? Looks like you guys really did fight!

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,810
Ja Rim. I thought Joo Yeong was going a bit overboard at first, but is he normally this caring?

35
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,780
I think it is how he is. But it's true he goes overboard.

36
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,830
Really? Must be nice. 

37
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,140
Kyeong Woo is a bit inattentive, even though I do like that too. 

38
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,790
Ja Rim! Eat up.

39
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,580
Ta-da.

40
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,950
Gosh. Why did you have to fight now of all times? Adding another mouth to feed.

41
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,630
It was already unbelievable that he was even dating.

42
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,220
You really won't eat? You can have just a little. Just eat.

43
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,240
Leave her be. That makes one less person to feed. You're trying to lose some of that chub?

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,330
What? Do you have a death wish? What's wrong with me?

45
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,190
I don't think you'll look any better even if you lose any weight.

46
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,110
You're so annoying.

47
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,590
What? It was a joke.

48
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,360
Why is she so serious all of a sudden?

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Why did you bother her? She's already sensitive because of her diet.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,230
- Ja Rim, open up. 
 - Gosh.

51
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,280
I have hands, you know.

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,690
Gosh, seriously.

53
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,690
Quickly eat up before the others finish everything.

54
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,050
I think if I keep looking at them while eating, the pizza will come back out through my mouth as a stir-fried pancake.

55
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,030
Honey, you used to do that just for me. You've changed.

56
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,000
- Feed me too, me too! 
 - I will. I will feed you.

57
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,120
Sorry.

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,540
They told us not to order food in anymore. What do we do? Should we buy something beforehand?

59
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,220
No, I'm going to prepare a lunchbox.

60
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,050
But you're Snorlax, you love sleeping.

61
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,020
I can just make it tonight.

62
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,620
Wait, this might be an opportunity for me to show my worth as a family man. 

63
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,060
She'll want to marry me. 

64
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,130
Do you want me to prepare your lunchbox too? You love the food I make.

65
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,220
It's fine. I'll make yours too.

66
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,750
You've cooked a lot for me. I feel bad.

67
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,010
Wh-What?

68
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,480
Why? Are you afraid it'll taste bad again?

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,710
No, that's not it. It's because I'm scared it'll be tiring for you.

70
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,190
It's fine. Making something for two people is quick.

71
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,900
Really? I'm sure it'll taste great.

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,590
Love Revolution: The lunchbox from hell. 

73
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,660
Episode 24. #CookingChallenge #HomemadeLunchbox #What'sOneTablespoon? 
 Arong_fighter @prince_rim: Just buy it...

74
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,090
Looks delicious.

75
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,530
This is stir-fried sausages, d-dried laver,

76
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,870
and even kimchi stew! Wow!

77
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,210
It's not. This is stir-fried fish cakes, to which I added sausages because you like them. 
 Stir-fried sausages - Wrong

78
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,240
And this isn't kimchi stew, it's stir-fried kimchi. 
 Kimchi stew - Wrong

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,650
Ah, really?

80
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,980
It looks delicious. Thanks for the food.

81
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,440
Okay. There's no way kimchi can taste bad, honestly.

82
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,290
Let's start with this. 

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,150
How... the kimchi is bland. Did she add water? 

84
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,530
It's so good.

85
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,720
Did you... add water maybe?

86
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,850
Yes. I was scared it would be too salty.

87
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,460
It's driving me crazy. She's so simple. 

88
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,510
So cute. 

89
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,920
Then I think it would be tasty if you added some onions too.

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,110
If it doesn't taste good, don't eat it.

91
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,000
No! It's delicious. Give it to me.

92
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,750
A lunch made by Wang Ja Rim?

93
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,460
Hey, just let me have one bite.

94
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,440
No!

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,190
No. I can't let Ja Rim get hurt. 

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,710
Ja Rim went through the trouble of making these for me. Why would I give it to you guys?

97
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,820
- Leave. 
 - Come on.

98
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,220
That makes me want to take it even more.

99
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,230
Oh yeah.

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,140
- Ah sorry. 
 - I think this has gone bad.

101
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,910
What?

102
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,100
What the hell are you saying? It's delicious!

103
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,690
Did love blind your tongue, too?

104
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,220
From Sang Hoon: Many people do home workouts these days. 

105
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,820
It could be difficult to go out to exercise, so I thought it would be all right with things you can do at home. 

106
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,770
This workout is the most popular among the easy ones.

107
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,230
I already said it last time, but I'd like it if you didn't push yourself too much.

108
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,460
You're already more than pretty enough. 

109
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,360
That makes one less person to feed. You're trying to lose some of that chub?

110
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,640
I don't think you'll look any better even if you lose any weight.

111
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,310
- It's really Devoted Hoon. 
 - You scared me.
 (T/N: pun on Jeong Sang Hoon: jeongseong means devotion)

112
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,570
- Have you made your decision? 
 - About what?

113
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,530
If you aren't playing with him, put an end to this soon.

114
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,370
What are you saying? I'm not playing with him.

115
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,950
But he likes you. You don't, so why are you exchanging texts with him? He's going to misunderstand.

116
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,770
I don't know...

117
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,060
I have something to ask you guys. Please answer honestly.

118
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,780
- What? 
 - What is it?

119
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,690
Does the food I make taste bad?

120
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,420
Ah, your food...

121
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,720
I don't know. I haven't eaten it lately so I can't tell.

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,250
Why? Did Gong Joo Yeong say it tastes bad?

123
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,020
He says it's fine, but the others couldn't eat any.

124
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,290
They must have suffered a lot. 

125
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,880
Then it must still taste like garbage.

126
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,640
How can you say it's garbage?

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,940
It's not that bad. It's just... a creative taste?

128
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,580
Be careful when adding seasoning. Don't put sugar without thinking to sweeten it. I'm sure you add water if you feel it's too salty, no?

129
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,150
But they say estimating the amounts by following your instinct is the best.

130
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:38,040
No, that can never work with you. People who are good at it do that, but you aren't.

131
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,050
That's true.

132
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,880
Can you maybe help me? With the lunchbox?

133
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,450
Okay. I'll come to your house later when I'm done.

134
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,430
Don't think too much about what the guys said earlier.

135
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,740
They lied because they're jealous of our relationship.

136
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,570
I think what you made is a hundred, a thousand times tastier than the food my mom and dad make.

137
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,790
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry. 

138
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll prepare our lunchbox for tomorrow. What do you want?

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,690
Should I make the stir-fried spicy pork you liked last time? Or mushroom marinated beef?

140
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,600
Just make what you want. Everything you make is tasty, anyway.

141
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,540
Really? Everything I made for you suited your taste?

142
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,050
Then you'd be really glad if we get married later, won't you?

143
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,130
You're going overboard again.

144
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,780
Why? I'll make you delicious food every day.

145
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,770
I'm back.

146
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,340
Hey, why are you putting that on? The hell...

147
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,420
You keep on wanting my clothes, you.

148
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,170
What's wrong? Let's share a bit.

149
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,660
You're so darn cheap.

150
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,520
Gosh. Ja Rim gave this to me as a gift!

151
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,140
I was being careful not to use too much.

152
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,290
Such a fuss.

153
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,540
Real belch extra? Real burp? 
 Real Barrier Extreme

154
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,440
Why did you take that out?

155
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,940
"Strengthens the skin barrier and moisturizes."

156
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,630
Isn't this something girls use?

157
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,120
Guys use it too. You should buy some and use it, too.

158
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,270
If you don't want to be "no girlfriend Kyeong Min" all your life.

159
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,070
Cook like you do math. Think of it as a formula and follow the quantities.

160
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,140
The next most important things are timing and controlling the flame.

161
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,440
Math is my worst subject, though.

162
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,270
So that's why you're this bad at cooking. It's alright. Here.

163
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,930
Start by cracking the egg and putting it in.

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,500
Here.

165
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,100
Hey, stop!

166
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,690
Look. There's a shell in it.

167
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,370
Really?

168
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,430
You see how there was a shell inside?

169
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,570
Your hit was too light so it didn't break cleanly and a shell fell in. Got it?

170
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,620
Try with a bit more force. Go on.

171
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,120
Okay.

172
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,160
You don't know how to settle for the middle.

173
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,910
Look, kimchi is already seasoned, so you don't really need to season it more.

174
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,830
But when you want to stir-fry it, you can add some sugar to make it a bit sweeter. It tastes nice.

175
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,140
Give me the sugar.

176
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,160
Wow. This will definitely taste good.

177
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,220
Gosh, it's salty.

178
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,190
Dammit, this is salt!

179
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,630
Really? Sorry. It looks too much the same.

180
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,570
If you want to cook food, either write the name or make some mark on this.

181
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,480
Is it fine?

182
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,130
Does this look fine to you?

183
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,150
I think you should just become a regular at a side-dish shop around here.

184
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,080
That's the only solution.

185
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,010
Hey. Want to eat this?

186
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,090
You made this  for me?

187
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,960
For real?

188
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,260
Did you really make this, Nuna?

189
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,360
Why, does it taste bad?

190
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,300
I-It's good. Wow, so tasty.

191
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,980
Actually, my friend made this but it felt like a waste to throw it away.

192
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,760
I knew it. There's no way a gourmet like you could have made this.

193
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,290
Ew. I thought it was a hit-or-miss lunchbox or something.

194
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,790
But she made that with me while I taught her.

195
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:18,180
No wonder. Just like for a hit-or-miss, there are tasty things and the others must be your friend's.

196
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,910
Hurry up and eat.

197
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,700
Eat up.

198
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,150
If we go there, you can eat too.

199
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,150
No, it's fine! You should eat what you want to.

200
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,130
How can I do that? You won't be able to eat.

201
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,580
I found a tasty salad restaurant so it's all right.

202
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,320
Isn't that Lee Kyeong Woo?

203
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,570
Should we go say hi?

204
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,490
It's fine, let's just go on our way.

205
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,180
Sure.

206
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,670
So annoying. Why am I the only one bothered by him?

207
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,630
He's nothing special. 

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,160
Let's just go eat something tasty! I don't want to diet.

209
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,570
- Is that all right? 
 - Yeah.

210
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,940
You said I'm fine as I am. I don't think I need to go through the trouble.

211
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,700
Yeah.

212
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,780
The way you are now... you're pretty.

213
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,920
♫ Like that, so much time passes ♫

214
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,960
Let's go.

215
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,550
♫ Everyone looks happy ♫

216
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,790
Let's... continue to date.

217
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't want to break up with you.

218
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think I was having too many expectations and burdened you. I'm sorry for whining.

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,140
♫ The day you left goes by ♫

220
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,590
I won't expect anything from you.

221
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,330
♫ And so does the next day ♫

222
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,760
Sorry.

223
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,390
I've been feeling sorry ever since hearing what you said that day.

224
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,350
Dating you with my current feelings... 
 ♫ All the autumn leaves fall ♫

225
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,170
would feel wrong toward you. 
 ♫ And everything blooms anew ♫

226
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,430
What's wrong with 
 ♫ So why is my season the only one   ♫

227
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,890
your current feelings? 
 ♫ that stays still? ♫

228
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,870
You don't like me anymore?

229
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,040
Even if we keep dating,

230
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,000
I think I'll only be feeling sorry to you, rather than feeling love for you.

231
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,610
♫ Am I still waiting, holding onto the lingering hope  ♫

232
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm a bad jerk. 
 ♫ that you’ll come back? ♫

233
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,150
You bad jerk. 
 ♫ The only thing that’s still the same ♫

234
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,620
*sshole. 
 ♫ Is this street we walked on together,  ♫

235
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,490
I'm sorry. Really. 
 ♫ hand in hand ♫

236
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,030
♫ And me, wandering everywhere  ♫

237
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,140
♫ looking for you, crying  ♫

238
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm so happy.

239
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,130
I should have given up earlier. I held back for nothing.

240
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,630
Did I look like a pig just now?

241
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,880
No! It's nice to see you eating well.

242
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,620
Do you really think I'm alright the way I am now?

243
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,240
Yes.

244
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,790
Why do you like me?

245
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:04,090
I... From the first time we met, I really liked you.

246
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,400
You're bright, you smile a lot...

247
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,240
And even now, I still really like you.

248
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,280
Then should we... date?

249
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,230
The lunchbox of love for Ja Rim!

250
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,960
Enjoy!

251
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,560
Thanks.

252
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,990
Sweetie. What's this?

253
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,040
Don't tell me, a lunchbox of love for me?

254
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,330
That's not it, so don't overreact—

255
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,160
Of course, I should overreact! You made it for me not only once, but twice!

256
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,490
You want me to die from being touched?

257
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,470
Quiet down before I just kill you.

258
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,950
Thanks for the food.

259
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,700
Ja Rim. It tastes good!

260
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,220
What's up? Why, how come it tastes good?

261
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,360
How come?

262
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,210
Well, as long as it's good, it's fine.

263
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,550
♫ What do you like? I’m curious ♫

264
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:34,400
♫ I wonder about every single thing about you ♫

265
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,200
♫ May I ask? May I approach you? ♫

266
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,650
♫ I keep on getting excited ♫

267
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:48,520
Do you think this tastes good? Are you wearing a thimble on your tongue or what?

268
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,470
♫ My mood goes up then down, on a roller-coaster ♫

269
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,870
♫ I can never know how you are feeling ♫

270
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,820
This is a bit... salty but putting me in a bad mood.

271
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,110
Byeol Rim, Byeol Rim, come here.

272
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,150
No, no way, I'm not eating it.

273
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,990
- Just once. 
 - No!

274
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,400
Are you trying to torture my tongue on purpose or what?

275
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,940
I'll just make it for you.

276
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,870
♫ Pit a pat ♫

277
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,000
At this rate, I'll be the one going crazy.

278
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,660
Ja Rim, it's really delicious. Make it  again next time.

279
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,810
I'll try.

280
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,420
- You're so bad at it. 
 - I couldn't do it.

281
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,480
It's not bad, right?

282
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,490
Hey, the lunchbox Ja Rim prepared for me today was totally tasty.

283
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,910
Friend. How long have we been doing business together? How dare you try to trick us?

284
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,350
It's true!

285
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,350
Just try and say that Ja Rim can't cook, you'll die.

286
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,520
- Right, Yang Min Ji. 
 - Yeah?

287
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,720
I heard you're dating Sang Hoon?

288
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,250
Yeah, that's true.

289
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,650
What the? One couple disappears and another one is born?

290
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,860
Is it the law of conservation of couples or what?

291
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,350
One disappeared?

292
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,080
This fool broke up with Bang Ye Seul.

293
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,850
But I was sure they were on a date that day. 

294
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,260
Really? I'm only finding out now.

295
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,560
Why?

296
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,210
You don't need to know. It's my fault anyway.

297
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,080
No doubt, that's for sure.

298
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,510
Forget about me. These two are dating.

299
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,700
Sang Hoon is a really good guy so do well.

300
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,180
Okay.

301
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,580
♫ Everything feels unfamiliar ♫

302
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,290
♫ But nevertheless  ♫

303
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:57,690
Ye Seul - profile message: "Phew..." 
 ♫ When I think of you, there is only one answer ♫

304
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,400
They really broke up. 

305
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,590
♫ I guess I love you. I've been waiting ♫

306
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:14,860
♫ I wished for this very moment ♫

307
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,590
Love Revolution

308
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,200
We're going to study, why did you dress up? Did you get a girlfriend?

309
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,230
- His face says he does. 
 - You?!

310
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,060
- You must like it. 
 - I do. 

311
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,460
You're really cute. 

312
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,980
Nuna, do you want to see who can do hundred burpees the fastest? 

313
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,890
- Betting a meal. 
 - Deal. 

314
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,030
She's so pretty! Who is she? 

315
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,460
Isn't she a social worker? 

316
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,250
Do you want to be introduced to someone?

317
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,960
What's with this sentence? Making me want to puke.

318
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,170
- Let's have a talk. 
 - What the? You guys still haven't left?

319
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,300
This is a super important matter to me. I don't want to let this go. 

320
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,910
Will such a thing ever happen again in my life?

321
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,590
Just you try to stop me. I'll hate you forever. 

322
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,160
♫ I felt it from the beginning ♫
