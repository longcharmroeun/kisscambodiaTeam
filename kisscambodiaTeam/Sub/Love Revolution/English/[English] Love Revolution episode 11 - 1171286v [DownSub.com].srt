00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,800
I truly like you so much.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,200
I like you even more than I did at first.

4
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,910
That's why it's so hard.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,750
Hey.  Are you crying again?

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,090
But I feel I'm the only one who likes the other,

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,200
and I feel so miserable.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,900
What do you really think of me?

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,700
Do you still not like me, not even a little?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,610
I ...

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,420
I freaking hate it.

12
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,590
Ja Rim. I really like you—

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,550
I got it.  Keep away from me.

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,720
Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Gosh, seriously.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,510
Joo Yeong. I see you left some food for the pigeons on the street.

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,180
Oh wait, the Cola. Cola.

 kyungwoo @princess_0: Yeah, you're mistaken.

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,440
Come and sit over here.

20
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,900
- How do you feel? 
 - Okay.  I just have a headache.

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,630
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,710
 Remembers everything perfectly.  
 No.

23
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,290
Did I do something wrong?

24
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Hey.  Give me your hand.

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,500
Why?

26
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,500
Are you not sober yet? Why are you blushing?

27
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,190
Do you like this?

28
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,300
- Give it to me again. 
 - Huh?

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,800
Hand.

30
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,660
What are they doing?

31
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,830
What? It's the usual Wang Ja Rim and Gong Joo Yeong.

32
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,970
Hey Punk, do you remember yesterday?

33
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,940
N-No.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,800
I really like you a lot. Even more than I did at first.

35
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,210
Hey, I never said it like that!

36
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,670
He does remember, this punk.

37
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,540
- I said I don't. 
 - Sure.

38
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,700
In the future, if you've got anything pent up inside, tell me right away.  Don't act like you did yesterday.

39
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,810
- Memento. 
 - Hey!

40
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,490
Why? You told me to tell you right away.

41
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,920
Tsk tsk, pretending to be a guy who takes care of his skin.

42
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,800
You should take care of yours.

43
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,060
Ah right, you don't have anyone to look good for.

44
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,400
Sorry. It's just that I have someone to look good for.

45
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,030
As expected of something Ja Rim gave me.

46
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,850
There's no way it doesn't make my skin better.

47
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,470
It's so moist.

48
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,900
- Hey, want to touch? 
 - Yeah.

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,570
Hey! Dammit!

50
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,840
You must be crazy! You're making it rot!

51
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,600
I want to wash up again, dammit.

52
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,290
My face smells like feet, goddammit.

53
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,350
Ja Rim. I put on the cream you gave me.

54
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,370
I feel like I've got super smooth skin now.

55
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,120
Want to touch it?

56
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,430
Wow, your skin feels awesome.

57
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,490
Tsk tsk. You keep on washing up,

58
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,040
so of course your skin gets better.

59
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,050
Won't you go away? Huh? Won't you?

60
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,070
Are you going somewhere?

61
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,170
Yes. We can't go to the valley, so we're going to the mountain over there.

62
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,900
Yes, you should.  Play and have fun.

63
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,540
My goodness, I have to clean.

64
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,300
Oh my, my.  My back. Oh dear.

65
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,280
Anyway, this house is too big.

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,380
Oh dear, when will I get it all done?

67
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,710
Grandma, should we help you clean?

68
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,940
Oh no, no. Don't worry about anything and go play. Go.

69
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,510
I told you to go.

70
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,500
Well then, we'll be back later.

71
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,500
You guys insist on helping, I can't stop you.

72
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,920
No. My Ja Rim can't get dust on her hands.

73
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,460
No. My Ja Rim shouldn't get water on her hands.

74
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,270
Then can I get your blood on my hands?

75
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,130
Will you leave me be?

76
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,900
All right.

77
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,710
Hey. You've been cleaning that same spot since before.

78
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,530
I'm putting all my dedication into it.

79
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,380
Oh my, so admirable.

80
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,110
Min Ji, I swept everything that was here.

81
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,260
You did? Thanks.

82
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,330
I'll throw this away.

83
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,680
Sang Hoon is the most diligent, really. Great job to you!

84
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,610
What's this?  When did you two get so close?

85
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,750
What's it to you?

86
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,700
Do you like him?

87
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,560
- What are you saying, out of the blue? 
 - If not, never mind.

88
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,670
Oh! Birth of a new couple over here!

89
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,640
That's not so, moron.

90
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,490
Seriously, can you just shut your trap?

91
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,190
Doesn't a strong denial mean a strong affirmation?

92
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,660
- Say there, Noona— 
 - I don't want to.

93
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,000
You didn't even listen to what I have to say.

94
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,810
Aren't you going to ask me to talk to Jin Hui? You go talk to her yourself.

95
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,040
Wow. Crazy. How did you know?

96
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,560
You loser. What are you doing? Didn't you say you're an in-fighter?

97
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,170
Being inside or outside the ring is a different story.

98
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:40,000
You kept acting like you're so strong and all. Don't tell anyone you do boxing.

99
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
- Oh? 
 - You'll embarrass me.

100
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,800
You're really crossing the line. I'm serious about boxing.

101
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,970
You're joking. You're just trying to look cool.

102
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,050
You keep looking down on me, so let's fight it out. If you hit me just once, you win.

103
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,340
What will you do for me if I win?

104
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,450
I'll buy you a meal.

105
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,950
Deal.

106
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,190
-  Who will you bet on? 
 - 1000 won on Namgoong.

107
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,230
- Me too, Namgoong.

108
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,400
Fighting Namgoong Ji Soo! She's like a man, so don't go easy on her.

109
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,740
I'm for Oh Ah Ram.

110
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,640
Don't underestimate her. This noona's jabs are as fast as she is light.

111
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,860
But her reach is short. If you maintain your distance, she can't reach—

112
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,800
- Dalkgalbi (stir-fried chicken). 
 - Noona, that was a foul.

113
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,570
We never said we were following boxing rules.

114
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,210
Ja Rim, wait for me.

115
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,020
What? Haven't you eaten?

116
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,010
My stomach felt a little off.

117
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,290
Shouldn't you have something like hangover soup?

118
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,390
That's okay.  Let's go hiking.

119
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,040
Yes, Mom.  I'm having fun.

120
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,360
Yes, I ate.  Grandma made us something.

121
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,640
- Wait, but why do you like Yang Min Ji? 
 - Be quiet.

122
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,530
- I mean, she acts all haughty, 
 - I'll call you back.

123
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,860
- and she's like an old shrew. 
 - What are you doing?

124
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,390
Hey, hurry up and go.

125
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,080
Why didn't I notice anything?

126
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,260
It's a relief you didn't. You'll do more good staying put and quiet.

127
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,280
Come on. Wang Ja and Gong Joo being together is the result of my own work.

128
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
- Want me to help you out? 
 - Oh Gosh, stop it.

129
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,610
Just shut up and don't do anything, dammit.

130
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,270
Okay.

131
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,530
He likes me? Who?

132
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,810
- What are you doing here? 
 - Oh you scared me.

133
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,660
- Why haven't you left already? 
- I have to get my phone.

134
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,980
When did you arrive here?

135
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,010
Just now, I came out to take a call. Just now.

136
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,570
What's that? Don't tell me it's a guy?

137
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,550
It's my mom...

138
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,900
Wow, you know how to make haejangguk? (hangover soup)

139
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,510
Try the taste. I'll go to the bathroom for a second.

140
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,600
Hey, Gong Joo Yeong! Gong Joo! Come here.

141
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,040
- What? 
 - Taste this.

142
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,910
- Hey, did you add something in there? Is it a penalty dish or something? 
 - How is it?

143
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,490
It tastes like death. Like death, really. What did you put in there?

144
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,900
Ja Rim made that, you know.

145
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,360
This is something you can only taste in heaven once you've died, yes.

146
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,010
This nutcase, he's quick to adjust.

147
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,120
Whoa, Ja Rim this is seriously so delicious. H-How did you make this?

148
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Let's take a spoonful.

149
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,720
He's not swallowing.

150
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,410
Ja Rim, I swallowed it.

151
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,930
Oh, sorry.

152
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,570
- You're not throwing it away? 
 - That'd be a waste. Why would I? We should save it.

153
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,910
The seasoning should be right now. Want to try?

154
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,020
You managed to save this!

155
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,070
- I'm good at cooking. I'll be a chef later. 
 - Huh?

156
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,700
Hey, set the table in the living room!

157
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,510
Okay!

158
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,130
Go and have fun. You said you became close.

159
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,950
With whom?

160
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,750
What's this? When did you two get so close?

161
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,030
So what if we got close? Why does he care?

162
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,820
Go and have fun. You said you became close.

163
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,830
Is he...jealous? Yeah.

164
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,950
Why would he ask if I called a guy earlier?

165
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,530
Apply some ointment.

166
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,240
- There was that, too. 
- Don't you have a boyfriend?

167
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,920
I think you're the crazy one.

168
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,820
You were awake?

169
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,120
Ja Rim.

170
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,740
What?

171
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,220
Nothing.

172
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,730
Arrival gate 3

173
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,670
Hyungs and Noonims, I had a wonderful time.

174
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,650
- Bye! 
- It was fun. See you next time.

175
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,480
Get back safely, guys. I have to stop by somewhere so I'll go now.

176
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,680
- I'm going to go with Ja Rim, too. 
 - Bye.

177
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,230
Then, I will also get going.

178
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,560
My dalkgalbi (stir-fried chicken).

179
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,670
Oh, right. Yes.

180
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,180
Let's go. Let's move.

181
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,900
They're going to end up dating at that rate.

182
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,210
Ah Rong? No way.

183
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,510
Instead of them...

184
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,070
I think another couple will form.

185
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,430
- Really? Who? 
 - What?

186
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,130
You and Sang Hoon.

187
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,600
I should get going, too.

188
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

189
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,340
- Um... 
- Yes? Me? What?

190
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,970
Hey, Jeong Sang Hoon likes you and wants to know your number.

191
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,650
- Hey! 
- You're making the bystanders frustrated to death!

192
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,080
This punk has to go get some lessons from Gong Joo Yeong.

193
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,570
Forget it. I'll figure it on my own so all of you get lost.

194
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,960
I thought you had something going on with Jin Hui.

195
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,130
That's because Ahn Kyeong Min assumed things on his own...

196
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,290
- Hi. 
 Sang Hoon's point of view for the last three days

197
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,760
Mosquito!

198
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,950
Give this to Min Ji. Please.

199
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,030
You can't tell her.

200
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,200
Hey, want a tip? Girls like it when you take care of them nonchalantly. 

201
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,270
You sure?

202
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,940
- Oh! Birth of a new couple over here! 
 - That's not so, moron!

203
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,650
So don't tie me together with Jin Hui, dammit.

204
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,700
Wait, but why do you like Yang Min Ji?

205
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,690
Be quiet!

206
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,830
- Want me to help you out? 
- Gosh, stop it!

207
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,180
- Are you okay? 
 - Huh?

208
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,780
Yeah.

209
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,030
Uhm, but I'm sorry, but—

210
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,360
No, it's fine.

211
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,160
It can't be helped. See you again if we get the opportunity.

212
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,690
Okay.

213
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,010
Hey Jeong Sang. Did you get turned down?

214
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,860
I'm going ahead.

215
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,870
Let's go.

216
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,760
You know the haejangguk you made for me yesterday?

217
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,360
You saw that I ate all of it, right?

218
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,140
Really, the more I ate the more I could taste its richness.

219
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,220
I only saw a picture. How would I know if you really ate it or threw it away?

220
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,720
And if it tastes bad, don't force yourself to eat it.

221
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,770
No, it was really good!

222
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,270
I should have taken a video.

223
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:12,140
Next time, I'll make you delicious garlic spaghetti.

224
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,390
So you aren't asking me to cook for you again, I see.

225
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,390
No, that's not it, uhm. It's really not that!

226
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,720
It really isn't.

227
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,470
♫ Friend, what are you doing? I’m curious. What do you like? I’m curious  ♫

228
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,430
♫ I wonder about every single thing about you  ♫

229
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:36,060
♫ May I ask? May I approach you? ♫

230
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,500
♫ I keep on getting excited. ♫

231
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,260
♫ All day long, seeing you and your smile puts me on a roller coaster ♫

232
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,120
Love Revolution

233
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,360
I'm in front of your house right now.

234
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,430
Move it.

235
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,020
The substitutes are you guys?

236
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,810
- Try it on. 
- And so— Hey!

237
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,890
- So annoying. 
 - Set-back.

238
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,590
- Want to die? 
 - It's because I don't know what to talk to you about.

239
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,850
I heard that a good relationship is when you feel comfortable even when you have nothing to say to each other.

240
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,230
- What? It's Gong Joo Yeong's birthday? 
 - Yeah. He told us not to tell Wang Ja Rim.

241
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,070
Can you... hug me just once?

242
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,910
What's taking him so long?

243
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,780
What are you doing? Come in.

244
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,140
♫ Pit a pat ♫
