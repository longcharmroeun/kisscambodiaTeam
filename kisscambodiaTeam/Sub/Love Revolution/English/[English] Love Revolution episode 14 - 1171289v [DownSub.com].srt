00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,510
Ja Rim, it's really a misunderstanding. That noona isn't my girlfriend.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,850
I heard it all.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,710
You said you dated me because you pitied me.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,240
I was just flustered. I didn't mean it.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,400
I really like you.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,440
I was going to end things with that noona while I was seeing you, but...

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,440
- I felt bad. 
 - Sorry, I don't want to see you anymore.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,930
Ja Rim, you like me too, don't you?

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,530
I'll end things and only see you.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,320
Sorry.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,150
Ja Rim, did you not like me?

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,210
Were you just acting all along?

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,500
I came to you first instead of going to that Noona.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,660
- What more— 
 - Stop it.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,320
Hey, do you think you can do this to me?

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,930
Let go!

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,020
I can't believe this. Sh*t.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,590
I wanted to date you for a bit because you're pretty.

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,970
Are pretty girls all like this?

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,910
You go around flirting to your heart's content, but if I try to hold your hand 

21
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,660
then you get frightened. 

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,740
And you act damn coy.

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,400
Do you actually think I dated you because I like  you?

24
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,770
F*cking delusional.

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,740
Fine. I must've been a fool for dating you.

26
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,090
What a f***ing load of bad luck. 

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,040
Even if you may have forgotten everything,

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,890
I remember how much of an asshole you were.

29
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,540
How scary.

30
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,340
Our Ja Rim...

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,780
You've gotten so much cooler.

32
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,690
Are you really the girl who got all shy when we kissed?

33
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,620
- Who kissed... 
 - Hey.

34
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,430
Your boyfriend is here.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,950
See you again.

36
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,440
I heard you guys broke up.

glasses @princess_0: More like you're talking Gil Shit. 

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,020
Can you wait for me a bit? Just now...

40
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,040
Cany (sent)

What? It looks like you'll break up? What does that mean?

44
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,700
- It's exactly as I said. 
 - Did he ask to break up?

45
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,830
He didn't say that, but...

46
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,830
If that's not it, then why are you saying that? Do you want to break up?

47
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,290
I don't know.

48
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,400
But when I see Gong Joo Yeong, he does things that are similar to that jerk, so I feel uneasy sometimes.

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,190
I think I've said this several times already,

50
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,580
but don't put Gong Joo Yeong and Choi Joong Ang on the same level.

51
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,800
How unfair would it be to Gong Joo Yeong?

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,650
Who's Choi Joong Ang? It's Choi Jeong Woo. Why do you keep getting the name wrong?

53
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,070
I've never even seen the guy anyway. Choi Joong Ang or Choi Ji Ral. Close enough. 
(T/N:  Joong Ang means "center" and Ji Ral has the meaning of "insane.")

54
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,700
Anyway, Ah Ram is right. Gong Joo Yeong and that oppa are different. Why do you want to break up?

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,830
But it seems like Gong Joo Yeong will ask to break up now.

56
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,390
What? Is that even possible?

57
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,460
It is.

58
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,620
Then, what do you want to do?  You don't care if you end it like that?

59
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,710
Don't tell yourself "It's not me, so it doesn't matter"

60
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,830
and stay quiet again.

61
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,950
You have to talk for him to know. How can he, if you don't say anything? Is he going to read your mind?

62
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,960
Yeah. Please communicate. So frustrating.

63
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,020
Whatever. I'm done here.

64
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,940
- I'm so frustrated, now I'm starving. Let's go and eat. 
 - How are you starving from being frustrated?

65
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,030
- Are you not hungry? 
 - No.

66
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,200
- You are? 
 - Yeah.

67
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,410
Hey, your bracelet is so cool.

68
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,030
I've had it since middle school. Why are you saying that now?

69
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,120
Hey. Did Buddha tell you to play pool like this?

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,470
He said to love your neighbor!

71
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,490
You nutcase. I'm not wearing it for Buddhism.

72
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,520
And isn't loving your neighbor something taught in church?

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,290
Buddha probably said something similar too.

74
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,070
But freaking seriously, if you take five points in a row when you're on 120,

75
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,460
then even Buddha would get angry.

76
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,200
If you're going to be like this, then make it 150.

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,400
I'm just lucky today. I usually can't play 150.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,050
If you're going to play, hurry up.

79
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,980
Three, two one...

80
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,430
You do it.

81
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,320
That's a real bouquet. Who's next?

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,940
Is it Gong Joo Yeong? That's like a freebie right there.

83
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,060
You couldn't even hit that? That's ridiculous.

84
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,170
He's no fun to compete with. Are you rich?

85
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,380
Well, it is good for me though.

86
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,020
I told you I didn't want to play, but you guys dragged me here.

87
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,700
If we hadn't, you'd be shut in somewhere weeping.

88
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,350
At these times estrogen should actively be used.

89
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,610
It's astrenaline you idiot.

90
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,070
It's adrenaline.

91
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,820
You always tell me to stay put.

92
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,660
Ah, right! Are you coming for basketball tomorrow? I heard that hyung will also come.

93
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,360
Hey, don't talk nonsense. Of course, he shouldn't go. Shall we all just not go?

94
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,520
Do you want to get cursed out by those hyungs?

95
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,140
What if they can't play because we're not there?

96
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,090
You guys should go.  You don't have to do this just because of me.

97
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,450
Really!

98
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,130
Its okay.

99
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,060
Yang Min Ji

100
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,870
Hello?

101
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,470
Gong Joo Yeong?

102
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,190
Did you come to play basketball? What's with these clothes?

103
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,150
Are you really going to play?

104
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,770
Then take off your top at least.

105
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,900
- Hello?
 - Ja Rim still didn't contact you?

106
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,270
Oh, yeah. Not yet.

107
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,390
You said you know Oppa Choi Jeong Woo, right?

108
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,250
A little bit.

109
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,260
This is something I am telling you so that you don't misunderstand.

110
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,850
They didn't actually date each other.

111
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,760
- Okay. 
 - Let's go!

112
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,730
Hey Gong Joo Yeong, foul!

113
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,180
Sorry.

114
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,150
It's fine.

115
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,560
Sorry.

116
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,310
- This bastard, really!
 - Hey hey hey!

117
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,490
Hey hey hey, don't don't don't.

118
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,650
Leave me.

119
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:42,830
Have you gone crazy? What are you going nuts for? F*ck you are doing this because of your girlfriend, right?

120
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,810
Did I do something to her?

121
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,710
Ah just because I dated her before, you are flipping out, right?

122
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,610
You're goddam overreacting just because I talked to her, you damn f**ker.

123
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,140
- Hey hey are you crazy? What happened to you? 
-Leave me

124
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,220
Sorry! Sorry!

125
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,350
Hyeong, the heat must have got to him.

126
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,050
Look at him, the kind of clothes he's wearing!

127
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,140
He forgot his outfit at home, and his common sense together with it!

128
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,380
You also know that he usually isn't like this right?

129
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,060
- He was playing so passionately that he took himself for Dennis Rodman and—
 - Darn it.

130
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,660
Crazy bastard. Don't you see how much you messed up the mood?

131
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,500
Also, no matter how much you hate that hyung, how can you do that in front of the other hyungs?

132
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,100
You aren't going to play with these hyungs anymore?

133
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,210
No, I won't.

134
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,980
This moron came today only to piss off that hyung.

135
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,050
Is this because of Wang Ja Rim? What on earth did  that hyung do?

136
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,910
You always talk loads, but at times like this, you don't say a word.

137
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,330
Anyway, thanks for stopping me.

138
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,740
If not for you guys I would've been smashed by that hyung.

139
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,750
So you do know.

140
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,580
That's a given. You frail little punk.

141
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,560
If he's frail, then what are you?

142
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,110
What about me? What?!

143
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,730
Why suddenly talk about me?

144
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,830
I am going. Sorry for today.

145
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,590
He is not taking responsibility for this mood.

146
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,190
I'll put in good words to those hyungs.

147
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,610
They're close to my brother after all.

Gong Joo Yeong: ^^

151
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,090
I'm in front of your house. If you don't come out quickly I'm kissing this.

152
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,560
Ah, you scared me! Where are you going suddenly?

153
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,630
Did I just see Magic Girl Transformation or what?

154
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,600
Who is it? Why so urgent?

155
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
A friend.

156
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,480
You mean, a friend who's a boy?

157
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,560
I missed you.

158
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,250
- Good job today Hyung. 
 - Good play.

159
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,730
Hyung.

160
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,790
Are you okay?

161
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,130
Nah, it's nothing.

162
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,570
Whatever the reason is, I apologize for the commotion today.

163
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Sorry.

164
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,990
Shouldn't Gong Joo Yeong be the one apologizing?

165
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,770
Yeah, he should be.

166
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,170
But there probably won't be a reason for him to see you again.

167
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,860
As long as you yourself don't go and find him.

168
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,210
Do I look  like I would do that?

169
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:54,710
Wouldn't it be good to end it here, with each of you getting a few punches?

170
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,160
It's only an emotional fight anyway.

171
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,560
If you keep picking fights with Gong Joo Yeong, I don't think I'll stay put either.

172
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,200
He's my friend after all.

173
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,360
- Bastard, is this an apology or a threat? 
 - Come on.

174
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,390
I am just saying it's like that.

175
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,130
You don't need to worry over nothing. I don't want to have anything to do with Wang Ja Rim either.

176
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,020
Do you know that me quitting school was because of her?

177
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,430
I don't really want to know.

178
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,240
Goodbye then.

179
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,930
You came out dressed so prettily.

180
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,200
I just roughly put something on and came out in a hurry.

181
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,280
So you're this pretty even if you just roughly dress up.

182
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,790
Were you not mad at me?

183
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,530
I did get mad and even worried a lot.

184
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,900
I was so frustrated I thought I was going to go crazy.

185
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,230
Why did you just leave like that? Why didn't you tell me anything?

186
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,490
I had a lot of things to ask you if we could meet like this.

187
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,380
But now that we've met,

188
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,030
the only thing that comes out is that I miss you.

189
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,140
♫ It is difficult for me ♫

190
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,570
♫ Everything feels unfamiliar ♫

191
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,680
I missed you. I really like you a lot.

192
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,670
♫ But nevertheless ♫

193
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,590
Why exactly do you like me? 
 ♫ When I think of you ♫

194
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,590
I like you because you're you.

195
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,530
Even though I talked harshly to you?

196
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,680
Yes.

197
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,310
Even if I purposely gave you a hard time?

198
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,020
Yes. I like everything about you.

199
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,590
♫ I have been waiting ♫

200
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,960
♫ I wished for this very moment ♫

201
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,060
Did you catch a cold?

202
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,350
Dammit. I have a runny nose.

203
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,950
♫ Then it will always be paradise  ♫

204
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,350
Are you crying?

205
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,070
I just yawned!

206
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:18,530
♫ You can just trust in me ♫

207
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,930
♫ Are you all right?  ♫

208
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,990
I'm sorry. 
 ♫ How are we?  ♫

209
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,490
For what?

210
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,520
For everything.

211
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,020
It's okay. From now on, let's not say sorry anymore.

212
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,600
Let's not do anything to feel sorry for.

213
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,760
Got it? 
 ♫ I will be able to say it now ♫

214
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:54,220
♫ If you would only stay by my side ♫

215
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,610
Do you want me to tell you?

216
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,930
What? 
 ♫ Then it will always be paradise ♫

217
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,260
♫ My dear ♫

218
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,060
♫ Now let's ♫

219
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,490
First of all, I never dated Choi Jeong Woo.

220
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,070
♫ be together ♫

221
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,020
- I know. 
 - How?

222
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,230
I can find out about everything.

223
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,830
They never dated. They definitely didn't.

224
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,700
Anyhow, Choi Jeong Woo was a jerk.

225
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,340
Are you listening?

226
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:43,000
But does Ja Rim know that you're telling me this?

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,100
No, but you guys need to clear things.

228
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,030
Then, I'll pretend I never heard anything.

229
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,750
Why? You're misunderstanding things right now.

230
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,420
I never misunderstood Ja Rim.

231
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,760
Thanks for your concern.

232
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,260
Did you tell anyone else?

233
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,530
No. You're the first I told of course.

234
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,880
Don't tell anyone else then.

235
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,470
All right.

236
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,150
Ja Rim: I met with Gong Joo Yeong.

237
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,910
Those two will probably work things out themselves.

238
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,070
Sorry for thinking you two were the same.

239
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,610
It's because you guys acted similarly. The way you talk and act

240
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,020
was too similar to what that jerk did.

241
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,330
So it's true that I dated you with a breakup in mind.

242
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,270
I also thought this incident would be the reason for that breakup.

243
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,380
I didn't want to bring up something I had already forgotten.

244
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,110
I also didn't want you to know...

245
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,980
Hey, are you listening?

246
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,810
I'm not saying any more.

247
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,200
I'm listening.

248
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,500
To sum things up, I'm your first boyfriend then, right?

249
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,380
That's quite a severe way of summarizing things, but that's true.

250
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,690
Honestly, it doesn't really matter.

251
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,770
In terms of how much I like you, I don't lose to anyone.

252
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,120
What? Usually, this is the time when you'd swear at me saying I'm too corny.

253
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,600
- Seriously... 
 - Oh?

254
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,940
- You smiled! 
 - I didn't.

255
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,380
I just sighed.

256
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,660
- Oh, Ja Rim, you know what? 
 - I don't know.

257
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,460
- It's our 100th day anniversary today. 
 - You even counted?

258
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,530
Of course. I have something to give you.

259
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,870
Ta-da!

260
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,190
This is yours.

261
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,180
And this is mine.

262
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,230
Ta-da!

263
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,880
I don't have anything for you.

264
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,220
I haven't even given you a birthday gift yet.

265
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,600
What? Are you asking me to give it back?

266
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,880
No. I'm asking you to hold my hand. For the whole day.

267
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,320
Why did you just leave that day?

268
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,760
When Choi Jeong Woo came to find me.

269
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,130
That time... Honestly, I was really happy to see you,

270
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,500
but I thought I had to ignore you, considering the situation.

271
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,040
When would I have another chance to do that?

272
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,530
I was having a really hard time trying to hold back my smile.

273
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,660
You really do all sorts of things.

274
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,530
Are you hungry? Let's eat.

275
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,220
All right.

276
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,830
But where did the button on your shirt go?

277
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,740
That? A bad guy stole it. Help me sew a new one on, sweetie.

278
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,750
Laundromats are good at sewing those on. Let's go.

281
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:23,100
I was thinking about where the laundromat is.

282
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,930
I don't think so. It seems like you were thinking about me.

Right? Right?

Hi, birds! Hi to you too, sweetie!

289

We decided to go on a date this weekend right? Let's just watch a movie.

00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,990
I'll book the tickets.  
 What the heck? Did I get hacked?

291
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,810
Just lend me 40,000 won, respected elder brothers!

Hey, hey! Are you good at LoL?

Ten thousand won per ten minutes.

Stop wallowing in self-pity and just sell a few things on second-hand sites.

 - What?

 The hell. It'd be cheaper to go all the way to Italy to eat. 

301

Ah shut up. I've only been receiving things from you all this time.
