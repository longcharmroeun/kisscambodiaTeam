00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,640
- What? I'm busy. 
 - Doing what?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,530
- I'm getting ready to go out. 
 - Really?

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,540
You didn't forget!

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,640
- Forget what? 
 - We said we would meet today.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,810
- Did we? 
 - On the day we came back from the valley, we said we had to meet.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm pretty sure I said I would see.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,970
No, we have to meet today.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,170
I really can't. I have plans today. I have to go help Min Ji and Ah Ram.

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,850
With what? What do they need help with?

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,620
They have to clean the school because of their volunteer hours.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,900
- If we have to meet, let's just meet tomorrow or something. 
 - But it has to be today...

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,470
I'm hanging up.

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,880
Love Revolution: On the day I miss you. 

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,640
Episode 12. #AllOfASudden #ADate #ForReal?

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,870
princess_0 @prince_rim: Ja Rim, I love you today too.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,630
Wang Ja, you don't have to come today.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm in front of your house now!

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,280
What did you tell Min Ji again?

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,860
Don't worry, I sent replacements.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,260
The replacements are you guys?

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,340
What's with that reaction? Who else could Gong Joo Yeong send?

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,610
It's just that he said he was sending Byeong Hoon.

24
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,950
It was my fault for being at the internet cafe with him. Hey, will you treat us to a meal if we help you?

25
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,260
- We will, but... 
 - Didn't Gong Joo Yeong promise to do something for you?

26
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,740
There's no way you two would come here if you're not getting anything out of it.

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,570
Oh, that...

28
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,890
This is just how loyal guys are. But where's Ahn Kaeng?

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,760
Hey.

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,920
What the heck are you doing this early in the morning? Disgusting.

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,140
Whoa, you're seriously doing all sorts of things now.

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,500
Now that it's vacation, you're doing crazy sh*t. Who would've expected to see Ahn Kyeong Min like this?

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,280
Did you actually spend money on that wig?

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,560
You can't even use it when school starts, so why are you throwing your money away like that?

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,180
Just shut the hell up. If I get a girlfriend before that, it'll be worth it.

36
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,080
- You won't get one. 
 - He's the type girls hate the most, isn't he?

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,430
That's just your preference. While I was coming here, the girls' eyes were already...

38
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,800
glued to me.

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,590
Aren't you hot? Hurry up and take it off! I can't breathe just looking at you.

40
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,760
You'll get all that taken from you.

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Seriously, why are you picking a fight with me when I'm trying to be a bit more awesome?

42
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,630
- Who in the world are you talking about? 
 - Who in the world are you talking about?

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,290
If anyone takes it away from me, I'm going to report it to the office of education.

44
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,610
No one can stop me now.

45
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,690
Oh, Mr. Dokgo Moon! Hello!

46
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,230
That seriously looks horrible!

47
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,550
- Oh, Joon Yeong! You're here! 
 - Hi,  Hyung.

48
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,780
This hyung is the boss here. I always buy my clothes here. This is my girlfriend.

49
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,830
- How pretty. 
 - Hello.

50
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,850
Hi! Hey, you punk, why haven't you been coming? I almost forgot your face!

51
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,660
I've been shopping online lately.

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,370
You are contradicting yourself.

53
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,030
- Don't you know I run an online shop too?
 - Oh, really?

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,520
I didn't know. Since when?

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,420
Wait a moment.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,810
Are you tired already? Don't you like shopping?

57
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,900
It's tiring so I just choose clothes quickly.

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,510
All right. I'll pick really quickly too.

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,110
- How is it? 
 - No good.

60
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,430
Give me more sincere comments.

61
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,120
You look like a carrot.

62
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,680
Carrot?

63
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,860
How about this?

64
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,910
You look like a Monami pen. 
(T/N: Monami is a Korean stationery brand)

65
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,160
How's this?

66
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,930
It yells out, "Come to our correctional facility"!

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,710
What? I'm giving you comments like you asked.

68
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,940
Even so, you're speaking so brutally. My feelings are hurt.

69
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,500
♫ On this night when the darkness thickens ♫

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,780
- Here. 
 - What?

71
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,720
What? Try them on.

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,240
♫ Yes, I know very well it won’t ring ♫

73
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,770
♫ But tonight, for no reason, I find myself waiting ♫

74
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,680
I've come out. 
 ♫ Your name I used to call so often  ♫

75
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,360
♫ Only now do I long for it ♫

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,120
Not bad. It's cute.

77
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,850
Yeah, it's cute. It's perfect for me.

78
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,710
My sweetie indeed has amazing fashion sense.

79
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,990
It seemed like it would look good on you.

80
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,560
Thank you, Ja Rim.

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
You said you were thankful. Move it.

82
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,600
What about Ahn Kyeong Min and Lee Kyeong Woo? Where did they go?

83
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,180
They said they were going to clean the mop. Are they not back yet?

84
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,390
What's with them?

85
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,220
If they're going to slack off, then they shouldn't have come to help.

86
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,930
- Where are the other plants that need to be watered? 
 - The infirmary and the school office.

87
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,370
Okay.

88
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,300
Here you go, your tiramisu and frappe.

89
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,920
Thanks.

90
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,150
I'm treating you because you specially chose my clothes for me today.

91
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,060
How is it? It's delicious, right?

92
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,400
Yes, it's flavorful.

93
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,970
Ja Rim, did you listen to IU's latest album?

94
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,420
No.

95
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,330
- Then, what singer do you like? 
 - Pink Floyd.

96
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,870
Is that a singer?

97
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,100
I see, that's a singer. I don't know him.

98
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,620
- What dramas do you watch? 
 - Stranger Things.

99
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,090
- Oh, the American TV series! 
 - Japanese. 
 (T/N: "Tales of the Bizarre", long-running Japanese series)

100
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,000
Isn't it an American series?

101
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,260
- Hey, so— 
 - Ah! 
 - Hey, what are you doing?!

102
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,130
You startled me! What were you doing?

103
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,640
You overreacted. I'm all wet now.

104
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,960
Hey, it's your fault for startling me! What were you doing here?

105
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,890
I was lying down for a bit. Taking a ten-minute break.

106
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,980
Everyone else is working while you're shamelessly resting. If you were going to do this, you shouldn't have come at all.

107
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,190
Don't be nagging me so much when I'm helping out of my goodwill. You'll get all the volunteering points anyway.

108
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,760
Okay, thanks. Ah, but what were you going to ask me earlier?

109
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Whether you gave your number to Sang Hoon or not.

110
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,010
No, I didn't. How's that any of your business?

111
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,800
Come on, just give it to him.

112
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,110
- Or do you want me to give you his? 
 - I said forget it.

113
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,750
What the heck? Is he that unlikable? You're putting up one sturdy iron wall here.

114
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,520
Why are you behaving like Wang Ja Rim?

115
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,240
Freaking annoying.

116
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,160
Which mic has the best vision among all—

117
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,890
A microscope.

118
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,590
Ah, you know it.

119
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,550
Then, what is the reason why GD shouldn't do a headstand?

120
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,230
Because he'll be a Dead Guy. 
 (T/N: DG sounds like the slang for "die")

121
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,950
- Want to die? 
 - Ah, so you know it.

122
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,540
Then, what is it when you fall down on the left side?

123
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,170
I don't know.

124
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,580
A downfall. Look. Down-fall.

125
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,950
- And— 
 - Is this funny for you?

126
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,270
But I don't know what to talk about with you.

127
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:19,030
I heard that a good relationship is actually when you feel comfortable even if you have nothing to say to each other.

128
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,150
Then, are you not saying anything because you're comfortable being with me?

129
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,530
I'm not uncomfortable.

130
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,310
When it's just the two of us like this, it feels like we're really dating. Right?

131
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,920
Are we fake dating, then?

132
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,810
That's true.

133
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,120
Then where should we go now?

134
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,120
It's hot outside, so let's stay in one place.

135
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,270
Why? Sweetie, can you do as I ask just for today?

136
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,220
Why should I?

137
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,180
Well, that's because it's our first date.

138
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,570
Is it a date only as long as I do as you want?

139
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,680
That's true. You're always right.

140
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,800
Ja Rim, look at this.

141
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,070
You nutjob, where did you get this? Was it Min Ji again? Give it to me.

142
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,680
If you do me a favor.

143
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,790
- Want to die? 
 - Not today.

144
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,230
- I'll give it to you if you catch me. 
 - Hurry and hand it over. Hey, you're done for!

145
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,890
Ta-da! I have another one.

146
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,400
Hey! If you aren't going to work properly I'll just sweep you out of the school building!

147
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,740
- Okay, we'll work, just one minute! 
 - We're really done in one minute, just a sec!

148
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,580
Hey. What's more important, the game or your life?

149
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,700
Get up. Stand up.

150
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,550
Hey. I shouldn't have said that earlier.

151
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,250
But if you don't feel like dating him, that's all. Why did you get so angry?

152
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,020
Drink this.

153
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,100
♫ I like your smiling face the most ♫ 
 ♫ But the picture you posted today, where was it taken? ♫

154
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:42,200
♫ Why does it make me so anxious when you are somewhere I’m not? ♫

155
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,290
♫ I like you  ♫

156
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,480
♫ I'm being sincere ♫

157
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,520
♫ I hope this song can be our beginning ♫

158
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:10,310
♫ I don't want any more breakup songs that feel like my  own story ♫

159
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,920
So what are we going to eat?

160
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,460
Can you buzz off? I'd be embarrassed to eat together with you. Don't you agree?

161
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,530
Yes, totally.

162
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,060
Hey, take this wig off. Am I supposed to be able to eat anything while looking at that hair?

163
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,310
Absolutely not, never.

164
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,640
Hey, as if that'd stop you from eating.

165
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,250
- Hello, Teacher. 
 - Hello.

166
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,860
I told you not to joke aroun—

167
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,870
Hey, Ahn—

168
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,500
- Ahn Kyeong Min. 
 - Yes.

169
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,270
Make sure you return to your original look by the start of school.

170
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,850
Yes, Sir.

171
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,230
- Here. 
 - Move it.

172
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,720
You paid for everything today.

173
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,740
You don't have to do this. All the things we did today were things I wanted to do.

174
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,700
- Do you have a lot of money? 
 - Yes, I do.

175
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,050
- I'll treat you at the next place. 
 - What? Where else do you want to go?

176
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,030
For dessert.

177
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,160
Have you seen the time?

178
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,880
Sorry. It's because I was too happy today.

179
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,630
Let's go now.

180
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,100
We're already here. What a pity.

181
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,790
We've been together all day, so how is it a pity?

182
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,080
Take care on your way back home.

183
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,660
Whoa, are you being worried about me?

184
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,740
Just go home.

185
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,390
Ja Rim.

186
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,490
Before I go...

187
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,280
What is it again?

188
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,470
Uhm... that is...

189
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,640
If you've got nothing to say, I'm leaving.

190
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,600
Just once!

191
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,310
Can you...

192
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,380
Hug me just once?

193
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,190
What the...?

194
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,090
For my next birthday, it'll be a peck.

195
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,190
Go in safely.

196
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,950
Don't tell me it's your birthday today?

197
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,180
Yes.

198
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,070
One hour ago

199
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,760
What? It's Gong Joo Yeong's birthday?

200
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,310
Yes. He told us not to tell Wang Ja Rim no matter what, so we didn't.

201
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,770
But you're just out here? You won't do something for your friend?

202
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,770
Letting him be alone with Wang Ja Rim is his present. What else should we do for him?

203
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,170
And we decided helping you guys out would replace getting him a present. 

204
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,380
But still, 

205
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,350
- you should get him a cake at least. I don't understand you guys. 
 - I agree.

206
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,670
I'm the one who doesn't understand you. 

207
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,490
The one concerned decided on that, so why would we do anything more? 

208
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,070
I agree with Ah Ram. 

209
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,990
When you guys forgot about my birthday—

210
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,230
Then let's go quickly. We need to buy a cake first. 

211
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,430
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

212
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,310
Okay. With seventeen candles.

213
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,320
- Stop eating, girl. 
 - Ah wait, wait, just that one bite.

214
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Why didn't you tell me?

215
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,270
I was afraid you'd feel preoccupied by it.

216
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,850
Today is your birthday, but you spent the whole day with me?

217
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,940
What about a cake? And seaweed soup? 
 (T/N: seaweed soup is traditionally eaten on birthdays.)

218
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,130
It's fine.

219
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,310
I don't even have a present for you.

220
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,520
I already got a birthday present from you.

221
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,370
You got one? What was it?

222
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:11,660
You bought me food, spent the entire day with me,

223
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,760
and you hugged me.

224
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,730
It's the best present I've ever received up to now.

225
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,330
But that wasn't me hugging you.

226
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,080
Wasn't it you hugging me as you pleased?

227
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,950
Sorry.

228
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,110
What are you doing? Come in.

229
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,980
Happy birthday.

230
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,600
Thank you, Ja Rim. I'm really happy. It's my best birthday.

231
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,140
I got it, so go now.

232
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,260
I'll leave first.

233
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,560
- What is it? 
 - Do you have a danso at home?

234
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,460
Yes, I do, why?

235
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,410
Byeol Rim asked me to borrow it for her. Let's go.

236
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,190
What's taking him so long? What the f*** is he doing?

237
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,300
They're going to make single-for-life Kyeong Min cry tears of blood. What the hell are they doing?

238
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,630
Hey. Don't pretend you aren't the same as me.

239
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,500
Gong Joo Yeong must be making the most of it since it's his birthday.

240
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,390
I sent Ja Rim a message. They'll come.

241
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,590
Hey, they're coming. Get ready. Hide, you moron.

242
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,190
Hey, where do I go with the cake?

243
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,660
- Just hide somewhere! 
 - Hide!

244
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,330
Here you go. But my house is a bit mess...

245
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,420
- Surprise! 
 - Surprise!

246
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,390
What the f*** are you guys doing right now?!

247
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,350
♫ Your name I used to call so often  ♫

248
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,550
♫ Only now do I long for it ♫

249
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,380
♫ Whenever I felt sad sending you back home ♫

250
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,350
Love Revolution

251
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,530
Don't you guys have girlfriends to call over?

252
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,870
Gong Joo Yeong, you said your girlfriend is pretty. Call her over.

253
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,590
No.

254
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,850
Hyeong, do you know Ja Rim?

255
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,480
Long hair suited her better.

256
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,050
Anyway, now I understand why you said you couldn't have physical contact with her.

257
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,650
- She's got a super strong iron wall put up. 
- Wait!

258
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,410
I want to ask you something.

259
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,400
Do you know hyeong Choi Jeong Woo?

260
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,090
Why don't you say anything to Gong Joo Yeong?

261
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,400
You have to tell him what happened to prevent any misunderstanding.

262
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,470
So did you break up with Wang Ja Rim?

263
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,190
But if you don't tell me anything, like this...

264
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,020
- Should we just break up? 
 - Right!

265
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,410
Wang Ja Rim?

266
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,040
