00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,810
Guys.  No end-of-day homeroom today. You can go.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,380
- Really? 
 - Yay.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,530
Five, four, three, two, one. Enter!

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,340
- Darling, let's go home.
 - Darling, let's go home.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,240
Jeez.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,510
Next one, enter on three.  Three, two, one Daeng!

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,050
Kyeong Woo.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,660
Kyeong Woo, it's over.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,410
Are you two some kind of puppies?

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,100
It seems they remain in a "stay" until their masters are finished.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,340
Do you attend school to date? You should be studying.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,230
You don't study either. Please date at least.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,500
I don't hear.  I don't hear anything.

 -  Lee Kyeong Woo, what are you doing?

17
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,720
How long are you going to do that?  I'm a bit bored.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,200
Oh. just a little longer.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,200
- Another round.  Go Go. 
 - Are you going to play more?

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,290
Just one round.  Only one.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,530
We're good right now.

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,220
Kyeong Woo, I don't have anything to do.  Is it okay if I leave now?

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,820
- Are you going? 
 - Why? Why? We're only just now getting fired up!

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,160
Sorry.  Never mind about me and have fun.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Ye S—

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,010
Ye Seul.

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,300
Ability is decided by 
 one's own effort.

28
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,260
Wow Daebak!  I won!

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,090
What?

30
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,110
I entered every time I went to see a movie with Ja Rim, and now I got a Lotte World free pass.

31
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,520
F*#%.  For how many?

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,970
- Two right? 
 - Wait a sec.

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,860
Wow, daebak.  I can bring three with me?

34
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,570
Four passes? It's just perfect for the four of us to go. Shall we go this weekend?

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,830
What are you talking about? Why would I go with you guys? I'm going with Ja Rim.

36
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,190
"I'm going with Ja Rim."  Then you shouldn't have told us at all, you disloyal bastard.

37
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,090
Kaeng?  What about you?  Would you like to double date with Ye Seul?

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,030
- I'll ask her. 
 - Wow.

39
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,380
Even Lee Kyeong Woo is dumping us because he has a girlfriend.

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,420
- Come to think of it, how many days has it been? 
  - Ja Rim and I—

41
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,360
Not you, I don't want to know.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,210
Around twenty days?

43
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,540
How far have you progressed?

44
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,740
Right. We can't not talk about this.

45
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,520
- Has this dude already—? 
 - You nutcase.

46
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,400
Hey!  Don't say that in my house. Ja Rim comes to hang out here and that's dirty.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,360
We did kiss.

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,890
- When? 
  - Where?

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,700
- Damn. Why do you need to know? 
 - Please tell.

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,860
Dude.  Did you make the first move?

51
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,220
She did it first. In front of her house.

52
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,260
  What? F-First?

53
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,650
I freaking envy you.  When will I get a girlfriend?

54
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,280
- First of all, you won't ever. 
 -  Yeah, that's you.

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,550
- No. 
  - Yeah, no.

56
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,160
- You won't either. 
 - You, you. You're also forever single.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,500
- You won't. I'm reflecting it back to you. 
 - Yeah you won't. That's right.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,050
- You also won't ever have one. 
 - No you won't.

 #Doubledate #LotteWorld #Kiss 
 kyungwoo @princess_0: I don't want to go on double dates anymore. 

61
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,580
When I think about it, I've been dating Ja Rim for half a year but I only held her hand.

62
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,030
 No.  For me I just want Ja Rim to be there for me.

63
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,910
But for Kyeong Woo it hasn't even been a month,

64
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,890
and they already kissed...  Is something wrong with us?

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,580
 I don't think I can fall asleep.

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,400
Darliiiiiiiiiiiiing.

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,010
What's the matter with you now? At school.

68
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,240
How can you say that to your boyfriend?

69
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,800
Don't do this at school. Seriously.

70
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,970
Do you want to hold this?

71
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,630
Darling, the whole school knows we are dating, so why can't I hold your hand?

72
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,810
I can't tell you who, but there are kids these days who recently started dating

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,980
and they're already kissing.

74
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,140
This punk.

75
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,490
So, what? You want to squeeze our mouths against each other's?

76
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,430
Yes, no, nope.

77
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,580
We can just squeeze hands affectionately.

78
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,320
Oh. seriously. If you don't want your wrist cut off, don't ever touch me at school.

79
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,090
Yes.

80
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,550
Never mind.  That's not the point.

81
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,810
Prince.  He wants to go to Lotte World this weekend.

82
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,140
Yeah.  I won four tickets and we decided to go on a double date with that couple.

83
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,080
Why the four of you? Wouldn't you normally want to hang out just you two?

84
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,810
Yeah.  But when I learned I won, he was with me.

85
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,460
I couldn't act like he wasn't there. I'd look like a cheapskate.

86
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,270
- So Darling, do you want to go? 
 - Well...

87
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,170
- Okay. 
 - Super!

88
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,720
Okay. I'll ask too.

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,070
This Saturday?  Great!

90
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,800
That's good.

91
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,550
Is it too spicy?

92
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,490
I can bear it.  It's okay.

93
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,840
Really.  You can't even eat spicy food.

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,880
No, no.  It's tasty.

95
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,620
You play games so often.

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,830
Well, sometimes.

97
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,190
Even when you are with me, you keep doing it.  Yesterday, too.

98
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,670
No, look.  I'm not doing it now.

99
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,600
You really like games. You'll stop playing so often, right?

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,850
Okay.

101
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,620
Saturday.

102
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,330
A date with Ja Rim at Lotte World.

103
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,470
I'll hold Ja Rim's hand as much as I want, link arms with her,

104
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,170
and in front of the merry-go-round,  I will  ki - i - ss ...

105
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,250
Okay.  It's been almost half a year since we started dating.

106
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,470
Today is indeed the day.

107
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,610
All the popular rides have a half-hour wait so should we ride the merry-go-round first?

108
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,480
- I'd like that. 
 - Hey, why would we come all way here and ride that?

109
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,810
Just ride it.  I don't want to start with waiting.

110
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,970
Right? I knew that so I found the ride with the least waiting. I did well, right?

111
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,280
Good job. Ye Seul, what do you think?

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,630
I like it too.  Let's take pictures.

113
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,130
Okay. Then it's okay for everybody except Kyeong Woo? Let's go to the merry-go-round.

114
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,610
Does it only matter if you guys want it?

115
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,400
Let's go, darling.

116
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,110
Aren't you coming?

117
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,520
I am.  I was turning on the app.

118
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,240
I'll help you up.

119
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,360
Put on the safety belt too.

120
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,040
Thanks.

121
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,290
Thanks. Sweetie, I'll take a photo of you.

122
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,830
One, two, three.

123
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,370
So pretty. Can you smile a bit this time? One, two, three.

124
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,670
Okay! Now let's take a pic together.

125
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,400
It's dangerous. I'll go to you.

126
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,860
It's more dangerous for you!

127
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,910
I'm okay. One, two, three.

128
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,360
We will make a short announcement for our passengers on the merry-go-round. 

129
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,400
We should also take some pics.

130
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,590
Cute. Look here, I'll take some.

131
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,320
Why would you? I'm fine. Take your picture.

132
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,690
Ah, click one pic for me. I'll keep it as my wallpaper.

133
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,390
We will be departing now. Enjoy your ride!

134
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,640
Hey, let's take a pic here.

135
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,860
Did you come to take pictures? You keep on asking to take pictures everywhere we go.

136
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,810
The only thing that remains from such outings are pictures, you brat.

137
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,470
Hurry up and stand there.

138
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,590
Shall we?

139
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,840
No, If you don't want to—

140
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,380
No no, let's go. 
 ♫ I know very well it won't ring ♫

141
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,730
♫ But tonight, for no reason,  ♫

142
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,570
♫ I find myself waiting ♫ 
 ♫ Honestly, how should I put it?  ♫

143
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,900
Im taking it. One, two, three! 
 ♫ I secretly hoped we'd run into each other again ♫

144
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,540
One, two, three. 
 ♫ Maybe that’s what I was hoping for tonight ♫

145
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,450
Wow! 
 ♫ Walking on this street ♫

146
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,930
Did it come out well? Let me see. 
 ♫ Why is the jet-black city so beautiful? ♫

147
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,970
♫ I am thankful you came to me when I was done ♫

148
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,920
Why am I the only one smiling? You should've smiled. You look handsome, even if you smile.

149
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,230
I'm feeling awkward today. 
 ♫ Your name I used to call so often  ♫

150
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,710
I'll take a pic for you guys also.

151
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,750
♫ Only now do I long for it ♫

152
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,050
♫ Whenever I felt sad sending you back home ♫

153
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,620
Darling, shall we also take a pic while kissing?

154
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,710
Sure, if you want that pic to be the one at your funeral.

155
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,950
♫ Why do I ?  ♫

156
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,650
Give me the phone. 
 ♫ remember this now? ♫

157
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,670
I'm taking the pic. 
 ♫ Midnight Midnight ♫

158
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,470
One, two... three! 
 ♫ Midnight. Why do I remember only now?  ♫

159
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,770
- It's done.
 - Tactless fellow. You should've taken a few more pics.

160
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,030
♫ Midnight, midnight ♫

161
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,840
What is this?! If you were going to do this, why say you'd take it?

162
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,350
You were better looking with only half of you showing. It's better than your actual appearance.

163
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,240
Let's go if we're done with the pics.

164
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,410
Ja Rim, let's go together.

165
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,160
Shall we go?

166
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,050
Zombie Experience

167
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,860
It looks fun.

168
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,580
This kind of thing really doesn't scare me at all.

169
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,350
Can you guys go, just the two of you? Kyeong Woo doesn't like things like that.

170
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,820
Ah! He's more of a coward than I thought.

171
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,660
Hey! It's o-only that I d-don't like it. Yeah.

172
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,160
Le- let- let's go.

173
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,750
You saw him stammer, right? He gets scared easily.

174
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,490
- Let's leave quickly.  
 - I'm scared!

175
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,050
- What, why? 
 - There's a person!

176
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,970
Isn't something going to jump out at us?

177
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,580
Hey, where are you going?!

178
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:26,850
princess_0: Lotte World with Ja Rim♥︎ Double date with KaengSeul. 

179
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,760
Annoying.

180
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,380
How did things end up this way?

181
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,010
Yang Min Ji idiot, seriously.

182
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,000
New message from Sang Hoon

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,250
You seem to like good restaurants.

184
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,290
Yeah. But I'm going to go on a diet now.

185
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,490
Are you okay? He's still out of it.

186
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,210
I won't go ever again. You might as well ask me to ride the gyro drop a hundred times.

187
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,600
Ja Rim, do you want to do that?

188
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,460
Okay! Let's go to the arcade.

189
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,870
Hey! Hey! What's so urgent?

190
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,260
- When shall we go home?
 - I don't mind as long as I'm with you.

191
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,570
Okay then.

192
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,360
- In for a bet? The losers buy food next time we hang out. 
 - Deal.

193
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,110
Ja Rim and Bang Ye Seul go first.

194
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,990
Ye Seul, do you know how to play this?

195
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,460
No, I haven't played this. Not once.

196
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,550
Ye Seul doesn't know. Give her a handicap.

197
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,010
Oh really? Then let's not count five of Ja Rim's bullets.

198
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,250
What if I'm bad at it?

199
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,550
It's okay, I'll cover for you.

200
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,470
- Congratulations. 
- Thank you.

201
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,360
Ye Seul is good at this. She'll be fine even without the handicap—

202
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,290
When you played with me last time, you won so easily.

203
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,180
Hey. So you suggested a bet knowing Wang Ja Rim is good. You're a thug.

204
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,870
I can just buy food for everyone then. Retract that pout.

205
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,580
It's fine. Let's say this was a practice game. Ye Seul is good at it, too, anyway.

206
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,440
This is fun.

207
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,880
This time we're starting at the same time.

208
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,350
Milky white Wang Ja Rim, milky—

209
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,820
Stop it! Are you trying to prevent me from playing or what?

210
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,140
My sweetie is doing well! My Ja Rim is a tough one!

211
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,100
- Tough Ja Rim! Tough Ja Rim! 
 - You have a death wish?

212
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,490
Hey, Prince, go easy. You're damn fierce.

213
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,490
- Ye Seul, what are you doing? 
 - What?

214
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,080
My sweetie won!

215
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,710
You got them all? You're crazy.

216
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,170
Sorry.

217
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,670
It's okay.

218
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,130
Hey, stop that and reload it.

219
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,460
My darling, you did so well.

220
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,650
Stop it.

221
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,620
We could have gone with them. Their homes are in the same direction as ours.

222
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,820
No but... They would also

223
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,010
want to spend time alone together too, I think.

224
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,200
It's so pretty.

225
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,500
What is it? What's wrong?

226
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,230
- What do you mean? 
 - Do you have something to say?

227
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,600
- Do you need to poo? 
 - No, that's not it.

228
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,320
Then what is it?

229
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,000
You won't get mad, right?

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,080
I won't.

231
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,470
You won't curse at me, right? You won't hit me?

232
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,370
I'm on the verge of cursing right now. Hurry up and talk. Three, two—

233
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,140
No, th-that's not it.

234
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,780
We...

235
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,220
d-don't really show any p-physical affection.

236
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,950
But other kids,

237
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,140
they would k-kiss within three days of d-dating and all.

238
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,600
You were saying that last time too.

239
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,880
- So you want to do that too? 
 - Yes. Ah, n-no!

240
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,710
It's not that I wouldn't like to. It's not that I just want to or anything...

241
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,710
I do want to, but...

242
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,980
What the hell are you saying?

243
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:07,340
- Hey. I'm giving you three seconds. Three, 
 - What? 
 - two, one.

244
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,950
I gave you a chance. If you bring this up again next time, you're dead—

245
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,070
I never told you to do it on my lips.

246
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,120
- And you went over the time! 
 - What?

247
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,930
You want to die?

248
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,280
It's a pity we lost the game. We'll have to buy them a meal next time.

249
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,580
It's okay, I'll buy.

250
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,370
Why would you? Don't.

251
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,190
It's fine. Ah.

252
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,220
- You're playing a game again? 
 - Just for a sec.

253
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,700
- You know— 
 - No it's fine, I'll buy.

254
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,920
When should we hang out with them again?

255
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,700
We're almost at my place. I'll go now.

256
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,430
- What's wrong? 
 - Forget it, you can go home.

257
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,130
You couldn't play your game all day today.

258
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,760
- Are you like this because of that? 
 - It's not because of that.

259
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,920
Hey, there's vomit!

260
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,180
- You're too much. You were really mean. 
 - What?

261
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,970
You're not even curious about how I feel, are you?

262
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,400
- What are you saying? That's not true.
 - You don't seem to be curious at all

263
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,770
about how I feel or what I want to do.

264
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,290
Why do I feel this lonely even when I'm with you?

265
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,300
When we're together, you just look at your phone.

266
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,510
I always feel like I'm being a hindrance when you'd rather hang out with your friends.

267
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,760
- That's not it. 
 - It was the same today.

268
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,290
Looking at you after seeing how Gong Joo Yeong treats Ja Rim, I wonder if we're really dating.

269
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,570
- He's just like that. 
 - I know he's like that. But I'm telling you I feel too lonely.

270
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,420
It's not like I was bad at that game because I wanted to, but you openly showed your disappointment.

271
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,330
I don't feel good, but you keep playing your game.

272
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,220
♫ And everything blooms anew  ♫

273
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,620
You weren't even listening to me.

274
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,640
♫ So why is my season the only one that stays still?  ♫

275
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,810
Why are you crying? I'm telling you that's not true. 
 ♫ I'm still the same ♫

276
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,940
Your girlfriend stepped in vomit but you just laughed. 
 ♫ What am I expecting? ♫

277
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,450
Sorry.

278
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,270
♫ Am I still waiting, holding onto the lingering hope that you’ll come back? ♫

279
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,130
You... 
 ♫ The only thing that's still the same ♫

280
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,060
Do you actually like me?

281
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,720
♫ Is this street we walked on together, hands in hands ♫

282
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,500
- I do like you. 
 - Then why don't you pay attention to how I feel?

283
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,230
I'm always trying to read your mood. 
 ♫ And me, wandering everywhere looking for you ♫

284
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:40,150
I'm lonely because I feel like you don't like me back. Aren't you dating me because you like me as well? 
 ♫ Crying and crying again ♫

285
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,740
♫ You are still the same  ♫

286
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,220
♫ Still in my heart, same as ever ♫

287
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,600
I got it. I'm leaving.

288
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,230
♫ Can I go on holding onto the lingering hope that you will come back again? ♫

289
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,800
♫ The only things that are still the same ♫

290
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,060
♫ Is this street we walked on together, hands in hands ♫

291
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:05,090
I guess you really don't like me, seeing that you're not holding onto me.

292
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,470
♫ And me, wandering everywhere looking for you, crying ♫

293
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,670
I don't think I can be good to you.

294
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,500
I was giving it my best. But I didn't know you had that on your mind.

295
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,160
I'm sorry.

New message from Lee Kaeng

298
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,040
♫ Your name I used to call so often  ♫

Love Revolution

300
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
There was an accident in the canteen and they're doing emergency repair work. 

301
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,150
They told us not to order food in, so what do we do? 

302
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll make your lunch together with mine. 

303
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,600
- Looks delicious! 
 - I think it's gone bad. 

304
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,810
- Is that Lee Kyeong Woo? 
 - Let's just keep going our way. 

305
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,560
Does the food I make taste bad? 

306
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,970
 How can you say it's garbage? 

307
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,610
For cooking, do it like you do math. Think of it as a formula and stick to the quantities. 

308
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,810
Hey, want to eat this?

309
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,970
Did you make it for me? 

310
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,200
Have you stopped liking me? 

311
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,080
Since the moment I first saw you, I really liked you. 

312
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,020
I'm a bad guy. 

313
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,250
Then should we...

314
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,720
What's this? Wh-Why does it taste good?
