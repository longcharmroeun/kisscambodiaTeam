1
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:07,273
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,174
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:14,414
Give me your blessing to stop taking away lives.

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,143
I want you to kill...

5
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:20,013
the enemy of Cheonjubang, the King of Goguryeo.

6
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:22,713
Are you really going to
attack during the ceremony?

7
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,064
A shaman tried to kill the King, then got away.

8
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:33,024
Hold on tight!

9
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:34,994
If she got hurt,

10
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,333
you should have taken her to
the village, not bring her here.

11
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,903
That is my name. On Dal.

12
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,573
What?

13
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:43,704
He told you to find your real parents first.

14
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:45,304
You are saying...

15
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:47,613
I am an orphan, right?

16
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:48,914
Hey!

17
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,484
You have not killed him?

18
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:55,083
You told me to seduce him instead.

19
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,283
You? As if.

20
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:58,984
EPISODE 3

21
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:00,094
Hi.

22
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:02,653
Your friend came to pick you up?

23
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:05,064
- Yes, she is my childhood...
- We met each other in the palace.

24
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:09,594
She is my hometown friend.

25
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:11,803
And we worked at the palace together.

26
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:13,003
I see.

27
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,303
How did you come all the way here?

28
00:01:16,404 --> 00:01:17,803
I followed the footsteps.

29
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:24,743
What is with you? Why are you interrogating us?

30
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:27,883
I am just checking if it is okay...

31
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:30,014
to just send you away like this...

32
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:32,124
and if the place you are going to is safe.

33
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:39,594
Oh, I do not have any money
to give you, but take this.

34
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:43,863
I carved it myself.

35
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,143
The Sunno Tribe... I mean...

36
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:54,643
Anyway, this means that we are on the same side.

37
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,514
- Same side?
- Yes, we are on the same side.

38
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,354
But I have nothing to give you.

39
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,354
Gosh.

40
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:03,184
Yes, you do.

41
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,963
Darn you!

42
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,373
Does it hurt here?

43
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:31,984
You are okay, right?

44
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:34,884
- See you.
- Yeom Ga Jin.

45
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:41,224
Do not get hurt. Your life is precious.

46
00:02:55,403 --> 00:02:57,544
"Your life is precious"?

47
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:00,004
"The same side"?

48
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:03,313
- Shoot.
- What was that?

49
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,563
You should not push people!

50
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,063
That was rude.

51
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:31,974
Why am I like this?

52
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,254
So I came this way.

53
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,493
This is just great.

54
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:55,764
You come later.

55
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,134
We will be suspected if we return together.

56
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:58,534
It is dangerous alone.

57
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,063
We have no time to argue.

58
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,433
Be careful.

59
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:12,343
Did she leave?

60
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,583
Yes.

61
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:17,924
It is true.

62
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:19,753
I sent her off with a stern warning.

63
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:21,724
Do not resent me.

64
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:26,263
Every life is unfortunate
if you look closely enough.

65
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,633
What do you mean?

66
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,133
A young woman wielding a
sword and shedding blood.

67
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,334
Her life must have been rough.

68
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:36,404
What kind of revenge is she after that...

69
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:38,073
she became an assassin?

70
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:39,373
I did not ask.

71
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:40,714
You did not ask her?

72
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,443
I pretended not to notice she was an assassin.

73
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,914
Well, she has gone now.

74
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:48,453
Do not get involved in other people's business.

75
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,724
We just breathe and get by.

76
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:53,524
That is how we live.

77
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:57,664
I know that. I just felt sorry for her.

78
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,594
The moon is so...

79
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,203
Is it bright?

80
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,274
Yes.

81
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:09,474
As if it cares not for how I feel.

82
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,094
I knew you would sneak back like a stray cat.

83
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,834
- Where is my father?
- See the chief first.

84
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,904
Yeom Deuk is not here now anyway.

85
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:45,243
- What?
- You returned. He will be let go.

86
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,914
My goodness. Oh, why are you doing this?

87
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,084
Oh, dear...

88
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:58,123
Please, guards.

89
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:02,794
Oh, dear...

90
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:08,493
I will accept the punishment for failing.

91
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,604
Please release my father.

92
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,734
Holding family responsible
for a killer's mistake...

93
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:16,073
is not our rule.

94
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:18,604
You disappeared without notice.

95
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:20,743
How will you defend that crime?

96
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:22,873
I will willingly accept any punishment.

97
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:25,183
If you will please release my father first...

98
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:27,883
- Tae Mo.
- Yes, chief.

99
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,383
Release Yeom Deuk.

100
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:32,654
Should I just let him go?

101
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:44,633
They strengthened the
defense of Pyeongyang Castle.

102
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:48,503
If you go back, are you sure you can succeed?

103
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:55,544
Before that, there is something I must know.

104
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:59,414
Who on earth am I?

105
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:11,464
I need to know who I am.

106
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:13,763
Chief.

107
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:16,234
You know, do you not?

108
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,664
It means nothing.

109
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:20,774
You are Cheonjubang's best killer Yeom Ga Jin,

110
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,734
and my most favored blade.

111
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:26,604
Even if you recover your
memory, nothing will change.

112
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:27,873
That decision...

113
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,683
is for me to make once I know who I am.

114
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:35,613
If you will not tell me,

115
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:39,724
I must find out for myself.

116
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:41,424
Is that...

117
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,724
truly what you want?

118
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:46,664
Yes.

119
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:49,363
You foolish thing.

120
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:20,563
Why is a butterfly called a butterfly?

121
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,493
I feel so strange.

122
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,433
What did you climb up there for?

123
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:30,003
Weol. Did something happen to Dal?

124
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:33,103
I think he has lost his mind.

125
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,614
Stop speaking nonsense...

126
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,313
and come down and go to work.

127
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,414
Take this.

128
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:41,654
Do not eat it in one go. Eat when it is time.

129
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:47,494
Dal, get down here now!

130
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:51,294
Why do you keep coming up here
when there is nothing to pick?

131
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,864
What about Ghost Valley?

132
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:55,063
That foxy girl...

133
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:58,463
has truly messed with your mind.

134
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,004
How dare you? You are wrong.

135
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:02,703
My gosh.

136
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:06,274
You stuck flowers in your
hair and grin to no end.

137
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:08,213
Am I wrong?

138
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:11,443
Weol. Is this not truly beautiful?

139
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,853
If you wish to befriend nature,

140
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,553
you must learn to appreciate it.

141
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:18,823
What is so special about mountains
and streams we see every day?

142
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:23,193
You might end up wanting
to save that girl's father.

143
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:32,303
What about her father?

144
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:33,634
You have not heard?

145
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:34,874
Heard about what?

146
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:39,904
Ga Jin. Do not get worked up.

147
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:42,443
You cannot fight the chief.

148
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:46,114
If anyone messes with my
father, I will make them pay.

149
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:51,983
I heard something about Cheonjubang...

150
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:55,323
and that something bad happened to her father.

151
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:57,593
Why are you telling me that now?

152
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:01,494
Dal! What about the balls of rice?

153
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,634
Dal.

154
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,774
- Cheonjubang?
- Yes.

155
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:18,683
Rumors say they are a group of assassins.

156
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:22,553
I hear they are a group that
has a grudge against Goguryeo.

157
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:24,683
The chief manages a group of killers.

158
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,894
They are served by migrants
who have a point system.

159
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:30,453
Where is this chief?

160
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:33,294
Why do you wish to know?

161
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:36,394
Well... I have a reason to.

162
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:40,303
I heard he moves around each
season with no set residence.

163
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:43,404
Even the killers communicate
with a secret method.

164
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:47,813
Now, he might be on Mount
Janggok or Mount Bongchu.

165
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:51,614
So he is on one of those two mountains?

166
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:54,914
Dal!

167
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:57,323
What are you doing?

168
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,024
What is up with you?

169
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:06,323
I must save someone.

170
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:36,353
Where is Ga Jin?

171
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:39,864
She got back safely, so do not worry.

172
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:43,333
She is not safe.

173
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:46,803
Why not? Where is she now?

174
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,874
This is urgent.

175
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:10,213
I must see you leave.

176
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:22,764
Ga Jin wore the exact same clothes.

177
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:35,473
The jade necklace. You must find that.

178
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,284
Jade!

179
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:08,073
Hey.

180
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,884
It is you. Ga Jin's friend.

181
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:13,983
How did you find this place?

182
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,514
How is Ga Jin? I heard her father is in danger.

183
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,024
Be quiet.

184
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:23,453
Your assassin friends are everywhere.

185
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:41,244
- Mister, I am back.
- Yes, good.

186
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:46,514
You are the country bumpkin Ga Jin was with.

187
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:47,813
Who is a country bumpkin?

188
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:50,583
You went to get a necklace
and came back with him?

189
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,884
It so happened.

190
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:53,624
You can relax.

191
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,823
He helped Ga Jin when she was hurt.

192
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:57,424
- Oh.
- And take this.

193
00:14:57,424 --> 00:15:00,524
- Are you Ga Jin's father?
- Oh, my goodness.

194
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:04,703
It is done. All is well.

195
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,333
Now we just need to get Ga Jin.

196
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,833
The thing is, I checked and...

197
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,144
Woong Tae and Sam Bok are on guard.

198
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,014
If they identify us during the fight...

199
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:18,044
Hey. We must lure them.

200
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:19,813
Lure them?

201
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,134
Did you just see a green snake?

202
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,573
Who are you?

203
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:47,404
A green snake just came in here.

204
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:52,443
Mister.

205
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:01,593
Ga Jin.

206
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:05,894
She inhaled a powder that put her to sleep.

207
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:07,994
A sleeping powder?

208
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:11,364
Wake up, will you?

209
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,473
- Father.
- Yes, it is me.

210
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:21,544
You?

211
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:24,784
Yes, it is me. The deer.

212
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:31,583
Go Won Pyo wants Ga Jin's head.

213
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,183
Do it, chief.

214
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:37,294
If she quits killing, Ga Jin is of no use to us.

215
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:41,264
You do not know her true value.

216
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:43,364
Her value?

217
00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:47,634
Ga Jin must kill King Pyeongwon herself.

218
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:49,803
If she does that, Goguryeo...

219
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:52,073
will turn upside-down.

220
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:54,473
But Ga Jin said she wishes to quit.

221
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:10,493
We must hold a rite to clear the muddied soul.

222
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,993
Just how we did a long time ago.

223
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:24,374
Your soul will be cleansed
with the energy of Cheonjubang.

224
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:31,314
This drug will erase your whole past.

225
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:40,054
The chief brought you here, Ga Jin.

226
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,693
He said you would have no
memory when you wake...

227
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:47,463
and told me to raise you as my own.

228
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,933
I had lost my family,

229
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,804
and the chief took me in
when I had nowhere to go.

230
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:58,443
How would I dare disobey his command?

231
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:10,814
Since that day,

232
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:16,493
you became my daughter.

233
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,334
Are you really...

234
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,804
not my birth father?

235
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,904
I should have told you before.

236
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:32,243
Then you would not have become a killer,

237
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:36,614
and you would have found your parents.

238
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:42,253
It is my fault. It is all on me.

239
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,793
Do not cry, Father.

240
00:18:55,793 --> 00:19:00,533
You had this necklace at the time.

241
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:02,003
Take a look.

242
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:05,674
Do you remember anything?

243
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:10,674
I think I saw it in a dream.

244
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,084
I am not sure.

245
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:18,483
- They are here.
- What?

246
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:22,023
You must get out of here.

247
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:26,223
Find your real parents and live happily.

248
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:28,894
Where can I go when you are here, Father?

249
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:31,304
I am not your father.

250
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:34,904
Mister, you must get home
before they find out. Hurry.

251
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,304
Father.

252
00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:39,144
Will you get me killed too?

253
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:43,543
We must each fend for our own selves now.

254
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:46,614
Ga Jin, do not worry. We
will look after your dad.

255
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:48,683
Get out of here for now, okay?

256
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:49,884
Come along.

257
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:53,283
Father.

258
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:15,574
Find Ga Jin!

259
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:18,943
Darn it.

260
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:27,483
Your friend says this tunnel leads outside.

261
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:29,924
Follow me.

262
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:49,144
Are you okay? Can you manage?

263
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,683
When did you realize?

264
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,723
That I am a Cheonjubang assassin.

265
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,463
From the start.

266
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:09,493
Why did you pretend not to know?

267
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,003
Is that important right now?

268
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:18,404
If I had shown I knew, you
would have had to kill me.

269
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:21,043
I did not want to make you take a life.

270
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,283
If we fight here, someone will get hurt.

271
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:27,614
I do not want that, so we must hurry.

272
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:42,263
Come on.

273
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,414
Follow me.

274
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:18,804
If it is too much, get some rest.

275
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,804
No. It is just the effect of the powder.

276
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,473
There is an excuse for everything.

277
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:27,174
Do not worry about your father.

278
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:29,574
He seems stronger than he looks.

279
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:32,084
Your friends are not bad either.

280
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:35,953
I must go to Pyeongyang Castle.

281
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:41,023
Yeom Ga Jin.

282
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:52,533
Oh, my goodness. Ga Jin...

283
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,904
She left the rest of us to save her own skin.

284
00:22:55,904 --> 00:23:00,304
This is why they say one should
not take in another human being.

285
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:03,614
- She is truly evil!
- Stop.

286
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:05,344
My goodness...

287
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:13,283
Tae Mo, what are you doing?

288
00:23:13,723 --> 00:23:15,154
My goodness...

289
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:21,293
My goodness...

290
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:31,374
You got out of Cheonjubang...

291
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:34,144
and decided to quit killing.

292
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:38,183
You should live quietly in the wilderness.

293
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:42,183
What kind of wilderness? Your home?

294
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,054
Do not even dream of that.

295
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:46,584
Who said we would take you in?

296
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:52,193
Think again about going to Pyeongyang.

297
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:56,433
Many people deliberately bury their past.

298
00:23:57,993 --> 00:23:59,503
There is no guarantee that...

299
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:02,334
recovering your past will make you happy.

300
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,144
I fear of falling asleep.

301
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:11,614
Each time I have a nightmare,

302
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:16,384
I wonder if it is a dream
or a memory I have lost.

303
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:20,983
It hurts so much I cannot even scream.

304
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:27,293
I am alive, but I feel as if I am dying.

305
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,834
Do you know how that feels?

306
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:42,674
However scary it may be, if
I do not find out who I am...

307
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:45,743
and why I am in such turmoil,

308
00:24:46,783 --> 00:24:48,213
I cannot do anything.

309
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:50,013
Why not?

310
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:51,753
You may not remember yesterday,

311
00:24:51,753 --> 00:24:53,384
but there is today, tomorrow,
and the day after that.

312
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:56,154
Just think of the days that will come.

313
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:58,463
Your parents and hometown?

314
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:02,164
Even without that,

315
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,164
human beings get by somehow.

316
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:12,344
About you.

317
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:17,243
Did something happen before
you went into hiding?

318
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,314
Fearing the world is just an excuse.

319
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:25,253
Did you commit a terrible crime?

320
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:27,054
Oh, come on.

321
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:30,324
I saved your life and you
repay me with an insult?

322
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,364
Whatever it is, that is your issue.

323
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:35,263
I will go to the Capital.

324
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:36,263
My gosh.

325
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:39,033
How do you think you will get in?

326
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,304
Since what you did last time,

327
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:42,374
they will not even let a mouse in now.

328
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,273
Then you go home. Your mother is all alone.

329
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:47,674
We are as good as dead because of you.

330
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:50,674
Exactly. Do not follow me
around and be a nuisance.

331
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,154
When was I ever...

332
00:25:55,183 --> 00:25:58,013
Hey. Ouch, that is hot. Shoot.

333
00:25:58,084 --> 00:25:59,753
Yeom Ga Jin! Wait up!

334
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:05,523
Yeom Deuk, San, and Jin say
they did not go to the cave.

335
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:07,963
They are lying, so a beating...

336
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:09,594
Do not be foolish.

337
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,003
You must find Ga Jin first.

338
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:19,003
- I will find her.
- You cannot kill her.

339
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:26,743
She still is of some use to Cheonjubang.

340
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:34,783
Will you look at that?

341
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,924
- What...
- "What did I say?"

342
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:38,523
Do not dare say that.

343
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:43,793
You cannot get into the palace.

344
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:45,364
What will you do now?

345
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,634
The court lady in Magnolia
Hall seemed to recognize me.

346
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,243
I wanted to ask her.

347
00:26:56,513 --> 00:27:00,013
You should have said so sooner. Follow me.

348
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:01,953
Hey.

349
00:27:04,384 --> 00:27:05,854
Salute!

350
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:41,124
Hey. Why are you still there? Come along.

351
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:53,463
I have the drawing you asked for.

352
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:11,354
Her hair is thicker than this.

353
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:15,023
And it is softer.

354
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,824
She does not just have a killer spirit.

355
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:20,693
She was also haughty and elegant.

356
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:24,463
Her lips should be plumper...

357
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,533
and have a sheen.

358
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,604
I will commission another drawing.

359
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:32,473
No. Leave this with me.

360
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:11,443
They will soon send the head of the assassin.

361
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,084
That is good news.

362
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:16,814
This Cheonjubang chief.

363
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:20,084
He is not entirely trustworthy.

364
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:22,293
Then what?

365
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:26,193
Will word get out that we hired him?

366
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:30,094
What matters now is the King's health.

367
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:31,864
GO WON PYO, GYERU TRIBE'S GOCHUGA

368
00:29:31,864 --> 00:29:35,003
His sickened soul took him to death's door.

369
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:38,543
He will need even stronger medicine.

370
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,473
I had the Head Eunuch bring something to him.

371
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,374
He will forget his earthly worries...

372
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,783
and fall into a trance.

373
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:18,983
My goodness. Who are you?

374
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:11,334
Who are you?

375
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,543
That herb is still young.

376
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:20,503
Do not touch it.

377
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,914
If you had hurt my hand,

378
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,283
you could not have made up for
it even if you sold this store.

379
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:30,753
What a pity.

380
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:33,154
If I had hurt your hand,

381
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:37,154
I could show you myself just
how effective that herb is.

382
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:38,523
And before that,

383
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:42,364
you would have lost your head.

384
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:46,233
Are you saying your hand is worth my life?

385
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:47,463
Not at all.

386
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,404
It would be worth...

387
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,703
at least 10 of you.

388
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:58,414
Do Gyeru Tribe royals have gold on their hands?

389
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:01,213
Do you know me?

390
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,654
You used to enjoy drinks and
women more than most jobless men,

391
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:11,154
but these days your life is boring
because you are after an assassin.

392
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:18,334
Now I get who you are.

393
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:22,003
I had heard that Hae Ji Weol
has a clever adopted daughter.

394
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:27,003
I am Hae Mo Yong.

395
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:31,213
Like you said, I ended up
here doing something boring.

396
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:34,213
Did a suspicious man sneak in here?

397
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:36,154
I did not see anyone.

398
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:40,854
Did you not?

399
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:46,594
Then I wasted my time.

400
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:50,864
We got to meet, so for me, it was a gain.

401
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,341
We need to find the owner of the
herb store in Mount Jangbaek.

402
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:02,697
- An herb store?
- Yes.

403
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:05,166
That person knows everything that happens...

404
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,537
in and outside of Pyeongyang Castle.

405
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:08,537
And that owner pretty much
has connections to everyone.

406
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:11,537
You might even get to meet the
court lady you are looking for.

407
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:13,537
But why are we at the mountain?

408
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:16,147
Do you think it will be easy
to meet someone like that?

409
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:19,877
We should at least bring that
person some wild ginseng.

410
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:21,276
Wild ginseng?

411
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:24,217
But how? That stuff is really rare to find.

412
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:25,287
I found it!

413
00:33:35,397 --> 00:33:37,296
Why are the leaves so...

414
00:33:39,737 --> 00:33:40,737
It is a bellflower root.

415
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,737
But I am sure I saw five leaves.

416
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:59,487
It even tastes like a bellflower root. Try it.

417
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:17,106
What?

418
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:23,407
Ga Jin, let us just pick all
the herbs in this mountain.

419
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:25,647
Bellflowers, dong quai roots,
and Siberian chrysanthemum.

420
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,647
Let us just pick everything.

421
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:31,647
Let us go.

422
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:36,526
He is unbelievable.

423
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:47,696
KING PYEONGWON, 25TH KING OF GOGURYEO

424
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:58,306
Your Majesty.

425
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:00,517
She is not an assassin. She is a ghost.

426
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,216
A ghost is here to get me.

427
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,147
- She is a ghost.
- Your Majesty!

428
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,357
Your Majesty!

429
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:14,556
- Please stop, Your Majesty.
- Get lost.

430
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,297
Get lost!

431
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:17,667
Your Majesty!

432
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:20,397
Please calm down.

433
00:35:23,866 --> 00:35:25,906
Are you going to wait all night?

434
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:28,336
You should go now.

435
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:30,547
I should say hello.

436
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,977
CROWN PRINCE WON, FUTURE KING YEONGYANG

437
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:36,547
The king and crown prince
will not last very long.

438
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:39,586
He will try his best to maintain his power...

439
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:42,357
until the crown prince grows older.

440
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:44,686
But in his state, he will
only last another year or two.

441
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:48,327
Then...

442
00:35:48,957 --> 00:35:50,996
He will either collapsed due
to an overdose of drugs...

443
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:53,637
or willingly give up the throne.

444
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:55,536
AN ACT OF ABDICATING THE THRONE

445
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:57,637
There will come a day when
we will need a regent.

446
00:35:57,637 --> 00:36:01,207
A PERSON WHO GOVERNS THE
COUNTRY ON BEHALF OF THE KING

447
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:08,647
The day you become a regent,

448
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:13,116
Geon will become the crown prince.

449
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:16,727
Then he will succeed the throne in the future.

450
00:36:33,906 --> 00:36:37,306
I want you to burn everything right now!

451
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,276
Yes... Your Majesty.

452
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,757
What is going on?

453
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,656
He asked them to burn everything
that belonged to the princess.

454
00:36:56,596 --> 00:36:57,727
Why all of sudden?

455
00:36:57,827 --> 00:36:59,297
I do not know.

456
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:02,197
Everyone must be seeing her ghost.

457
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,507
What do you mean?

458
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,306
The thing is, a few days ago...

459
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:11,546
Princess.

460
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,117
She said "Princess"?

461
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:16,216
Strange, right?

462
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,986
Lady Gongson raised the princess
ever since she was a baby.

463
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:22,726
She would never mistake
her for another court maid.

464
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,117
I am worried this might all be for nothing.

465
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,586
It might be better not to remember anything.

466
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,656
I would do anything...

467
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:00,957
to forget what I have been through.

468
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:11,666
Goodness, you did not have to
bring me this at this late hour.

469
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,507
I know you are worried about Dal,

470
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:16,546
but we were worried about you.

471
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:18,906
Eat up so you can stay healthy.

472
00:38:18,906 --> 00:38:21,317
That way, you will have the energy
to beat Dal once he comes back.

473
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:24,387
Why are you telling her to
beat Dal? He did nothing wrong.

474
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:28,317
Wol, do you know something?

475
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:32,387
My goodness, of course not.
I do not know anything.

476
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:34,497
Do not worry too much.

477
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:36,627
You know Dal would not get himself in trouble.

478
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,127
My goodness, he should know better.

479
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:40,767
What is the matter?

480
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:42,137
Forget it.

481
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,507
I have too much on my mind. You should go.

482
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:48,437
Come on. Let us go.

483
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:51,577
That darn punk.

484
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:02,286
Thank you.

485
00:39:06,957 --> 00:39:07,957
What is that?

486
00:39:12,526 --> 00:39:13,736
You are awake.

487
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:15,937
It is nothing.

488
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:18,267
It is a drawing of the assassin.

489
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:19,836
Then it is something.

490
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:37,557
Did you also see the assassin that day?

491
00:39:39,187 --> 00:39:40,457
No, I did not.

492
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,796
My lord, a letter just came from the palace.

493
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,466
I will leave you to it.

494
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:02,747
Lady Gongson went after the
maid, but she disappeared.

495
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:07,057
Who do you think that maid was?

496
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,127
Is anyone there?

497
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,796
I separately packed the
medicinal herbs for His Majesty.

498
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:26,507
No one should find out which
medicinal herbs were used.

499
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,137
Of course.

500
00:40:54,236 --> 00:40:55,966
Did I keep you waiting for too long?

501
00:40:56,307 --> 00:40:58,367
I had to deliver some
medicinal herbs to the palace.

502
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:13,257
If you wish to find a woman, you
should go to a courtesan house.

503
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:15,317
She is the assassin who tried to kill the king.

504
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:26,867
Have you ever seen that letter?

505
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:30,066
"A shaman..."

506
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,377
"will attack the king."

507
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:37,247
That letter was secretly given
to me on the day of the ceremony.

508
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:38,776
Do you think...

509
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:41,916
I was the one who sent it?

510
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:43,946
This place...

511
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:47,357
not only sells medicinal herbs.

512
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:50,656
I heard you also sell people and information.

513
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:53,826
I want you to find the assassin.

514
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:58,326
And bring her to me first.

515
00:41:58,397 --> 00:42:02,467
Then what will I get in return?

516
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:03,536
"In return"?

517
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:07,306
You will not have to worry about...

518
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:12,347
my soldiers destroying your herb store.

519
00:42:13,517 --> 00:42:15,117
The court musician who disappeared...

520
00:42:16,017 --> 00:42:17,617
used to work for you.

521
00:42:20,656 --> 00:42:22,956
You keep asking me things I do not know of.

522
00:42:24,186 --> 00:42:25,186
Then...

523
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:29,727
I would also like to ask you for something.

524
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:33,166
I want to know why Gochuga...

525
00:42:33,696 --> 00:42:35,967
suddenly took...

526
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:38,737
Lady Gongson.

527
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:41,107
What?

528
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:44,507
- My lady.
- Come back later.

529
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:49,377
A couple of herb collectors are
selling their stuff outside.

530
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:59,997
Are your eyes dim, and do
your hands and feet feel numb?

531
00:43:00,397 --> 00:43:03,467
And do you have a sore throat and knees?

532
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:06,536
Do you have no appetite?

533
00:43:06,536 --> 00:43:09,367
And does alcohol not taste good?

534
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:13,706
That is all because you lack energy.

535
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:16,507
Take a look at her!

536
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:18,147
Ever since she was a kid,

537
00:43:18,147 --> 00:43:21,916
she was always sick and weak.

538
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:25,887
So I checked her condition and figured...

539
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:28,987
that 20 of these pills will do the magic.

540
00:43:30,387 --> 00:43:34,097
She gained so much energy after she ate this.

541
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:35,826
Whoever marries her...

542
00:43:36,097 --> 00:43:38,166
should be ready to exhaust himself to death.

543
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:40,097
My goodness.

544
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:41,767
It must work wonders.

545
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:43,306
What are you doing?

546
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:48,507
I would not have gathered
you if I only had pills.

547
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:51,206
Mount Yongchu, Mount Gonam, and Mount Baekryong.

548
00:43:51,206 --> 00:43:54,416
I went to all the great mountains...

549
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,786
to gather all these precious herbs.

550
00:43:56,786 --> 00:44:00,087
After she ate these herbs,

551
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:04,487
she even picked up the
energy to learn martial arts!

552
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:06,257
Is that true?

553
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:08,627
You will believe me once
you see it for yourself.

554
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:10,867
What are you doing?

555
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:12,267
Come on.

556
00:44:14,837 --> 00:44:16,036
Do you have a death wish?

557
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,906
I am doing this to live.

558
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,176
I am not going to play along with this.

559
00:44:21,176 --> 00:44:22,877
Do you not want to meet the
owner of the Jangbaek herb store?

560
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:28,617
Come on. People are waiting.

561
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:31,347
I will seriously hurt you.

562
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,717
Did you see that?

563
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:08,156
Did you see her flying around?

564
00:45:08,816 --> 00:45:12,757
That is all thanks to the herbal pills she took.

565
00:45:13,026 --> 00:45:15,097
Let me have some of that.

566
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:16,566
- My goodness, stop pushing.
- Move.

567
00:45:16,566 --> 00:45:19,737
Everyone, line up!

568
00:45:33,676 --> 00:45:35,117
What are they doing?

569
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:36,316
Stay still.

570
00:45:37,786 --> 00:45:39,857
How dare you cause a scene?

571
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:41,816
Who do you think you are?

572
00:45:46,757 --> 00:45:49,497
- My goodness.
- Oh, dear.

573
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:55,467
Take it easy, will you?

574
00:45:57,837 --> 00:46:00,206
How dare you create a scene?

575
00:46:00,206 --> 00:46:04,076
I wanted to meet you and ask you something.

576
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:13,357
She is the assassin who tried to kill the king.

577
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,267
I am here to find someone.

578
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,666
She can come in, but not him.

579
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:41,847
Who are you looking for?

580
00:46:42,347 --> 00:46:44,286
She is someone who worked at Magnolia Hall.

581
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:46,286
She is a middle-aged lady.

582
00:46:46,686 --> 00:46:47,987
Lady Gongson.

583
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,186
"Gongson"?

584
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:51,987
You are very lucky.

585
00:46:52,426 --> 00:46:54,826
I just heard something about her.

586
00:46:55,056 --> 00:46:56,826
What can I do to meet her?

587
00:46:56,826 --> 00:46:58,467
Why are you looking for her?

588
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:00,436
I cannot tell you.

589
00:47:00,936 --> 00:47:02,237
Then what is your name?

590
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:03,936
You do not need to know that either.

591
00:47:07,176 --> 00:47:09,576
I have my reasons, so please help me.

592
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:12,176
- I will pay you...
- You already helped me make money.

593
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:20,186
I was offered five chunks of silver to find you.

594
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:22,617
That means...

595
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:27,556
you will not be able to walk out of here alive.

596
00:47:32,696 --> 00:47:34,897
The moment something happens to me,

597
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:38,436
your friend will get beheaded.

598
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:07,767
Let us start over.

599
00:48:09,296 --> 00:48:10,906
What is your name?

600
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:13,536
I do not know.

601
00:48:15,237 --> 00:48:18,747
I am trying to meet with
her, so I can find that out.

602
00:48:19,507 --> 00:48:21,517
You are telling me that you
do not know who you are.

603
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:23,286
If you let me talk to her,

604
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:26,816
I will gladly let you tie me up.

605
00:48:27,656 --> 00:48:30,826
Then, you can hand me over to
the soldiers and take the reward.

606
00:48:48,406 --> 00:48:50,206
Forgive me for not treating you better,

607
00:48:50,507 --> 00:48:51,977
but wait here quietly.

608
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:09,967
What?

609
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:31,446
Who are you?

610
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:34,017
By any chance,

611
00:49:35,456 --> 00:49:36,956
do you know who I am?

612
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:53,276
I vaguely remember a lullaby.

613
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:57,847
I remember going to Magnolia Hall.

614
00:50:01,377 --> 00:50:04,847
Was I a maid at the palace?

615
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:09,956
Goodness.

616
00:50:12,587 --> 00:50:14,426
Praise the divine forces.

617
00:50:16,397 --> 00:50:17,397
Lady.

618
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:21,067
You cannot be here.

619
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,137
You must run away at once!

620
00:50:24,236 --> 00:50:25,736
If they find out you are alive,

621
00:50:26,037 --> 00:50:28,006
they will try to kill you, My Princess.

622
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,617
"Princess"?

623
00:50:35,016 --> 00:50:36,176
What are you talking about?

624
00:50:37,016 --> 00:50:39,617
- I am not...
- How could you say that?

625
00:50:40,686 --> 00:50:42,387
You are the daughter of the King.

626
00:50:42,887 --> 00:50:44,857
You are Princess Pyeonggang.

627
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:56,837
Who are you?

628
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,676
Princess!

629
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:13,117
Other soldiers will be here.

630
00:51:13,357 --> 00:51:15,716
You must run away now. Hurry!

631
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:25,797
This stays between you and me.

632
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:46,587
- You two, clean up the warehouse.
- Yes, my lord.

633
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:49,216
The four of you will chase
after the woman that just left.

634
00:51:49,387 --> 00:51:50,787
You are never to kill her.

635
00:51:50,926 --> 00:51:51,926
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

636
00:52:07,476 --> 00:52:09,107
You are the daughter of the King.

637
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,347
You are Princess Pyeonggang.

638
00:52:57,926 --> 00:52:58,956
What is going on?

639
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:47,406
Where did the guards all go?

640
00:53:47,777 --> 00:53:48,777
Open it.

641
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:03,986
Did you go to Magnolia Hall
the day before the ceremony?

642
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:05,057
Yes.

643
00:54:06,057 --> 00:54:08,256
I go there once every 10 days...

644
00:54:08,597 --> 00:54:10,226
and clean the hall.

645
00:54:10,226 --> 00:54:12,726
And you saw a maid you
have not seen before there.

646
00:54:15,537 --> 00:54:16,906
No, I did not.

647
00:54:16,906 --> 00:54:18,206
There is a witness.

648
00:54:18,736 --> 00:54:21,236
How dare you lie to him?

649
00:54:21,537 --> 00:54:22,607
Well,

650
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:27,117
around the death anniversary of the princess,

651
00:54:27,117 --> 00:54:29,716
I tend to get confused.

652
00:54:29,847 --> 00:54:31,946
So I must have hallucinated...

653
00:54:32,216 --> 00:54:34,186
and misspoken.

654
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:36,087
If what you are telling me is true,

655
00:54:36,617 --> 00:54:38,527
your time at the palace must be nearing its end.

656
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,996
The prince has not recovered fully.

657
00:54:41,996 --> 00:54:43,926
I must look after him.

658
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:49,736
We cannot sacrifice the prince...

659
00:54:50,137 --> 00:54:53,006
for the sake of the late princess.

660
00:54:54,706 --> 00:54:55,777
Choose.

661
00:54:56,607 --> 00:54:58,547
You can leave the palace now.

662
00:54:59,647 --> 00:55:03,416
Or you can look after the
prince and be my eyes and ears.

663
00:55:11,226 --> 00:55:12,426
Allow me...

664
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:15,996
to look after the prince.

665
00:55:38,516 --> 00:55:40,716
I am not trying to run away.

666
00:55:41,456 --> 00:55:44,887
The blood is all going to my head.
I wanted to be more comfortable.

667
00:55:47,696 --> 00:55:49,926
Tell me everything you know about your friend.

668
00:55:50,426 --> 00:55:53,127
I do not know much. I only met her recently.

669
00:55:53,327 --> 00:55:55,867
But you risked your life
for someone you barely knew?

670
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:57,206
Who says I am going to die?

671
00:55:58,307 --> 00:56:00,206
I will not die in a shed like this.

672
00:56:01,436 --> 00:56:03,406
I am trying to help you.

673
00:56:03,706 --> 00:56:06,446
It is hard to believe that when
you stick a dagger at my throat.

674
00:56:08,317 --> 00:56:09,916
Where is my friend now?

675
00:56:11,686 --> 00:56:13,587
She needed to meet someone.

676
00:56:13,587 --> 00:56:15,916
So I told her how she could do that.

677
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:18,426
You are just as I heard. You do know everything.

678
00:56:19,226 --> 00:56:21,656
Thank you. I will pay for your help.

679
00:56:23,027 --> 00:56:25,127
She will repay me.

680
00:56:25,696 --> 00:56:27,567
I just secured collateral for her promise.

681
00:56:27,897 --> 00:56:28,897
Collateral?

682
00:56:29,996 --> 00:56:31,037
You.

683
00:56:32,037 --> 00:56:35,607
Well, this position is quite uncomfortable.

684
00:56:36,406 --> 00:56:37,607
But it is doable.

685
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:39,077
"Doable".

686
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:49,156
For every two hours, you will bleed half a hop.

687
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,827
You must pray that she comes back...

688
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:55,057
before you bleed out.

689
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:57,466
Hey.

690
00:56:58,127 --> 00:56:59,996
You should pray too.

691
00:57:01,597 --> 00:57:03,936
If anything happens to my friend,

692
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:07,436
I am going to destroy this place.

693
00:57:10,506 --> 00:57:13,377
Sure. Let us pray together.

694
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:24,647
Princess!

695
00:59:24,946 --> 00:59:27,446
My goodness. Where are you going?

696
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:15,426
Father!

697
01:00:19,226 --> 01:00:23,037
My Princess. I did not hear you
come in. How did you get here?

698
01:00:23,097 --> 01:00:25,266
It is a secret. No one knows it, but me.

699
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:28,277
You will keep that a secret?

700
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:31,107
I have a present. Please close your eyes.

701
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:32,277
Sure.

702
01:00:35,317 --> 01:00:36,577
You can open them now.

703
01:00:40,716 --> 01:00:43,087
Yes. This flower resembles...

704
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:45,986
the lady of Magnolia Hall.

705
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:02,077
I do not need any of you!

706
01:01:02,176 --> 01:01:04,406
You are foolish and vulgar!

707
01:01:07,676 --> 01:01:08,676
Who is there?

708
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:16,087
Do not hide there like a rat.

709
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:17,686
Show yourself.

710
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:36,377
Do you...

711
01:01:37,847 --> 01:01:39,406
recognize me?

712
01:01:42,547 --> 01:01:43,547
You are...

713
01:01:45,686 --> 01:01:48,357
Yes. I am Pyeonggang.

714
01:01:53,956 --> 01:01:55,456
Why did you do it?

715
01:01:57,696 --> 01:01:59,696
Why did you abandon me?

716
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:04,307
Father.

717
