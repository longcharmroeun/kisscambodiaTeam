1
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:07,338
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,309
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,408
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:14,349
This man here is my husband.

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,949
You are no longer my daughter.

6
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:20,319
Leave the palace immediately.

7
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:24,690
They are married. Ga Jin and Dal got married!

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,690
You punk! How dare you
tease your blind mother!

9
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,859
It does not matter if it is real or not.

10
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:32,899
As long as I can be with you...

11
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:34,899
and protect you.

12
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,300
Practice the basic strikes.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,569
Let us not tell Mother that
I am learning to fight.

14
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:42,109
She will fall ill...

15
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,139
the moment she hears.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,539
Revive the Sunno Tribe?

17
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:49,350
You cannot live in Ghost Valley forever.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,319
You must gather your men, gain strength,

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,219
and regain power.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,889
The Cheonjubang leader,
disguised as a fortune-teller.

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,060
I will refrain from any
further foolish games.

22
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:59,920
It is quite a waste,

23
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,990
but I have no choice.

24
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,399
EPISODE 11

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,779
You despicable spy.

26
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,509
I will kill you here so
you cannot return to Silla.

27
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:53,339
Lady Hae. Wake up.

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,410
Did you...

29
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,720
hear...

30
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,149
what he said?

31
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,419
I heard,

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,200
and I was surprised.

33
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:13,999
You are truly...

34
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,629
a mysterious woman.

35
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,580
I told you to spy on Hae Ji Weol,

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,080
and you saved his daughter.

37
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,679
Do not worry about Lord Hae.

38
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:32,649
I did not find anything to
show he is hostile towards you.

39
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,820
And his daughter?

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,719
Anything suspicious about her?

41
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,460
I heard she controls the Sono
Tribe from behind the scenes.

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,929
Do you have something?

43
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,330
No.

44
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,800
I did not find anything in particular.

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,899
I would like to be excused.

46
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,099
Check up on the Princess at all times.

47
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,170
She will not have returned
to the Sunno Tribe...

48
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,170
to play house with On Hyeop's son.

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,379
When the time is right,

50
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,149
we must nip them in the bud.

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,189
I will untangle them.

52
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,230
I will remove anything...

53
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,499
that comes between us! So please...

54
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:18,559
Master Go!

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,629
I need to leave now.

56
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,570
I am sorry.

57
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:31,779
Master Go.

58
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,619
I will not go easy on you.

59
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,990
I need to check on your progress.

60
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,929
Do not cry after you lose.

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Here we go.

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,820
Lady Sa.

63
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,390
Do you know why I am not
teaching Dal swordsmanship?

64
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,560
Once he wields the sword,

65
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,960
he is bound to see blood. That
is the fate of a swordsman.

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,440
I do not want Dal to follow
in my bloody footsteps.

67
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,159
Well done, Dal.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
What are you doing right now?

69
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:03,229
Mother.

70
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,640
My gosh, Mother. Watch your step. Be careful.

71
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,210
- Are you all right?
- Mother.

72
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,409
How did you get here?

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,580
What is this?

74
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,419
Is it a sword?

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,560
Dal, are you learning how to use a sword?

76
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,620
Lying to me...

77
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,390
and hiding up here?

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,200
I am not learning anything.
We are just fooling around.

79
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,630
My eyes do not work,

80
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,529
but my brain works just fine!

81
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,940
Mother. It is all my fault.

82
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,810
Dal did not want to learn,

83
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,070
but I made him.

84
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,010
What did you say?

85
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,750
What will you do by
teaching him how to fight?

86
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,779
Do you want to turn him into a human butcher?

87
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,820
So he can go out and cut down people?

88
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,390
Mother, that is not what it is for.

89
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,620
All this happened because...

90
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,930
a wicked girl joined the family.

91
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,960
Mother. You speak too harshly.

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,029
Dal.

93
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,330
Do not scold Ga Jin.

94
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,070
I said I wished to learn.

95
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,099
I wish to learn swordsmanship...

96
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:14,770
and become a general like Father.

97
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,279
- What?
- My father...

98
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,549
was the greatest fighter in Goguryeo.

99
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,210
But me?

100
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,680
What am I?

101
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,849
I just plow fields and gather herbs.

102
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,359
What would Father say if
he were to see me now?

103
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,130
You turned me into an
ignorant country bumpkin.

104
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,270
You fool.

105
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,799
You idiot. You should just die!

106
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,239
You fool!

107
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,239
You punk. You immature brat.

108
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,979
That was what the general wanted.

109
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,680
He wished you would never hold a sword...

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,190
and live like a country bumpkin forever!

111
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,399
Mother.

112
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,890
Mother. You should eat.

113
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,849
She must be very dismayed.

114
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,520
She will not eat.

115
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,120
You should talk to her...

116
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,149
so that she can come around.

117
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,390
What should I say?

118
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,890
That I will never hold a sword again?

119
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,529
That she need not worry?

120
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,899
Or...

121
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:24,700
that I will live quietly and do as she says?

122
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,909
I am not saying you should
lie to smooth things over.

123
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,380
What you truly think.

124
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,680
Tell her what your deepest,
honest thoughts are.

125
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,690
My thoughts?

126
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,619
Lady Sa must be in shock.

127
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,259
She tried so hard to prevent
Dal from learning to fight.

128
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,729
Bad news is best heard as soon as possible.

129
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,300
It was for the best. She
was bound to find out.

130
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,769
She cannot coddle...

131
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,339
someone like Dal who is
made to be a great general.

132
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:04,780
He is a loyal and filial boy,
so he will be confused as well.

133
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,180
I am afraid Ga Jin will end up
being treated like a nuisance.

134
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,550
Do not worry about that.

135
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,150
She is smart and feisty.

136
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,489
Women like her are rare.

137
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:17,889
That is true.

138
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,660
She is a perfect match for Dal.

139
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:24,430
Just like you and me, Chief.

140
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,369
What...

141
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,570
Anyway, I do not think it
is for us to interfere.

142
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:36,810
We should wait and see.

143
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,940
Yes, Chief.

144
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,150
How much steel do you
have to melt into weapons?

145
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,780
We have quite a lot.

146
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,280
Come to the forge.

147
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,759
You are quite...

148
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:01,200
Mother.

149
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:06,969
I thought about it,

150
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,710
and even if Father were alive,

151
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,310
eventually,

152
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,810
I would have learned to fight.

153
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,379
If he disapproved,

154
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:23,749
I would probably learn in
secret am I'm doing now.

155
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,489
It is not because of Ga Jin.

156
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:29,889
It is what I want.

157
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,129
I dream of becoming a great general.

158
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:38,040
So please give your permission, Mother.

159
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,810
You want to ruin your own life.

160
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,749
What can I do to stop you?

161
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,280
Mother.

162
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,119
Get lost. I am sleepy.

163
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,170
Oh, General...

164
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,810
General On...

165
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,810
You idiot.

166
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,609
You could not deal with one girl?

167
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,410
Kill me, Chief.

168
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,379
How will killing you benefit me?

169
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,849
The wench will try to get back at us.

170
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,950
You must get away.

171
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:07,060
We are after each other's life.

172
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,129
She will not act rashly.

173
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Chief.

174
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,099
A messenger is here from Jangbaek herb store.

175
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,410
Wait outside.

176
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,519
You are hiding your identity
from your right-hand man too?

177
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,320
It is not something I want
everyone to know about.

178
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,359
You are harder to kill than I thought.

179
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,200
That is rich coming from
the Cheonjubang chief...

180
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,570
who is always trying to kill the King.

181
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,400
The night is short, so do not waste time.

182
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,139
Get to the point.

183
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,080
The woman who asked for the
impregnation ceremony...

184
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,550
is the King's concubine.

185
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
But...

186
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,719
if I were to let you enter the palace,

187
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,119
something dreadful could
happen that I cannot control.

188
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,060
Why do you want the King dead?

189
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,769
You must tell me what grudge you hold.

190
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:28,139
I believe we can cooperate.

191
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:35,210
There was a young priest...

192
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,280
with great skill.

193
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,690
Also,

194
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,160
there was a woman he loved in secret.

195
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:56,030
Push harder.

196
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,129
Harder.

197
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,540
A bit more.

198
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,420
- After them!
- Yes, sir!

199
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,790
The priest broke the law,

200
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:19,160
and all he wanted was to
save his wife and child.

201
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,729
No. Wife.

202
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,940
After them! Get them!

203
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,910
Wife.

204
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,310
Wife!

205
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
That night,

206
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,759
what the King's men killed were
not the man's wife and child.

207
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,089
It was...

208
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:32,999
the priest himself.

209
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,170
King Pyeongwon.

210
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:42,139
I must avenge...

211
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,780
my wife and child who
were killed by the king.

212
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,920
An impregnation ceremony?

213
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,530
Yes. I found a very skilled fortune-teller.

214
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,629
Please give your permission.

215
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,930
Having an offspring...

216
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,999
means bringing forth a grave
concern into the world.

217
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,139
Plus, if the Queen were to find out,

218
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,210
how will you bear her jealousy?

219
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,080
I do not wish for anything else.

220
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,519
I just want to hold your child in my arms.

221
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,400
Give your permission. Please?

222
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,009
How many times must I say that I get it?

223
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,920
It could take a day or two longer.

224
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,360
I cooked your favorite meat dishes,

225
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,519
so eat all that.

226
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,930
Did you ever come and go as I said?

227
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,729
Why are you acting so weird today?

228
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,600
Mother. We brought in extra firewood.

229
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,130
And the water jug is full too.

230
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,630
Okay. Stop talking and nagging and get going.

231
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,769
- Mother.
- Just go already.

232
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:20,340
- Are you angry?
- Just go.

233
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
I got it. You can go.

234
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,509
You sigh too much.

235
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,079
Do not worry about your mother.

236
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,850
I am not worried.

237
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,960
It shows when you lie.

238
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,289
From now on, we must do well.

239
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,100
Looking after her...

240
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,059
and reviving Ghost Valley.

241
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,200
You must focus on your training.

242
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:52,600
- I know.
- Then stand up straight.

243
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:54,940
You look extra ugly when you are hunched.

244
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,680
That is a bit better.

245
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,920
But must I learn from another master?

246
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,279
I want to go on learning from you.

247
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,519
My skills are not good enough now.

248
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,489
You have strong muscles, and you are quick.

249
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:14,360
You advance quicker than I thought.

250
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:17,390
You should learn from a teacher
who is more experienced than me.

251
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:19,299
Who is that?

252
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,930
I have someone in mind.

253
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:23,229
We should go.

254
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
It is too high.

255
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,319
How far must we go?

256
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,559
Follow me.

257
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,469
Wol Gwang.

258
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,840
Swordsmanship?

259
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,009
I thought you were having
an affair with those sticks.

260
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,680
You. That crazy monk.

261
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,420
Wol Gwang. Have you been well?

262
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,549
It has been a long time, Princess.

263
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,029
You could barely mumble last time.

264
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,900
Now you can walk at least.

265
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,430
Ga Jin. Who is this man?

266
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:39,239
I believed you would come to me in due time,

267
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,509
so I waited.

268
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,279
It was you.

269
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,920
When I was poisoned and fell
unconscious in the Capital,

270
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,150
you saved me.

271
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,160
And after that, you continued
to watch Dal and me.

272
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:05,100
You left Yibullansa with a look of despair.

273
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,600
But seeing you now, having found your path,

274
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,410
I am infinitely moved.

275
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:14,710
To tell you truth, I have come
to ask for a difficult favor.

276
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,380
If Dal has a worthy master,

277
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,620
he will become a great man of Goguryeo.

278
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,950
I am not certain...

279
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,960
that I am worthy of teaching the
son of the great General On Hyeop.

280
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,930
What nonsense are you talking about?

281
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,759
The person you want me
to take as my master...

282
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,069
was this crazy monk?

283
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,630
I will not do it. I cannot.

284
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,940
Be careful what you say.

285
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,340
In the South was General On Hyeop,
and in the North, General Son.

286
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:45,840
He fought with your father
to protect the country...

287
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,640
as one of its greatest warriors.

288
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,279
I beg of you, Wol Gwang.

289
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,390
Are you really leaving
me here, all by myself?

290
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:02,690
That crazy...

291
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:05,900
I mean, that monk seems a bit strange to me.

292
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,029
Do not say such things and train hard.

293
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,239
While you are training,
I will also work hard.

294
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,600
What if I want to see you?

295
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
Just bear with it. I will do the same.

296
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,479
There are some things I cannot bear.

297
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,090
Gosh.

298
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,259
I will wait for you, my
husband. I have faith in you.

299
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,539
Be careful, my wife.

300
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,039
Hey.

301
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,910
I will get going.

302
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,100
What should I learn first?

303
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,130
I have mastered the basics of swordsmanship.

304
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,229
First, get some firewood and make some rice.

305
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,900
I ate raw food for a few days
because I was out of wood,

306
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,340
and I have had diarrhea for several days now.

307
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:24,039
Right, catch some rabbits
and cook a couple too.

308
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,110
You're a monk, but you eat meat?

309
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,749
Whether it's grass or meat,
everything turns to feces anyway.

310
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,509
What are you doing?

311
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,079
Are you waiting for the sky
to shower you with gifts?

312
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,779
Do not let your emotions
get in the way of our work.

313
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,210
I have been waiting for this
chance for over a decade.

314
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,009
There is no way I would do that.

315
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,319
I am simply reminding
you of what you promised.

316
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,420
Of course I remember.

317
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,460
What you desire is the end of Goguryeo.

318
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,890
Until that time comes,

319
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:19,860
I will allow the King to live.

320
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,950
The qi does not flow properly
in your fertility system.

321
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,219
I know.

322
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,749
We have used herbs to
improve the flow thus far.

323
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,759
Will I be able to become pregnant?

324
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,630
Wait for a full moon,

325
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,660
and perform a ritual for the dead.

326
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,029
You need to absorb energy
from your noble ancestors...

327
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:58,969
and revive your stagnated flow.

328
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,009
If you do so, you will be
able to become pregnant.

329
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,940
Is that really true?

330
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,940
Before you perform the ritual,

331
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,450
I will tell you what foods
and taboos you should avoid.

332
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,979
If you trust me,

333
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,489
I know you will give
birth to a healthy child.

334
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,789
Of course I will.

335
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,329
What happy news.

336
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,829
Thank you, Lady Hae.

337
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,559
It is my honor.

338
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:31,170
But I have not heard your name.

339
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,809
A low fortune-teller like
me does not have a name.

340
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,340
Just call me No Name.

341
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,710
No Name?

342
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,620
Lady Hae.

343
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,390
Go ahead without me.

344
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,930
You may go.

345
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:10,509
Your wound must not yet be healed.

346
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,880
What brings you to the palace?

347
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,640
Work is important, but you
must look after yourself.

348
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,880
I have yet to give you my
thanks for saving my life.

349
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,180
How could I repay this debt?

350
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,090
There is no debt between us.

351
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,190
Did you find out who attacked you?

352
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:31,329
Their sword skills were
definitely beyond ordinary.

353
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,430
Making both large and small deals...

354
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,600
has made me the object of much resentment.

355
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,870
I will be careful, so please
do not worry too much.

356
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,809
Then please be careful.

357
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,279
You are important to me, Lady Hae.

358
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,150
If you would like to repay your debt,

359
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,190
just buy me a drink sometime.

360
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,059
I will buy you the best there is.

361
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,789
I look forward to it.

362
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,539
Here.

363
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,539
How beautiful he is.

364
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:25,749
I hear you have been going
to the King's quarters often.

365
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:27,920
To hear that the king favors you...

366
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:30,249
pleases me as well.

367
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,289
I know.

368
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,989
After he sent the princess
away from the palace,

369
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:36,829
he must have been very lonely.

370
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,600
He tells me many things.

371
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,769
He does?

372
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,630
Yes, he does.

373
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,400
I simply listen.

374
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,269
Have some. This is the fish
jerky that you so favor.

375
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,249
Stay away from foods that
are grilled, braised, dried,

376
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,049
or fishy.

377
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:04,749
Today, they smell a bit too fishy for me.

378
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,390
I will take my leave now.

379
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:12,200
I'll come again to play, my prince.

380
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:23,940
Did you say the herb store owner
visited Royal Consort Hyeon...

381
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,809
with a strange man in tow?

382
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,279
Yes.

383
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,690
That was some great food.

384
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:46,499
Clear the table.

385
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,840
Are you hard of hearing?

386
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,739
I came to learn swordsmanship,

387
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,380
not work as your servant.

388
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:00,509
What did you say?

389
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,620
Have you ever heard of a painter
painting on a lumpy canvas?

390
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,650
A lumpy painting?

391
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,719
What are you talking about?

392
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,759
Follow me.

393
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,479
Is it not spacious?

394
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,180
This is the cave where I spend my Dongangeo.

395
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,420
DONGANGEO: WHEN MONKS WITHDRAW
FROM THE WORLD AT YEAR'S END

396
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,890
So what are you telling me to
do while I am stuck in here?

397
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,160
You're going to become a clean, white canvas.

398
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,360
The toxins in your body,

399
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,130
the rotten energy in your mind,

400
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,989
work to cleanse it all away.

401
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,499
Swordsmanship will come after.

402
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,940
If you chew on a few of these...

403
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,509
when you get hungry, you
will not starve to death.

404
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:10,880
Feel free to run away now if
you do not feel up to the task.

405
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,460
Is he kidding me?

406
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,940
He is testing me even though
he is nothing but a crazy monk?

407
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,340
We shall see who wins.

408
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,519
We shall see.

409
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:07,375
Please make way!

410
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,215
Put it over there.

411
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:14,086
Why are they causing all this
fuss? What are they making?

412
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:15,716
Have you not heard of a stable?

413
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:18,556
The house for horses!

414
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:20,826
Of course I know what it is.

415
00:30:20,826 --> 00:30:23,795
Why are they making a stable
when we do not have any horses?

416
00:30:23,795 --> 00:30:26,626
The Princess went to buy horses.

417
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:29,396
She left earlier with Pung Gae.

418
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:31,465
They left me out?

419
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,465
Gosh, I do not like him.

420
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,366
Hey! Do it properly!

421
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:38,575
It must cost a lot.

422
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,745
With what money is she buying horses?

423
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:43,876
There must be a way she thought of
since she said she is capable of it.

424
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,016
- That is what I am saying.
- Of course.

425
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:51,486
Gosh.

426
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:55,586
If we head to the East Gate,
there is a horse market.

427
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,025
There must be some horses that
are put out on the market...

428
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:58,525
after being used as war horses.

429
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:01,196
Pick out the ones that look
sick and have lost their hairs.

430
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:03,395
What? The ones that have lost their hairs?

431
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:06,005
They must cost less than half
of what normal horses cost.

432
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:08,406
You get what you pay for.

433
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:09,975
Even though they were used as war horses,

434
00:31:09,975 --> 00:31:12,746
it would be a waste to buy sickly horses.

435
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,906
We do not need horses that
were only used for wagons.

436
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,376
Since they were war horses,

437
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:18,776
they will become useful if we
feed them well and tend to them.

438
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,486
See you later at the tavern.

439
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:35,026
Your Highness.

440
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:39,165
Your Highness, let us get inside.

441
00:31:55,785 --> 00:31:57,255
Thank you, Nanny.

442
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,626
My goodness.

443
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,225
You have gotten haggard.

444
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:08,065
I am fine.

445
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:11,195
Is the Crown Prince doing well?

446
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:13,135
Of course.

447
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:16,876
He is doing his best to
train with General Go.

448
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:19,505
- Master Go?
- Yes.

449
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:22,815
He has recently become
the Head of Bodyguards.

450
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:27,415
Let us go inside.

451
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:29,915
The King must be waiting for you.

452
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:05,985
Your undutiful daughter is
here to greet her father.

453
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:09,695
Why are you here?

454
00:33:10,295 --> 00:33:14,195
I have been working
together with the people...

455
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:16,966
to rebuild the Sunno Tribe.

456
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,605
I will raise an army and build their home...

457
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:25,035
so that they can be your support soon.

458
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:30,445
It will not take long. Please wait for us.

459
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:33,285
Get up.

460
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:40,956
Do not ask for trouble.

461
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:45,996
It is the task Mother left me.

462
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,936
Also, it is the path I must take
for you and the Crown Prince.

463
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:57,075
I will pull through.

464
00:33:58,776 --> 00:34:00,676
You take after...

465
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:03,146
your mother's sturdiness.

466
00:34:07,716 --> 00:34:11,686
By the way, why is General
Go training the Crown Prince?

467
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,755
He got on Gochuga's bad side...

468
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:18,125
and was about to be kicked out
to the border, so I took him in.

469
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:20,125
You should not keep him close.

470
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,735
In the end, he is the next
chief of the Gyeru Tribe.

471
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,865
He swore his loyalty to me,

472
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,506
but I do not fully trust him.

473
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:34,375
I will only use him when I need him.

474
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,415
How is On Hyeop's son?

475
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,956
He is giving his all to train himself.

476
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,055
I am sure he will make a huge contribution...

477
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:52,225
I am asking if he is nice
to you as your husband.

478
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:56,995
Yes, he is.

479
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:05,136
That is all I needed to hear.

480
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:10,245
Your mother did not have
luck with her husband,

481
00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:13,446
so at least you should.

482
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:35,966
Darn it.

483
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:52,886
I will wait for you, my
husband. I have faith in you.

484
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,725
Wait for me, my wife.

485
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:15,375
Thank you, Lady Hae.

486
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:19,076
I asked for it in a hurry, but I did
not know it would be done so fast.

487
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:22,446
I am glad that I could be of help.

488
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,115
Please do not hesitate to
ask me if you need anything.

489
00:36:26,326 --> 00:36:28,185
What happened to your wrist?

490
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,295
It is nothing.

491
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:33,596
I hurt it while cutting the herbs.

492
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:38,336
You heard about General Go, have you not?

493
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,566
Are you going to go back without seeing him?

494
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:46,076
If you want to see him, I can arrange it.

495
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:48,906
I do not need to, and I wish not to see him.

496
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,516
Or is there a message you
would like for me to relay?

497
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:52,946
Lady Hae.

498
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:57,156
- Do you perhaps...
- Pardon?

499
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:00,855
Do you perhaps have feelings for General Go?

500
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:05,555
Your Highness.

501
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:08,896
That does not make any sense.

502
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:14,406
Master Go is impeccable as a husband.

503
00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:17,475
If your feelings are
sincere, do not lose him.

504
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:21,346
Why did you turn down a man like him?

505
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:25,776
Because I have someone else in my heart.

506
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:34,985
JANGBAEK

507
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:48,035
Did anything suspicious happen?

508
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:52,006
Her plans are meticulous, so
you need to be on your toes.

509
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,646
- General Go.
- What is it?

510
00:37:55,745 --> 00:37:58,475
About an hour ago, the
Princess made her visit.

511
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:17,196
Should I go after her?

512
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:19,096
No.

513
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:21,435
I must see for myself.

514
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:47,495
- My goodness!
- That is ridiculous.

515
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:49,196
- Move!
- My gosh!

516
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:38,145
I will never give up.

517
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,125
They were raised as war horses,

518
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,926
so if we feed them well and tend to them,

519
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,525
I am sure they will come around.

520
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,125
They seem to be of good breeding.

521
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:59,395
My goodness! But they are so skinny!

522
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:02,436
Who would want to raise such poor horses?

523
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:04,635
Jin and San are the Gokturks.

524
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,475
They know everything about horses.

525
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:09,105
But that does not mean I
can make a miracle happen.

526
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:11,475
Did you pick them?

527
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:14,786
Do not worry. Pung Gae will help too.

528
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:21,686
Well, we need cavalry if
we are to raise an army.

529
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:23,556
I got some silver too.

530
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:24,696
What?

531
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:28,696
We will use that to buy
more horses for cavalry,

532
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:30,936
and we will get more steel for our weapons.

533
00:40:30,936 --> 00:40:32,436
Are you serious?

534
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:36,735
My goodness, Chief. It is like
you gained a thousand troops!

535
00:40:39,706 --> 00:40:42,505
Hey, Ga Jin.

536
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,216
- Are they decent horses?
- Of course.

537
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,716
Where did Dal go?

538
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:55,485
- Why do you ask?
- I am worried...

539
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,125
about your mother-in-law.

540
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:02,666
Mother.

541
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,566
Mother.

542
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:16,245
Mother.

543
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:20,145
Mother...

544
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:27,125
Mother. Mother.

545
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:30,696
Hey, you are back.

546
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,066
Mother, are you okay?

547
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:40,005
The house is a mess, is it
not? I could not clean up.

548
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,806
I got tired.

549
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,206
Are you sure you are not sick?

550
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:46,975
An old woman such as myself aches all over.

551
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:50,245
Gosh, by the way,

552
00:41:51,546 --> 00:41:52,875
where is Dal?

553
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,956
Dal could not come with me.

554
00:41:57,316 --> 00:41:58,816
He had some things to do.

555
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:05,556
- Mother...
- Okay.

556
00:42:08,895 --> 00:42:10,495
You can go.

557
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:48,905
I do not want Dal...

558
00:42:49,706 --> 00:42:52,735
to follow in my bloody footsteps.

559
00:42:53,576 --> 00:42:57,416
My father was the greatest
fighter in Goguryeo.

560
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,076
What am I?

561
00:42:59,216 --> 00:43:02,485
I just plow fields and gather herbs.

562
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,286
What would Father say if
he were to see me now?

563
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:10,696
You turned me into an
ignorant country bumpkin.

564
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:16,296
Mother. We brought in extra firewood.

565
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:17,895
And the water jar is full too.

566
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,235
Water, vegetable garden, laundry,
and bush stems. I got it.

567
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:23,206
She is my wife.

568
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:36,346
It has been long since I had
a drink with my father-in-law,

569
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:37,916
so please feel free to drink.

570
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:42,625
According to what I heard,

571
00:43:43,696 --> 00:43:46,155
it seems that you are not on good
terms with Gochuga these days.

572
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,336
I knew...

573
00:43:55,605 --> 00:44:00,475
you did not summon me to have
drinks with me at leisure.

574
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,645
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

575
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:11,485
The high-spirited and loyal
vassals and scholars...

576
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:15,056
are writing up an appeal in secret.

577
00:44:15,056 --> 00:44:16,255
An appeal?

578
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:19,326
For what?

579
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:21,796
They are asking to
reinstate the Sunno Tribe...

580
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,765
and recover their position
on the Five Tribe council.

581
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:30,735
I am putting together the young vassals.

582
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:34,546
It has been eight years since
we lost our honor to Gochuga.

583
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:37,346
It is time to bring back the Sunno Tribe...

584
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:38,775
on the Five Tribe council.

585
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:40,816
- Let us go inside.
- Yes, my lord.

586
00:44:40,816 --> 00:44:44,755
It is obvious that Gochuga
will dismiss the appeal.

587
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:48,225
I am sure Lord Hae of the
Sono Tribe will take his side.

588
00:44:48,225 --> 00:44:49,456
Therefore,

589
00:44:51,395 --> 00:44:53,326
we need your help, Lord Jin.

590
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:58,995
I am not sure if the Gyeru
Tribe will obediently withdraw.

591
00:45:00,635 --> 00:45:02,765
A father-in-law oughts to...

592
00:45:03,505 --> 00:45:05,336
side with his son-in-law.

593
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,176
Go Won Pyo's world...

594
00:45:08,676 --> 00:45:10,846
will come to an end soon.

595
00:45:31,836 --> 00:45:34,666
If you have too much on your mind,
it is hard to hit the target.

596
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,176
Today must be your lucky day.

597
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,375
You are hitting the target,

598
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:43,046
and you will be tipped off by your son.

599
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:47,615
Last night, Lord Jin of the Gwanno Tribe...

600
00:45:47,615 --> 00:45:49,916
was seen leaving the
King's chambers all drunk.

601
00:45:50,286 --> 00:45:53,586
It seems Daedaero Kim
Pyeong Ji was also invited.

602
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,686
The time has come.

603
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:02,495
It is time to use the
blacklist I have been keeping.

604
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:11,076
So who do you think will make it out alive?

605
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:18,275
An appeal? What kind of
nonsense are you talking about?

606
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,586
Keep your voice down!

607
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,056
Only the King and Daedaero know of this.

608
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:27,985
Then did you promise the King...

609
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,395
that you will turn away from
Gochuga and join hands with him?

610
00:46:31,395 --> 00:46:33,826
It is not much of a promise.

611
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:35,966
I told them I got their intentions.

612
00:46:35,966 --> 00:46:38,936
If you think about it, because
Gochuga behaved audaciously,

613
00:46:38,936 --> 00:46:41,966
our tribe has always been neglected.

614
00:46:42,206 --> 00:46:46,405
On top of that, the King
seemed really firm about this.

615
00:46:46,405 --> 00:46:48,846
This is utterly unreasonable!

616
00:46:49,745 --> 00:46:51,076
Your Highness.

617
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:56,145
Gochuga is merely hiding his claws for now.

618
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:59,155
He is going to tear apart
the prey he lays his eyes on.

619
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:03,385
And yet, you are trying
to walk into his claws?

620
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:09,026
Is he really waiting for the right timing?

621
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,665
Do not act like you heard...

622
00:47:10,766 --> 00:47:13,165
or know anything about the appeal.

623
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:16,405
Do not attend any meetings
Daedaero invites you to.

624
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:18,506
Not only our family...

625
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:20,705
but also the prince will
face severe punishment.

626
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:35,826
I have something I need
to urgently inform you.

627
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:40,425
His Majesty met with my father in private...

628
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:44,895
and told him that the Sunno
Tribe will soon be reinstated.

629
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:50,935
What a good daughter you are.

630
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,175
Pardon?

631
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:56,705
The words you just said to
me saved your father's life.

632
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,576
If you had deliberately kept quiet,

633
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:02,685
it would have cost you your life.

634
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:22,965
There will be no revenge.

635
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:29,875
My name is On Dal, the future
general of this country.

636
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:35,385
We need to change the world,

637
00:48:36,586 --> 00:48:40,355
so that the people can live life
to the fullest, without fear.

638
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:48,865
That is the country we must
build, the new Goguryeo.

639
00:49:50,395 --> 00:49:51,796
You wicked witch!

640
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:55,165
The royal custom is to be strictly observed.

641
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:57,195
How dare you get up to this immoral mischief?

642
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,405
I can explain, Your Highness.

643
00:50:00,405 --> 00:50:01,905
Shut it.

644
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:07,306
You were holding a superstitious
ritual at this sacred palace?

645
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:12,476
Since you obviously have the nerve, tell me.

646
00:50:12,746 --> 00:50:14,486
What did you pray for?

647
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:16,516
Did you pray that you would
give birth to a child...

648
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:19,556
and bring down the Crown Prince and my son?

649
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:21,885
Absolutely not, Your Highness.

650
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:26,125
I only prayed that I would be
blessed with the King's grace.

651
00:50:27,326 --> 00:50:28,465
The King's grace?

652
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:33,705
Then you shall be blessed
with my grace as well.

653
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,006
It hurts.

654
00:50:40,006 --> 00:50:41,806
- Be quiet!
- Stop!

655
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:43,875
Please do not hit me.

656
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:52,715
My Queen, what is going on here?

657
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:55,226
I was punishing Royal Consort Hyeon...

658
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,226
for being blinded by superstition...

659
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,496
and disturbing the order in the palace.

660
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:03,266
It hurts so much.

661
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:05,695
I gave her my permission.

662
00:51:06,665 --> 00:51:09,365
I did because she was
desperate to become pregnant.

663
00:51:09,506 --> 00:51:11,336
So leave her alone.

664
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:16,076
Still, this matter is in the hands of women.

665
00:51:16,675 --> 00:51:18,375
I ask you to stay out of it.

666
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,675
What did you say?

667
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:24,286
Do you dare to tell me
what is right and wrong?

668
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:31,326
Your Majesty, there is a problem.

669
00:51:38,935 --> 00:51:40,665
Are you on your way to the meeting?

670
00:51:47,846 --> 00:51:49,145
I advise you not to.

671
00:51:50,246 --> 00:51:52,776
What? What are you talking about?

672
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,115
I assume you are going to discuss
the appeal with the scholars.

673
00:51:57,855 --> 00:51:59,256
How did you know that?

674
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,586
You should not go there.

675
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:07,165
My father has dispatched soldiers there.

676
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,365
Get them!

677
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,375
- No!
- Take him.

678
00:52:19,675 --> 00:52:20,976
Come!

679
00:52:32,685 --> 00:52:34,756
What on earth is going on?

680
00:52:43,965 --> 00:52:46,496
Seven were arrested and locked up.

681
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:50,675
Not enough blood has been
shed to quench my thirst.

682
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:56,175
There are two people left to kill.

683
00:52:57,276 --> 00:52:59,175
The king's daughter...

684
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:01,915
And On Hyeop's son.

685
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:06,056
I will take care of it with
the most agile soldiers.

686
00:53:07,586 --> 00:53:09,655
It is best if Geon does not know.

687
00:53:11,695 --> 00:53:14,226
Let him hear the news of the
princess's death afterward.

688
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:16,226
Yes.

689
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:33,445
What are you thinking about?

690
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,756
I did not know you were coming.

691
00:53:38,986 --> 00:53:41,385
You were obviously too busy to invite me,

692
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,026
so I invited myself.

693
00:53:43,026 --> 00:53:46,026
A lot happened both inside
and outside the palace today.

694
00:53:46,026 --> 00:53:49,125
So I am hoping to drink here quietly.

695
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,195
What happened at the palace?

696
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:52,365
Well...

697
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:55,566
The queen stopped a ritual
halfway through or something.

698
00:53:56,905 --> 00:53:59,175
But enough of that.

699
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:00,776
Bring me food and drinks.

700
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:02,846
You should come back another time.

701
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,915
I will prepare a feast for you.

702
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:08,385
What are you so busy with?

703
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:09,915
That is not it.

704
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:12,155
Did you successfully deal
with the princess's matter?

705
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,756
I saw her visit you urgently.

706
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:19,526
Were you spying on me?

707
00:54:21,066 --> 00:54:24,635
You seemed to be hiding many secrets from me.

708
00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:29,905
Will you have a drink with
me and tell me about it?

709
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:53,425
Dal.

710
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:01,806
You look a mess.

711
00:55:02,635 --> 00:55:03,976
Are you okay?

712
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,836
When...

713
00:55:10,715 --> 00:55:12,346
How did you get here?

714
00:55:12,915 --> 00:55:16,246
I am sorry. I put you through so much.

715
00:55:16,415 --> 00:55:18,715
I need to get rid of the
poison inside me first.

716
00:55:20,615 --> 00:55:23,556
Only then can I start
learning true martial arts.

717
00:55:23,685 --> 00:55:25,455
You have done enough.

718
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,096
This is enough. Follow me back home.

719
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,425
Your mother is waiting.

720
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:33,766
What is it?

721
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:36,236
The Ga Jin I know...

722
00:55:37,506 --> 00:55:39,976
never tells me to give up.

723
00:55:40,205 --> 00:55:41,405
That means...

724
00:55:42,776 --> 00:55:44,215
you are fake.

725
00:55:47,685 --> 00:55:50,145
You are just an illusion that I created.

726
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:06,855
What an extraordinary guy.

727
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,066
I thought it would take
you at least a full month.

728
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:11,596
Look at this guy.

729
00:57:13,066 --> 00:57:16,506
I miss Ga Jin.

730
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:21,346
I will go see her, and come
back to learn from you,

731
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,276
Master.

732
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:35,625
All right.

733
00:57:39,425 --> 00:57:41,326
Eat this.

734
00:57:58,415 --> 00:57:59,576
Here.

735
00:58:13,395 --> 00:58:14,695
Mother.

736
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:20,766
Mother?

737
00:58:42,155 --> 00:58:44,296
By the way, where is Dal?

738
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:46,955
Dal could not come with me.

739
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:48,865
He had some things to do.

740
00:58:53,865 --> 00:58:55,165
Mother.

741
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:36,346
Mother.

742
00:59:39,546 --> 00:59:40,816
Mother.

743
00:59:45,455 --> 00:59:48,226
Mother, where are you going?

744
00:59:49,685 --> 00:59:50,996
Princess.

745
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:57,425
I have fulfilled my duties as
a mother to my young master.

746
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:00,036
Now I must go.

747
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:04,736
He has an innocent soul.

748
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:10,445
Please look after him.

749
01:00:11,476 --> 01:00:13,175
You cannot do this.

750
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:15,986
If you leave like this,

751
01:00:16,786 --> 01:00:18,955
what will Dal and I do?

752
01:00:23,226 --> 01:00:25,326
I lost my mother when I was very young.

753
01:00:26,796 --> 01:00:29,296
I did not know what a
mother's love felt like.

754
01:00:31,036 --> 01:00:32,536
Only now...

755
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:36,105
Only now was I happy to have found a mother.

756
01:00:37,236 --> 01:00:39,435
Why are you abandoning me now?

757
01:00:48,415 --> 01:00:49,945
Princess.

758
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:52,655
No.

759
01:00:54,756 --> 01:00:56,655
I am your daughter.

760
01:00:58,056 --> 01:00:59,195
Please.

761
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:03,726
Please, do not leave.

762
01:01:21,546 --> 01:01:25,155
- Mother?
- Run away. Hurry.

763
01:01:26,185 --> 01:01:27,455
Hurry!

764
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:32,895
Listen to your mother. Go.

765
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:45,306
My child.

766
01:01:46,076 --> 01:01:48,705
Hurry and run away. Hurry.

767
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:52,276
If you wish to save the old woman,

768
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,415
do not resist my blade.

769
01:01:59,056 --> 01:02:00,115
Go.

770
01:02:11,365 --> 01:02:12,465
My child.

771
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,276
My child.

772
01:02:53,076 --> 01:02:54,276
Dal.

773
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:46,695
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

774
01:03:46,895 --> 01:03:48,566
<i>It is not your fault.</i>

775
01:03:48,566 --> 01:03:50,796
<i>They were people sent by
Go Won Pyo to kill us.</i>

776
01:03:50,796 --> 01:03:53,096
<i>You speak like a killer.</i>

777
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:54,766
<i>Do I not look pathetic to you?</i>

778
01:03:54,766 --> 01:03:57,066
<i>My lady, do you love me?</i>

779
01:03:57,306 --> 01:04:00,375
<i>Do you not want to know
who stole that gravestone?</i>

780
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:03,445
<i>The person you must risk
your life to protect,</i>

781
01:04:03,846 --> 01:04:06,746
<i>that is the reason a man takes up the sword.</i>

782
01:04:06,746 --> 01:04:08,885
<i>I will protect my woman.</i>

783
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,856
<i>Go and attack. Attack
and seize what is yours.</i>

784
01:04:11,856 --> 01:04:15,155
<i>Whether or not you follow,
the traitors will be punished.</i>

785
01:04:16,356 --> 01:04:17,956
<i>Father, Father!</i>

786
01:04:17,956 --> 01:04:19,255
<i>I deceived you.</i>

787
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:22,425
<i>I stole away your heart
and your life to use you.</i>

788
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,226
<i>I knew that and went along with
you anyway, so I was not deceived.</i>

789
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:27,195
<i>- I am not worth all this.
- You are the fate I have chosen.</i>

790
01:04:27,436 --> 01:04:30,405
<i>My wife, my one and only.</i>
