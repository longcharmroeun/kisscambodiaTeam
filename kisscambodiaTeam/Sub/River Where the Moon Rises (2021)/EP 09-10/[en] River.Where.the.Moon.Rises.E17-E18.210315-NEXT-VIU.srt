1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,330
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,271
(Characters, incidents, and dates do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,001
I would like to speak.

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,440
It is about the Princess' marriage.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,781
You will never get your own way.

6
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:19,841
I am offering a chance.

7
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:23,850
A chance for you and your offspring to save your lives.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,621
They are looking for the King's son-in-law.

9
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,821
The Princess will marry.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,121
I will always be on your side no matter what.

11
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,291
I cannot accept your feelings.

12
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,930
I must have her...

13
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:37,100
even if that means I have to use force.

14
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:49,341
(Episode 9)

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,441
What is that sound?

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,450
They are officially announcing the royal wedding.

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,710
They are calling the candidates into the palace.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,191
Princess.

19
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,021
Come here quick.

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,120
Look at this. Are they not pretty?

21
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:09,391
What is all this?

22
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:11,201
What do you think they are?

23
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:13,001
We need to make a dress for your wedding.

24
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:14,400
Not just a wedding dress.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,240
From head to toe, you will need so many ornaments.

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,840
They have not yet selected her husband-to-be.

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,240
- Why would you already... - How dare you to interrupt?

28
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:28,551
I will not marry.

29
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:31,751
Stop being so childish.

30
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:33,721
The King gave the command,

31
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,490
and the Five Tribe council decided on it.

32
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:39,391
Do you not know this is a joy for the palace as well as the people?

33
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,730
The wedding where the bride is bartered...

34
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,161
is not a joyous occasion.

35
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:48,801
Princess.

36
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,100
How dare she?

37
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,971
She has such an odd temperament.

38
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,111
What now?

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,781
Where could she go other than to see her father?

40
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:05,551
Princess.

41
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,530
Many young men of noble birth...

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,400
have applied to be your husband.

43
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,571
The King is greatly blessed.

44
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,740
That means your influence is even greater.

45
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,851
The influence that made this preposterous marriage...

46
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:35,551
a possibility.

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,351
You have everything in the world.

48
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,750
What more do you want?

49
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,220
Tying me down with marriage...

50
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,391
will not benefit you at all.

51
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:50,301
This is not for me.

52
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:53,460
The marriage is for you, Princess.

53
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,481
If you keep lashing out with stupidity and bravado,

54
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,111
you might...

55
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:11,120
follow in your mother's footsteps, and we cannot have that.

56
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,660
If your mother had acted appropriately for her status,

57
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,060
she would not have died the way she did.

58
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,190
Shut your mouth.

59
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,370
How dare you mention my mother?

60
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,870
We do not need any more...

61
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,271
misfortune in the royal family.

62
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:36,011
The King saw my intentions...

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,710
and allowed your marriage.

64
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,780
A man crazed by jealousy...

65
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,150
killed his own wife and people.

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,391
Does he deserve to sit up here?

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Father.

68
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,800
Did Go Won Pyo threaten you...

69
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,300
into agreeing to my marriage?

70
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:43,241
Do you fear his weapons that much?

71
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,540
Why?

72
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,980
You are King.

73
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:53,951
I had a dream every night.

74
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:59,491
A dream in which you and your mother die.

75
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:06,001
A nightmare in which my people are slaughtered.

76
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:10,331
I committed those dreadful deeds myself.

77
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,501
How can I avoid punishment?

78
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,311
When you returned to the palace,

79
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,220
I was afraid.

80
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:30,821
It felt as if my past wrongdoings had come back to life.

81
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,660
And I was also pleased.

82
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,501
Your mother...

83
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,001
had given me a chance to atone.

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,470
If they had known how you felt,

85
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:53,480
the Sunno Tribe migrants would also rejoice.

86
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,980
However...

87
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:59,050
Before being the King,

88
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,720
I am but a powerless father.

89
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,191
I wanted to...

90
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,131
do whatever I could to protect you and the Crown Prince.

91
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
So...

92
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,600
is that what happened?

93
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:17,840
Did Go Won Pyo...

94
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,371
threaten you with our lives?

95
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,951
I am sorry.

96
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,650
I did all that I could,

97
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:39,561
and yet I could not prevent your marriage.

98
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,470
Princess.

99
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,741
Will you forgive me?

100
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:57,071
Father.

101
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,071
The herb gatherer is gone,

102
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,900
and a young noble is here.

103
00:07:58,501 --> 00:07:59,741
Your clothes...

104
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,241
did more than just change your looks.

105
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,350
Mok Tae Seon, a silk merchant from Jami Province.

106
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,951
I just have to say I am his son?

107
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,590
Creating a fake identity is not all.

108
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:21,460
You will be questioned to see if you studied all the classics.

109
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:23,491
When given a theme,

110
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:24,931
you must also write a poem.

111
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:28,831
I do not need to do that.

112
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:31,001
Do you truly think that is possible?

113
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,641
Even if you apply as a candidate,

114
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:39,540
General Go will end up marrying the Princess.

115
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,450
That will not happen.

116
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,820
I cannot let Ga Jin be forced into a marriage.

117
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,060
We feel the same.

118
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,461
You are in love?

119
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,001
Fate.

120
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,200
She and I are destined to be together.

121
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:09,440
So I cannot let her marry.

122
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,141
I will do whatever it takes.

123
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:28,560
They turned us into traitors so they could get rid of us.

124
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,700
I was a fool.

125
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,601
I underestimated Go Won Pyo.

126
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,841
For Father.

127
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:43,871
And for Ga Jin.

128
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,310
Go Won Pyo.

129
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,751
I will kill you and die myself.

130
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,420
Read the theme for the poem in the envelope.

131
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:41,670
I heard that General Go did not apply.

132
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:44,040
Does that mean we have a chance?

133
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,001
You are such a fool. Do you think your father or mine...

134
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,540
sent us with hopes to become the King's in-law?

135
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,580
It is what the Five Tribe council commanded.

136
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,580
What do you mean by that?

137
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,680
They will fail all of us and when they think there is no one worthy,

138
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,991
they will recommend General Go as if there is no substitute.

139
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,491
If his eldest son were to enter the selection process,

140
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,920
how would Gochuga manage to judge fairly?

141
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:09,790
Darn it. I am here to stand in the background, then.

142
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:13,731
Let us go and get drunk with some girls after this.

143
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,271
Next.

144
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,351
Here she is.

145
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,991
I am here at your command.

146
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,420
Welcome.

147
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,790
I called her because...

148
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,131
she deals in herbs and also rare accessories.

149
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:48,871
Hey. It was my idea to call her.

150
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,540
Do you feel better?

151
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,121
Both the Princess and Crown Prince act as they wish.

152
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,920
No one knows how stressful that is for me.

153
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:11,221
I just hope my son has an uneventful future.

154
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:14,330
I heard a talented fortune-teller has set up shop in the city.

155
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,930
Shall I ask for you?

156
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:20,930
Fortune-telling? I have so many questions too.

157
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,731
Where is he?

158
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,991
I brought some accessories that will suit you.

159
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,560
- Pick a few later. - No, thank you.

160
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,761
I will say this because I agreed to not keep secrets.

161
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:54,060
I was unable to do as you asked.

162
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:59,741
That young man. On Dal.

163
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:04,680
The more I get to know him, the more intriguing he becomes.

164
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:06,241
What about Dal?

165
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,011
He will be in the palace about now.

166
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:15,920
Next.

167
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:23,861
Oh!

168
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,160
You look handsome and manly.

169
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:30,771
- Take a seat. - Thank you.

170
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:33,170
Let me see.

171
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:36,070
Your family does not live within the Capital.

172
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,440
You are from Jami Province.

173
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:42,511
- That is so. - Your father is Mok Tae Seon.

174
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,920
Mok Tae Seon? I have heard that name.

175
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:50,450
Is he not a merchant who sells silk...

176
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,961
and cotton goods?

177
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,221
What?

178
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,001
We are here to select the King's son-in-law...

179
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,731
and a merchant's son applied?

180
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,400
Do not say more than you need.

181
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,670
A theme for a poem is in the envelope. Write something.

182
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,910
I will do that.

183
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:17,920
Lord Hae, it is such a pity.

184
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,481
Do you not think so?

185
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,961
A merchant's son applied. That looks bad on us.

186
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:43,711
Stop.

187
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,491
- What is it? - He hid his identity...

188
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:03,891
to sneak into the palace.

189
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:07,530
He hid his identity?

190
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,800
Then is he not Mok Tae Seon's son?

191
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,101
That is true.

192
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:17,981
Oh, dear...

193
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:21,851
Then who are you?

194
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:30,221
Dal.

195
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,430
- "Dal"? - "Dal"?

196
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:55,431

197
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:13,761
I heard something disgraceful happened...

198
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,670
during the selection process.

199
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,771
What was that?

200
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,410
Tell me immediately.

201
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,981
I wished to protect my husband.

202
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,121
- What? - "Husband"?

203
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:40,560
What did you say? "Husband"?

204
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,530
This man here is my husband.

205
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,871
What? Her husband?

206
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,731
- They are married? - This is unbelievable.

207
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,741
How could this be?

208
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:02,150
The Princess is married?

209
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:06,151
It is too early to be dreaming.

210
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,721
I am not making this up.

211
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:10,620
A eunuch rushing from the hall told me.

212
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:13,961
The Princess appeared with a young man at her side...

213
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:16,661
and announced they are already married.

214
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,901
That is nonsense.

215
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:20,100
Then go to the hall yourself.

216
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,300
It was turned upside-down.

217
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,771
What...

218
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:36,211
This is not your fortune.

219
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,481
Whose fate is it you wish to learn of?

220
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:41,921
You really are as good as rumours say.

221
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,390
You have such great skill,

222
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:47,021
so what did you do before you came to the Capital?

223
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,691
She is leaving.

224
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:51,030
I would like to hear my fortune before I am thrown out.

225
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:54,870
Did you see that person's future?

226
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,001
Corpses are stacked as high as mountains,

227
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,880
and blood flows like a river.

228
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,481
Starved wild dogs gather from all around,

229
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,550
and there is nowhere to flee.

230
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:15,021
This karma can only be atoned for with death.

231
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,151
What a pity.

232
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,491
A fate that is unavoidable.

233
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,290
A fate that is cursed.

234
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,161
When I had lost my memory and was wandering,

235
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,231
he showed me the way...

236
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:30,600
and allowed me to rely on him.

237
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:34,201
His unchanging heart...

238
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,711
is what moved me.

239
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,411
You asked me to release a young man from prison.

240
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:45,050
You said he had saved your life many times.

241
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,350
Was that this man?

242
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,290
Yes.

243
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,431
At the time, you clearly said he was a friend.

244
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:59,501
And yet now you say he is your husband.

245
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,070
Are you insulting me?

246
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,600
Father. It is not like that.

247
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:05,800
Shut your mouth.

248
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,441
Please calm down.

249
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:13,110
I believe the Princess is scheming to avoid her marriage.

250
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,981
Yes.

251
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,481
You are already married?

252
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:22,350
That is very hard to believe, Your Highness.

253
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:28,890
How else do we say what has been done?

254
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:32,100
- What? - How dare you?

255
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,461
I am...

256
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,701
the Princess' husband.

257
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:41,911
You are out of your mind!

258
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:43,870
How dare you raise your voice here?

259
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,241
You sneaked into the palace under an assumed identity!

260
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,981
That is very true.

261
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,221
We cannot accept a man of unclear identity...

262
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:54,620
and status as the Princess' spouse.

263
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,991
Your Majesty.

264
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:58,120
- Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.

265
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:05,100
What is your name?

266
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,011
My father was Daemodal...

267
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,310
and a Widudehyeong.

268
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,550
(Widudehyeong: A 5th Grade rank)

269
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,481
I am the son of General On Hyeop, the 17th chief of the Sunno Tribe,

270
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,221
My name is On Dal.

271
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:29,991
On Hyeop's son?

272
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,991
What?

273
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:42,671
Long time no see, Hyeop.

274
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,540
If you admit that you are a traitor,

275
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,040
I will spare the lives of everyone else.

276
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
My goodness.

277
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:10,761
You are actually the son of On Hyeop?

278
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:12,931
That is true.

279
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:15,501
Yes.

280
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,501
I remember that gaze.

281
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:21,070
You take after your father.

282
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,971
On Hyeop...

283
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:27,441
was beheaded for committing treason.

284
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,350
The reason his family...

285
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,451
and the remaining people of the tribe...

286
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:35,221
were allowed to live was by the King's grace.

287
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,921
He forgot about all that...

288
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:40,360
and entered the palace, causing this fuss.

289
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:43,790
He must be severely punished!

290
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,130
That is correct.

291
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:48,070
Please punish him severely.

292
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,431
Punish him?

293
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:51,070
They may have married in secret,

294
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,001
but he is the Princess' husband.

295
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,540
Must he be dealt a severe penalty?

296
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:59,681
Your Majesty. You must not do anything to harm your authority.

297
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:02,911
Having a royal marry someone from that bloodline...

298
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:05,820
already harms the royal household's authority!

299
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:07,421
Your Majesty.

300
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,790
- Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.

301
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,120
Silence!

302
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:32,741
Your Majesty.

303
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:33,981
Your Majesty.

304
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,580
- My goodness. - What is happening?

305
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:40,080
You did nothing but cause trouble since you returned,

306
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,691
and you ended up bringing disgrace on your father.

307
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:44,890
- Father. - Shut your mouth!

308
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,590
You are no longer my daughter.

309
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,261
Leave the palace immediately.

310
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,300
I will accept any punishment. The Princess...

311
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,800
Did you not hear me?

312
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,171
I no longer have a daughter.

313
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,840
The next time I see you,

314
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:12,221
I will behead you both on the spot.

315
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,401
Are you all right?

316
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,050
My lady.

317
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:54,350
The Princess was ordered to leave the palace.

318
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:56,221
She must leave?

319
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:18,540
I am sorry, Nanny.

320
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,610
I am leaving after causing you much distress.

321
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,280
You are not married.

322
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:29,850
Tell the King that you lied. Please?

323
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:32,661
Do you not believe it either?

324
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,060
I cared for you even before you could murmur.

325
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,931
Do you think I do not see through you?

326
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:47,300
I would rather leave the palace with you.

327
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,241
I will look after you and...

328
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:52,580
No. You must protect my brother Won.

329
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,251
You are the only person I can entrust...

330
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,151
his safety.

331
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,850
Oh, dear...

332
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,751
Are you the man my sister married?

333
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,850
Oh, the Crown Prince?

334
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:41,421
Crown Prince.

335
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,330
Are you really leaving?

336
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:46,100
Leaving me on my own?

337
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,501
Father is so furious.

338
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,671
I have no choice.

339
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,271
You must beg.

340
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:54,171
Ask him to forgive you.

341
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,810
Beg to let him allow you to stay.

342
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,780
If you leave again,

343
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,610
what do I do alone?

344
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,880
You might never be able to return this time.

345
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,751
I will return.

346
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:15,630
For you and  Father, I will come back.

347
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,001
You and Father both. I hate you.

348
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,630
I hate you all.

349
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:26,671
Do not say that.

350
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,171
Father is trying to save my life.

351
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,481
This is the only way I can avoid the royal wedding.

352
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:41,481
Father gave the order but he is crying inside.

353
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,491
The Princess came to say goodbye.

354
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,860
Are you out of your mind?

355
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:55,171
There is no princess in this family.

356
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:03,211
You must leave without seeing your father.

357
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,741
Father.

358
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,981
Do you hear me?

359
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,820
I am leaving the palace.

360
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,620
I wish more than anything to remain here with you,

361
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,860
but accepting your command is also my filial duty.

362
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:26,401
So I shall leave.

363
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Until now,

364
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,140
I did nothing but cause you concern.

365
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,411
Please forgive me.

366
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,221
Do not worry!

367
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,491
I will protect the Princess.

368
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:19,941
You have made a very difficult decision.

369
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:22,281
Since the Princess has left,

370
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,480
the palace will finally find peace.

371
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,491
Are you happy about that?

372
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,531
Of course not.

373
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:39,360
I only wish for peace and safety in the palace.

374
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,201
If you have any regrets,

375
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:46,601
you can always tell the Princess to come back.

376
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,621
How could he kick you out like this when you are a princess?

377
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,561
He is so mean. He did not even see you out.

378
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:11,561
Dal.

379
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,130
I need to stop by somewhere.

380
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,931
Where?

381
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:19,640
I will be right back, so you should go ahead first and wait there.

382
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,041
Let us meet at the entrance of Mungyeongsaejae.

383
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,270
You are going alone? Let me tag along.

384
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,580
Do not worry.

385
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,481
From now on, we will always be together.

386
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:35,121
Make sure to come back fast!

387
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:43,830
I was surprised when I heard that you are already married.

388
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,901
And you had to be kicked out of the palace all of a sudden.

389
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,871
I do not know how to console you.

390
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:51,300
You need not say anything.

391
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:53,770
I am here to ask for your help.

392
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:57,981
It is a waste to take you as my enemy,

393
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,651
but I cannot fully trust you to have you on my side.

394
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,981
But you came to see me nonetheless.

395
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:06,951
That must mean that you want to put trust in me.

396
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:09,921
I also wanted to know why you helped me.

397
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,190
I know you are good at figures, and you have nothing to gain from this.

398
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:19,130
Do you remember what I have told you?

399
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,500
I...

400
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:25,641
abhor Go Won Pyo.

401
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,341
I may not resent him as much as you do,

402
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,781
but I want to protect...

403
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,111
the tribe my father has been keeping, the Sono Tribe,

404
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:37,950
even though I am his step-daughter.

405
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,450
Then you should help me.

406
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:46,361
Let us stop the Gyeru Tribe from abusing their power,

407
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,331
and together we will bring Go Won Pyo down.

408
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,500
I thought you would be grief stricken,

409
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,670
but I guess I do not know you enough.

410
00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,970
Will you be on my side?

411
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:05,040
There is something I want to ask.

412
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,051
If you wish to proceed with your plan,

413
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,051
what will you do with General Go?

414
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:19,190
What if the two families of the Go's...

415
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:21,730
shed blood?

416
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:23,630
I trust Master Go.

417
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:27,670
He is different from his father.

418
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,591
I thought I would catch up with you at the hill if I hurried.

419
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,391
But what are you doing here? Where is the Princess?

420
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,431
- She left first. - Is that so?

421
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:00,831
Then you must have been waiting for me.

422
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,371
There is nothing I want to talk about with you.

423
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,700
That is a shame.

424
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,910
But my sword has a lot to ask you.

425
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:25,660
I will keep you updated regarding the King and the Crown Prince.

426
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,560
I will secretly help with your plan,

427
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,730
so entrust it with me.

428
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,160
I appreciate it.

429
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,201
I feel like I have finally found a friend in the Capital.

430
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,470
I am flattered, Your Highness.

431
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,521
If you go back to the King and tell him the truth,

432
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,220
I will spare your life.

433
00:33:54,691 --> 00:33:58,620
But if you keep pretending to be the Princess' husband,

434
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,391
I will end your life here.

435
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,990
I pity you.

436
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:07,331
You do not want to admit that you lost Ga Jin.

437
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,271
That must be why you want to behead me.

438
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:10,701
Shut your mouth.

439
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:12,870
Go ahead and kill me.

440
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,670
Even if I die,

441
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:18,910
I will never give Ga Jin to you.

442
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,980
All right then.

443
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:41,730
I cannot waste my sword to kill someone as lowly as you.

444
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,071
I will end your life with my trick instead.

445
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,110
I think I have started to like you.

446
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,761
Get up.

447
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,271
How dare you...

448
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,040
come at a general of Goguryeo...

449
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,810
with the skills you gained from collecting herbs and hunting?

450
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,490
Do not act up and come at me.

451
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,331
All right then. I will end your life here.

452
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:33,040
- Get this! - Stop it!

453
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,321
Stop it, Dal.

454
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,160
There is something I need to talk about with Master Go.

455
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:02,110
Do not dare to run away!

456
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,610
It is over, Master Go.

457
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,680
The royal wedding and the arranged marriage...

458
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:09,081
are all over.

459
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:12,951
- Let us go. - What do you mean it is over?

460
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:18,591
What do you mean it is over?

461
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,961
Did you ever give me a chance to start?

462
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:29,970
It has been eight years.

463
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:35,211
No, it has been longer than that.

464
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,881
I have been longing and...

465
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
waiting for you.

466
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:45,981
I have missed you a lot.

467
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,690
But why did you...

468
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,190
tell me to give up before I even had a chance?

469
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,060
Why? Why did you?

470
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,471
It is not something we started.

471
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,371
Our fates have been twisted for so long...

472
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:10,511
that neither of us can untangle them.

473
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,680
I will untangle them.

474
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:19,320
I will remove anything that comes between us!

475
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,950
- So please... - Master Go!

476
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,290
It is all over now.

477
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,160
I need to leave now.

478
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:46,440
I am sorry, Master Go.

479
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,281
The Princess of Goguryeo, Princess Pyeonggang,

480
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:21,141
was kicked out because she incited the wrath of the King.

481
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,281
Since the arranged marriage came to a fail,

482
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:28,550
I will write to you again once I find out what Go Won Pyo...

483
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:31,460
cooks up for a scheme.

484
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:47,670
General Go!

485
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:52,741
General Go! What happened?

486
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:54,511
Bring me some medicines.

487
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,820
I cannot go back to the palace in this state.

488
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:01,721
General Go!

489
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:20,971
What will you tell the people of Ghost Valley?

490
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,971
Do not worry.

491
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,881
I will tell them that this all happened...

492
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,710
because of the royal wedding, and that our marriage is not true.

493
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:32,251
What if they find out?

494
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:34,021
What?

495
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:35,950
People from the Castle...

496
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,660
might come and spy on us to see if we are a married couple.

497
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,330
What will you do if they find out we are not a real couple?

498
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,460
Hey, then we can pretend to be living...

499
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,930
Should we live together?

500
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:52,101
This is about us, not anyone else.

501
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,501
I know.

502
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,271
I am your husband, and you are my wife.

503
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,940
What is he saying?

504
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:04,511
- Ga Jin. - What?

505
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:07,221
Let us do that.

506
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:12,090
We can tell the villagers that we got married.

507
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,231
That way, people from the Castle will not be able to find out.

508
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,231
But this does not count as a real marriage.

509
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:24,031
Why not? Am I not good enough as your husband?

510
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:25,440
Darn you!

511
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:33,040
It does not matter if it is real or not.

512
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:37,781
As long as I can be with you...

513
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:41,690
and protect you.

514
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,790
My father was Daemodal...

515
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,160
and a Widudehyeong.

516
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:26,960
I am the son of General On Hyeop, the 17th chief of the Sunno Tribe,

517
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:29,531
My name is On Dal.

518
00:42:36,371 --> 00:42:37,570
On Hyeop,

519
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:42,310
you are tormenting me even after your death?

520
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,040
I knew this would happen!

521
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,401
So the rumour about the Princess being kicked out of the palace...

522
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:08,511
must be true!

523
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:10,611
- I guess so. - You just found that out?

524
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:13,881
Did she really get married to the son of a merchant?

525
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:17,450
Are you kidding me? I hear he is a fool.

526
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,221
I hear he is a total idiot.

527
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,221
I have never heard of that. My gosh.

528
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,031
That must be why the King was infuriated.

529
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:32,160
It is certain that the royal wedding has been cancelled.

530
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,101
I think she was kicked out of the palace last night,

531
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:36,871
but I have not found out her whereabouts.

532
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:40,771
She must have gone to the village of the herb gatherer.

533
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:43,611
Then the guy she got married to...

534
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:46,040
Ga Jin is helping me.

535
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,151
Sorry?

536
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:50,751
We would have definitely run into Ga Jin...

537
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,851
if we went into the palace.

538
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,590
She left at the right time.

539
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,521
Should I still tail her?

540
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:58,891
Leave her be.

541
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,131
When we see full moons several times...

542
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,060
and when the stars shine in different places,

543
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,971
she will come back herself.

General Go, are you up?

546
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,031
How did you bring me here?

547
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,460
You came to me yourself.

548
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,401
I did?

549
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:49,840
Take the medicine.

550
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:52,241
It will soothe your nausea.

551
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:59,251
Do not be worried. There is no poison inside.

552
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,960
Do you not think you need to pour me a glass...

553
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,800
since I have kicked out my own daughter?

554
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,200
Here. Let us get drunk.

555
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,471
The Princess must have gone to...

556
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:24,881
the village of the Sunno Tribe.

557
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:29,251
Well, I do not wish to know...

558
00:45:29,481 --> 00:45:30,981
where she is staying.

559
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,651
Why not?

560
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:36,651
Were you not planning to...

561
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,920
bring back the Sunno Tribe into the Five Tribe council...

562
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,190
up until recently?

563
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,601
You did not eliminate the source of trouble.

564
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:50,601
That is why you are facing trouble now.

565
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:55,340
Who knew the spouse of the Princess...

566
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:57,210
was the son of On Hyeop?

567
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,151
You need to put out the ember even if it is too late.

568
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:09,690
I remember it.

569
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:14,261
You and General On studied under the same teacher as young men.

570
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:17,191
Although you were older than him,

571
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,830
I heard General On was more skilled in martial arts.

572
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:25,671
On top of that, he was beloved and trusted by the people.

573
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,171
He must have upset you in many ways.

574
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,310
However,

575
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:35,751
he was beheaded for committing treason.

576
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,580
You were the one who ordered it.

577
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:51,231
My sins in this world run deep and are heavy.

578
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,271
That is why I called you here today to ask for a favour.

579
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,281
I have disowned my only daughter.

580
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:13,021
And I only have two sons.

581
00:47:13,181 --> 00:47:16,590
And if you try to use my sons...

582
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,661
to threaten me again,

583
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:29,630
you must kill me with this arrow first.

584
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:38,110
I will pay for my sins in death. However,

585
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:44,610
you and your family will also be in a pool of blood.

586
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,721
All right. Okay. Let us drink.

587
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,060
Here.

588
00:48:01,771 --> 00:48:04,171
You can stay a bit longer to gather yourself.

589
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,610
Vicious rumours will spread if I, the eldest of the Gyeru Tribe,

590
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:11,411
was found in the room of the daughter of the Sono Tribe.

591
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:14,380
I was not aware that rumours had sway over you.

592
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,451
I will send someone to pay for the medicine.

593
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,350
General Go.

594
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,191
You must take care of your mind and body.

595
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:28,431
How could you bring back the fate that had already been lost?

596
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,231
Know your place.

597
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:34,300
The Princess lied about her marriage.

598
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,671
There may be a piece of truth...

599
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:39,140
in that lie.

600
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,110
I can carve it out...

601
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:48,411
whether it is the truth or not.

602
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:25,781
Mother, you will hurt yourself.

603
00:49:26,521 --> 00:49:28,421
You ungrateful son.

604
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,890
You little brat. Do you wish to see me die?

605
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:36,231
My goodness. You brat! Because of you,

606
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,800
I could neither sleep nor eat.

607
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,330
I could have died, worrying about you!

608
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,201
Did you know that?

609
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:44,370
My gosh. This hurts!

610
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,340
You may kill me at this point.

611
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:48,511
Come here.

612
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:55,080
Are you all right?

613
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,120
Gosh, do not worry. I am all right.

614
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,681
Goodness. You troublemaker.

615
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:09,191
Who is there? Who did you bring?

616
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,761
Have you been well?

617
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,100
I came back with Ga Jin.

618
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:23,310
Ridiculous. How can that be?

619
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:25,481
You said she was a princess.

620
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,681
She should be in the palace. Why is she here?

621
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:30,050
It just happened.

622
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,481
So tell me how on earth that happened.

623
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:36,050
Well...

624
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,691
Let me tell her.

625
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:43,890
I hope this will not come as a big shock to you.

626
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:47,400
Actually, Dal and I...

627
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:49,731
are married.

628
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:55,441
What? You are what?

629
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,340
We are married.

630
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,650
I cannot understand what you just told me.

631
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,221
So who is married to whom?

632
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:11,790
So Ga Jin and I are married.

633
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:13,761
I am her husband. She, my wife.

634
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:19,501
What... What on earth...

635
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,531
You punk! How dare you tease your blind mother!

636
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,671
Mother, it is true.

637
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:27,771
I do not want to hear it.

638
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:30,110
Gosh.

639
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:37,451
He is back!

640
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,080
He is back!

641
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,090
- He came back! - Hey!

642
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,691
He is back!

643
00:51:48,491 --> 00:51:51,130
Dal is back now.

644
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,761
My gosh, he is back?

645
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:56,231
But why are you out of breath?

646
00:51:56,431 --> 00:52:00,271
But he did not come back alone. He brought Ga Jin.

647
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,911
No. He came back with the Princess!

648
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:06,011
- What? The Princess? - What?

649
00:52:06,011 --> 00:52:10,110
Hey. My Ga Jin is back? Are you sure?

650
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:14,021
She is back. But the thing is...

651
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:16,991
Come on, tell us. You are making me dizzy.

652
00:52:17,921 --> 00:52:22,231
They are married. Ga Jin and Dal got married!

653
00:52:22,231 --> 00:52:23,630
- Married? - They are married.

654
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,360
- Married? - Really?

655
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,931
What is going on? Dal got married?

656
00:52:31,671 --> 00:52:32,840
Ga Jin.

657
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,840
Ga Jin.

658
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:42,610
My gosh. I thought I would never be able to see her again.

659
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,320
Mother, open up.

660
00:52:48,521 --> 00:52:50,221
I get that you are furious.

661
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:52,021
But at least hear our side of the story.

662
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:56,231
Mother! You are not going to see your son ever again?

663
00:52:56,461 --> 00:52:57,461
Dal.

664
00:52:58,290 --> 00:52:59,731
We should give her some time.

665
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,201
She must be shocked.

666
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,540
Gosh.

667
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,130
They must be scared because you are the Princess.

668
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,900
Thank you for taking good care of my father.

669
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,840
But I am not here as the Princess.

670
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:48,441
Then, what are you?

671
00:53:48,681 --> 00:53:52,521
Are you really Dal's wife?

672
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,350
Yes.

673
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,390
I am Ga Jin's husband.

674
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:07,130
That is true! They got married!

675
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,370
Gosh. What a way to shock all of us.

676
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:16,610
Did you spend your first night together?

677
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:20,610
- Gosh. - Goodness!

678
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:22,810
What did I tell you?

679
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,850
I told you these two were fated to be together!

680
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:29,820
Congratulations.

681
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,830
Father.

682
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:46,501
It is your son.

683
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:49,941
I came with Ga Jin.

684
00:54:51,711 --> 00:54:53,140
You remember her, right?

685
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,251
General On, I am indebted to Dal and the Sunno Tribe...

686
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,850
once again.

687
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:04,390
Please be generous and watch over us.

688
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:08,890
She is your daughter-in-law.

689
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:15,830
That is true.

690
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:26,441
Come on.

691
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:29,751
The Chief is here. Do not make him stand here.

692
00:55:30,951 --> 00:55:32,181
Come on.

693
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:36,691
No matter how it happened, this is a happy occasion.

694
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,120
Please accept them with your generous heart.

695
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:43,890
Please think about the kids who must have been through a lot.

696
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:46,630
You do not know anything.

697
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:51,271
They are facing a long road of trouble and pain now.

698
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:55,070
Why did they... Gosh.

699
00:55:58,211 --> 00:56:01,781
Are you telling me that you lied to avoid the royal wedding?

700
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,451
What choice did we have?

701
00:56:03,711 --> 00:56:06,521
Ga Jin was about to get married without this lie.

702
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:09,120
The three of us knew something was up.

703
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,050
When we saw you at Pyeongyang Castle,

704
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,461
you did not seem to be engaged.

705
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,461
We cannot lie to you.

706
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,860
But you must keep this a secret.

707
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:20,161
If this gets out, it will put Ghost Valley and us in danger.

708
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,900
I heard you spend your first night at the bride's house.

709
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,001
Yeom Deuk was preparing the blankets for you.

710
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:28,701
What?

711
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:31,570
Gosh. Hey!

712
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,650
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

713
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,451
- Look at them! - What are they doing?

714
00:56:43,451 --> 00:56:46,421
My gosh. What are you doing? That is so vulgar!

715
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:49,330
Get out of here! Go!

716
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,830
- Look at them! - Leave already!

717
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,531
Hey. Let me crash at your place tonight.

718
00:56:57,531 --> 00:56:59,370
- Of course. - Let me sleep over there.

719
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,810
- Dal, do a good job! - Gosh.

720
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:07,040
Bride. Groom. Sweet dreams!

721
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,511
- They have no time to sleep! - Gosh. Get out of here.

722
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,380
- Leave, you punk. Go! - Look at them!

723
00:57:19,191 --> 00:57:21,761
Gosh. I did not think about this.

724
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:24,491
Right.

725
00:57:26,731 --> 00:57:27,860
Do you want to go to sleep?

726
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:30,600
I should.

727
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:34,040
- Go ahead, then. - What about you?

728
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,640
- This is comfortable for me. - I am good too.

729
00:57:47,421 --> 00:57:49,491
Go to sleep already. You must be sleepy.

730
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:53,691
- No, I am not. - You even yawned.

731
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:03,531
You are the sleepy one.

732
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:05,300
I am not sleepy!

733
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,640
Why are you getting mad?

734
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:10,771
I am not sleepy, but you keep telling me to go to sleep.

735
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:12,481
You are getting mad at me for nothing.

736
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,981
Hey. Where are you going?

737
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:19,221
I need to use the bathroom!

738
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:22,550
Why did you touch me?

739
00:58:27,021 --> 00:58:28,691
My goodness.

740
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,060
Gosh. Seriously.

741
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:40,840
Gosh.

742
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:56,090
Moon.

743
00:58:57,191 --> 00:58:58,790
Tell me what to do!

744
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,630
Do you have an answer?

745
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:05,491
I should not have gotten married!

746
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:09,931
It is making my heart do somersaults!

747
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:15,040
Gosh. It feels weird. Seriously.

748
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,840
Gosh.

749
00:59:26,921 --> 00:59:28,521
What is taking him so long?

750
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:35,931
- What is it? - Gosh.

751
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:38,390
If you went out to use the bathroom again, you might pass out.

752
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:40,600
Why do you care?

753
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,731
What about you? Why are you playing the pipe in the middle of the night?

754
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:45,231
You cannot even play it.

755
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:48,241
Why do you care if I play it or not?

756
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,771
I never had the chance to learn it.

757
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,711
Cheonjubang?

758
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:00,181
I am good at playing the pipe.

759
01:00:00,521 --> 01:00:02,521
Hey. That...

760
01:00:03,691 --> 01:00:05,451
I mean...

761
01:00:12,961 --> 01:00:15,600
Hey, you are dirtier than I thought.

762
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:20,271
"Dirty"? How could you say that about me?

763
01:00:20,501 --> 01:00:23,370
What about this, then? Why put this on your lips?

764
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:27,441
If I wanted to kiss you, I would have done it a long time ago.

765
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:29,181
Why would I put my lips on this sogeum?

766
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:31,511
Liar.

767
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,021
You are the liar. You are sleepy, but you are not going to sleep.

768
01:00:34,781 --> 01:00:36,090
You are the coward.

769
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,090
Kissing does not scare me.

770
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,090
Same here.

771
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,191
Then, try it.

772
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,161
You try it.

773
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:49,870
You...

774
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:31,501
(River Where the Moon Rises)

775
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,471
It feels weird to lie down here with you.

776
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,741
I came back here to live as Dal's wife.

777
01:02:36,741 --> 01:02:38,340
I am not here as the Princess or to play.

778
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,840
Are you sure you will not regret it?

779
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,181
What is my daughter-in-law doing?

780
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:43,411
I am coming.

781
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,781
I ask to be the head of the royal bodyguards.

782
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:47,380
You despicable spy.

783
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:49,951
I will end you here, so you never go back to Silla.

784
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:52,350
I will get everyone at the palace on my side.

785
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,491
Get the Prince's trust first.

786
01:02:54,491 --> 01:02:56,330
You planned it when you were at the palace, right?

787
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:58,790
And me becoming a general must be part of your plan.

788
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,731
Do you know why I am not teaching Dal the swordsmanship?

789
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:04,231
Once he wields the sword, he is bound to see blood.

790
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:05,671
That is the fate of a swordsman.
