1
00:00:05,392 --> 00:00:07,402
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:09,398
(Characters, incidents, and dates do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:11,672 --> 00:00:15,067
(Episode 10)

4
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:24,347
What is it?

5
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:26,513
Where are you going after sundown?

6
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,783
It is none of your business. Step aside.

7
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:32,047
Are you leaving to strike where the Princess is?

8
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:37,327
I will strike you first if you do not step aside.

9
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,657
Go inside.

10
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:42,657
Your father is waiting to see you.

11
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:53,778
I will pay for my sins in death.

12
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:58,348
However, you and your family will also be...

13
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:01,178
in a pool of blood.

14
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:10,488
You asked to see me?

15
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,387
If you cut down On Hyeop's son...

16
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:14,458
and burn their village,

17
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,568
do you think the Princess will become yours?

18
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:21,438
She will when she runs out of people to lean on.

19
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:27,038
She lied about being married to run away.

20
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,083
This is not something you can control by brute force.

21
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,477
I am only doing as you taught me.

22
00:01:34,822 --> 00:01:36,518
You killed the late Queen...

23
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,947
and beheaded On Hyeop.

24
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:44,288
It is a powerful scheme that does not backfire.

25
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:50,997
I commend your courage, but you have a long way to go.

26
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:53,898
Power is powerless when that is all it has.

27
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:57,412
Justification is what you need before you wield your sword.

28
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:58,637
Without that,

29
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:02,607
how different is a general at war from a butcher in a slaughterhouse?

30
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:04,947
Justification?

31
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:08,018
I shall make something up.

32
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,747
It will come upon us without us having to do anything.

33
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:15,418
Do you think the Princess can live as a herb gatherer's wife?

34
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,358
Until we have our cause,

35
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:22,027
- wait. - How much more time must I waste?

36
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,398
You are so slow.

37
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,898
To catch the chief, you must first fell his horse.

38
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:01,638
Did you sleep well?

39
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:04,467
Yes. Did you?

40
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:08,108
I did.

41
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:16,217
We should clean up.

42
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:23,217
General Go will be banished to the border?

43
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:26,793
Yes. He helped the Princess many times,

44
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:29,057
Gochuga seems to be angry with him.

45
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:31,032
He is Gyeru Tribe's next chief,

46
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:34,337
but he is very different from his father.

47
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:36,937
I am aware of his loyalty to the royal family.

48
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:42,078
The first person to notify me the Princess was alive...

49
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:44,008
was General Go.

50
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:48,117
He is too great a talent to lose like this.

51
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,931
Gochuga is so ruthless.

52
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:02,458
He is sending his heir to such a faraway place.

53
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,198
I got on his bad side.

54
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:08,798
But this exile is to a truly far place.

55
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:13,037
I am to inhale sand way up in the north.

56
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:16,977
Are you upset that I am going far away?

57
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:20,008
It is not great news.

58
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:22,217
Then shall I stay?

59
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:23,547
Pardon?

60
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:31,058
On a day like this, I wish I could sit in a boat on a river...

61
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:33,688
and drink for hours.

62
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:46,068
General Go Geon is to come and see the King immediately.

63
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,477
Please do not be angry, Mother.

64
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:57,188
I know I am lacking, but I will do my best.

65
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:06,388
Mother. Ga Jin's father,

66
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:08,762
my father-in-law gave his blessing.

67
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:10,702
I do not believe what I am hearing.

68
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:12,568
You have no father-in-law.

69
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:13,898
Mother.

70
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,213
I will light the fire.

71
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:19,808
I am good at that.

72
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:28,777
Get out of the way.

73
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,427
Do not do this, Princess.

74
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:47,268
You are the noblest of nobles on this earth.

75
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:49,998
You cannot do such rough work.

76
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:54,037
I am your daughter-in-law.

77
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,208
Do not tease an old woman.

78
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:00,847
Rest for as long as you are here.

79
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:10,857
My father commanded that...

80
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:14,058
I stay on a faraway border...

81
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:17,058
and do not show myself.

82
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:20,467
That is a punishment, not a command.

83
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:23,667
Is it because you helped the Princess?

84
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:24,907
I was never...

85
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:28,578
a satisfactory elder son.

86
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:33,748
My bodyguards have not been as orderly as before,

87
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:37,948
and security inside and outside the palace has been lax.

88
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:40,587
I am considering...

89
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:45,188
appointing you the new Head of Bodyguards.

90
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,058
I do not deserve that title.

91
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:52,868
But...

92
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,568
I have already packed to leave for the border.

93
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:01,037
Packed luggage can always be unpacked,

94
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:03,607
and commands taken back.

95
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:05,648
Before that,

96
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,547
to keep you close,

97
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:12,047
I must be able to trust you completely.

98
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,388
To make me trust you,

99
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:18,857
gain the Crown Prince's trust first.

100
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:23,998
With that, I will gauge your loyalty to the royal household.

101
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,037
Yes, sire.

102
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:44,122
He does not feel well,

103
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:45,787
and bids you come another day.

104
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:49,217
Did you tell him I am his new martial arts teacher?

105
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:50,318
Yes.

106
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,357
The truth is,

107
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:58,002
since the day the Princess left the palace,

108
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:59,832
he has not left his chambers.

109
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:01,103
(To not have contact with others.)

110
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:03,398
He said he cannot be bothered to do anything.

111
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:09,708
Pyeonggang, where on earth are you?

112
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:12,508
You are well, right?

113
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:26,427
I told you to get close to the King...

114
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:30,297
and you became the Crown Prince's trainer?

115
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:34,238
I am doing as you taught me.

116
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:38,768
To catch a chief, you fell his horse, you said.

117
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:40,738
Yes.

118
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:43,638
The Crown Prince is the King's horse.

119
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:48,018
I will get the Crown Prince's trust, and then the King's.

120
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:51,287
I will get everyone at the palace on my side.

121
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:54,518
The subjects are as doubtful as they are powerless.

122
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,287
Do you have a secret plan?

123
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:01,228
It would no longer be a secret if I were to speak of it.

124
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,327
Leave the royals to me...

125
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,268
and keep the council in line.

126
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:10,098
They have more greed than they deserve.

127
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:13,008
No one knows what they will do in secret.

128
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:18,947
Some good came from the Princess leaving the palace.

129
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:23,018
You have changed enough to care for our family.

130
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:24,947
Love it or hate it,

131
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:27,787
I am the next Gyeru chief.

132
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:31,927
I must do my duty as the son.

133
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:39,868
Are you still up?

134
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:45,543
Why are you taking more bedding?

135
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,207
There is enough in the other room.

136
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:49,312
There is only one set.

137
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:50,848
You said you are married.

138
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:52,777
Will you sleep apart from her?

139
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:56,077
Ga Jin feels uncomfortable. It is for her sake.

140
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:04,228
How am I to teach her?

141
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:09,527
Will there be any books?

142
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:18,738
She almost caught me.

143
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:20,407
Doing what?

144
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:22,937
Nothing.

145
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,623
I thought she would kick me out. I am glad she did not.

146
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:29,248
That is not good.

147
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,352
She treats you like you are invisible.

148
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,518
She is putting you first.

149
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:35,457
She may be your nanny,

150
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:38,457
but she cared for you more than any mother would.

151
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:40,588
That is how a mom thinks.

152
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:47,567
These are books on military strategy that I brought from the palace.

153
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,468
Military strategy?

154
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,312
"Simseo", "Yukdo", "Samryak",

155
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,108
"The Art of War", "The Five Arts".

156
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:56,807
Hang on.

157
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:59,307
Wait.

158
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,822
I do not have to read all these, do I?

159
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:04,722
Reading once is not enough.

160
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:05,893
10 times, 20 times.

161
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,358
You must be able to quote from it with your eyes closed.

162
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:10,293
I will study with you.

163
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:13,263
That is not fair. You said you would teach me to fight.

164
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:15,432
What is the point in just brandishing a sword?

165
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,457
You must be able to use your head.

166
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:26,437
Shall I have a look, then?

167
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:31,777
My gosh.

168
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:35,523
I think reading this will make me even more stupid.

169
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:38,388
You are complaining even before you begin.

170
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:46,088
I am tired. Can we just go to sleep?

171
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:50,297
Yes? Please?

172
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,128
My gosh.

173
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,037
Oh, well.

174
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:59,108
Do you feel uncomfortable?

175
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:01,482
I can sleep in the bigger room.

176
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:04,307
Do you want to sleep separately just after we got married?

177
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,348
Men can get divorced too.

178
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:08,577
Can they?

179
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:10,988
Even if it is a lie,

180
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:15,018
lying next to you feels like we are married.

181
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:18,327
It feels strange.

182
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:21,297
I agree.

183
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,797
- Ga Jin. - Yes?

184
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:32,768
Let us not tell Mother that I am learning to fight.

185
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:39,478
She will fall ill the moment she hears.

186
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:43,148
Okay.

187
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:47,118
And you too. Do not get in between Mother and me.

188
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:49,263
There is not much you can do to help.

189
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:53,758
Hey. Who else will look after the wife than the husband?

190
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:56,728
That is so reassuring.

191
00:12:57,503 --> 00:12:59,567
Still, leave it to me.

192
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,437
I am leaving to chop firewood.

193
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:38,907
I need to bring 3 or 4 stacks within the day.

194
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:44,707
Oh, and Ga Jin left already. She went to get water.

195
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:47,378
Come here.

196
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:53,018
What is she up to?

197
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:56,123
- What do you mean? - Why would a Princess...

198
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:58,633
come back to live in the mountains?

199
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:01,827
I do not believe she would marry a herb gatherer.

200
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,827
Come closer.

201
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:08,037
You can tell your mom.

202
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:11,567
She is up to something else, is she not?

203
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:14,008
I seduced her.

204
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,478
It is true.

205
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:22,718
Instead of being cooped up, she should be with me and fly...

206
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:25,692
and be free. That is what I said.

207
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,088
You can deceive a ghost but not me.

208
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,437
You made it.

209
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:45,373
Well? It is nice and spacious, right?

210
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:47,407
Yes. Wow.

211
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,082
What about Mother?

212
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:51,037
I made up some kind of story.

213
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,807
What do I do first? Tell me quickly.

214
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,618
Here.

215
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:07,427
That is not how you hold a sword.

216
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:10,657
Did you not learn as a kid? It is the basic of basics.

217
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:14,673
I asked my father to teach me, but he never listened.

218
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:16,898
General On? Why not?

219
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:18,508
I do not know.

220
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:25,053
Here. Support the weight with your left hand.

221
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:28,248
With your right hand, you control its movements.

222
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:30,648
Like this?

223
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:34,348
Hold the sword higher.

224
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:38,092
Shoulders straight, knees bent, back straight.

225
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:40,332
Why is it so complicated?

226
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:42,998
Learning the basics is the hardest part.

227
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:44,667
Lift your chin.

228
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,998
Keep your sight at the tip of the sword.

229
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:51,608
And pretend your enemy is over there.

230
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:54,937
Okay?

231
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,848
Come on.

232
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:03,417
Good.

233
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:06,518
Stay like this until I come back.

234
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:09,057
What? Where are you going?

235
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:13,533
Hey. This is a penalty, not training.

236
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:14,932
Stay like that!

237
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,527
Ga Jin!

238
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:26,667
What did you just say?

239
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:29,907
Revive the Sunno Tribe?

240
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:33,677
The King also wants the Sunno Tribe to return.

241
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:36,547
Go Won Pyo brought up my marriage...

242
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,988
so he could not show his intent.

243
00:16:40,722 --> 00:16:44,057
You cannot live in Ghost Valley forever.

244
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:46,562
You must gather your men, gain strength,

245
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:48,498
and regain power.

246
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:50,527
You must...

247
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:54,027
recover your position on the Five Tribe council.

248
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:57,067
Is this why you returned?

249
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,207
To help revive the Sunno Tribe?

250
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:03,338
It is not just for your tribe.

251
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:09,318
While I was in the palace, I realized how things really are.

252
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:12,553
Go Won Pyo and his allies...

253
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:15,417
damage the King's authority and control everything political.

254
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:18,358
If we do not stop those few men,

255
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,028
Goguryeo will crumble from the inside out.

256
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:27,098
Please offer the King your support.

257
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:30,467
I may be the chief,

258
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:33,507
but this is not a decision for me to make alone.

259
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,878
I will speak to the villagers.

260
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:40,447
To gather and train people, we will need that much money.

261
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:42,548
It might not be enough,

262
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,348
but I will obtain some silver that will get us started.

263
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,288
You are selling all these?

264
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:53,892
There is a woman who needs money urgently.

265
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:56,362
She needs silver and soon.

266
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:59,227
I think I saw these somewhere.

267
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:03,167
Who is it? Do I know this woman?

268
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:11,138
This is the jewellery I kept in Magnolia Hall.

269
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:15,717
I will leave it with you. Find me a buyer.

270
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:18,548
What do you need this much silver for?

271
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:22,717
You do not need to know. But the sooner the better.

272
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:26,427
Do forgive me.

273
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:29,898
I was requested to keep her identity a secret.

274
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:33,467
Forget about that.

275
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,773
The medicine you gave me.

276
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:37,838
You said it would get me pregnant.

277
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:41,543
I do not think it works.

278
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:43,183
Even if you take medicines,

279
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:46,082
the balance of yin and yang is hard to control.

280
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:47,778
Since we are talking...

281
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:51,318
The fortune-teller you mentioned.

282
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:55,288
If he is as good as rumours say, he will do services as well, right?

283

284
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:12,237
Why are you at the Crown Prince's chambers?

285
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:16,407
I heard you were appointed as his trainer.

286
00:19:17,713 --> 00:19:19,907
There truly is nothing you do not know.

287
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:22,023
I also know the Crown Prince...

288
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:24,378
never leaves his room, let alone train.

289
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:29,358
Did you make another wasted trip?

290
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:33,558
If I had known he would be so much trouble,

291
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:35,828
I would have left to the border.

292
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:40,727
When the Princess left,

293
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:43,667
she showed grave concern for the Crown Prince's safety.

294
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:48,278
For her sake, I hope you do not give up too easily.

295
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:56,517
I cannot tell what you are thinking.

296
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:01,247
Because of the Princess, you had to face flogging.

297
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:04,017
Yet, you are worried about her.

298
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:07,957
I have a lot of pity...

299
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:12,028
for you who cannot move on from a woman who has left...

300
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,197
and for the Princess who has been disowned by the King.

301
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:19,568
My heart feels much compassion.

302
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:28,417
Hey.

303
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:29,848
Gosh.

304
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:34,588
Have you not moved since I left you?

305
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,187
You told me to stay like this.

306
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:37,818
You said mastering the basics is the most important.

307
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:40,888
Gosh. That is enough. You can stop that.

308
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:50,898
Goodness.

309
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:52,368
Are you laughing?

310
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,038
How can you laugh when you made me do it?

311
00:20:58,652 --> 00:20:59,747
Do not move.

312
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:04,447
That feels nice.

313
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,561
Well, my wife can wash away the fatigue just with her hands.

314
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:11,457
You little... Do not get cheeky with me.

315
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:18,267
Ga Jin.

316
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:21,667
I know that this is just a wooden sword,

317
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:25,038
but it feels awful to train behind my mother's back.

318
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:34,348
We have no choice.

319
00:21:36,352 --> 00:21:37,447
I know that.

320
00:21:37,753 --> 00:21:41,588
I even made you promise to never wield your sword before.

321
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:45,058
Now, I am learning it from you.

322
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,497
If you do not want to, you can stop.

323
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:54,427
I do not want you to be in agony.

324
00:21:57,642 --> 00:21:58,967
I was just saying.

325
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:02,407
What is the next pose?

326
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:11,378
My gosh. It is cold outside. Where have you been?

327
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:15,162
Oh, my. You are a princess. Why are you carrying a jug of water?

328
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:17,493
- Give me that. - It is okay. I can do it.

329
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:19,332
My gosh. That is absurd. Put it down now.

330
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:20,933
- Give me that. - No, it is okay.

331
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,157
- Gosh. - Goodness.

332
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:24,798
Gosh.

333
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:26,467
Darn it.

334
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:28,298
What? "Darn it"?

335
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:32,013
Oh, no.

336
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:33,713
I am sorry. I should have been careful.

337
00:22:33,713 --> 00:22:35,483
Gosh, do not say that.

338
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:37,483
This kind of menial job is for people of low birth like me.

339
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:40,747
I cannot let a princess like you do such a thing.

340
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:42,717
If I do, I will be gravely punished for it.

341
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:44,548
Mother.

342
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:48,118
I am here to live as Dal's wife.

343
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:50,257
I am not here to fool around as a princess.

344
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:54,528
Please treat me how you would treat your family.

345
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,398
Are you sure you will not regret...

346
00:23:01,102 --> 00:23:02,997
what you just told me?

347
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:05,472
Pardon?

348
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:07,912
Will you not criticize me...

349
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:10,638
even if I give you a lot of hard jobs?

350
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:13,677
Please just tell me what you want me to do.

351
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:17,677
In that case,

352
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:22,687
you need to get the water again.

353
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:26,328
And chop the firewood too.

354
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:31,667
Okay.

355
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:52,517
Where is Ga Jin?

356
00:23:52,523 --> 00:23:54,957
I told her to tend the vegetable garden in the valley.

357
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:57,892
The vegetable garden is a mess...

358
00:23:57,892 --> 00:24:00,128
because you decided to go traipsing around the city.

359
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:02,233
She cannot tend the garden all by herself.

360
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,957
Stay out of this.

361
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,997
She said she would be my daughter-in-law.

362
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:08,402
Mother.

363
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:10,543
She said I did not have to treat her like a princess.

364
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:12,407
She will get her wish.

365
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:19,578
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

366
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:21,207
Goodness.

367
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,177
Gosh.

368
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:25,818
You are so strong.

369
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:27,747
She really is.

370
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:31,558
Do not work yourself too hard.

371
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:34,157
You are eating so well.

372
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:40,598
Ga Jin has made up her mind now.

373
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:41,868
What do you mean?

374
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,497
She visited the chief.

375
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:47,538
And the chief told you to get a book on battle formations.

376
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:49,243
I do not know what is going on,

377
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:51,977
but I am definitely certain she has a big plan in mind.

378
00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:55,253
So that must be why she came here...

379
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:56,878
pretending to have married a guy like Dal.

380
00:24:57,882 --> 00:24:59,118
Nothing is wrong with Dal.

381
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:02,318
He is the son of a great general.

382
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:04,321
He does not have to feel small because of a disowned princess.

383
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:08,128
I mean, look at his face and his skills at martial arts.

384
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:11,828
Ga Jin is way too good for him.

385
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:14,102
Without Dal, you and your brother...

386
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:15,943
would not have been able to live here.

387
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:17,467
Did we ask for that?

388
00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:20,072
My gosh. You ungrateful girl.

389
00:25:20,072 --> 00:25:22,638
"Girl"? Do you have a death wish?

390
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:24,108
What are you doing?

391
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:28,108
Is that a lovers' quarrel?

392
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,447
It is sunny today. Fight in the sun at least.

393
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:32,318
Do you also have a death wish?

394
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:36,957
I found it.

395
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,838
Hey, Ga Jin. Your hand...

396
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:52,308
I am all right. Just read your book.

397
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:54,068
No, that does not look okay.

398
00:25:54,372 --> 00:25:55,737
We should put some herbs on it.

399
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:57,278
Let me see.

400
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:58,677
Read your book.

401
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:00,947
Your hand.

402
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:12,033
What is my daughter-in-law doing?

403
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:14,388
Come over here already.

404
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,828
What are you doing?

405
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,638
Yes, I am coming.

406
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:28,112
You must read the entire first chapter of "Yukdo".

407
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:29,437
I will quiz you later.

408
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:48,058
It does not sound like you are sewing now.

409
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:51,628
I cannot get the thread through the needle.

410
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,398
Do you not know how to sew?

411
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:56,937
Well, I have watched people sew a few times before.

412
00:26:57,342 --> 00:26:58,507
Give me that.

413
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:23,898
You told me yourself that you are neither a princess nor an assassin.

414
00:27:24,763 --> 00:27:26,828
From now on, learn how to maintain a home properly.

415
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,503
If you want to support Dal,

416
00:27:29,503 --> 00:27:31,368
you must work twice or thrice harder...

417
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:33,507
than a blind woman did.

418
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,608
You raised him until now...

419
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:39,548
when you cannot see.

420
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:42,622
I cannot even imagine how it must have been for you.

421
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:45,288
Just sew. Stop chitchatting.

422
00:27:47,023 --> 00:27:48,118
Okay.

423
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:58,628
Do not worry about the Princess.

424
00:28:00,572 --> 00:28:03,368
She is as brave as a man.

425
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:05,937
She is not the only one I worry about.

426
00:28:06,912 --> 00:28:09,878
I worry about the Crown Prince who refuses to leave his chambers.

427
00:28:10,183 --> 00:28:13,477
I strictly told him to start training tomorrow.

428
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:16,878
But raising children is more difficult...

429
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:18,888
than ruling over an empire.

430
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:21,548
I am sorry that I do not know...

431
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:24,217
the trouble of a parent.

432
00:28:37,743 --> 00:28:40,467
I have used all kinds of effective herbs.

433
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:42,578
But she never became pregnant.

434
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:46,007
From what I have heard, you can also perform a ritual.

435
00:28:46,152 --> 00:28:48,578
A mighty owner of an herb store was not able to do it.

436
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:50,977
Are you asking a fortune-teller to do it?

437
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:00,033
She said she is willing to pay whatever it takes...

438
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:02,157
as long as she is blessed with a child.

439
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:03,898
Bring her here.

440
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:06,267
I will feel her chi first.

441
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:09,138
And I will see if a ritual will work.

442
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:11,568
She is not someone who can freely come and go.

443
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:13,967
Here.

444
00:29:14,513 --> 00:29:17,112
I brought her date of birth, so use this to read her fortune.

445
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:18,907
Unless I see her face to face,

446
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,108
a ritual cannot be done.

447
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:34,028
He does not seem ordinary.

448
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:36,497
He refused to take this much silver.

449
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:44,298
Not a lot of fortune-tellers would burn anesthetic incense sticks.

450
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:46,638
He is very good at deception.

451
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,078
Do you think he can be trusted?

452
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:03,525
She has nice facial features.

453
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:05,720
And her nose shows a good sign of wealth in her fortune.

454
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,351
However,

455
00:30:08,155 --> 00:30:11,390
I can see her true face behind her wealth.

456
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:14,761
Look into her.

457
00:30:15,536 --> 00:30:18,101
I must know how many faces she is hiding.

458
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,171
Darn it. My water jug.

459
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:38,580
You fool.

460
00:30:52,276 --> 00:30:54,301
My water jug!

461
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:08,825
Mother, I will go and get some water.

462
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:13,126
Okay. Well, fill all the empty water jugs.

463
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:14,820
Once you are done with those,

464
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:18,126
weed out the vegetable garden over there on the hill.

465
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,436
After that, wash the laundry and hang it up.

466
00:31:21,436 --> 00:31:23,506
Oh, right. Before the sun comes down,

467
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,835
get some bush stems, so you can make a broom.

468
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:29,501
Water, vegetable garden, laundry, and bush stems. I got it.

469
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:33,545
And today, I am wearing the clothes you made me before.

470
00:31:33,546 --> 00:31:35,070
So my clothes will not get in the way of my work.

471
00:31:35,115 --> 00:31:36,680
I will be back.

472
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:39,680
What about your hands?

473
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,620
My gosh. How much more do you want to torture her?

474
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,936
Are you sure she is a princess?

475
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:00,105
- She is not a princess. - What?

476
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:01,800
She is my wife.

477
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:10,510
I am sleepy. What are you doing? This is a hassle.

478
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:13,355
The order came from the King.

479
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:16,020
You can rest all you want after the training.

480
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,420
Once this is over, I will bring in sweets.

481
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:24,820
You may go.

482
00:32:33,406 --> 00:32:35,131
Grab the wooden sword.

483
00:32:36,475 --> 00:32:38,105
Do you not wish to train?

484
00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:40,640
I will not. This is a hassle.

485
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:48,681
Then, let us have a bet.

486
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:51,181
If you can touch so much as my collar,

487
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:53,990
you do not have to train.

488
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,221
- Are you serious? - Of course.

489
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,661
I will report to the King myself.

490
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:02,531
However, if you fail, you must train with me.

491
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:21,216
I will not do it.

492
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,855
Then, as you promise, you must train with me.

493
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:26,026
A king does not need to know swordsmanship.

494
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:27,950
I can order my generals.

495
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:30,290
No generals or soldiers will not follow...

496
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:33,061
a king who will not fight with them on the front lines.

497
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:38,330
A long time ago, your sister...

498
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:41,631
had the same bet.

499
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:45,811
She was young. And she is a woman.

500
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:49,080
So I told her that I could not teach her.

501
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:52,080
But she insisted that she learned how to fight.

502
00:33:52,116 --> 00:33:54,980
The Princess had a bet with me,

503
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:57,080
so she could train.

504
00:33:57,825 --> 00:34:00,490
So what happened?

505
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,320
I...

506
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,931
became her master.

507
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:18,500
Well, we did have a bet.

508
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:24,841
Practice the basic strikes.

509
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:31,680
Lower your sword. Again.

510
00:34:34,296 --> 00:34:37,161
That is too far. Do it again.

511
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,965
It is too short this time. Again!

512
00:34:40,965 --> 00:34:42,961
Why is this so complicated?

513
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:46,331
Strike it at the same angle. Do it again.

514
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:56,341
Go over it again, so you do not forget it.

515
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:15,705
Mother, I need to go back one more time to fill the jug.

516
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:18,130
I will go to the vegetable garden in the valley today.

517
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:34,411
Hey. Focus.

518
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:36,821
Yes, master.

519
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:49,161
Stand up again.

520
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,161
How will you protect our empire if you are this weak?

521
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:26,771
Where is my daughter-in-law?

522
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:29,440
I am coming.

523
00:36:54,566 --> 00:36:58,360
Gochuga is a tiger without his claws.

524
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:02,335
He failed to stop the royal marriage from getting annulled.

525
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:05,601
And he just watched the Princess leaving the palace.

526
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:10,141
How about Daedaero? He used to try to be on our good side.

527
00:37:10,246 --> 00:37:13,885
I heard that lately, he has only been visiting the King.

528
00:37:13,885 --> 00:37:17,986
I am sure Gochuga has a plan he has not told us yet.

529
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,321
A plan?

530
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:23,666
Even his eldest son is on the King's side.

531
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:25,565
He is teaching the Crown Prince martial arts now.

532
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:27,094
What plan could he have?

533
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:28,961
You are here.

534
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:36,540
Were you discussing things I am not supposed to hear?

535
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:38,971
Of course, not.

536
00:37:39,316 --> 00:37:42,641
We were discussing envoys to Northern Zhou.

537
00:37:45,955 --> 00:37:49,480
I have already thought about which envoys and how many will go.

538
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:54,591
I am sure the Gyeru Tribe will take the lead again.

539
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:57,865
And our people will be no more than just fillers.

540
00:37:57,866 --> 00:38:01,031
Well, let us do that then.

541
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,540
I heard General Go Geon has been busy lately.

542
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:13,271
I hear the Crown Prince has a lot of faith in him.

543
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:21,151
You brought me sweets.

544
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:23,480
I came here to thank you.

545
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,780
This is too much for just me.

546
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:28,351
Would you like to have some too?

547
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:32,660
Master.

548
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:34,431
Yes?

549
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:37,860
Master Go, do you have feelings for Pyeonggang?

550
00:38:39,635 --> 00:38:41,201
Why do you ask me that?

551
00:38:41,206 --> 00:38:43,701
I just want for you to be on her side, that is all.

552
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:48,010
Do not hate her too much, even if she is married.

553
00:38:49,645 --> 00:38:51,740
No master hates his pupils.

554
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:53,451
On top of that,

555
00:38:54,155 --> 00:38:56,250
the Princess was my first pupil.

556
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:02,091
I will always protect you both.

557
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,691
I need to find out what is going on.

558
00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:50,601
You have brought useful information.

559
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:52,441
Good work.

560
00:39:52,846 --> 00:39:55,211
I will call for you again when I have decided on an area to spy on.

561
00:39:56,446 --> 00:39:59,880
I saw some suspicious people in front of the herb store.

562
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,150
And?

563
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:04,826
He was disguised as a merchant, but he was a Cheonjubang killer.

564
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:06,020
From Cheonjubang?

565
00:40:06,856 --> 00:40:08,295
Are you sure?

566
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:11,860
Yes, we corresponded directly.

567
00:40:12,295 --> 00:40:14,765
After looking around the herb store for a while,

568
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:15,935
he left.

569
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,466
Did you tail him?

570
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:20,201
He entered a fortune-teller's house.

571
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,071
It is called Songhwadang.

572
00:40:30,885 --> 00:40:32,780
There is not much known about her.

573
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:35,081
She appears to be an orphan, with no known relatives.

574
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,785
Even with a status like that,

575
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:42,150
she became the adopted daughter of the Sono tribe?

576
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:46,360
What a formidable woman.

577
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:51,030
There is a rumour that she has been gathering precious and rare herbs.

578
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:55,201
There was also talk that she also secretly sold a palace maid...

579
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:56,900
off to Silla, causing havoc.

580
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,010
Silla?

581
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:02,541
But the person who revealed that incident...

582
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,311
was the Princess.

583
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:20,331
I am so busy.

584
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:21,665
Why did you ask us to gather?

585
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:24,000
The Chief said he had something to tell us.

586
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,265
Do you know what it is?

587
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:26,431
I have no clue.

588
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:29,370
Hey, mister.

589
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:31,541
Hey.

590
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:36,385
You should spend some time taking care of your daughter.

591
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:37,986
What is wrong with Ga Jin?

592
00:41:37,986 --> 00:41:40,586
She is doing so much labour as a newly married woman.

593
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:41,986
Chopping firewood...

594
00:41:41,986 --> 00:41:44,326
and washing all the blankets in icy water.

595
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:46,356
- Is that not right? - That is right.

596
00:41:46,356 --> 00:41:50,390
She is running all over the village all by herself doing chores.

597
00:41:50,795 --> 00:41:54,890
My goodness. She must seem like a real fox to her mother-in-law.

598
00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:56,701
She had to let go of her one and only son.

599
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,561
I am sure she does not look favourably on her.

600
00:41:58,736 --> 00:42:00,801
My goodness.

601
00:42:01,106 --> 00:42:02,201
Oh, my.

602
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:17,221
I have something to tell you all, so have asked you to gather.

603
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,951
Let us discuss our village...

604
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,990
and the future of the Sunno tribe.

605
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:50,821
You must be a monk.

606
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:56,490
Are you lost? There is no village or temple around here.

607
00:42:56,665 --> 00:42:58,291
Who are you?

608
00:42:58,425 --> 00:43:00,860
Dancing an outrageous dance in the middle of nowhere?

609
00:43:01,035 --> 00:43:02,230
Can you not tell?

610
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:05,160
I am practicing my swordsmanship.

611
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:08,471
Swordsmanship?

612
00:43:08,576 --> 00:43:11,041
I thought you were having an affair with those sticks.

613
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:15,610
Sir, those are some harsh words for a stranger.

614
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:28,826
This would be perfect to use as a walking stick.

615
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:32,020
Hey, you. Give that back before I lose my temper.

616
00:43:34,096 --> 00:43:35,561
All right, you fool.

617
00:43:43,562 --> 00:43:48,562

618
00:43:56,826 --> 00:43:58,821
How long will you hang ropes as a talisman,

619
00:43:58,986 --> 00:44:00,620
wave your goblin lights,

620
00:44:00,996 --> 00:44:03,591
and live in hiding here in Ghost Valley?

621
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:06,061
Abandon the past,

622
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:08,291
so full of unjust and wretched days.

623
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:11,000
Let us prepare to re-enter the world.

624
00:44:12,106 --> 00:44:14,601
We have a plan as well as funds.

625
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,341
We just need your backing.

626
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:21,171
I do not know about the Sunno tribe,

627
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:23,385
but I feel hesitant about it.

628
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:25,685
Do you call yourself a man?

629
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:27,986
Who cares if we are Sunno or not?

630
00:44:27,986 --> 00:44:30,851
She is just saying we have a shot at living like human beings.

631
00:44:30,956 --> 00:44:34,395
It is true that we have never gotten any respect as a person.

632
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:37,520
We have just lived as worms, shovelling dirt and being stepped on.

633
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:39,890
What will you do afterwards?

634
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:43,905
The people of Ghost Valley are few.

635
00:44:43,905 --> 00:44:45,135
It is not enough to form troops...

636
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:47,370
and forge weapons.

637
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:48,630
You are right.

638
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:51,246
We need a lot more people.

639
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:53,211
Homeless nomads roaming the towns,

640
00:44:53,415 --> 00:44:55,941
people trampled underfoot by the nobles.

641
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:57,545
Once the preparations are complete,

642
00:44:57,545 --> 00:44:59,116
I am going to win them over to our side, one by one,

643
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:01,081
starting with the nearest town.

644
00:45:01,885 --> 00:45:03,181
I will do it personally.

645
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:09,520
I am in favour.

646
00:45:09,596 --> 00:45:12,490
It is a promise made by the Princess, after all.

647
00:45:14,765 --> 00:45:15,860
Me too.

648
00:45:16,236 --> 00:45:17,765
Fine, me too.

649
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:20,071
Fine, I am in favour too.

650
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:23,841
- Me too. - Me too.

651
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:25,801
We will give it a shot.

652
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:28,811
Let us try it.

653
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,645
- It will be a new opportunity. - Let us go for it.

654
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,041
We have to do it now.

655
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:38,351
- We have to try. - We can have a new life.

656
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,630
I was going to tell you.

657
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:52,061
But for you, training was the priority.

658
00:45:54,106 --> 00:45:55,370
I am not angry with you.

659
00:45:59,106 --> 00:46:01,270
It was something you were planning when you were in the palace, right?

660
00:46:04,415 --> 00:46:06,181
Me becoming a general...

661
00:46:07,216 --> 00:46:08,650
is also in that plan, is it not?

662
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:15,620
Dal, this is for you and me,

663
00:46:15,795 --> 00:46:17,721
and for the benefit of the whole Sunno tribe.

664
00:46:19,565 --> 00:46:20,791
I am all right.

665
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:24,230
I need to carry on my father's wishes.

666
00:46:25,805 --> 00:46:26,900
And...

667
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,341
That is what you want.

668
00:46:40,586 --> 00:46:42,610
But those people are different.

669
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:46,051
Those people have escaped to this place...

670
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:49,721
because they have grown tired and exhausted from the world.

671
00:46:52,866 --> 00:46:55,230
They have barely survived until now.

672
00:46:55,765 --> 00:46:58,031
How can we endanger that?

673
00:46:59,976 --> 00:47:01,970
We need to change the world,

674
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:07,041
so that the people can live life to the fullest, without fear.

675
00:47:11,216 --> 00:47:15,511
That is the country we must build, the new Goguryeo.

676
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:25,591
Although our lives seem peaceful, apart from the world like this,

677
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:28,160
even Ghost Valley will turn into a bloodbath,

678
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,501
with a single word from Go Won Pyo.

679
00:47:34,906 --> 00:47:37,271
When you first came to Ghost Valley,

680
00:47:39,545 --> 00:47:41,910
you loved it because you said it was like a dream.

681
00:47:51,426 --> 00:47:53,390
I, the humble Go Geon,

682
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:56,591
will be so bold as to accept the role of Head of Bodyguards.

683
00:48:02,236 --> 00:48:05,301
With the unchanging power of the sword,

684
00:48:06,406 --> 00:48:10,370
protect the King and his castle with loyalty and zeal.

685
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:18,140
I accept your command.

686
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:20,950
- Salute! - Salute!

687
00:48:31,595 --> 00:48:33,960
"He lost his son to the King."

688
00:48:34,035 --> 00:48:36,460
That is what the people outside the castle are saying.

689
00:48:37,006 --> 00:48:39,265
They say the failed marriage soured his relationship with his father,

690
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:41,970
and that he has turned his back on the family.

691
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:45,605
A parent cannot block the path his child has chosen.

692
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:48,170
I fear for your safety, Gochuga.

693
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:52,541
If you let this happen, how will you deal with the aftermath?

694
00:48:55,785 --> 00:48:57,751
Why, are you planning to turn your back on me too?

695
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:01,720
It appears your father has a different goal in mind.

696
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:05,960
The Princess gave us a gift by getting out of the way...

697
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,761
and forged a path for me towards the throne.

698
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:15,301
Once the assassin squad has been completed, a bloodbath will ensue.

699
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:21,370
I have only one desire.

700
00:49:21,815 --> 00:49:23,815
For our son, Geon Mu, to ascend to the throne,

701
00:49:23,815 --> 00:49:26,311
with the aid of your strength.

702
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:30,081
"Our son".

703
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:41,831
Is that prince...

704
00:49:42,966 --> 00:49:44,860
really my son?

705
00:49:47,406 --> 00:49:48,970
What?

706
00:49:49,976 --> 00:49:52,041
How can you say that?

707
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:56,041
You are the type of woman who would argue...

708
00:49:57,416 --> 00:50:00,351
that the sky is the earth to seat your son on the throne.

709
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:11,021
I love...

710
00:50:11,896 --> 00:50:13,460
your greed.

711
00:50:14,365 --> 00:50:15,860
Geon Mu...

712
00:50:17,835 --> 00:50:19,860
is your son.

713
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:27,511
The metal is all rotten.

714
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,110
I could melt it down and reforge it,

715
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:32,785
but then I would need a bigger forge.

716
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:34,285
Still, please get started.

717
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:36,456
I will get you the materials you need.

718
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:37,555
All right.

719
00:50:37,555 --> 00:50:38,981
Hey.

720
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:42,825
Ga Jin, is this really all right?

721
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:46,265
I told you I would get some silver. Do you not trust me, Father?

722
00:50:46,265 --> 00:50:49,430
Not that. I meant your mother-in-law.

723
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:52,065
I heard she is making you suffer, giving you a ton of chores.

724
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:55,130
That is not true. She is very good to me.

725
00:50:56,605 --> 00:50:59,200
Dal will be waiting. I will be going now.

726
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:02,210
- I will leave it to you. - All right.

727
00:51:02,615 --> 00:51:05,246
The Princess is so in love with On Dal.

728
00:51:05,246 --> 00:51:06,481
Ga Jin.

729
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:09,051
Good luck.

730
00:51:10,085 --> 00:51:11,351
Let us go.

731
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,591
I am just as worried as you are.

732
00:51:21,035 --> 00:51:24,460
Ga Jin is not used to being in a relationship.

733
00:51:24,636 --> 00:51:28,400
Do you think they spent their first night together?

734
00:51:29,075 --> 00:51:32,841
You know what I mean. The steamy, inexplicable... Gosh!

735
00:51:33,775 --> 00:51:35,875
I told you to keep their secret.

736
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:38,011
That was a good kick.

737
00:51:40,085 --> 00:51:43,851
Seeing that it is her,

738
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:46,751
I feel like she could really change the world with Dal.

739
00:51:49,926 --> 00:51:53,321
I want to try my best to help them too.

740
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,960
(Songhwadang)

741
00:52:14,686 --> 00:52:17,354
Since you told me to come alone,

742
00:52:17,355 --> 00:52:19,680
you must be ready to perform the ritual.

743
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:23,791
I called you here to discuss matters your adoptive father cannot hear.

744
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:25,620
What?

745
00:52:27,335 --> 00:52:31,501
Or perhaps he already knows?

746
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:37,370
The fact that you are a Silla spy.

747
00:52:41,716 --> 00:52:43,880
What nonsense do you speak of?

748
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:49,180
I was not quite sure, but your expression has said it all.

749
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:55,021
The adopted daughter of the Sono tribe is a spy after all.

750
00:52:55,496 --> 00:52:56,765
What an entertaining turn.

751
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:59,261
I have heard enough foolishness for now.

752
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,930
If you leave like this,

753
00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:06,200
I will not be able to keep my mouth shut.

754
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:09,301
I too am quite tempted to speak plainly.

755
00:53:10,476 --> 00:53:13,370
The Cheonjubang leader, disguised as a fortune-teller.

756
00:53:14,646 --> 00:53:16,841
And his assassins.

757
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:21,416
What are you trying to do now,

758
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:23,351
after aiming for the throne by using the Princess?

759
00:53:23,986 --> 00:53:26,781
Are you planning more treachery?

760
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:38,666
I knew you were a formidable woman.

761
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:41,400
Rather than throw the tribes into chaos and mutual destruction,

762
00:53:41,775 --> 00:53:44,470
we should try to help one another, discreetly.

763
00:53:45,506 --> 00:53:47,940
I will refrain from any further foolish games.

764
00:53:54,285 --> 00:53:55,581
What should we do?

765
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:58,281
It is quite a waste,

766
00:53:58,956 --> 00:54:01,051
but I have no choice.

767
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,880
You despicable spy.

768
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:07,920
I will kill you right here so that you can never go back to Silla.

769
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:25,831
My lady, stay with me.

770
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:27,331
My lady.

771
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:32,271
What are you doing here?

772
00:56:35,075 --> 00:56:36,470
By any chance,

773
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:40,081
did you hear...

774
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:44,420
what the man said?

775
00:56:46,156 --> 00:56:47,551
What did he say?

776
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:51,720
Let me take you to the herb store. You may be in danger.

777
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:55,331
My lady.

778
00:57:14,355 --> 00:57:16,085
I will not go easy on you.

779
00:57:16,085 --> 00:57:18,321
I need to check on your progress.

780
00:57:23,325 --> 00:57:25,420
Do not cry after you lose.

781
00:57:27,496 --> 00:57:28,791
Here we go.

782
00:57:31,305 --> 00:57:35,501
Where did I put my sewing basket?

783
00:57:36,305 --> 00:57:38,140
Let me see.

784
00:57:42,216 --> 00:57:43,880
Oh, there it is.

785
00:57:50,726 --> 00:57:52,581
What is a book doing here?

786
00:57:53,226 --> 00:57:54,890
That is strange.

787
00:57:56,956 --> 00:57:58,591
Hello?

788
00:57:59,765 --> 00:58:01,031
Who is it?

789
00:58:02,636 --> 00:58:04,400
Hello?

790
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:06,460
Oh, my.

791
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:18,045
I am Ga Jin's dad.

792
00:58:18,045 --> 00:58:21,610
I do recognize your unpleasant voice.

793
00:58:24,525 --> 00:58:27,996
I was looking for wood to turn into a hoe...

794
00:58:27,996 --> 00:58:31,920
but ended up making a stick.

795
00:58:32,025 --> 00:58:34,365
I am thinking of giving it to my in-law.

796
00:58:34,365 --> 00:58:37,160
Your in-law? Who do you mean?

797
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:42,970
Why not just accept it, seeing how things turned out this way?

798
00:58:42,976 --> 00:58:45,275
That would make the kids feel better.

799
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:48,115
Also, please stop being mean to Ga Jin...

800
00:58:48,115 --> 00:58:50,746
That is enough. You are out of line.

801
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:53,311
I am actually glad you are here. Here, take it.

802
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,811
Tell me what book that is.

803
00:58:57,156 --> 00:58:59,880
I cannot read.

804
00:59:01,426 --> 00:59:03,620
Let me see.

805
00:59:04,426 --> 00:59:07,660
Wait, there are pictures.

806
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,196
Is it a picture book?

807
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:13,360
Yes, there are pictures of soldiers holding swords.

808
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:16,900
Is this a book about military tactics?

809
00:59:18,676 --> 00:59:22,646
In addition to learning martial arts,

810
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,986
is he studying military tactics too?

811
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:26,180
Who?

812
00:59:27,216 --> 00:59:30,011
- Are you talking about Dal? - Did you not know?

813
00:59:32,456 --> 00:59:34,420
That little brat.

814
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:38,896
Where are you going? That way, you will end up in the mountains.

815
00:59:38,896 --> 00:59:41,295
Be careful. My goodness.

816
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:42,436
Do not worry.

817
00:59:42,436 --> 00:59:46,261
I know every rock on this mountain.

818
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:51,601
Oh, my. She is walking so fast.

819
01:00:05,825 --> 01:00:07,180
Lady Sa.

820
01:00:14,896 --> 01:00:17,160
He just fell asleep.

821
01:00:17,436 --> 01:00:19,360
He stopped Silla spies...

822
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,601
from sneaking in through the mountain fortress.

823
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,601
He says he fought bravely.

824
01:00:27,045 --> 01:00:31,146
He threw stones and swung his wooden sword.

825
01:00:31,146 --> 01:00:32,481
In today's battle,

826
01:00:34,456 --> 01:00:37,351
sixteen of our soldiers died.

827
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:47,831
We won the battle, but the battlefield reeked of blood.

828
01:00:48,865 --> 01:00:52,160
- Lady Sa. - Yes, General.

829
01:00:52,466 --> 01:00:55,801
Do you know why I am not teaching Dal swordsmanship?

830
01:00:58,176 --> 01:00:59,841
Once he wields the sword,

831
01:01:03,045 --> 01:01:06,210
he is bound to see blood. That is the fate of a swordsman.

832
01:01:09,956 --> 01:01:11,380
I do not want Dal...

833
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:16,491
to follow in my bloody footsteps.

834
01:01:44,926 --> 01:01:46,620
Great job, Dal.

835
01:01:56,396 --> 01:01:57,700
Mother.

836
01:01:58,305 --> 01:02:00,660
What are you doing now?

837
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,466
(River Where the Moon Rises)

838
01:02:29,466 --> 01:02:33,235
All this happened because you married that wicked girl.

839
01:02:33,236 --> 01:02:36,636
You turned me into an ignorant country bumpkin.

840
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:39,006
I have been working together with the people...

841
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:40,976
to rebuild the Sunno Tribe.

842
01:02:40,976 --> 01:02:42,976
I believe we can cooperate.

843
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:44,946
You are special to me.

844
01:02:44,946 --> 01:02:46,886
My skills are not good enough.

845
01:02:46,886 --> 01:02:49,756
You should learn from a teacher who is more experienced than me.

846
01:02:49,756 --> 01:02:53,456
First, become completely blank. Skill comes after that.

847
01:02:53,456 --> 01:02:55,551
Please do not go, Mother.

848
01:02:56,456 --> 01:02:58,120
Run now.
