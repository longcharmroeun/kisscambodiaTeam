EPISODE 4

4
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,996
I do not need any of you!

5
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,306
You are foolish and vulgar!

6
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:25,606
Who is there?

7
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:32,946
Do not hide there like a rat.

8
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:34,647
Show yourself.

9
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:50,467
Do you...

10
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,467
recognize me?

11
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:57,607
You are...

12
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:02,306
Yes. I am Pyeonggang.

13
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:08,847
Why did you do it?

14
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:13,117
Why did you abandon me?

15
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,026
It is a ghost.

16
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,927
I see a ghost.

17
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:21,196
- Is anybody there?
- Father.

18
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:23,836
There is a ghost!

19
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,867
I saw a ghost!

20
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:28,567
There is a ghost in there!

21
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:31,977
Inside there! Get the ghost!

22
00:01:31,977 --> 00:01:34,306
Get the ghost!

23
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:39,946
The ghost...

24
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,517
A ghost... I saw a ghost.

25
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:47,987
KING PYEONGWON, 25TH KING OF GOGURYEO

26
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:51,427
This is how sick my soul is.

27
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:07,776
This stone will keep you safe.

28
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:09,307
Princess.

29
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:29,027
LADY GONGSON, PYEONGGANG'S NANNY

30
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,396
Princess.

31
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,166
Nanny.

32
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:44,717
Princess. It is you, right?

33
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:48,317
I am sorry.

34
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:51,087
I stayed alive.

35
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:57,826
Why would you say that?

36
00:02:58,157 --> 00:02:59,396
I am...

37
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:04,696
grateful that you are still alive.

38
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:07,567
I am so thankful.

39
00:03:08,236 --> 00:03:09,606
Nanny.

40
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:23,516
Who did you say attacked?

41
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:26,116
You are such a mess.

42
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:27,527
It was me.

43
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:29,757
GO SANG CHEOL, GYERU TRIBE COMMANDER

44
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:32,597
- General.
- They seemed to slack off,

45
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:34,967
so I teased them.

46
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:38,766
You have learned your
lesson. You may leave now.

47
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,407
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,206
GO GEON, GO WON PYO'S ELDEST,
LORD OF SONGHAK FORTRESS

49
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,807
Where is Lady Gongson?

50
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:52,277
How would you know that?

51
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:54,116
I asked a question.

52
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:57,087
I sent her to the palace on Gochuga's orders.

53
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:00,356
But the palace was turned upside-down.

54
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:03,597
- Why?
- The King saw a ghost.

55
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:08,097
But the ghost looked like the dead princess.

56
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:17,577
You grew up to be so beautiful...

57
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,736
and so elegant.

58
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:24,647
My father...

59
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,947
called me a ghost.

60
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,587
He would be in shock.

61
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:36,827
He lost all sense of reason...

62
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:39,227
a long time ago.

63
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:43,496
The Crown Prince is very concerned, is he not?

64
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:45,736
The Crown Prince...

65
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:52,637
Can you not rest here in peace tonight?

66
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:56,407
I will report to the King in the morning.

67
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:59,416
No. Not yet.

68
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,287
I must find out something first.

69
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,967
Halt.

70
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:23,407
I am Go Geon, Head of Capital Defense.

71
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,707
Who are you and where do you work?

72
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:32,077
We are 10 steps apart.

73
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:35,947
Even if you run, I will cut you down.

74
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:39,087
Reveal your identity.

75
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:43,356
You are trying to run
when you cannot even walk.

76
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:46,457
- Master Go.
- Yes, Your Highness.

77
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,767
It has been a long time, Master Go.

78
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,316
Is it really you, Princess?

79
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:08,816
Then the person I saw earlier...

80
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:15,287
- How have you been all...
- Halt.

81
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:19,157
If you let me go right now, we will both live.

82
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:21,767
If you do not,

83
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,796
one of us will die.

84
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:30,577
Why did you try to harm the King?

85
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:34,077
I must leave to find out why. Or actually...

86
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,447
I must go.

87
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:41,387
Let me go, Master Go.

88
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:51,957
Just 400m outside the
palace gate is our stable.

89
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,566
Show this and they will give you a horse.

90
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:08,806
Your Highness. Please return a princess.

91
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,916
If you come as an assassin,

92
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,186
then I will cut you down.

93
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:18,856
Who is there?

94
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:20,787
It is the Head of Capital Defense.

95
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,597
I think I had about two jugs.
Now it begins to taste bitter.

96
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:11,837
Where is my friend?

97
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:15,176
Why? Will you go on waiting?

98
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:18,277
Wake me when she comes.

99
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:21,147
I would like to nap.

100
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:24,556
If you are worried, untie me.

101
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,727
I cannot let my collateral go.

102
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:29,926
Your collateral is going to sleep.

103
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:34,526
Your guts earned you another chance.

104
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:36,996
One,

105
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:40,437
tell me all you know about
her and leave safely.

106
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:44,307
Or stay hanging upside-down
and wait aimlessly.

107
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,876
Of course, you will get no food or water.

108
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,047
I do not like going hungry.

109
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,116
Can you not just untie me?

110
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:01,126
There are five chunks of silver on her head.

111
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,297
I will make up for what my friend owes you.

112
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,996
1,000 nyang, was it?

113
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:15,807
You could have gotten out of here long ago.

114
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,707
Then my friend would feel
lost when she returns.

115
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:22,177
You trust that she will return.

116
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:25,577
She said she would, so she will.

117
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:30,957
You do not know anything about her.

118
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,786
Her real name, her real identity.

119
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:36,856
Knowing nothing,

120
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,957
you just believe what you want and wait.

121
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:40,967
I do not care about that.

122
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:44,097
I just want her to be okay.

123
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,297
She will return when she
finishes her business.

124
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:49,406
What shall I do first? I will do anything.

125
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:54,876
Whoa.

126
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:29,646
Does a monk called Wol Gwang live here?

127
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,577
WOL GWANG, YIBULLANSA MONK,
WAS A JEOLLO TRIBE GENERAL

128
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,526
Do you know...

129
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:49,727
who I am?

130
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:56,807
You have traveled far, Princess.

131
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:21,967
The King tried to use a human curtain.

132
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,866
TO USE PEOPLE AS COVER

133
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,406
It was the Queen's doing.

134
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:39,417
The Queen sent the princess' ghost.

135
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,187
What did she say?

136
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:44,156
She asked if I recognized her.

137
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:46,587
She said she was Pyeonggang.

138
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:49,286
She... She blamed me.

139
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:51,097
He has been like this all night.

140
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:53,756
You must relax.

141
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,727
Yes. I need an exorcism.

142
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,496
A massive exorcism.

143
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:58,866
An exorcism?

144
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,366
Try to calm down.

145
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:09,776
Organize an exorcism.

146
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:13,047
I need to get rid of the princess' ghost!

147
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,766
It is possible that in the near future,

148
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:36,366
I might get to meet your father.

149
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:49,616
What brings you here?

150
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,356
The princess...

151
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,327
is alive.

152
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:08,136
If father and daughter meet again,

153
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:11,406
before we even set up a plan,

154
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:13,906
things will spiral out of control.

155
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:20,547
Kill her as soon as you find her.

156
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,746
She is a Goguryeo princess.

157
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:25,516
That changes nothing.

158
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:29,927
She is just an assassin
who tried to kill the King.

159
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,156
Father!

160
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,496
I said kill her.

161
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:44,307
You should not kill the princess.

162
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:48,347
Do not say the word so freely.

163
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:52,817
Only Gochuga and a few people
on the Five Tribe council know.

164
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,616
That is why it is an opportunity.

165
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:57,856
If the princess were to return alive,

166
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:01,057
Gochuga is the one who
will feel most threatened.

167
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,886
We need him to waver...

168
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,427
if our Sono Tribe is to gain a foothold.

169
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:10,937
We shall just sit back and enjoy the ride.

170
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:16,236
It would be even better if we
were to catch the princess.

171
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:17,536
The princess?

172
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,447
Do you have a plan?

173
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:29,486
My plan involves a person.

174
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:34,187
- Gosh, you are strong.
- That is impressive.

175
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,957
Will you hurry up?

176
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,126
Step aside.

177
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,937
Give me that.

178
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:56,077
Oh, these poor things.

179
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,776
I pray you are born again as a human being.

180
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:01,687
I am sorry.

181
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:30,847
Hey!

182
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:33,947
You?

183
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:35,746
Why are you here?

184
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:37,817
What on earth are you doing here?

185
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:41,356
Me? I brewed some medicinal herbs.

186
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:44,297
Now I must trim the Siberian chrysanthemums.

187
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,197
- Siberian chrysanthemums?
- Yes.

188
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:48,766
These have a lovely smell.

189
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:50,866
Take some while you are here.

190
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:54,437
Do you even know Ghost Valley was overturned?

191
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:57,536
- Why?
- Why else? Because of you.

192
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,776
You followed a killer to Cheonjubang...

193
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:02,677
and did not return for days.
Of course, we were all worried.

194
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:05,947
Well, I was going to send word but...

195
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,516
Forget it. We are leaving.

196
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:10,847
Bow to your mom and beg for forgiveness.

197
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,687
If you do not, she will kill you.

198
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,087
I will return, but not now.

199
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:19,427
- What?
- Until Ga Jin returns,

200
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:21,266
I must wait here.

201
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,097
When will that be?

202
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:24,937
I do not know.

203
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:27,496
What is she to you?

204
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:31,807
Is she that important that you
would rather make your mom...

205
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:33,606
and everyone in Ghost Valley worry?

206
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:35,776
Yes.

207
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:41,587
Pung Gae.

208
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:45,116
I do not know why that is,

209
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:47,727
but that is how I feel.

210
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:49,156
You idiot.

211
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,156
You eat all the Siberian chrysanthemums.

212
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,266
Tell my mom not to worry.

213
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:56,896
I do not care, you moron.

214
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,136
Why did he hit me so hard?

215
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:42,746
Ga Jin.

216
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:44,647
Deer.

217
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:54,316
What happened to you?

218
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,986
You were waiting.

219
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:00,897
I said I would wait.

220
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,096
Are you all right?

221
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,967
I have nowhere to go.

222
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:09,437
I do not know...

223
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:12,377
where to go.

224
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:14,036
You silly.

225
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,076
You do have a place to go.

226
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:20,677
Home.

227
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:22,746
Come with me.

228
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,286
Where are you going?

229
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:35,427
You must pay what you owe.
You cannot just leave.

230
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:38,836
How can you mention money right now?

231
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:42,236
She came back half-dead. That is so cruel.

232
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,677
What did you tell her?

233
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,107
Dal.

234
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,617
I promise to pay what I owe.

235
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,046
Did you find out what you wished to?

236
00:18:57,016 --> 00:19:00,657
Leave it. I told you not
to go and you insisted.

237
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:04,326
Take the horse to cover some of the debt.

238
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,526
I will pay the rest.

239
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:07,796
We should go.

240
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:13,736
Will you just let them go?

241
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,637
Let them be.

242
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:22,947
The South Gate?

243
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:24,776
No. I searched even the empty homes.

244
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:27,246
If we searched everywhere
and could not find her,

245
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:28,917
Ga Jin is not here.

246
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:31,556
Must we taste something to know what it is?

247
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,887
We keep searching until I say we stop.

248
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:37,326
Wait. What about...

249
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:41,526
Shall we go over the layout of the Capital?

250
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:43,526
- Forget it.
- Wait.

251
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:08,486
It is called Ghost Valley,

252
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,026
but it is just a village.

253
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:15,867
People who got chased from
Goguryeo gathered here,

254
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,096
creating a village.

255
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:20,937
Come with me.

256
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:25,306
- Dal.
- Yes, hello.

257
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:27,177
What is up?

258
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:32,816
Who is the girl?

259
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,447
Is it not obvious?

260
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:36,887
He saved her from death.

261
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:42,026
Dal has the worst kind of karma.

262
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:44,157
Can you not say that?

263
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:46,157
If he did not rescue you,

264
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,967
you and you both would
have died on the mountain.

265
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,397
I did not deny that.

266
00:20:50,397 --> 00:20:54,167
Yes. We owe Dal our lives.
He is our lifesaver.

267
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:55,806
Not me.

268
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,437
He might have saved you,

269
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:01,746
but our chief saved me.

270
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:03,746
Good for you.

271
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:16,427
It may look disastrous right now,

272
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,326
but it will be fine after some fixing up.

273
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:37,346
Come in.

274
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:40,677
Gosh, look at the cobwebs.

275
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:51,756
Are you hungry?

276
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:56,367
These are corn cakes. Have this for dinner.

277
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:58,566
If you are to cook,

278
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:00,736
you will need a cauldron and bowls.

279
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,066
I will bring that tomorrow.

280
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:09,647
Here.

281
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,917
Did everything work out in the palace?

282
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:17,617
You took longer than I
thought, so I was worried.

283
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:26,157
Oh, dear. The roof needs fixing.

284
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:28,596
So does the wall.

285
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:32,167
- Deer.
- Yes? What?

286
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:33,836
I want to sleep.

287
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:35,937
Yes. You must be tired.

288
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,576
You must sleep.

289
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:42,477
Get some rest.

290
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,096
She only knows her name.

291
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,167
Yeom Ga Jin.

292
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:08,566
But that is not her real name.

293
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:11,367
She hurt her head and does
not remember anything.

294
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:14,276
Can you please let her stay here...

295
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:17,276
at least until she gets her energy back?

296
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:21,947
She is a Cheonjubang killer.

297
00:23:22,016 --> 00:23:23,816
Would they not do something?

298
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:26,857
They will come all the way
here to find their comrade.

299
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:29,657
She said she would kill no more.

300
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:31,427
That is what you think.

301
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:33,357
She said that herself.

302
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:36,627
- Dal.
- Yes, Chief?

303
00:23:36,796 --> 00:23:39,897
Ghost Valley consists of
Sunno Tribe survivors,

304
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:43,036
and people who managed to survive...

305
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:46,377
but must stay in hiding.

306
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:49,846
I know that.

307
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,846
I do not know the girl's story,

308
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:54,947
but if for some reason...

309
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:57,316
she puts our village in danger,

310
00:23:58,256 --> 00:24:00,586
I myself will not allow that.

311
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:02,687
I will take full responsibility.

312
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,326
Can I trust you with that?

313
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,897
- Yes.
- Father.

314
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:09,326
Dal said he will be responsible.
That is good enough.

315
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:11,026
Do not mention it again.

316
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:14,066
Thank you, Chief.

317
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:18,407
Your mother is greatly concerned.

318
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:20,377
Did you visit her?

319
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:26,677
Mother, I am hungry.

320
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:28,117
Give me food!

321
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:30,316
My gosh.

322
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,887
You troublemaker.

323
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:35,286
I will kill you and then take my own life!

324
00:24:35,286 --> 00:24:38,127
- Come here, you fool!
- You will hurt yourself.

325
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:40,056
Let go of me.

326
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:43,496
- My gosh. You are strong.
- I am!

327
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:47,937
Wait. What is this sound?

328
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:03,516
She has been through so much pain
both mentally and physically.

329
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,217
She had nowhere to go, so I
took her to an empty house.

330
00:25:06,217 --> 00:25:08,727
She must be very pretty, then.

331
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:11,486
- What?
- Is she so pretty that...

332
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:13,157
she makes your heart pound?

333
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:14,496
Not that again.

334
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,326
Do you plan to make her your wife?

335
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:20,536
What do you mean? Me and Ga Jin?

336
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:22,536
My goodness...

337
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,536
Drink some cold water and wake up.

338
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,536
A person whose fate is twisted...

339
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:29,006
will twist the fate of those around them.

340
00:25:29,246 --> 00:25:31,917
- I can straighten it out for her.
- What do you know about her?

341
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,717
Does the past matter?

342
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:35,647
I can look after her in the future.

343
00:25:39,556 --> 00:25:41,217
He has fallen for her so bad.

344
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:53,967
I knew you were the princess
as soon as I saw you.

345
00:25:55,506 --> 00:25:58,107
There is no way the Queen
could return to life,

346
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:00,607
so you must be her daughter.

347
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:04,006
The day Mother died.

348
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,877
I must know what happened that day.

349
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:13,786
Wol Gwang.

350
00:26:15,986 --> 00:26:17,957
When I returned,

351
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:20,397
blood had already been shed.

352
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,967
Because of some groundless rumor,

353
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:28,407
the King suspected the Queen and me.

354
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:34,607
He lost his mind and took many lives.

355
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:40,776
The Sunno Tribe also suffered for no reason.

356
00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:43,316
They were framed for treason.

357
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:51,927
Someone's greed and treachery...

358
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:54,127
caused a great tragedy.

359
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:00,596
Then...

360
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:04,407
the rumor surrounding my mother...

361
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:07,736
It is nonsense.

362
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:10,407
She did marry at a young age,

363
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:13,816
but the Queen truly loved
her husband and king.

364
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:15,387
Then why...

365
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,917
did you not tell the King the truth?

366
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,486
Even if it were late, you should have...

367
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:24,286
He would not have believed it.

368
00:27:25,697 --> 00:27:28,157
His doubt caused him to kill his wife.

369
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:31,496
He would be unable to accept the truth.

370
00:27:32,496 --> 00:27:34,897
He knew I was alive,

371
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:37,137
and yet he never came to see me.

372
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:42,506
He could not...

373
00:27:43,346 --> 00:27:46,816
bring himself to face his past mistake.

374
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:52,657
It is my fault.

375
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,586
If I were not there,

376
00:27:59,697 --> 00:28:02,596
Father would not have become jealous.

377
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:08,607
Do you know...

378
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:12,407
the kind of life I lived so far?

379
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,776
I became a killer.

380
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:24,947
I killed people as if they were insects.

381
00:28:27,617 --> 00:28:29,427
With this sword,

382
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,296
I even tried to harm my father.

383
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:38,937
Now...

384
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:43,066
How am I to live now?

385
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,137
You must find...

386
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:54,576
a way to live as a princess.

387
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:23,846
These are corn cakes. Have this for dinner.

388
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:41,397
Gosh. The moon is so bright.

389
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:03,044
You must have some urgent news...

390
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:05,014
seeing that you came here yourself.

391
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:07,014
That is nonsense.

392
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:10,654
I just came outside to get some sun.

393
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,195
You own the biggest herb store in Goguryeo.

394
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:15,555
You cannot possibly be that free.

395
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:19,665
I heard His Majesty ordered
people to carry out exorcism...

396
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,865
because of the ghost he saw.

397
00:30:23,464 --> 00:30:24,964
I heard it is going to be a very big ritual.

398
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:28,805
We live in a troubled
world, so things happen.

399
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:31,574
I cannot believe he saw
a ghost in the palace.

400
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:35,775
I will leave you to enjoy the sun.

401
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:38,015
Many herb collectors go to Mount Daeseong...

402
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,485
to collect herbs.

403
00:30:42,115 --> 00:30:45,854
And recently, an herb
collector came from there...

404
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,894
along with a woman...

405
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:52,964
who looked just like the woman
in the drawing you showed me.

406
00:30:56,594 --> 00:30:58,404
- Is that true?
- Well...

407
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:01,134
I might have been mistaken.

408
00:31:02,275 --> 00:31:03,275
Mount Daeseong?

409
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,844
She is the owner of the Jangbaek herb store.

410
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:10,484
She was adopted by Hae Ji Weol.

411
00:31:14,214 --> 00:31:18,285
Is she the one who makes the
intoxicating drugs for the king?

412
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:19,384
Yes.

413
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:22,824
Bring her to me.

414
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:24,764
Yes, my lord.

415
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:39,574
Dal.

416
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:43,744
Gosh, is he going to do that all by himself?

417
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:45,484
It will be very tiring.

418
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:48,714
Dal is a very strong man.

419
00:31:48,714 --> 00:31:50,384
He might even marry her soon.

420
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:53,794
Dal is only helping her
because he is kind at heart.

421
00:31:59,594 --> 00:32:01,765
Do not even think of
making me do all the work.

422
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:05,105
I am only going to help you a little bit.

423
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:08,305
We should get rid of everything on the floor.

424
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:13,675
What are you doing? Here.

425
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:31,194
You are doing great.

426
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:47,714
Gosh, my back.

427
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:53,754
It looks like a bird's nest. Great job.

428
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:05,765
My gosh, seriously.

429
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:09,395
My goodness.

430
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:10,605
You smiled.

431
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:14,735
See? You should smile like that.

432
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,205
That will make everything better.

433
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:18,675
Dal!

434
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,374
Dal.

435
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:23,645
Dal!

436
00:33:26,115 --> 00:33:27,254
What is all that?

437
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:29,214
You cannot help her all by yourself.

438
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:30,325
It will take too long.

439
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:32,085
This stuff is easy.

440
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:33,994
We saw everything.

441
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:37,025
You are here to fix things, but
you totally destroyed the roof.

442
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:41,365
The sun will not be out
for long. Let us hurry.

443
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:42,765
You came such a long way.

444
00:33:46,335 --> 00:33:48,034
You should get some rest.

445
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,874
Where should I put the bucket of water?

446
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:53,404
Where should I put it?

447
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:00,855
They came to greet you.

448
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:02,455
They are here to welcome you to Ghost Valley.

449
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:07,294
Let us hurry.

450
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:39,654
Why are you so nice to me?

451
00:34:39,984 --> 00:34:40,995
What?

452
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,395
I did nothing for you.

453
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:45,265
Because you do not take care of yourself.

454
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:52,205
You deserve someone to look after you.

455
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:55,005
Are you upset that it is me?

456
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:58,804
Do not overthink things.

457
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:01,015
It is better to keep your body busy.

458
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,185
I have to go home now.

459
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:08,315
You should also go home and get some rest.

460
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:18,294
She is so young. Eat up.

461
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:20,125
You should also eat.

462
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:23,534
Is it that yummy?

463
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,265
Ga Jin.

464
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:27,904
Come and eat with us.

465
00:35:27,904 --> 00:35:29,275
She is right. Come on.

466
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:32,544
- It is okay.
- This does not happen often here.

467
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,745
You should fill yourself up when
there is a memorial service.

468
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:37,015
- Come on.
- She is right. Join us.

469
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:44,154
Whose memorial service is it?

470
00:35:44,154 --> 00:35:47,825
He used to be a general and
the leader of everyone here.

471
00:35:48,094 --> 00:35:50,825
He passed away while trying
to save the villagers.

472
00:35:51,294 --> 00:35:52,594
Am I right?

473
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:56,294
Only the elders and Sunno
Tribe members knew him.

474
00:35:56,594 --> 00:35:58,664
We came to the village later
on, so we do not know anything.

475
00:35:58,664 --> 00:36:00,804
You do not need to know much.

476
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:02,705
Dal's character already proves
what a great man he must have been.

477
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,515
Deer... I mean, what about Dal?

478
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:10,114
Dal is his son.

479
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:11,645
General On Hyeop.

480
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:13,614
I guess she did not know.

481
00:36:15,114 --> 00:36:16,755
- "General On Hyeop"?
- Eat up.

482
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,054
The race cake turned out nice.

483
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:19,154
It is very delicious.

484
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:34,705
Everyone here is safe...

485
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:37,344
just like what you had hoped for.

486
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:42,775
So do not worry too much.

487
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:45,044
GENERAL ON HYEOP

488
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,125
Dal.

489
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,025
There will be...

490
00:36:57,224 --> 00:36:58,224
no revenge.

491
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,195
Father...

492
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:02,435
There should be no resentment...

493
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:05,835
in your life.

494
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:09,974
Live like a fool...

495
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:15,315
and live peacefully...

496
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:17,645
and quietly.

497
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:20,955
Father.

498
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:23,755
Father...

499
00:37:24,654 --> 00:37:25,984
Father.

500
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:28,625
Father.

501
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:00,794
Is it not great?

502
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:01,794
Get that out of my face.

503
00:38:02,924 --> 00:38:04,664
What is so great about a wood carving?

504
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:08,265
Once I become a ruler, I
will rule the entire cavalry.

505
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:10,135
You cannot become a ruler
just because you want to.

506
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:11,505
You need to receive
acknowledgement from our people.

507
00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:12,804
What is your name?

508
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:15,835
My name is On Dal, the future
general of this country.

509
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:20,515
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.

510
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,145
That is my name. On Dal.

511
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:39,525
As of now, the man
stronger than Go Won Pyo...

512
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:42,434
is General On Hyeop who stands before us.

513
00:38:50,574 --> 00:38:53,645
I advise you to stay away from swords.

514
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:56,745
It is okay. I am going to become a ruler.

515
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:58,044
I am proud to hear that.

516
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,115
When that day comes,

517
00:39:00,115 --> 00:39:03,215
that sword will be used to protect you.

518
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:07,495
The Sunno Tribe also suffered for no reason.

519
00:39:07,794 --> 00:39:09,554
They were framed for treason.

520
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:14,334
- Father!
- No!

521
00:39:16,265 --> 00:39:17,605
Father!

522
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:50,235
We are not allowed to go any further.

523
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:52,635
This mountain is apparently
filled with lost souls...

524
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:54,375
that were abandoned by Goguryeo.

525
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:56,304
Is that so?

526
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:01,245
Then we are at the right place.

527
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:06,084
We are here to find the
ghost of the princess.

528
00:40:45,324 --> 00:40:46,584
Ga Jin.

529
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:49,095
Ga Jin.

530
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:55,865
Where is she?

531
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,105
Where did she go? Dal!

532
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:01,635
Wol, have you seen Ga Jin?

533
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:04,304
Is she not home? Did you not meet her?

534
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:07,914
- What is the matter?
- The thing is,

535
00:41:07,914 --> 00:41:11,184
she suddenly ran somewhere
in the middle of her meal.

536
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,985
We are all very worried about her.

537
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:22,154
Do you think she left?

538
00:41:22,824 --> 00:41:23,824
No.

539
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:27,095
Dal!

540
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:50,255
How...

541
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:54,725
How did I fail to recognize you?

542
00:41:56,495 --> 00:41:59,525
- Ga Jin!
- Ga Jin!

543
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:02,495
- Ga Jin!
- Ga Jin!

544
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:04,334
- Ga Jin!
- Ga Jin!

545
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:05,404
- Ga Jin!
- Ga Jin!

546
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:07,304
- Ga Jin!
- Ga Jin!

547
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:09,775
- Ga Jin!
- Where are you?

548
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:12,105
- Ga Jin!
- Ga Jin!

549
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:14,544
- Ga Jin!
- Where is she?

550
00:42:14,544 --> 00:42:17,044
- Ga Jin!
- Where did she go?

551
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:19,015
Ga Jin!

552
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:20,855
Who are you looking for?

553
00:42:25,654 --> 00:42:26,885
A dog.

554
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:31,294
You all came out here just to find a dog?

555
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:38,534
Do you live in Ghost Valley?

556
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:43,404
No, I live down the mountain.

557
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:45,044
How dare you lie to me.

558
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:46,505
Hey.

559
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,475
Dal.

560
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:52,885
You should go back.

561
00:42:52,885 --> 00:42:55,814
What are you going to do? He has a sword.

562
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:59,184
- I told you to go.
- I will bring the others.

563
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:06,164
I have no time for a country bumpkin.

564
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:08,365
I am here to find someone.

565
00:43:08,534 --> 00:43:09,995
There are no humans here.

566
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:15,404
There are only ghosts in this village.

567
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:16,534
Is that so?

568
00:43:19,245 --> 00:43:20,505
Then let us see...

569
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:22,914
if a ghost sheds blood.

570
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:25,284
You are starting to scare me.

571
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:27,284
You seem...

572
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:30,515
very similar to the man who was
held hostage at the herb store.

573
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:33,485
Where is the lady that ran away...

574
00:43:33,755 --> 00:43:34,824
from the palace?

575
00:43:34,824 --> 00:43:36,025
I do not know.

576
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,025
I do not know of her.

577
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:41,495
You leave me no choice but to hurt you.

578
00:43:52,304 --> 00:43:54,845
You are the first person to
walk past the straw threads.

579
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,515
I must say, you are brave.

580
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:59,784
Country bumpkin, quit playing around.

581
00:44:00,444 --> 00:44:01,454
Okay?

582
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,725
I want to help, but I cannot do that.

583
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:09,424
Things will get complicated if the
world finds out about Ghost Valley.

584
00:44:09,654 --> 00:44:11,365
I am not interested in you or the villagers.

585
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:13,495
I am here to find the princess!

586
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:14,595
"Princess"?

587
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:16,934
What are you talking about?

588
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:22,034
I am sorry, but this country
bumpkin does not have time for you.

589
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,804
The Jangbaek herb store!

590
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:25,875
You left that place along with the princess!

591
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:29,275
What...

592
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:31,845
did you just say...

593
00:44:32,715 --> 00:44:34,044
right after "Jangbaek herb store"?

594
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:35,914
She is the daughter of the king.

595
00:44:36,784 --> 00:44:38,324
That is whom...

596
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:40,324
you left with.

597
00:44:42,495 --> 00:44:43,755
Princess Pyeonggang.

598
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:49,595
How can you call yourself
the princess of Goguryeo?

599
00:44:50,164 --> 00:44:51,834
If you give up now,

600
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:53,704
that will be the end of Goguryeo.

601
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:56,404
Who says I am going to give up?

602
00:45:00,304 --> 00:45:02,015
We are in trouble. Hurry.

603
00:45:02,944 --> 00:45:04,044
Dal.

604
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:06,414
Are you okay? I heard you
had to fight a soldier.

605
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:07,444
Where is Ga Jin?

606
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:08,454
The only place we did not check is...

607
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:10,314
by the entrance where people pass by.

608
00:45:10,554 --> 00:45:12,554
This is the first time
a soldier came this far.

609
00:45:13,025 --> 00:45:14,125
What are we going to do?

610
00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:15,525
Stop causing a fuss.

611
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:16,995
I will deal with this.

612
00:45:16,995 --> 00:45:18,725
I want you guys to take
everyone back to the village.

613
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:20,465
- Okay.
- I told you...

614
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:23,034
that lady will only bring trouble.

615
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,934
I said I will deal with it.

616
00:45:33,204 --> 00:45:34,515
We should go.

617
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:37,115
Okay. Come on. Let us go.

618
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,794
This stone will keep you safe.

619
00:45:52,895 --> 00:45:55,294
You had this necklace at the time.

620
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:58,135
Do you remember anything?

621
00:45:59,235 --> 00:46:01,275
Gosh, I am so dumb.

622
00:46:02,074 --> 00:46:04,304
I cannot believe I did not
notice even after I saw that.

623
00:46:05,044 --> 00:46:06,174
My goodness.

624
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:22,395
I must have been out of my mind.

625
00:46:25,294 --> 00:46:26,495
Who did I think I was...

626
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:29,895
to live an ordinary life?

627
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:35,775
I put you...

628
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,375
and the people of your tribe in danger.

629
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:43,475
I must have no shame.

630
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:03,594
What do you think you
are doing? Are you crazy?

631
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:04,864
Let go of me.

632
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:06,604
- I cannot.
- Let go.

633
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,235
If I let you go, you will jump off.

634
00:47:08,304 --> 00:47:09,705
Just let go of me!

635
00:47:10,505 --> 00:47:12,475
You will regret...

636
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:15,044
saving my life.

637
00:47:15,044 --> 00:47:16,044
Why?

638
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:18,185
Because you are Princess Pyeonggang?

639
00:47:21,814 --> 00:47:22,955
How did you...

640
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:24,485
You are sorry now?

641
00:47:25,485 --> 00:47:27,155
You would rather die?

642
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:30,354
I am the one who wants to die.

643
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:32,025
How did you find out?

644
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:34,935
Since when?

645
00:47:35,235 --> 00:47:37,294
Today. Just now.

646
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:39,665
The arrogant soldier told me...

647
00:47:40,034 --> 00:47:41,604
that he is here to find the princess.

648
00:47:44,304 --> 00:47:45,675
How could it be you?

649
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:49,074
What am I supposed to do now?

650
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:52,284
Your father...

651
00:47:53,544 --> 00:47:57,584
killed my father and annihilated my tribe.

652
00:47:58,784 --> 00:48:00,425
Why does it have to be you?

653
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:03,054
I do not know.

654
00:48:04,124 --> 00:48:06,195
I feel so guilty.

655
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:10,235
I do not know what I should do now.

656
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:15,104
I would rather just kill myself.

657
00:48:20,104 --> 00:48:21,515
Listen to me carefully.

658
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:25,015
Your life is not yours alone.

659
00:48:25,644 --> 00:48:28,384
The people of the Sunno Tribe,

660
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:33,324
my father, and I sacrificed
our lives to save you.

661
00:48:33,685 --> 00:48:35,955
If you want to kill yourself,
you need to get their permission.

662
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:40,394
Stop trying to kill yourself
when your life is not yours.

663
00:48:43,435 --> 00:48:44,435
Dal.

664
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:48,935
We need to get rid of the
soldier who came looking for you.

665
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:53,074
Leave it to me.

666
00:48:54,574 --> 00:48:56,044
I am the source of misfortune,

667
00:48:56,915 --> 00:48:58,284
so I must end it myself.

668
00:49:01,084 --> 00:49:02,084
I will do it.

669
00:49:14,564 --> 00:49:16,564
They are here to get that woman.

670
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,034
At this rate, they will raid the village.

671
00:49:19,634 --> 00:49:21,705
Seeing how they cut
through the warning ropes,

672
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:22,935
they are not here to play.

673
00:49:22,935 --> 00:49:25,275
I knew this would happen.

674
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:27,775
I told you not to let just
anyone into the village.

675
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:29,775
My gosh, when did you ever say that?

676
00:49:29,775 --> 00:49:31,215
You brat. I definitely...

677
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:33,314
Come on! Keep quiet.

678
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:35,715
We cannot take it lying down!

679
00:49:37,455 --> 00:49:38,455
Pung Gae!

680
00:49:41,894 --> 00:49:43,425
It is time for war.

681
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:46,225
What? But Dal is not here.

682
00:49:46,225 --> 00:49:47,225
Get ready.

683
00:49:55,205 --> 00:49:56,834
Are you here to save me?

684
00:50:01,814 --> 00:50:04,544
Or are you here to seal my lips?

685
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:05,544
Master Go.

686
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:08,854
You should not have come here.

687
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:10,814
I came to save you, Your Highness.

688
00:50:10,985 --> 00:50:12,284
The princess is dead.

689
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:16,495
The assassin you are after
has already disappeared too.

690
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,094
I do not think...

691
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:24,165
my father will give up that easily.

692
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:29,804
That is why I have to kill you.

693
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:32,975
Not for me...

694
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:35,945
but for the people of this village.

695
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:38,284
I do not want to put this village in danger.

696
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:40,715
Your Highness, I only want to take you...

697
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:42,215
I said, the princess is dead!

698
00:50:51,054 --> 00:50:52,364
She died...

699
00:50:53,824 --> 00:50:55,034
eight years ago.

700
00:51:02,705 --> 00:51:04,374
Are you going to stay in this village?

701
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:06,005
Even if I want to,

702
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:08,814
I cannot stay here anymore.

703
00:51:10,344 --> 00:51:13,185
Because my father and my country...

704
00:51:14,884 --> 00:51:16,814
destroyed their lives.

705
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:19,624
Then let us go back to
the palace, Your Highness.

706
00:51:20,185 --> 00:51:21,195
No.

707
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:23,824
Since you have found this place,

708
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:26,465
no one is going back safely.

709
00:51:34,034 --> 00:51:35,205
Hey, Yeom Ga Jin!

710
00:51:39,044 --> 00:51:40,374
Have you not given up being an assassin?

711
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:42,074
Is killing a man that easy for you?

712
00:51:42,844 --> 00:51:44,475
I will take care of him instead of you.

713
00:51:44,475 --> 00:51:45,985
I did not say I was going to kill him.

714
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:47,144
Nothing will change anyway.

715
00:51:47,144 --> 00:51:49,614
- Yeom Ga Jin!
- Show courtesy to the princess!

716
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:58,094
I will not mention this village.

717
00:51:59,665 --> 00:52:01,394
So please come with me to the palace.

718
00:52:07,034 --> 00:52:08,905
I do not believe any word
from the Gyeru Tribe.

719
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:11,874
Do not be fooled.

720
00:52:11,874 --> 00:52:13,374
Who is giving me that advice?

721
00:52:14,104 --> 00:52:16,374
The mighty princess or
the assassin Yeom Ga Jin?

722
00:52:21,614 --> 00:52:23,655
We do not need a princess in our village.

723
00:52:24,854 --> 00:52:27,425
But we will take in a girl
who has no place to go.

724
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:42,775
It is the ghosts.

725
00:52:51,784 --> 00:52:52,945
What are those?

726
00:53:10,165 --> 00:53:12,104
They must be the ghosts of the mountain.

727
00:53:12,205 --> 00:53:13,364
Nonsense.

728
00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:28,584
Those jerks...

729
00:53:34,425 --> 00:53:36,225
- Oh, no.
- Keep quiet!

730
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:39,965
Stop right there.

731
00:53:42,064 --> 00:53:43,064
General Go.

732
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,304
We made a trip in vain.

733
00:53:47,534 --> 00:53:49,005
There is nothing in this mountain.

734
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:51,275
Besides,

735
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:53,604
this mountain is bewitched.

736
00:53:53,945 --> 00:53:55,314
It is not a place to live.

737
00:53:55,945 --> 00:53:57,745
What about the search?

738
00:53:58,584 --> 00:53:59,884
We are returning to Pyeongyang Castle.

739
00:54:13,894 --> 00:54:15,364
I nearly died out there.

740
00:54:38,854 --> 00:54:40,324
They were the royal soldiers!

741
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:44,094
You can only scare away the
herb collectors and poachers.

742
00:54:44,225 --> 00:54:46,925
How can you pull a stunt like
that on the royal soldiers?

743
00:54:47,064 --> 00:54:48,064
In the end,

744
00:54:48,935 --> 00:54:50,695
they went away.

745
00:54:50,935 --> 00:54:52,005
What did you say?

746
00:54:52,965 --> 00:54:57,435
My goodness. Please calm down, Chief.

747
00:54:57,435 --> 00:54:59,844
Everyone is safe, so that settles it.

748
00:55:00,374 --> 00:55:03,415
Pung Gae was so brave.

749
00:55:05,915 --> 00:55:07,084
I apologize.

750
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:11,155
This all happened because of me,

751
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:14,425
so I will leave the village.

752
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:15,495
My gosh.

753
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:18,394
You said you have nowhere else
to go. Where are you going?

754
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:21,195
This can happen again.

755
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:25,034
I will not cause trouble anymore.

756
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:31,074
Come on! Everyone here is the same.

757
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:34,275
From him to her, everyone
causes trouble here.

758
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:37,574
This guy, for instance. His name is Seok Gu.

759
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:39,544
He used to work at a stable,

760
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,415
but he ran away because he did
not want to starve and be beaten.

761
00:55:42,784 --> 00:55:44,354
And Pil Gu over here...

762
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:46,185
I was taken to Jangan Castle.

763
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:48,655
They made me work all day and all night.

764
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:50,094
So I ran away in the middle of the night.

765
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:54,124
They are still bent on finding me!

766
00:55:54,695 --> 00:55:56,195
My goodness.

767
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:58,134
Why are you keeping quiet?

768
00:55:58,505 --> 00:56:00,005
You are the one who brought her here.

769
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:01,405
I found out...

770
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,675
who I am.

771
00:56:05,675 --> 00:56:08,515
Your injured head is all healed now?

772
00:56:09,044 --> 00:56:10,144
But...

773
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:14,215
if you find out who I am,

774
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:17,354
you will not be able to forgive me.

775
00:56:17,455 --> 00:56:19,725
We do not get surprised by
most stories, so it is okay.

776
00:56:19,725 --> 00:56:21,955
You can just share it with us.

777
00:56:22,455 --> 00:56:23,695
Actually...

778
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:29,995
The reason everyone here, including
On Dal, has to live in hiding...

779
00:56:30,495 --> 00:56:32,205
is because...

780
00:56:34,735 --> 00:56:35,834
I am...

781
00:56:38,304 --> 00:56:39,405
Goguryeo's...

782
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:42,574
- and the king's...
- She is an assassin!

783
00:56:42,715 --> 00:56:44,144
- What?
- What?

784
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:45,985
- What did he say?
- I have no idea.

785
00:56:47,185 --> 00:56:49,114
- An assassin of Cheonjubang.
- An assassin?

786
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,185
You have heard of it, right?

787
00:56:50,354 --> 00:56:54,384
They are willing to risk anything
to kill the king of Goguryeo.

788
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:56,755
That is who Ga Jin used to be, an assassin.

789
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:58,495
- An assassin?
- An assassin?

790
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:00,965
A slim woman like her?

791
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:03,495
But you are not an assassin now, right?

792
00:57:03,935 --> 00:57:05,905
You said you would quit.

793
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:08,534
That is why Dal brought you to Ghost Valley.

794
00:57:13,405 --> 00:57:15,814
Then that settles it!

795
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:17,844
Is that not right, Chief?

796
00:57:17,844 --> 00:57:18,884
Of course.

797
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:23,685
I will take responsibility.

798
00:57:24,015 --> 00:57:25,925
I am the one who brought Ga Jin.

799
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:27,824
Since I said that I will take responsibility,

800
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:30,594
I will take whatever punishment you give.

801
00:57:31,054 --> 00:57:32,525
Stop it, Dal.

802
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:37,265
It is late, so everyone
go back to your homes!

803
00:57:37,364 --> 00:57:38,834
I will give him punishment later.

804
00:57:42,574 --> 00:57:43,604
Let us go.

805
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:45,905
I cannot believe it.

806
00:57:46,905 --> 00:57:47,905
She was an assassin?

807
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:57,755
- Dal.
- Do not ask.

808
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:00,755
I also do not know.

809
00:58:02,394 --> 00:58:03,755
You can go...

810
00:58:04,695 --> 00:58:06,594
and find a way to live on your own.

811
00:58:33,554 --> 00:58:36,155
The princess is alive?

812
00:58:36,925 --> 00:58:39,094
Kill her as soon as you find her.

813
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:40,794
The princess is dead.

814
00:58:46,165 --> 00:58:50,104
What if you must choose between
the royal household and your tribe?

815
00:58:50,104 --> 00:58:51,374
I do not care for either.

816
00:58:52,044 --> 00:58:55,015
Because I will choose you.

817
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:16,634
You are all dismissed.

818
00:59:24,705 --> 00:59:26,245
Your Majesty, you mentioned...

819
00:59:26,804 --> 00:59:28,915
that you have seen the ghost
of the princess, right?

820
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:34,945
That is why I told Gochuga to
prepare an exorcism ritual.

821
00:59:36,384 --> 00:59:38,485
I do not know what is taking him so long.

822
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:41,225
You did not see a ghost, Your Majesty.

823
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:45,064
- What did you say?
- The princess...

824
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:46,824
is alive.

825
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:54,165
General Go, you must be still drunk like me.

826
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,905
I have seen the princess
myself, Your Majesty.

827
01:00:02,215 --> 01:00:04,215
Do not mock me.

828
01:00:34,604 --> 01:00:35,614
"Pyeonggang".

829
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:39,314
It is a blessed and strong name.

830
01:00:41,245 --> 01:00:42,814
That is your name, Pyeonggang.

831
01:00:43,155 --> 01:00:44,284
Do you like it?

832
01:00:44,655 --> 01:00:46,725
Now that we have a healthy princess,

833
01:00:47,284 --> 01:00:50,755
Goguryeo will become a stronger nation.

834
01:00:55,094 --> 01:00:56,435
It is jade.

835
01:00:56,864 --> 01:01:00,364
The meaning of jade is good
health and immutability.

836
01:01:00,735 --> 01:01:04,175
Just like this jade, my love
for you will not change.

837
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:07,975
Thank you.

838
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,455
I am Pyeonggang.

839
01:01:30,094 --> 01:01:33,864
I will figure out a way to
bring back the princess safely.

840
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:35,975
You can give us your order...

841
01:01:37,505 --> 01:01:39,505
when we are ready to go, Your Majesty.

842
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:10,086
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

843
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:21,365


844
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,105
Ga Jin!

845
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:24,744
Do not go.

846
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,875
Live as Yeom Ga Jin with us.

847
01:02:27,105 --> 01:02:29,045
The assassin brought the body?

848
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,585
She looks like the assassin who is wanted.

849
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:33,984
I am sure she is the princess.

850
01:02:34,345 --> 01:02:36,154
You are doing everything for me.

851
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:37,384
Is there anything I can do for you?

852
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,255
It is something very difficult.

853
01:02:40,654 --> 01:02:41,724
Will you be okay with it?
