EPISODE 2

4
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:33,447
No need to thank me.

5
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:36,818
Hey.

6
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:43,788
You cannot just walk off.

7
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:03,638
What are you doing?

8
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,918
I know you.

9
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:22,157
I know you.

10
00:01:23,998 --> 00:01:25,657
How would you know me?

11
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:27,597
The killer.

12
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:29,698
What?

13
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,267
"The devil who kills."

14
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:36,838
We never met. Do not talk nonsense.

15
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:40,308
Men are dying and you did not bat
an eyelid. That makes you a killer.

16
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,778
What are you?

17
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:48,618
I work at the palace.

18
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,588
I visited my family and
got lost on the way back.

19
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:00,728
That is a relief, then.

20
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:04,698
If a pretty girl like
you were really a killer,

21
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:06,597
I would have been very sad.

22
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:10,507
If you just walk off, you are a killer.

23
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:13,377
You are no maid.

24
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:19,377
You should treat them at least.

25
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:22,118
They will really die if
you leave them like that.

26
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:28,688
These are some precious herbs
I picked from the mountainside.

27
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,558
Grind it up and put it on their wounds.

28
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,907
You made such a fuss,

29
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:50,048
I thought you would bury the deer.

30
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:52,548
I meant we should not torment it to death.

31
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:54,387
Hunting is a necessity.

32
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:58,218
It is survival and the way of nature.

33
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:12,368
Oh, dear. I think I am dying.

34
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,708
Stay still.

35
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:24,518
Stay still.

36
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:32,387
Go.

37
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:36,028
- I said go.
- Okay. Thank you.

38
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:41,667
I almost died. Wait up.

39
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,868
Happy now?

40
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,238
Hey.

41
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:58,278
What are you doing?

42
00:03:58,278 --> 00:04:01,118
You got hurt too.

43
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:04,357
Here.

44
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:11,958
From now on, do not hurt others...

45
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:14,167
and look after yourself as well.

46
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:18,368
Your life is precious.

47
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,647
You startled me.

48
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:39,918
You fool! Where have you been?

49
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:42,688
I brought your favorite, Mom. Meat.

50
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:50,358
Come here! Come closer!

51
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:01,108
I smell human blood.

52
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,007
Did you meet someone?

53
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,077
What human blood?

54
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:07,478
It is deer blood.

55
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:09,507
I heard it cry out...

56
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:13,217
and decided to rescue
it from a painful death.

57
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,188
And then I...

58
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:18,757
You fool. You will be the death of me.

59
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:22,587
But... It is true, Mother.

60
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:33,438
We could be raided at any time.

61
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,137
We must move.

62
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:37,077
I did not meet anyone.

63
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:38,837
Poachers are people too.

64
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:41,077
What if they were to report us?

65
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,207
There are many Goguryeo farmers...

66
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:45,118
who lost their land and wander.

67
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:49,548
The first day of the coming month
is your father's death anniversary.

68
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:52,058
I know that.

69
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:55,728
You vowed to not see, hear, or
get involved in worldly matters.

70
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:58,627
You cannot forget that.

71
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:02,027
For your father's sake,

72
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:07,108
for the rest of your life,
you must live as a fool.

73
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:09,967
I said I get it.

74
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:28,257
No, the deer meat. Are you
going to let me starve?

75
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:31,798
Just wait here.

76
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:33,897
I will cook it up nicely.

77
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,308
I heard you caught some poachers.

78
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:45,808
Word travels fast.

79
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,908
We rushed over, but we were too late.

80
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,077
Did you get them on your own?

81
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,918
You are too curious.

82
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:53,717
Did you come just to ask me that?

83
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:54,918
My dad sent me.

84
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:02,827
We have an empty house.

85
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:05,757
You and Lady Sa can move to Ghost Valley.

86
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:07,498
Do not refuse this time.

87
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:11,438
We all live in hiding in some mountain.

88
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:14,108
This place is just as good as Ghost Valley.

89
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,168
Both Mother and I feel more comfortable here.

90
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:18,308
I knew you would say that.

91
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:22,577
Hey. Is this all you picked?

92
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:25,717
It is getting harder to find
wild animals and good herbs.

93
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,988
Oh. Pil Gu said that...

94
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,058
Mount Songhak is the place to go.

95
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:32,688
There are herbs everywhere.

96
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:34,688
Mount Songhak?

97
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:43,697
You will not find anything like this.

98
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,697
Come and take a look.

99
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,347
For what reason do they want more taxes?

100
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:56,408
They are building Jangan Castle.

101
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:59,747
Every commoner must hand in a roll of cloth.

102
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,548
My goodness. The king is so ruthless.

103
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,418
A roll of cloth?

104
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,158
He might as well ask for
a roll of human skin.

105
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:10,357
Why will not the spirits take him?

106
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:14,028
These days, he spends
time drinking with women.

107
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,697
He does not even run the country.

108
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:18,638
That works for the nobles
on the Five Tribe council.

109
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:19,997
Darn my life.

110
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,788
Of all the Goguryeo lords,

111
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:41,128
now none are loyal to the king.

112
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:46,428
Did you say they are Cheonjubang?

113
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:49,967
Thanks to the migrants, we got
rid of the king's family...

114
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,237
without getting blood on our hands.

115
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:55,067
Are those in the palace the only ones left?

116
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,577
Preparations for that have already begun.

117
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:00,908
What do you mean by that?

118
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,548
Are you really going to
attack during the ceremony?

119
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:05,817
The Daedaero disapproved,

120
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:08,148
so we planned it ourselves.

121
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:11,288
- But...
- Let us not mention it anymore.

122
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:18,798
GO WON PYO, GYERU TRIBE'S GOCHUGA

123
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,128
KING PYEONGWON, 25TH KING OF GOGURYEO

124
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:59,067
The King of Goguryeo was
always the suspicious type.

125
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:02,467
It got much worse since his queen died.

126
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,038
The problem is, he has many bedrooms,

127
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:08,508
and he sleeps in a different one each night.

128
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:10,607
We cannot tell where he will
sleep on any given night.

129
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:13,918
His bodyguards are also on high alert.

130
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,617
Our only opportunity...

131
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:20,558
is when he climbs Mount Songhak's Cheonjedan.

132
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,727
I will contact the head shaman
until right before the ceremony.

133
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:26,597
Disguise as a servant girl
and right after the ceremony,

134
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,898
disguise yourself as a shaman.

135
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:39,477
The place marked there is the shrine.

136
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:45,817
SHRINE

137
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:03,597
Stop.

138
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,178
Where are you going?

139
00:12:13,178 --> 00:12:16,048
To Magnolia Hall with the prince.

140
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:19,178
I have a present for our sister
to offer at the ceremony.

141
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:21,447
You do not have a sister.

142
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:24,388
Princess Pyeonggang is not your true sister.

143
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:26,918
The late Queen Yeon had an affair,

144
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,528
and she was the dirty result.

145
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:33,528
So you need not care about a ceremony...

146
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:35,597
for that dead brat.

147
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:37,997
Let us go.

148
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:54,587
Take this to Magnolia Hall.

149
00:13:14,538 --> 00:13:17,067
MAGNOLIA HALL, PRINCESS
PYEONGGANG'S CHAMBERS

150
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,928
Who are you?

151
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,058
I apologize, Madam.

152
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:17,638
The Crown Prince told me to bring this here.

153
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,367
Put it on that small table.

154
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,168
Your Highness?

155
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:44,357
Did you see where the
maid who just left went?

156
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:47,418
A maid? What maid?

157
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,457
Did you see anyone?

158
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:55,428
You must be seeing things.

159
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,867
This garden has such beautiful flowers.

160
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:04,067
How about I move into Magnolia Hall?

161
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:09,508
- Please.
- I was just kidding.

162
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,717
Your Highness. Princess.

163
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:16,217
"Princess"?

164
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,217
Is my sister truly dead?

165
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:52,987
Tomorrow is the ceremony to send her off.

166
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:55,227
Her farewell ceremony.

167
00:16:55,987 --> 00:17:00,357
Would we ever host such a
ceremony for the living?

168
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,138
The nobles forced me to
sit through the rites.

169
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,578
Tomorrow will be the last one.

170
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,207
But no one found her body.

171
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:17,648
She could be alive.

172
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,697
Princess Pyeonggang is dead.

173
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,398
- Father.
- Do not...

174
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:38,898
mention her again.

175
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:24,168
MOUNT SONGHAK

176
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:43,858
My goodness. Did you drink yet again?

177
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:47,628
No ceremony is complete without a drink.

178
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:52,467
Let us finish this in a hurry
and return to the palace.

179
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,398
We should all get drunk.

180
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:02,777
Go Geon, Lord of Songhak Fortress
greets His Majesty the King.

181
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:05,217
We have not met in a long time.

182
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,487
You must be proud of your eldest son.

183
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:11,658
I instructed him to be on high alert today.

184
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,918
Can I trust that you did?

185
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,388
I fear that...

186
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:19,557
I am only in charge due to
my fortunate birth rite.

187
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:23,767
You should put more trust in
your bodyguards than my soldiers.

188
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,297
Are they not the elite
that can take on 100 men?

189
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:30,868
You even speak in jest.

190
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:34,438
Your son is better than you.

191
00:21:39,977 --> 00:21:42,908
A SHAMAN WILL ATTACK THE KING.

192
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,527
We must cancel the ceremony.

193
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:32,757
Why?

194
00:22:33,027 --> 00:22:35,168
One of the shamans is an impostor.

195
00:22:35,797 --> 00:22:37,568
She has to be an assassin.

196
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:41,098
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

197
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,767
She changed into their costume...

198
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:45,678
and mixed in with the group.

199
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:47,378
Wait.

200
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:49,007
Father.

201
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:52,678
Ruining the ceremony could cause
more trouble than we can handle.

202
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:57,547
The king is in danger.

203
00:22:57,987 --> 00:23:00,388
That is why you must watch carefully.

204
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:26,017
Speak. Where is Wol Gwang?

205
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:30,247
He... He went to Mount Geumgang to meditate.

206
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:33,418
He will return in a month's time.

207
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:36,428
Do you mean that Wol Gwang...

208
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:39,128
is not here?

209
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:05,487
I am sorry.

210
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:10,027
I am so sorry.

211
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:40,588
Wol Gwang!

212
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:44,457
Stop.

213
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:46,858
Stop.

214
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:50,898
Stop, stop! I said stop!

215
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:54,438
- Stop! Stop!
- Your Majesty!

216
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:13,618
You...

217
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:17,757
You...

218
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:20,757
How come you...

219
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:04,997
Keep climbing!

220
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:40,638
Hold on tight!

221
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,868
Come on, climb up quick!

222
00:27:53,777 --> 00:27:56,787
What on earth happened?

223
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:16,608
Darn it.

224
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:32,287
Ga Jin failed?

225
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:36,388
Find her quickly.

226
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:40,727
We must find her before
anyone from Goguryeo does.

227
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:42,668
- Yes, Chief.
- Yes, Chief.

228
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:22,138
You should recover on your
own if I have done this much.

229
00:29:26,777 --> 00:29:28,507
Please save me.

230
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:56,477
Save me.

231
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,680
She would not have taken the mountain pass.

232
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,349
Search the forest thoroughly.

233
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,680
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:50,289
Deer...

235
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,429
Where are we going?

236
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,289
Do not worry.

237
00:30:58,099 --> 00:30:59,659
I am not going to kill you.

238
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,039
My goodness.

239
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,610
I told you not to sneak up on me like that.

240
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,980
What did you catch this time?

241
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,110
Did you catch a deer or an elk?

242
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,679
My goodness...

243
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,489
You brought someone?

244
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:56,350
It is not just anyone.

245
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,760
She is injured.

246
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:01,860
My gosh. My goodness.

247
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,660
If she got hurt,

248
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,830
you should have taken her to
the village, not bring her here.

249
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,929
Things were chaotic down the mountain.

250
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,369
Do not worry.

251
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:11,999
Once she is all better, I will send her away.

252
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:12,999
My goodness.

253
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,140
Mother.

254
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,880
Mother.

255
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,450
I ran into some soldiers...

256
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:31,559
while I was outside picking herbs.

257
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:34,360
And she saved me.

258
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,959
Did you get hurt?

259
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,029
No, I am fine.

260
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,369
She tried to save my life.

261
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,179
How could I just leave her there?

262
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,910
She got hit by an arrow because of me.

263
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,950
Let her stay for a few days.

264
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,749
There is nothing I can do anyway. I am blind.

265
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,519
Mother.

266
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,649
Okay, do whatever you want.

267
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,860
Now that we have one more person here,

268
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,559
your old mother will stay up all night...

269
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,760
to sew her clothes and cook for her.

270
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,660
Goodness, my entire body aches.

271
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,459
Goodness, my body.

272
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,899
And once...

273
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,929
the soldiers come to find her here,

274
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:19,299
I will accept my fate and die.

275
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,369
Goodness, my darn life.

276
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,910
I have such an unfortunate life.

277
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,760
Mother...

278
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,230
Father...

279
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,839
Mother...

280
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,890
Fight properly!

281
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,990
Goodness.

282
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,899
You need to learn how to fight...

283
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,859
in order to protect me!

284
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,959
You witch!

285
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,529
Who do you think you are?

286
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:54,570
How dare you look at me that way!

287
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,930
Get lost! Go!

288
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,800
Get away! Get lost!

289
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,209
The time has come.

290
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,580
She is here to take me away.

291
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,789
She is here to take me with her.

292
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,430
Fine. Take me with you.

293
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,200
Take me with you, Pyeonggang.

294
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,070
Goodness, what are we going to do?

295
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,539
He will not be able to
go to war in that state.

296
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,609
Should I take care of him tonight?

297
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,620
Go ahead.

298
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:52,390
If you get lucky and get
pregnant with a prince,

299
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,359
it will be even better.

300
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,359
That is not what I meant.

301
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,250
What a way to wake up.

302
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Deer?

303
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,789
From now on, do not hurt others...

304
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:03,029
and look after yourself as well.

305
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,000
Your life is precious.

306
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:08,399
What am I doing here?

307
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,140
You begged me to save you.

308
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:15,310
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

309
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,640
"Please save me." That is what you said.

310
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:20,810
I said that?

311
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,349
Yes. My gosh.

312
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,719
Are you not eating the
porridge because you want rice?

313
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,149
I am not hungry.

314
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,140
Mother, stop staring at her.
She will not be able to eat.

315
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:52,109
I am not staring. I cannot
see anything anyway.

316
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,750
What is your name?

317
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,219
Yeom Ga Jin.

318
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,789
My goodness, what a pretty name.

319
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,349
What do you do for a living?

320
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
She is a maid.

321
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,890
She works at the palace.

322
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,529
I did not ask you.

323
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:16,729
Does that mean you work for the king?

324
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,940
- Yes.
- I see.

325
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,139
That explains your gentle voice...

326
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:23,070
and pretty face.

327
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,310
You cannot even see her.

328
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,280
I do not need to see to know.

329
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,180
By the way,

330
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,150
how did you get to know Dal?

331
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,249
Oh, that is my name.

332
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
On Dal.

333
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:41,060
You did not even tell her your name?

334
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,629
We had no time for that.

335
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,060
Then...

336
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,359
Ga Jin...

337
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,800
Thank you for the food.

338
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,070
You are done already? You should eat more.

339
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,339
Eat a bit more.

340
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:53,700
I need to go to the bathroom.

341
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,509
Sure.

342
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,550
She barely even ate anything.

343
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,680
You were angry at me for bringing her home.

344
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,489
Why are you asking her so many questions?

345
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,160
I can tell by touching her hands
that she is not a kitchen maid.

346
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,889
She is a maid who works at the palace.

347
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:15,129
But her hands are too rough to be a maid.

348
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,759
I wonder what she does.

349
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,680
Get over here!

350
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,109
Stop!

351
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,749
Come here! Come here!

352
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,989
You...

353
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,690
You are dead.

354
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,700
I caught you!

355
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,540
Mother, you were supposed to
catch the chicken, not her.

356
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,440
If she saw me, she should have avoided me.

357
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,280
I am the one who is blind.

358
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,109
- My goodness.
- My gosh.

359
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,379
Mother, now that you are lying here,

360
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:14,820
take a look at the sky.

361
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,989
The sky is beautiful.

362
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,560
It is so blue.

363
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
You are right.

364
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,190
It is very blue.

365
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,700
How nice.

366
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:58,200
Get changed.

367
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,099
My mother stayed up all
night sewing that for you.

368
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,739
It may not be fancy, but it will do.

369
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
What did you just say?

370
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,639
I made that even though I am blind.
You should give me more credit.

371
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,739
What is the matter with you?

372
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,440
Just get out here already.

373
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,609
- Ga Jin!
- Be quiet.

374
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,650
Ga Jin, you are alive.

375
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,479
We searched all over Mount
Songhak, Mount Samjeong,

376
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:55,550
and Mount Daeseong to find you.

377
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,950
What about the chief?

378
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,459
He told us to find you and bring you back.

379
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,959
What happened?

380
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,030
I do not know.

381
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:08,629
Why did I do that?

382
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:11,070
Is that supposed to be
a question or an answer?

383
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:35,259
Mother, why are you going through her stuff?

384
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:37,430
You told me she is a maid on the run.

385
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,660
Why does a maid have all these weapons?

386
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,499
Well, let me explain.

387
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:43,499
Is she a killer?

388
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,469
Is she the reason why there
were soldiers last night?

389
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,540
Answer me.

390
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,109
Yes.

391
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:53,310
I want her gone right now.

392
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:55,810
Mother, she has not even recovered yet.

393
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,879
And then what?

394
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,650
Do you think we will be safe here?

395
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,219
Do you think a killer will let us live...

396
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:03,790
even after having seen her face?

397
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,820
Is anyone home?

398
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,459
Weol Yi?

399
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:10,959
Yes.

400
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,670
The village ladies told me
to give you some vegetables.

401
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,999
You did not have to come
all the way here to do that.

402
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:22,440
My goodness, that is just how
much we all care about you.

403
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:26,009
By the way, Dal, the traps
you set up are a mess.

404
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,739
By any chance,

405
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,450
do you think the lady you saved...

406
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,249
cut them open and ran away?

407
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,219
Dal!

408
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,290
By the way, who is the guy who lives here?

409
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:09,790
Why?

410
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,020
He set up tons of traps.

411
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:16,830
We were able to avoid
getting caught thanks to me.

412
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,930
- If not...
- Ga Jin!

413
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:23,129
Wait.

414
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,270
Yeom Ga Jin!

415
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,270
Why are you not killing him?

416
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,509
He saw your face.

417
00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:34,739
Then you should kill him That is our rule.

418
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,280
Yeom Ga Jin!

419
00:44:39,749 --> 00:44:41,050
His life is precious.

420
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:42,489
What?

421
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,089
What did you just say?

422
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:46,920
She said his life is precious.

423
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,030
So what? You are going to break the rules?

424
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:53,830
If you let him live, the
chief will punish you.

425
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,869
I want you guys to go back.

426
00:44:56,129 --> 00:44:57,530
Do not tell anyone that you found me.

427
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,300
If you cannot kill him,

428
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:01,040
we will do it for you.

429
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,440
If we must kill him, I will do it myself.

430
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:06,639
Well...

431
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,080
There is a way not to kill him.

432
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,550
What is that?

433
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,280
Seduce him and get married.

434
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,219
Then he will become one of us,

435
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,249
so you will not have to kill him.

436
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:19,389
That is how Deuk Jae got
himself a wife last year.

437
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,290
Cut the nonsense.

438
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,330
What? Ga Jin does not want to kill him.

439
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:27,229
Ga Jin, what is it that you want?

440
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,070
Yeom Ga Jin!

441
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:51,859
Should I kill him...

442
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,119
or seduce him?

443
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,459
Yeom Ga Jin!

444
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:20,150
What are you doing in there?

445
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:32,660
Gosh, I looked everywhere for you.

446
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,229
Here. Hold onto this.

447
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
Get lost.

448
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:02,990
What are you staring at?

449
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,270
Did you catch a cold?

450
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:11,740
Do you have a fever?

451
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,869
No, I do not.

452
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,369
I think you do.

453
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,849
Oh, dear. Your wound might get infected.

454
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:24,349
I have my appetite back, so I am all good.

455
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:31,820
It is not cooked yet.

456
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,169
Tell me if you are going to leave.

457
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,740
Do not just go about and mess up my traps.

458
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,909
Your traps are covered in many layers.

459
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,210
Why did you set up so many?

460
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:54,639
Are you that scared of wild animals?

461
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,379
I am not afraid of animals.

462
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:00,550
I am afraid of humans.

463
00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:07,859
Here.

464
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:22,310
I was worried because I thought
you went down the mountain.

465
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:23,939
You were worried...

466
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:25,980
about me?

467
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,879
My mother told me...

468
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:30,449
to make you pay for the herbs,

469
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,510
at least.

470
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:36,220
You have a quick eye for a profit
for people living in the mountain.

471
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:39,119
Why do you not make a living by
selling things in the village?

472
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,689
Why do you live in hiding?

473
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,089
I do not know.

474
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:48,899
How did your mother hurt her eyes?

475
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,639
It just happened.

476
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,879
It is okay. You do not have to tell me.

477
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,179
Father.

478
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,050
Father!

479
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,790
Father, Father!

480
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,550
Father...

481
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,230
Father. Father...

482
00:49:22,899 --> 00:49:24,530
Did you come with Un Am?

483
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,540
Yes.

484
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,669
The princess made it to Yibullansa.

485
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,570
Well done.

486
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,710
I am proud of you.

487
00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:34,939
Father.

488
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:37,609
I wanted to tell you...

489
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:39,949
I am sorry...

490
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,619
for making you break your sword.

491
00:49:46,689 --> 00:49:47,689
I know.

492
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,189
Father, let us escape from here.

493
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:53,929
Come with me, Father.

494
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,899
Come with me.

495
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,030
Dal.

496
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:02,839
A general cannot disobey the king's order.

497
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:06,240
Father... What about me?

498
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,550
How should I live without you?

499
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:12,449
What about the villagers?

500
00:50:13,149 --> 00:50:16,089
I am here to save those lives.

501
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,859
Father...

502
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:23,159
Dal.

503
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,330
There will be...

504
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
no revenge.

505
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:34,899
There should be no resentment...

506
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:38,240
in your life.

507
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,480
Live an ordinary life... No.

508
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:49,849
Live like a fool...

509
00:50:52,189 --> 00:50:55,089
and live peacefully...

510
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:57,560
and quietly.

511
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,500
A fool?

512
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,369
Father.

513
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,540
Father.

514
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,210
Father...

515
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,980
Father...

516
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:17,649
Father.

517
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,250
Father... Father...

518
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,260
Father...

519
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,889
Father...

520
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,429
- How could they do this?
- My goodness.

521
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:36,399
- My gosh.
- I cannot believe this.

522
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:38,129
This cannot be happening.

523
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:39,169
- Poor him.
- Be quiet!

524
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:58,859
General, I will take good care of the tribe.

525
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,619
Do not worry about your son.

526
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,330
I will protect him.

527
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,939
- Father!
- No!

528
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,260
Dal! Do not be like this.

529
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,929
- Dal!
- Let go of me!

530
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,500
I have to go see my father.

531
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,899
I have to take his body!

532
00:52:41,899 --> 00:52:43,929
No! I cannot lose you too.

533
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,369
I am not afraid of death.

534
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,570
Let go of me!

535
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,169
You cannot go!

536
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,510
Please...

537
00:52:58,179 --> 00:52:59,250
What do you think you are doing?

538
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:14,199
Lady Sa.

539
00:53:21,169 --> 00:53:22,240
Lady Sa!

540
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:24,109
Lady Sa!

541
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,639
Lady Sa...

542
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,010
Lady Sa!

543
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:30,510
Lady Sa! Lady Sa!

544
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,550
Lady Sa.

545
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,760
Lady Sa...

546
00:53:40,419 --> 00:53:41,760
From today,

547
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,230
you will be...

548
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,570
my son!

549
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,540
Are you going to...

550
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:58,139
- leave your blind mother?
- Lady Sa...

551
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,210
Lady Sa...

552
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,750
Lady Sa...

553
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,080
Lady Sa...

554
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,599
These are from a wild-walnut tree.

555
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,000
They kill the worms in your body.

556
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,669
And these are spicebush leaves.

557
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,109
They help relieve an upset
stomach or clogged arteries.

558
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:36,109
Starworts help get rid of a cold or phlegm.

559
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,080
And...

560
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:41,449
this is what you need the most.

561
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:42,649
Fo-ti root.

562
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,849
If you put its leaf on a wound,

563
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:47,119
it gets rid of all the pus.

564
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:50,689
What do you think? Do they interest you?

565
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,730
- What?
- What?

566
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,169
What are you doing?

567
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:02,339
People pay good money for these.

568
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:04,139
You need to make a living too.

569
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,839
Did you not say that you
ran away from the palace?

570
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,409
This may be wilder than working as a maid,

571
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:10,909
but it is not that bad.

572
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,720
And you will not have nightmares.

573
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:35,770
Is that you, Dal?

574
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,470
Yes.

575
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:40,639
You should go to bed.

576
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:41,810
Come here.

577
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,220
What about the girl?

578
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,490
I brought her back.

579
00:55:57,089 --> 00:56:00,000
She went out for a walk and got lost.

580
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,000
Is she pretty?

581
00:56:03,129 --> 00:56:05,500
- What?
- Is she so beautiful...

582
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,199
that you are crazy for her?

583
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,770
Mother, have you lost your mind?

584
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,179
Do not make me repeat myself.

585
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,010
As soon as the day breaks,
get her out of here.

586
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:21,050
Otherwise, I will kick her out myself.

587
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,889
A SHAMAN WILL ATTACK THE KING.

588
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,030
Are you in there?

589
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:10,929
Yes, Father.

590
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:22,139
You will start working at
the palace from tomorrow.

591
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:24,109
You will need to guard the palace.

592
00:57:26,149 --> 00:57:27,149
Me?

593
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,649
Until the assassin is caught, the
responsibility rests with you.

594
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,460
You asked me to guard the king
during the ceremony out of the blue,

595
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,330
and now you want me to catch the assassin?

596
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:38,159
Do you want me to do the job halfheartedly...

597
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,230
and lose the assassin?

598
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:44,030
That is a wild speculation.

599
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,470
Then can I really...

600
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:49,139
catch the assassin?

601
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,040
I will catch her and
offer her to His Majesty.

602
00:57:56,349 --> 00:57:58,250
He will be proud of you.

603
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,179
And he will appoint you
to a more important post.

604
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:02,520
I am not interested...

605
00:58:03,649 --> 00:58:04,949
in politics.

606
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:10,260
But I will make sure to catch the assassin.

607
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:26,210
The king is in danger.

608
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,939
That is why you must watch carefully.

609
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,750
People...

610
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:35,619
cannot find out the shameful
secret of our family.

611
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:00,710
Yeom Deuk...

612
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,250
Yeom Deuk!

613
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:07,750
Yeom Deuk!

614
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,020
Yeom Deuk.

615
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:12,250
Yeom Deuk!

616
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,619
Tae Mo, that jerk!

617
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:18,089
He must have drugged Yeom
Deuk to find where Ga Jin is.

618
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:20,359
Yeom Deuk, pull yourself together.

619
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:22,260
It is me, Tara Jin.

620
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:26,369
Do not come back. Do not ever come back!

621
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,070
Guys.

622
00:59:28,839 --> 00:59:29,839
Jin!

623
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:32,780
Do not forget what I have just said.

624
01:00:31,399 --> 01:00:32,399
Hey.

625
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,270
Ga Jin.

626
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,310
Why are you here? I was going to see Chief.

627
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:42,010
What is wrong?

628
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:45,949
Ma Tae Mo turned your house upside down.

629
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,389
What about my father?

630
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,149
He is fine.

631
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,290
San is taking care of him.

632
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:55,490
- Let us go.
- Wait.

633
01:00:57,629 --> 01:01:00,129
Yeom Deuk said you should never come back.

634
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:01,659
What?

635
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:04,230
He told you to never come back...

636
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:07,399
and find your real parents first.

637
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:11,869
My real parents?

638
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,879
What does he mean by that?

639
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:15,240
Well, he meant...

640
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,280
Chief said you are an orphan.

641
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:23,520
What did you say?

642
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:28,089
Gosh, I will just tell you. Yeom
Deuk does not have a family.

643
01:01:28,089 --> 01:01:31,760
That is why Chief told him
to raise you as his daughter.

644
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,500
Stop joking. It is not funny.

645
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,470
He said there is this necklace...

646
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:42,070
that belongs to you.

647
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,669
He said that will be a token to
help you find your real parents.

648
01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:49,710
A necklace?

649
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:57,820
But Ma Tae Mo must have taken that.

650
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,320
So...

651
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:08,000
you are saying I am an orphan, right?

652
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:09,929
Yes.

653
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:16,970
Hey!

654
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,909
You have not killed him?

655
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:24,050
You told me to seduce him instead.

656
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,720
You? As if.

657
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,720
Hi.

658
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:36,189
Your friend came to pick you up?

659
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,560
- Yes, she is my childhood...
- We met each other in the palace.

660
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,970
She is my hometown friend.

661
01:02:45,169 --> 01:02:46,699
And we worked at the palace together.

662
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:48,070
I see.

663
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,310
How did you come all the way here?

664
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:52,939
I followed the footsteps.

665
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,210
What is with you?

666
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,080
Why are you interrogating us?

667
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:01,179
I am just checking...

668
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,320
if it is okay...

669
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,490
to just send you away like this...

670
01:03:05,689 --> 01:03:07,389
and if the place you are going to is safe.

671
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,460
Oh, I do not have any money
to give you, but take this.

672
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,939
I carved it myself.

673
01:03:24,939 --> 01:03:27,609
The Sunno Tribe... I mean...

674
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:32,550
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.

675
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,050
Same side?

676
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:35,379
Yes, we are on the same side.

677
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,290
But I have nothing to give you.

678
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,389
Gosh.

679
01:03:39,919 --> 01:03:41,159
Yes, you do.

680
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:55,139
Darn you!

681
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,810
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

682
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,779
<i>That sneaky girl...</i>

683
01:04:06,779 --> 01:04:10,090
<i>managed to seduce Dal.</i>

684
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:11,489
<i>Even if I am scared...</i>

685
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:12,590
<i>and cannot find out...</i>

686
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:14,690
<i>who I am and what happened to my family,</i>

687
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,860
<i>then I will not be able to do anything.</i>

688
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,560
<i>We must save her.</i>
