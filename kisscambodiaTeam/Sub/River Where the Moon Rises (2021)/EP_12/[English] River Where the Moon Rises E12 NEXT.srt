1
00:00:05,252 --> 00:00:07,221
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:09,221
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:13,622
Hurry and run away.

4
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:19,052
If you wish to save the old woman,

5
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,052
do not resist my blade.

6
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:26,182
My child.

7
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:38,382
Dal.

8
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,482
EPISODE 12

9
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:03,582
It is fortunate. The
arrow missed vital spots.

10
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,481
Is she okay?

11
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,722
She will be once the wound heals.

12
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:11,922
Then she will be fine.

13
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,291
Dal.

14
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,851
Calm down and wash yourself.

15
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:51,622
Where did you go?

16
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,652
I buried him.

17
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:56,282
What?

18
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,851
If I left him there,

19
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:01,521
he would lure wild animals.

20
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:18,282
Forget about it.

21
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,421
It could not have been helped.

22
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:25,321
It is not your fault.

23
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:29,081
They were people sent by
Go Won Pyo to kill us.

24
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:32,521
If not for you, both Mother...

25
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:34,152
and I would have been in danger.

26
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:39,021
You speak like...

27
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,222
when you were a killer.

28
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,021
Dal.

29
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,782
Dal.

30
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:52,851
Mother.

31
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,752
Mother. Are you awake?

32
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,182
Mother. Are you all right?

33
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:07,351
Water.

34
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,552
You should have stayed at home.

35
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,382
Why did you pack your things?

36
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:27,451
You should be training in some mountain.

37
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,852
What are you doing here?

38
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,422
Were you hurt?

39
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:33,992
No.

40
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,052
I just need you to recover.

41
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:46,451
Dal.

42
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:51,581
Does he feel guilty because of what he did?

43
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:53,382
Yes.

44
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:58,781
It is because that was the
first time he hurt a man.

45
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,081
My child.

46
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:02,752
You.

47
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,521
Were you hurt?

48
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:07,252
I am fine.

49
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:09,052
Thanks to Dal.

50
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,151
Okay, then.

51
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,451
That is a relief.

52
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:47,422
Scholars who were writing
a petition in secret...

53
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:49,382
suffered a huge blow.

54
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:53,721
I heard that some even died trying to flee.

55
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,321
You are ruining my appetite.

56
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:01,281
I say this out of concern for you.

57
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,281
I heard of the impregnation ceremony.

58
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:08,852
Can you afford to drink on a night like this?

59
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:10,982
How did you know of that?

60
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:14,252
- Pardon?
- I only mentioned a ceremony.

61
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:17,221
I never said what it was for.

62
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:22,252
I knew it.

63
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,721
You were the middleman.

64
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,552
Royal Consort Hyeon wishes
so much to get pregnant.

65
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,882
Even the lowliest court maid knows that.

66
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:33,252
If there were a ceremony,

67
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,982
that would be the only reason.

68
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:36,352
You get away yet again.

69
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:38,021
You have great explanations.

70
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,552
Anyway, I told you clearly.

71
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:42,382
Today, I plan to find out...

72
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:44,382
everything you are hiding.

73
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,021
So, shall we begin?

74
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:51,521
Begin what?

75
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:53,852
We will take turns to
ask what we want to know,

76
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,922
and must answer truthfully.

77
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,382
If you think the answer is a lie,

78
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:00,021
you drink as a penalty.

79
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,281
You are very strange tonight.

80
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:05,451
I am not just strange.

81
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,521
I can be fun as well.

82
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,321
I shall go first.

83
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:14,852
Do you...

84
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:18,752
love me?

85
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,081
Commander.

86
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,581
Commander.

87
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:44,081
You must drink if you will not answer.

88
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:45,752
Go on.

89
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:47,752
Me, love you?

90
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:50,651
What gave you that idea?

91
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:52,781
I asked the question.

92
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:54,721
Now answer.

93
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:56,552
Do you love me?

94
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:58,252
I do not.

95
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:02,221
I do not believe you.

96
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:03,821
If you call a truth a lie,

97
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,182
then I have no choice.

98
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:15,482
Fine.

99
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:18,521
This time...

100
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:20,651
it is your turn.

101
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,951
You became the Crown Prince's master...

102
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:26,252
and Head of the King's Bodyguards.

103
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,451
It is because of the Princess, right?

104
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,151
To gain her affection whenever she returns.

105
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,852
She has married another man.

106
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:39,092
Why should I wait for her?

107
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:42,322
That is a lie.

108
00:08:49,592 --> 00:08:53,222
We might both get very
drunk on penalty drinks.

109
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:56,722
To this question, I really hope that...

110
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,352
you give an honest answer.

111
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:02,452
Ask me whatever you will.

112
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:07,651
Since when...

113
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,622
did you start?

114
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,622
Spying for Silla.

115
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:28,882
Or are you originally from Silla,

116
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:33,622
and did you smuggle yourself into Goguryeo?

117
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:44,151
Do you want to lose your head
instead of taking a shot?

118
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:51,452
- General.
- Later.

119
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:53,722
Go Sang Cheol returned gravely wounded.

120
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:03,092
I will have you watched.

121
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,222
Do not think of running away.

122
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:18,222
Father.

123
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:24,722
Why did you go against your word?

124
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:28,551
- What word?
- I said that...

125
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,482
I would take care of anything
regarding the Princess.

126
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,281
Why did you send your men?

127
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:35,281
Did you really...

128
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:38,592
try to hurt the Princess?

129
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:43,882
You are wrong about one
and right about the other.

130
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,181
I never gave you my word. And yes,

131
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,382
I did give the order to kill the Princess.

132
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:53,281
As well as On Hyeop's son.

133
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,822
The bud has grown, and it
is only time to nip it.

134
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:01,322
You cannot do this without
so much as a word to me.

135
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:04,222
What?

136
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:08,421
Did you not smuggle out
Daedaero without my permission?

137
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:10,921
I told you to arrest Kim
Pyeong Ji at that gathering.

138
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,051
You ruined my plan.

139
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:15,551
Rather than confine him,

140
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:17,982
you must make him an ally.

141
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:22,082
Either way, the spark was lit.

142
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,122
Now we just have to kindle the fire.

143
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:28,382
What fire?

144
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,781
The weeds that are in the way.

145
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:37,181
The fire will eliminate them all.

146
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:43,421
Be cautious.

147
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:50,952
The one who lights the fire...

148
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:54,352
is most likely to get burned.

149
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:06,421
Yes.

150
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:08,752
I will remember that.

151
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:39,681
Dal.

152
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:43,752
The men I cut down.

153
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,222
I see their eyes.

154
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:52,681
I hear their screams.

155
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,651
The more I try to forget them,

156
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,722
the clearer they become
and it drives me crazy.

157
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:07,982
How many more must I kill...

158
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,281
and cut down?

159
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:15,082
What we wish to do.

160
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:20,082
Is it really worth that much?

161
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:29,982
If it tortures you too much, you can stop.

162
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:33,882
You suffer so much that you have nightmares.

163
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,281
You need not force yourself.

164
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,752
Do I not look pathetic to you?

165
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:44,952
No. Why would you say that?

166
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:46,582
What you do not like,

167
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,582
I do not like either.

168
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:53,322
We are married.

169
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,352
What did you say?

170
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:22,822
We must suppress the Sunno Tribe?

171
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:26,382
Who do you think supported those
who were writing petitions?

172
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:29,181
They must have been in contact
with Sunno Tribe survivors.

173
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:33,122
They are currently gathering
men and making weapons.

174
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:36,281
They plotted treason once.

175
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,181
They would not hesitate to try again.

176
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:42,921
If Gochuga is right,

177
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:45,551
- you must hastily...
- That is nonsense.

178
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,151
The Princess is there. Why
would they plot treason?

179
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:53,722
Are you trying to turn my
own daughter into a traitor?

180
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:55,822
She is probably being threatened.

181
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:58,622
On Hyeop's son is holding her...

182
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:00,622
and using her as a hostage. So...

183
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:03,222
give us your permission...

184
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:05,681
to eliminate the traitors
and save the Princess.

185
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:06,982
Not a chance!

186
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:10,822
I will not send my men based
on your insistence alone.

187
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:13,521
Please be understanding.

188
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,181
- Please be understanding.
- Please be understanding.

189
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,181
Bodyguards!

190
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:21,122
As of this moment, anyone...

191
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:23,651
who mentions treason or suppression...

192
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:26,181
is to be killed in the King's name!

193
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,021
I will obey your command.

194
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,921
- Salute!
- Salute!

195
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,352
Go Won Pyo's private army?

196
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:47,021
Thanks to Dal, I got back safely.

197
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,051
Mother is safe too.

198
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:51,151
The cowards.

199
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:53,281
I would have killed them all if I were there.

200
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:54,382
As if.

201
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,582
Is it not the first time that
Go Won Pyo sent assassins?

202
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,952
So the situation is not good.

203
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:02,421
He made an attempt for my life.

204
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:05,082
He will not stop now.

205
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:09,151
He can come at us.

206
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:10,822
We will fight to the death.

207
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:13,322
Yes, friend. Now we are on the same page.

208
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:15,252
Do not worry.

209
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,151
Our kids have learned how to use a blade.

210
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,452
Silence!

211
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:25,051
It is not about the Gyeru Tribe.

212
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:27,082
They might...

213
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:30,021
send an army to wipe us out.

214
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,452
An army?

215
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:34,752
To frame us for treason and kill us all.

216
00:16:57,151 --> 00:17:00,021
They turned us into traitors
so they could get rid of us.

217
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:04,382
General. I will look after the tribe.

218
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,151
When you suggested we revive our tribe,

219
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,481
I expected a danger like
this would befall us.

220
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:29,552
And so...

221
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:34,852
I sent a secret letter to our
scattered people to join us.

222
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:40,181
Chief.

223
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,022
Princess.

224
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:46,651
Please lend us your wisdom.

225
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:53,751
You twins must speed up the
training of the grown men.

226
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:54,751
- Yes.
- Yes.

227
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:55,751
Father.

228
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:58,721
Yes? Yes, your wish is my command.

229
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:01,052
We must block the entrance
with a fence made with stakes.

230
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:02,751
Pung Gae can get the wood.

231
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:05,022
Father, you are in charge
of making the fence.

232
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:06,651
Do not worry.

233
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,082
We also need lots of food.

234
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:10,052
Do not worry about that.

235
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,352
I will go through our stores
and steam what we can...

236
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,522
and dry the meat and make jerky.

237
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:15,681
I will help out too.

238
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:17,221
- Thank you.
- Good girl.

239
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,352
Think of the late General On's wish.

240
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:23,382
Please help us as best you can.

241
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,792
- Yes, Chief!
- Yes, Chief!

242
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:33,082
Chief.

243
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:35,151
I want to ask you something.

244
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,251
About Dal's father.

245
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:39,981
General On Hyeop.

246
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,251
How far must we go?

247
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:50,951
We are almost there.

248
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,721
At least tell me where we are going.

249
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:55,481
Just follow me.

250
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:58,921
I am in no mood for jokes.

251
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:03,451
Do you not remember this path?

252
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:09,052
As a child,

253
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:12,882
you said you followed your father
to a grave covered in stone.

254
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,022
I asked the Chief about it...

255
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,921
and also heard from Mother.

256
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:22,082
About General On.

257
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:23,921
What about my father?

258
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:27,322
He wished that you would never hold a sword.

259
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:32,221
I think it was because he
knew you would be like this.

260
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:34,522
I wondered about that.

261
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,382
Who is buried in that tomb?

262
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,451
Do you not want to know?

263
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:40,522
No. No!

264
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,382
He said it was his fault.

265
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:54,251
So he did not even adorn the grave.

266
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:56,382
But...

267
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,751
deep down in his heart,

268
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:01,792
he put a rock on it instead.

269
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:16,382
Where are we, Father?

270
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:18,981
It looks like a grave.

271
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:22,022
Later.

272
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:26,582
I will tell you later.

273
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:30,181
When you are ready to be a true fighter.

274
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:37,651
Dal.

275
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:41,022
Like a fool,

276
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,421
I had failed to keep my woman safe.

277
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:48,921
You...

278
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,322
must not follow in my footsteps.

279
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,052
Father.

280
00:21:56,822 --> 00:21:58,582
The great cause of protecting the empire...

281
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:00,352
or the justification of saving the people...

282
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:01,721
These are...

283
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:04,681
all nonsense.

284
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:14,751
The only person you must
risk your life to protect.

285
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,421
And the only reason a man must wield a sword.

286
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,352
She is your only reason.

287
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:31,421
Are you ready?

288
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:35,481
Yes.

289
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:40,981
I will protect my woman.

290
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,322
I finally realized...

291
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:59,082
why I must fight.

292
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,282
I am still contemplating what to do with you.

293
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:24,951
As you held a superstitious ritual,

294
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:27,421
you must be beheaded.

295
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:31,582
But you must be curious
about my humble talent.

296
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:35,282
If I am as good as people say,

297
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,181
that would be a waste, would it not?

298
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:41,352
Do not think you can save
yourself with your rash words.

299
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:45,721
Before I came into the
palace, I had a reading.

300
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:51,282
A dangerous aura has engulfed the King.

301
00:24:52,382 --> 00:24:56,951
Soon, he will be facing a serious misfortune.

302
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:57,951
Shut your mouth.

303
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:00,151
Are you trying to stall
time with your nonsense?

304
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:01,481
If I am wrong,

305
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:04,481
you can behead me then.

306
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,981
I have no idea how they could spy...

307
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:12,981
on our meeting for the secret appeal.

308
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:16,552
Do you think General Go had
something to do with that?

309
00:25:18,122 --> 00:25:19,522
No.

310
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:22,822
If it were not for him, I
would have been caught then...

311
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,451
and imprisoned.

312
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:26,522
Please do not suspect him.

313
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:28,751
Anyway,

314
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:31,852
Go Won Pyo and the Five Tribe council...

315
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:33,782
will not back down this easily.

316
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,181
Perhaps, they might gather private guards...

317
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:38,181
and attack the Sunno Tribe.

318
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:40,552
I will not allow that.

319
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:42,681
Send a secret message to the Jeollo Tribe,

320
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,751
so they can dispatch an army of men.

321
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:46,852
If they leave the border unguarded,

322
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,882
how will we stop invasions
from Northern Zhou?

323
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,852
We crumble either from within or outside.

324
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:52,122
It is all the same.

325
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,352
I will put an end...

326
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:58,352
to this fight between Go Won Pyo and myself.

327
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:07,481
You do not seem well.

328
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:10,782
Are you afraid?

329
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:13,052
Not knowing what I should fear...

330
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,681
scares me.

331
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,022
Your stepfather bragged...

332
00:26:20,282 --> 00:26:22,052
how his stepdaughter...

333
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:24,282
was as brave and smart as a son could be.

334
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,352
You are too kind.

335
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:29,382
That is why I am giving
you an important task.

336
00:26:34,782 --> 00:26:35,981
Secretly make...

337
00:26:37,382 --> 00:26:38,822
some medicine.

338
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:41,852
May I ask who will be taking it?

339
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:43,782
The King.

340
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:46,981
He will be poisoned with the medicine.

341
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:52,582
And that medicine will be
rescuing this rotten empire.

342
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:02,481
Due to his acute stomach illness
that causes vomiting and diarrhea,

343
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:04,481
even the royal physician
who will rush over...

344
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:06,751
cannot find out why he
is sick. And in the end,

345
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:10,681
the King will pass away within that night.

346
00:27:12,852 --> 00:27:14,651
Can you make that happen?

347
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:16,921
However,

348
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:19,552
how could I...

349
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:22,382
Show me what you can do with my support.

350
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:25,782
Or you will face death for
learning about my grand plan.

351
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:28,921
Choose.

352
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:48,181
You became a spy for a favor
to a man who saved your life.

353
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:49,951
At that young age,

354
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:52,951
with that determination,

355
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:56,981
you crossed the border?

356
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:59,522
When I began on this
journey, the peril of it...

357
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:01,582
kept things interesting.

358
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:03,122
How?

359
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:06,481
Plotting schemes and
manipulating people was fun.

360
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:13,251
Just like you are trying
to come up with a way...

361
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:16,951
to use me instead of reporting me.

362
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,951
Seeing how you have reached that on your own,

363
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:22,582
things will be easier on my end.

364
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:28,921
I am sure you know it
is the Princess' plan...

365
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,022
to bring back the Sunno Tribe.

366
00:28:31,451 --> 00:28:34,282
I also know that the son of
General On Hyeop has joined her.

367
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:36,352
Tell me everything you know.

368
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:40,921
Tell me why the Princess
is coming to your store...

369
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:44,822
and why you are helping them.

370
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,822
That is a promise between
the Princess and me.

371
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:49,181
So you will not tell me?

372
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:54,322
If that is your answer, you
will go straight to jail.

373
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:56,651
You tell me it is my decision to make,

374
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,221
but you are threatening me.

375
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:02,981
Indeed. Like father, like son.

376
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:04,282
Are you saying I am like my father?

377
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,022
What are you talking about?

378
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:09,151
Last night,

379
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:12,951
I have met with Gochuga.

380
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:17,352
He secretly ordered me to make
some poisonous herbal tonic.

381
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:20,582
He said it was intended for the King.

382
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:27,852
You will decide whether I live or not.

383
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:31,681
So please tell me how I
can get out of this alive.

384
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:36,582
Should I serve the poisonous herbal tonic?

385
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,352
Or should I let your father end my life?

386
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,144
The Head of Bodyguards is here.

387
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:01,144
Is the King all right?

388
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:03,344
I am protecting him day and night.

389
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,715
Yes. You ought to.

390
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:10,484
Father.

391
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:19,865
Never mind.

392
00:30:35,844 --> 00:30:36,975
Dal.

393
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:41,615
Dal.

394
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:45,725
How come you did not tell
me that you were leaving?

395
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:48,185
I told you that I was
going back to the mountain.

396
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:51,225
I did not know that you would be
leaving this early in the morning.

397
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,895
If I were to stay to say goodbye,
my mother would start nagging me.

398
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:55,264
And I know that you are busy.

399
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:56,895
You have a lot of work to do in the village.

400
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,535
Even so. How could you leave
without even a goodbye?

401
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:03,074
I am sorry. Please take
good care of my mother.

402
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:05,175
I will be back.

403
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,175
Dal.

404
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:11,214
Do not go if that is not in your heart.

405
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,244
We have a lot to do here.

406
00:31:14,244 --> 00:31:15,585
Do you remember?

407
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:19,184
When you went to Pyeongyang
Castle to get your memories back?

408
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:21,854
That is what I told you to stop you.

409
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:26,994
Whatever happens, I ought to face it head-on.

410
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,035
Otherwise, I would never improve.

411
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:53,754
- Great!
- Keep going.

412
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:55,754
- Like this.
- Like that.

413
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:57,455
- Hey.
- Nice.

414
00:31:57,494 --> 00:32:00,524
- Here I am!
- You are here.

415
00:32:34,024 --> 00:32:37,635
I do not know what destiny they hold.

416
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:40,964
I wonder if I am pushing them...

417
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:43,205
to death to fulfill my goals.

418
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:50,015
I feel as if what happened
to Dal is my fault.

419
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:54,485
He did not wish to play the world's game.

420
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:58,214
But he is on a tough road because he met me.

421
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:02,355
We cannot place any blame for such things.

422
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:05,094
That is done out of trust and love.

423
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:11,594
Dal is not the one who
is suffering from pain.

424
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:17,504
You have yet to shake off
your confusion as well.

425
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:21,944
"Confusion".

426
00:33:23,274 --> 00:33:26,344
What can I do to rid myself of confusion?

427
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:33,485
You are asking me for the
answer you already have.

428
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:44,635
Wol Gwang!

429
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:58,045
Wol Gwang!

430
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,485
Ga Jin.

431
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:14,994
What brings you here?

432
00:34:15,194 --> 00:34:16,795
I am here to teach you.

433
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:19,735
And I will learn as well.

434
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:24,775
What do you mean?

435
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:34,345
- This is a real sword.
- On Dal.

436
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,285
I am your master.

437
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:51,465
I fooled you.

438
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:53,365
I wanted to use you,

439
00:34:53,365 --> 00:34:56,105
so I stole your heart and your life.

440
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:58,175
I know.

441
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:09,045
I see you in great pain, but I never
did anything to ease that pain.

442
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:10,155
No.

443
00:35:11,514 --> 00:35:12,785
I knew what you were doing,
but I still chose you,

444
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:13,785
so you did not fool me.

445
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:17,055
Why are you doing this for me?
Why? I do not deserve your love.

446
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:18,925
Have you forgotten?

447
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:21,824
You are the destiny I chose.

448
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:23,235
Why?

449
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:51,454
I am scared...

450
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:54,525
that we might change...

451
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:57,095
and will eventually be ruined.

452
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,305
Do not fear.

453
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,905
We will never change.

454
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:11,975
Dal.

455
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:23,225
My dear wife.

456
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:28,764
You are mine.

457
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:34,865
This is the guardian stone
my mother left behind.

458
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:42,634
This stone will keep you safe.

459
00:37:44,535 --> 00:37:46,305
Please take good care of the princess.

460
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:51,744
Right.

461
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:54,615
I remember this necklace.

462
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:58,384
The late Queen gave you this that day.

463
00:37:59,624 --> 00:38:01,725
And this will keep you safe now.

464
00:38:02,624 --> 00:38:04,254
And this represents...

465
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:08,225
our shared fate as husband and wife.

466
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:24,875
Are you making any progress
with your martial arts training?

467
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,645
General Go's hands are
full with the bodyguards,

468
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:29,875
so I am training alone.

469
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:34,245
If you miss 1 day, it takes
10 to get back on track.

470
00:39:34,484 --> 00:39:36,084
Make sure you work hard.

471
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,255
Yes. I will keep that in mind.

472
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:42,954
By the way, is it because of
Gochuga that the palace is...

473
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:45,255
under strict guard?

474
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:47,765
It is none of your business.

475
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:52,734
I beg you to deal with the
matter with the utmost severity.

476
00:39:55,005 --> 00:39:57,535
- Now eat.
- Yes.

477
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:05,875
Father.

478
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:08,344
Father.

479
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:11,155
Father!

480
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:14,584
Father, are you okay? Father.

481
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:17,724
Is anybody there? Father!

482
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:28,635
How dare you show up here?

483
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:31,074
I heard that His Majesty is unwell.

484
00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:33,444
Did you forget that you are under probation?

485
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:35,545
- Still...
- Go back to your chambers.

486
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:37,745
Why would you cry? It brings bad bad luck.

487
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:50,925
Explain what happened.

488
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:53,125
He has taken medicine for acute indigestion,

489
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,895
but he is not getting better.

490
00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:56,864
His heart is beating too fast as well.

491
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:59,734
I cannot figure out what the problem is.

492
00:40:59,734 --> 00:41:01,604
How can you say that as the royal physician?

493
00:41:02,364 --> 00:41:05,734
Could there have been poison in his food?

494
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:07,905
Won.

495
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:11,015
All his food was thoroughly
examined, but no poison was found.

496
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:13,444
Vomiting and diarrhea are clearly...

497
00:41:13,444 --> 00:41:15,114
symptoms of acute indigestion.

498
00:41:15,114 --> 00:41:17,584
Then why don't you try
other kinds of medicine?

499
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:21,285
Medicine should be used with extreme caution.

500
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:25,495
- Father!
- Your Majesty.

501
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:28,224
Are you okay, Father?

502
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:31,334
A dangerous aura has engulfed the King.

503
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,135
Soon,

504
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,604
he will be facing a serious misfortune.

505
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,844
Your prediction was right.

506
00:41:49,415 --> 00:41:51,614
His Majesty is in critical condition.

507
00:41:51,785 --> 00:41:53,385
I am sorry to hear that.

508
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:55,255
If you are so excellent,

509
00:41:56,454 --> 00:41:58,824
do you also know how to prevent misfortunes?

510
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:00,824
It is nothing to boast about,

511
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:03,535
but I do know a thing or
two about medicinal herbs.

512
00:42:04,665 --> 00:42:06,464
If I may,

513
00:42:06,464 --> 00:42:09,005
I would like to have an
audience with His Majesty...

514
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:11,005
before I come up with a solution.

515
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:33,864
Prepare an antidote.

516
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:36,125
You made the locks.

517
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:38,694
I am sure you can make the keys as well.

518
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:41,334
That was not just any poison.

519
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:43,305
Whoever poisoned him...

520
00:42:43,305 --> 00:42:45,305
managed to disguise it as a natural death.

521
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:48,675
I cannot guarantee that my
antidote will be effective.

522
00:42:48,675 --> 00:42:49,775
Mo Yong.

523
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:56,714
Just follow my father's order
and prepare an antidote.

524
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,015
That way, you can be safe.

525
00:43:02,484 --> 00:43:06,295
Still, I will not be able to
tell His Majesty in advance.

526
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:10,035
Even if I was interrogated
about who poisoned His Majesty,

527
00:43:11,665 --> 00:43:13,864
I could not answer that it was my father.

528
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:16,675
In that case,

529
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:19,775
how are you going to use the antidote?

530
00:43:20,675 --> 00:43:23,344
The royal physician will
demand an explanation.

531
00:43:27,114 --> 00:43:29,385
Even with the antidote, I
will be faced with a dilemma.

532
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:36,354
Do you...

533
00:43:38,395 --> 00:43:39,925
trust me?

534
00:43:49,005 --> 00:43:53,305
Lady Hae says this medicine is your lifeline.

535
00:44:08,055 --> 00:44:11,895
You do not deserve a comfortable death.

536
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:14,765
Wait until your empire falls...

537
00:44:15,525 --> 00:44:18,594
and your children vomit blood.

538
00:44:18,594 --> 00:44:20,064
Take your last breath...

539
00:44:21,135 --> 00:44:25,405
as a beautiful misery unfolds
before your very eyes.

540
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:17,555
The King survived.

541
00:45:18,995 --> 00:45:21,025
Are you sure you prepared
the poison properly?

542
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:23,094
I would never...

543
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:26,704
dare to disobey your order.

544
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:31,405
I guarantee that the poison was effective.

545
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:40,484
Get lost.

546
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:29,964
I am sorry.

547
00:46:47,584 --> 00:46:49,484
It is to transfer control of the military...

548
00:46:49,644 --> 00:46:52,814
to the Five Tribes.

549
00:46:53,154 --> 00:46:55,225
Please approve it.

550
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:59,394
Is this why you wanted to see me so urgently?

551
00:46:59,394 --> 00:47:02,324
The ongoing rebellious activities
must be suppressed immediately.

552
00:47:02,324 --> 00:47:05,064
I beg you to give an order...

553
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:06,965
on behalf of the royal family.

554
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:13,604
Once the Crown Prince approves,

555
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:16,344
two goals will be achieved.

556
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:20,285
By pressuring the Crown
Prince into giving an order,

557
00:47:20,914 --> 00:47:23,114
we can first suppress the rebellion.

558
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:27,055
After that, when the time is right,

559
00:47:27,985 --> 00:47:30,455
we will hold the Crown Prince responsible.

560
00:47:30,455 --> 00:47:32,824
With His Majesty still alive,

561
00:47:32,824 --> 00:47:35,894
the Crown Prince is giving
a royal order himself?

562
00:47:37,735 --> 00:47:40,205
That would make him an
undutiful and disloyal son.

563
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:42,064
He would sustain his life,

564
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:45,235
but he will not be able to
keep his title as crown prince.

565
00:47:47,604 --> 00:47:48,805
That is why...

566
00:47:49,705 --> 00:47:51,715
I asked you to come. To read a fortune.

567
00:47:53,344 --> 00:47:55,015
Will Prince Geon Mu...

568
00:47:56,015 --> 00:47:58,185
rise to the throne?

569
00:48:08,564 --> 00:48:09,725
I...

570
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,005
cannot sign this.

571
00:48:20,674 --> 00:48:21,904
Your Highness...

572
00:48:21,904 --> 00:48:23,874
How dare I make a decision...

573
00:48:24,574 --> 00:48:27,314
that is meant for the King to decide?

574
00:48:27,314 --> 00:48:29,644
But this is an urgent matter.

575
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:32,685
Besides, before my father had fallen ill,

576
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,654
he made clear about the
fate of the Sunno Tribe.

577
00:48:37,324 --> 00:48:38,455
I cannot...

578
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:42,265
cross his will as his son.

579
00:48:42,424 --> 00:48:44,634
You are a filial son, Your Highness.

580
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:48,735
But you should consider the
safety of the Princess also.

581
00:48:48,735 --> 00:48:51,205
The fact that the Sunno Tribe
is threatening my sister...

582
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:53,674
is merely a claim you made.

583
00:48:53,674 --> 00:48:55,344
Because that is the fact.

584
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:59,374
But my sister is not someone who
will be controlled by others.

585
00:49:00,414 --> 00:49:01,745
And I do not...

586
00:49:03,515 --> 00:49:05,084
wish to be controlled by others either.

587
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:07,555
Your Highness...

588
00:49:07,555 --> 00:49:09,324
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness.

589
00:49:13,465 --> 00:49:15,164
How can you be laughing?

590
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:18,134
Is the young Crown Prince's
guts not admirable?

591
00:49:18,364 --> 00:49:20,205
If we cannot get through to
him with a justification,

592
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:22,005
then we should get through
to him using our skills.

593
00:49:22,035 --> 00:49:23,404
What do you mean by skills?

594
00:49:23,404 --> 00:49:24,834
The Sunno Tribe can be...

595
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:27,574
subjugated by the private
army of the Gyeru Tribe alone.

596
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:30,245
The advance guard must already be there.

597
00:49:32,445 --> 00:49:36,185
You only need to agree on behalf
of the Five Tribe council.

598
00:49:38,884 --> 00:49:42,424
We need two more men to guard
around the Fox Rock, right?

599
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:44,755
The byroad to the village
can be seen well from there.

600
00:49:45,495 --> 00:49:47,094
You and San can leave.

601
00:49:48,295 --> 00:49:50,265
- What?
- This is the Sunno Tribe's fight.

602
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:52,364
The Gokturks, such as yourselves,
do not need to get involved.

603
00:49:52,664 --> 00:49:53,864
Hey, Sa Pung Gae.

604
00:49:53,864 --> 00:49:56,235
I am just worried that you might die.

605
00:49:57,935 --> 00:50:01,344
I mean, you are the type to act up.

606
00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:04,015
So what I am trying to say is...

607
00:50:06,745 --> 00:50:07,914
Dong Mun!

608
00:50:14,025 --> 00:50:15,154
No, Jin.

609
00:50:27,735 --> 00:50:29,364
What is this?

610
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:32,834
It belonged to General On Hyeop.

611
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:35,775
- Please make a good one out of it.
- Okay.

612
00:50:36,674 --> 00:50:39,874
If it is a sword that Dal will
use, then we need to do a good job.

613
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:41,884
Chief!

614
00:50:42,185 --> 00:50:45,785
There is... Chief!

615
00:50:47,685 --> 00:50:49,185
Chief!

616
00:50:56,324 --> 00:50:57,965
You came right on time.

617
00:50:59,664 --> 00:51:02,404
This is Woo Yeong who used to
serve General On Hyeop with me.

618
00:51:02,634 --> 00:51:04,005
This is Princess Pyeonggang.

619
00:51:06,074 --> 00:51:08,644
It is my honor to meet you, Your Highness.

620
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:11,515
My name is Woo Yeong.

621
00:51:13,045 --> 00:51:14,314
Please get up.

622
00:51:19,884 --> 00:51:21,324
It seems like...

623
00:51:21,324 --> 00:51:23,555
he came here with his army as
soon as he got my secret letter.

624
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:28,094
The old comrades of our
tribe are also gathering...

625
00:51:28,094 --> 00:51:29,695
to make their way here.

626
00:51:29,695 --> 00:51:32,235
We must take part in this important fight...

627
00:51:32,295 --> 00:51:34,205
as we spent years in resentment.

628
00:51:34,904 --> 00:51:36,535
We are grateful, Your Highness.

629
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:39,775
I feel as though I gained a thousand troops.

630
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:47,285
Princess Pyeonggang! Princess Pyeonggang!

631
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:52,015
Your Highness, we are in trouble!

632
00:52:07,864 --> 00:52:09,604
You seem familiar.

633
00:52:13,874 --> 00:52:15,975
How many of you are there?

634
00:52:16,275 --> 00:52:17,775
How many weapons have you got?

635
00:52:18,874 --> 00:52:22,314
There are 10,000 soldiers
and 1,000 war horses.

636
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:24,414
Are you surprised?

637
00:52:29,685 --> 00:52:31,124
Pung Gae!

638
00:52:31,955 --> 00:52:33,795
You worthless barbarian.

639
00:52:34,664 --> 00:52:38,364
What? You do not deserve
to be called a human.

640
00:52:39,965 --> 00:52:41,965
You piece of trash.

641
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:43,535
Are you okay?

642
00:52:44,705 --> 00:52:45,834
Darn it.

643
00:52:46,604 --> 00:52:48,074
Down this mountain,

644
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:51,374
dozens of soldiers from the
Gyeru Tribe are stationed.

645
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:53,884
That means they are the advance guard.

646
00:52:54,114 --> 00:52:56,785
They must have spied out on us,
so they know we are fortified.

647
00:52:56,785 --> 00:52:58,215
That must be why they
put a halt to the attack.

648
00:52:59,715 --> 00:53:03,124
Just as you said, it was important
to build a fence around the village.

649
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:06,255
There is only a handful of them.
We should just get rid of them.

650
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:08,265
What if Jin gets hurt?

651
00:53:11,495 --> 00:53:12,765
Do not worry.

652
00:53:13,535 --> 00:53:16,164
I will come up with a way to save her.

653
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:27,515
Lady Hae.

654
00:53:34,824 --> 00:53:36,485
Go wait for me at the dock.

655
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:45,894
Are you trying to run away at night?

656
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:49,005
If I have to leave, will you let me go?

657
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,074
I have fulfilled all my duties.

658
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:53,805
It is not over yet.

659
00:53:56,144 --> 00:53:58,074
I do not wish to let you go.

660
00:54:00,945 --> 00:54:03,185
I do not want to be used anymore.

661
00:54:03,814 --> 00:54:04,955
Especially...

662
00:54:07,525 --> 00:54:10,525
by a man who has someone else in his heart.

663
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:16,725
Then why do you not come into it?

664
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:20,705
I will open...

665
00:54:23,265 --> 00:54:24,935
my heart for you.

666
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:31,515
I guess you have not heard.

667
00:54:32,245 --> 00:54:34,584
The person you love...

668
00:54:37,614 --> 00:54:40,285
is in deep trouble.

669
00:54:49,265 --> 00:54:50,765
Jin, are you okay?

670
00:54:51,965 --> 00:54:53,094
Yes.

671
00:54:55,265 --> 00:54:57,305
What about you?

672
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:01,404
Why did you have to spew
such nonsense earlier?

673
00:55:01,644 --> 00:55:05,144
I had to so that you and the
others would not be hurt.

674
00:55:08,844 --> 00:55:10,045
That is right.

675
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:14,154
Who are you?

676
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:20,394
I am the eldest daughter of the King
of Goguryeo, Princess Pyeonggang.

677
00:55:23,295 --> 00:55:24,634
Your Highness!

678
00:55:39,644 --> 00:55:42,215
Father. Father!

679
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:49,584
Geon. Because the tangled
fate still continues,

680
00:55:51,594 --> 00:55:53,495
the King is on the throne.

681
00:55:53,495 --> 00:55:55,164
Goguryeo originally...

682
00:55:57,124 --> 00:55:59,265
belongs to our family.

683
00:56:00,965 --> 00:56:03,535
It is time to take back our place.

684
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:05,674
Are you...

685
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:08,344
prepared?

686
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:16,384
Are you plotting a conspiracy?

687
00:56:20,414 --> 00:56:21,785
It is a subjugation.

688
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:24,725
The cavalry and soldiers of
the Gyeru Tribe will gather...

689
00:56:24,725 --> 00:56:26,154
before the break of dawn.

690
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:29,725
Go and attack.

691
00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:32,134
Attack and...

692
00:56:32,134 --> 00:56:34,104
- seize the Princess you wanted.
- Father.

693
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:37,374
I started the fire, but
you should control it!

694
00:56:40,604 --> 00:56:42,844
That is what the next chief
of the Gyeru Tribe should do.

695
00:56:57,154 --> 00:56:58,525
I will...

696
00:57:02,864 --> 00:57:04,435
accept your order.

697
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:07,094
Do not be burned by the fire.

698
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:09,005
Yes, Father.

699
00:57:20,344 --> 00:57:22,515
- Let them go!
- Yes, sir.

700
00:57:24,884 --> 00:57:27,584
Everything will be okay now. You
should go back to the village.

701
00:57:27,685 --> 00:57:28,924
What about you?

702
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:32,824
Pung Gae, are you okay?

703
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,924
We cannot go without you. What will you do?

704
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:38,235
I will follow you right after.

705
00:57:38,235 --> 00:57:39,594
You expect me to believe that?

706
00:57:39,594 --> 00:57:42,634
Do not believe her. It is a lie.

707
00:57:42,634 --> 00:57:46,104
You must have forgotten, but I am a princess.

708
00:57:47,174 --> 00:57:49,045
I am the daughter of Goguryeo's king.

709
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:51,344
Would they dare to hurt me?

710
00:57:53,414 --> 00:57:55,515
- Let them go.
- Yes, sir.

711
00:58:02,424 --> 00:58:03,785
Be careful.

712
00:58:06,455 --> 00:58:08,195
- Take care of Dong Mun.
- What?

713
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:10,695
Why? What about you?

714
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:13,094
- I need to go to Dal.
- What?

715
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:16,104
- Hey.
- I should go.

716
00:58:16,904 --> 00:58:20,074
But... Hey, Pung Gae!

717
00:59:09,124 --> 00:59:10,525
Won.

718
00:59:13,525 --> 00:59:14,765
Father.

719
00:59:15,525 --> 00:59:16,765
Father.

720
00:59:49,995 --> 00:59:51,594
Are you here, Master?

721
00:59:53,195 --> 00:59:54,465
Dal.

722
00:59:56,834 --> 01:00:00,205
Pung Gae. What are you doing here?

723
01:00:18,424 --> 01:00:21,664
WIBALTA: THE CHIEF OF NORTHERN ZHOU

724
01:00:26,394 --> 01:00:29,604
THE BORDER OF GOGURYEO

725
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:31,475
- Oh, no!
- What is going on?

726
01:00:31,475 --> 01:00:34,404
It is the Northern Zhou! Sound the alarm!

727
01:00:34,404 --> 01:00:36,745
It is the Northern Zhou!

728
01:00:36,745 --> 01:00:40,515
- It is the Northern Zhou!
- Get ready!

729
01:00:54,695 --> 01:00:56,765
Go back to Gochuga and tell him this.

730
01:00:57,225 --> 01:01:00,805
Even the last man of the Sunno
Tribe will fight against him.

731
01:01:00,805 --> 01:01:03,104
The same goes for the Gyeru Tribe.

732
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:10,874
You must stop, Your Highness,
to put an end to this fight.

733
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:13,114
You want me to end a fight
that has not even begun?

734
01:01:13,114 --> 01:01:14,985
The King is in critical condition.

735
01:01:15,445 --> 01:01:17,485
The Crown Prince is all alone too.

736
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:20,485
You must go back with me...

737
01:01:21,485 --> 01:01:23,424
to bring peace to this empire.

738
01:01:27,295 --> 01:01:28,664
Please get up.

739
01:01:32,235 --> 01:01:33,495
Your Highness.

740
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:39,104
You talk of peace,

741
01:01:40,275 --> 01:01:41,844
and yet, you brought your army here?

742
01:01:41,844 --> 01:01:43,805
You only need to go back with me.

743
01:01:43,805 --> 01:01:46,914
This is Gochuga's order, is it not?

744
01:01:46,914 --> 01:01:48,245
That is not true.

745
01:01:49,445 --> 01:01:51,584
I am here for you, Your Highness.

746
01:01:51,914 --> 01:01:53,384
I am here for you and Goguryeo.

747
01:01:53,384 --> 01:01:55,084
If I follow you,

748
01:01:56,255 --> 01:01:58,624
everyone remaining here will be killed.

749
01:02:00,354 --> 01:02:02,725
That is what you are here for.

750
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,305
You should...

751
01:02:12,435 --> 01:02:14,035
just kill me only.

752
01:02:22,644 --> 01:02:24,555
Whether or not you follow,

753
01:02:26,084 --> 01:02:28,055
the traitors will be punished.

754
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,594
Please do not see anyone's blood...

755
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:35,695
and just come with me.

756
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:40,795
Ga Jin!

757
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,745
Ga Jin.

758
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:19,775
Hey, Go Geon!

759
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:22,844
Do not kill innocent people,

760
01:03:23,475 --> 01:03:25,745
and have a one-on-one fight with me.

761
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:28,144
You are asking for your death.

762
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:31,055
Dal, stop it.

763
01:03:31,685 --> 01:03:35,225
I cannot stop. You know I cannot.

764
01:03:36,584 --> 01:03:39,525
You deserve more than death
considering what you did to Mother.

765
01:03:44,664 --> 01:03:46,195
Drop your swords.

766
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,935
Hey, country bumpkin.

767
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:54,274
You learned some petty tricks.

768
01:03:56,805 --> 01:03:58,815
Do you know how it feels to
kill a man with a real sword?

769
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:08,254
Even a wooden sword...

770
01:04:09,254 --> 01:04:11,125
is too good for the likes of you.

771
01:04:31,844 --> 01:04:33,915
- General Go!
- What is it?

772
01:04:35,085 --> 01:04:36,944
The Northern Zhou has invaded our border.

773
01:05:02,605 --> 01:05:03,805
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

774
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:05,745
<i>The Sunno Tribe is to head to the north...</i>

775
01:05:05,745 --> 01:05:07,315
<i>and stop the Northern Zhou.</i>

776
01:05:07,475 --> 01:05:09,685
<i>I only fight for you.</i>

777
01:05:09,685 --> 01:05:12,455
<i>When the King told me that I am his son,</i>

778
01:05:12,455 --> 01:05:14,524
<i>that I am your husband,</i>

779
01:05:14,524 --> 01:05:16,324
<i>I was really glad.</i>

780
01:05:16,324 --> 01:05:19,194
<i>I sent a false secret message
to Silla just for you.</i>

781
01:05:19,194 --> 01:05:21,094
<i>There is a talented fortune-teller.</i>

782
01:05:21,094 --> 01:05:23,665
<i>That is the guy from Songhwadang,
the chief of Cheonjubang.</i>
