00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:07,235
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:09,160
(Characters, incidents, and dates do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:13,401
(Episode 8)

4
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:18,670
Your Majesty. General Go wishes to see you.

5
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:20,411
Tell him to come back later.

6
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:22,440
General.

7
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:28,226
I was waiting to see you since early morning.

8
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:30,080
I told you to come back later.

9
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:36,760
It involves the Princess' safety.

10
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:48,541
Keep going.

11
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:57,410
Hey.

12
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,705
I got nothing. No one knows...

13
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,045
what Songhwadang is.

14
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:24,015
That does not mean you can drink my alcohol.

15
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:26,470
What man gets upset so easily?

16
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:29,211
Jin, he is more narrow-minded than he looks.

17
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:30,885
Do you have something?

18
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:33,620
No. No one has heard of that name.

19
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,450
Where is On Dal?

20
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,726
He has one last place to ask.

21
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:41,060
Does he think he is Ga Jin's husband?

22
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:43,060
That is what he is like.

23
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:45,896
Once he decides he will protect something,

24
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:48,661
he will do it, even if the sky falls.

25
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,631
Ga Jin is just like that.

26
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:54,241
She is the same.

27
00:01:56,846 --> 00:02:00,581
It must be tough being friends with someone so frustrating.

28
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:05,250
Exactly.

29
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,630
Hey! Move.

30
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,530
Owner!

31
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:35,040
Today must be my day for unwelcome visitors.

32
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:37,651
I am a valuable guest.

33
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:40,651
I am here to offer you a way out.

34
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:51,261
- What are you doing here? - You do not need to know.

35
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:55,130
The women who should have gone to Northern Zhou.

36
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:57,801
Where did you take them?

37
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:00,771
I am guessing you sold them to Silla.

38
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:03,845
Tell me which road they are taking.

39
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,171
Women?

40
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,086
Do you buy and sell people too?

41
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:10,380
There is nothing in the world that cannot be traded.

42
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:13,921
That goes for people and their hearts.

43
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:23,731
You should not act out behind Gochuga's back.

44
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,636
What if he scolds you again?

45
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,735
This has nothing to do with my father.

46
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:29,361
On the contrary,

47
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:32,231
the silver I got in exchange for the women.

48
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:35,600
Who do you think took half of it?

49
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:43,711
The Princess...

50
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,780
hid herself among the women sold off as tributes?

51
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:50,181
So General Go took the special forces...

52
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,921
and the King summoned Hae Ji Weol.

53
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,530
The Princess has overturned her fortune.

54
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:09,970
We should do as she wishes.

55
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:15,810
Do not try to talk yourself out with lies.

56
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:18,655
I am here on the King's command.

57
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:21,050
Tell me where the women are.

58
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:23,790
You should just cut me down.

59
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:27,720
I am giving you a chance to come clean.

60
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:29,790
But you refuse it.

61
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,360
Would I be the only guilty party?

62
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:36,201
I knew you would do this.

63
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,170
I sent some men out at dawn already.

64
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:42,276
They will check all the routes to Silla.

65
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:45,811
Even if you keep quiet, I will eventually get what I want.

66
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:51,050
And the Princess will protect the women.

67
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:54,751
- The Princess? - She is with them now.

68
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,151
To save the Goguryeo people.

69
00:04:57,156 --> 00:05:00,895
Ga Jin? Where did she go?

70
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,521
She is a princess.

71
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:05,561
General!

72
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:11,600
We searched the main roads, piers, and rivers,

73
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,901
but we could not find the women.

74
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:17,716
You have one last chance. Speak the truth.

75
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:20,046
Cut out my tongue then slit my throat.

76
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:21,410
Hae Mo Yong!

77
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:24,381
Squirrel Pass.

78
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:29,951
Drug dealers and poachers from Silla choose that path.

79
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:32,691
That is the only way out if they want to go undetected.

80
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:38,131
General. Are you sure you will not regret this?

81
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:43,300
Tie her up and take her in!

82
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,670
Yes.

83
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:48,970
General. General, you must not do this.

84
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,170
Lead the way.

85
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:12,030
Keep going.

86
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:17,501
Hey. Stop there.

87
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:26,410
Whose is it?

88
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,645
- Is it yours? - No.

89
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:30,416
It is at your feet!

90
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,211
No. It is hers, not mine.

91
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,331
Stop!

92
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:56,670
Drop the sword.

93
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:01,445
Do not do it. He cannot kill us.

94
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:03,011
Shut your mouth.

95
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:07,951
He paid a lot of silver for us. He will not be able to kill me.

96
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,561
I said, drop the sword.

97
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:29,306
Just kill me too! I do not want to live like this anymore!

98
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:32,445
- Kill me too! - Just kill me!

99
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:36,110
- Kill me! - Kill me!

100
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,680
- Kill me! - Keep quiet!

101
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,850
Just kill me!

102
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:44,751
I am sick of this!

103
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,251
- Kill me! - Kill me!

104
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:23,461
Move!

105
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:34,871
They are gone.

106
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:39,570
They have gone. We are safe now.

107
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:18,050
Are you all right?

108
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:34,361
Dal.

109
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,901
Ga Jin.

110
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,780
Mo Yong.

111
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:54,280
I cannot believe this.

112
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:56,685
The Princess...

113
00:09:56,685 --> 00:10:00,861
must be determined to destroy the Sono Tribe.

114
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,521
Calm down.

115
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,095
Did Lord Kim also get caught?

116
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:09,960
No, I think he managed to escape to Silla.

117
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:13,200
That is all that matters.

118
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,705
You should quickly meet Gochuga and find a way to deal with this.

119
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:19,015
I have already met him.

120
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:22,146
Gochuga is a very complicated man.

121
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,881
He has failed to keep his own son under control.

122
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:36,861
Princess, what is it that you need to tell me?

123
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:43,131
It is embarrassing enough...

124
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,670
that he tried to sell the women of Goguryeo.

125
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:51,170
But he even secretly sold them to Silla.

126
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:56,881
And it was done by the head of the Sono Tribe.

127
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:07,195
I hope you are right this time.

128
00:11:07,195 --> 00:11:10,361
I witnessed it myself. I heard and saw everything.

129
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:14,631
These women are also my witnesses.

130
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:26,841
Is it true that you were meant to be sent to Northern Zhou?

131
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:30,680
Look at me.

132
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,550
Is that true?

133
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:39,751
Yes, Your Majesty.

134
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,361
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

135
00:11:57,105 --> 00:12:00,440
It is not good to let people outside the palace hear them cry.

136
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,710
Let us talk about this inside.

137
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:05,310
He is right.

138
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:08,651
We should also listen to what Lord Hae has to say.

139
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,820
Do not worry.

140
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,550
I will resolve what happened.

141
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:47,721
- Thank you. - Thank you.

142
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:01,300
The Sono Tribe is in charge of...

143
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:04,516
trading many different items,

144
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:08,540
which is probably what caused the unfortunate incident.

145
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:11,210
They are not items. They are people.

146
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:13,780
They are beautiful women of Goguryeo.

147
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:16,026
How could you give such an excuse...

148
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,851
after having made a deal with a Silla merchant?

149
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:19,521
Lord Hae.

150
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:23,920
What you did was foolish and wrong.

151
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:25,795
I am extremely ashamed of myself.

152
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,960
That is not enough.

153
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:31,371
You sold those women for your own personal interest.

154
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:34,406
You violated the law and traded with our enemy, Silla.

155
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:37,940
They are all serious crimes that cannot be overlooked.

156
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:41,810
We need to get one thing straight.

157
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:46,481
Lord Hae did not do it for his own personal interest.

158
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,881
I was the one who asked him for a favor.

159
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:58,160
What do you mean, Gochuga?

160
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:02,131
Our country is in financial trouble.

161
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:06,501
So I asked him if he knew a way for us to gather more silver.

162
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:12,810
I know very well that he did it out of loyalty to Goguryeo.

163
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,386
But that means...

164
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,280
General Go, I want you to go to the royal warehouse...

165
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:19,011
and check the silvers.

166
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,151
Yes.

167
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,200
General Go.

168
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:53,201

169
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,351
Let us go back.

170
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:04,865
Gochuga is a very complicated man.

171
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:07,665
He has failed to keep his own son under control.

172
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,830
He told me to move the silver...

173
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:13,401
to the royal warehouse.

174
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:17,401
He also said he even already moved the silver we gave him.

175
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,085
He is making a small sacrifice to save everyone.

176
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:26,450
Even so, we will be losing so much money.

177
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,580
We need to stay alive...

178
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,221
for any of that to even matter.

179
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:38,030
Right now, we need to make sure we stay alive.

180
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:44,930
He chose the wrong method to fill the treasury fund,

181
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:48,670
but you must not doubt Lord Hae's loyalty.

182
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:51,746
And if this information leaks...

183
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:53,516
and the people of Northern Zhou find out what happened,

184
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:56,241
things will surely get out of hand.

185
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:58,256
He is right.

186
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:01,820
They will get furious at us for deceiving them.

187
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,725
Lord Hae made a secret transaction with our enemy.

188
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:10,460
Are you going to let him get away with that?

189
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,030
His big contribution makes up for his small mistake.

190
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:20,530
Father, I hope you will give him the right punishment.

191
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:37,320
It is clear that Lord Hae has committed a sin.

192
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,991
But I praise his loyalty for Goguryeo.

193
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:46,391
Additionally, this incident must stay confidential...

194
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:50,660
to protect the dignity and face of our country.

195
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:53,300
Your Majesty.

196
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,641
Being able to get away with committing a crime...

197
00:16:56,676 --> 00:17:00,871
already harms the dignity of Goguryeo.

198
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:04,281
- Princess. - My goodness.

199
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:09,720
I want the historians to write this down.

200
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:14,565
No matter how much power or wealth one may have,

201
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:17,791
anyone who violates the law will be held responsible.

202
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,891
That is the discipline...

203
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:23,665
that King Jumong had when he built Goguryeo.

204
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,170
And it is the principle...

205
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:29,000
that King Pyeongwon follows as he rules the country.

206
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:46,391
Although I have announced to keep this confidential,

207
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:52,131
Lord Hae will still have to take responsibility for his actions.

208
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:54,605
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

209
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:57,000
Your Majesty!

210
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,041
Strike one!

211
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:15,881
Strike two!

212
00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:22,726
I have sinned greatly.

213
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,160
- I have sinned greatly. - Strike three!

214
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,861
Strike four!

215
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:35,141
At this rate, the next person will either be me or you.

216
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,801
Lord Jin.

217
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,710
Strike five!

218
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,841
How is saving the face of a criminal...

219
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:43,341
considered a punishment?

220
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:46,980
We are talking about the head of the Sono Tribe.

221
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,450
- It is already a big punishment... - I have sinned greatly.

222
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:51,690
for a man like him to go through this.

223
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:59,736
- I have sinned greatly. - I have sinned greatly.

224
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,960
Strike seven!

225
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,381
Strike nine!

226
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,690
The Princess keeps acting out.

227
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:30,821
Are you going to let her keep behaving that way?

228
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:34,901
Your Highness.

229
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:40,930
Calm down.

230
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:47,575
I safely sent the women home along with new clothes...

231
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:49,111
and some money.

232
00:19:49,216 --> 00:19:51,910
Those who live far away got escorted by my soldiers.

233
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,450
Thank you.

234
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:57,680
I would not have been able to save them without you.

235
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:01,861
Then do you finally believe that I will stand on your side?

236
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,621
Yes.

237
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:09,101
But I am certain Gochuga is very angry now.

238
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,875
I will try to find a way...

239
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,675
to stop him from sending you to the borderline.

240
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:18,871
No, that is between me and my father.

241
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,970
You do not need to worry about it.

242
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:26,680
I forgot to thank your friend for leading the way.

243
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:29,680
Please thank the country bumpkin for me.

244
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,831
You could have let it go.

245
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:46,270
You did not have to punish him.

246
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:50,541
He committed a crime. I could not let it slide.

247
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:54,980
But this will make your subjects very upset.

248
00:20:57,486 --> 00:20:59,210
I am the king.

249
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:03,250
Must I care about how they feel?

250
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:08,425
I heard the Princess will no longer be confined in Magnolia Hall.

251
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:09,924
(Confinement: Forbidding someone to leave a certain area)

252
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:11,690
Good going.

253
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:14,436
That will only bring bigger chaos to the palace.

254
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:15,660
My Queen.

255
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:24,641
Go and bring my medicine.

256
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:25,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

257
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,750
What is it? Do you wish to say something to me too?

258
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:35,581
Yes.

259
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:39,791
- What? - I think you did the right thing...

260
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:42,260
by punishing Lord Hae.

261
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,760
I know it was a difficult decision,

262
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,990
but you did what you had to do as the King.

263
00:21:50,365 --> 00:21:53,601
I truly admire your decision.

264
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:05,910
Take it away.

265
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:08,526
I do not want to drink it today.

266
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,625
But it will help you sleep.

267
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,351
I told you to take it away.

268
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:13,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

269
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:32,770
Gosh, stop sweeping. It is only making the place dusty.

270
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:37,240
Should I come live here?

271
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:40,155
Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?

272
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:42,486
Dal keeps leaving home.

273
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,585
So I am sure you feel lonely.

274
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:47,895
If I live here, I can sweep the yard...

275
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:51,496
and run errands for you. It will be very nice.

276
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,690
Hong Mae will get upset if you leave.

277
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:57,466
She only cares about the chief all day.

278
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:59,401
She does not care about me at all.

279
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:02,801
She might move in with him sooner or later.

280
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:04,770
You little brat.

281
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:07,641
Look at you talking about me behind my back.

282
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:09,811
How dare you.

283
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:12,111
What? I said nothing wrong.

284
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:15,456
You are always busy talking about the chief.

285
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,496
Goodness, your one-sided love for him is hard to watch.

286
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:21,496
My goodness, did you hear that?

287
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:24,496
This is why they say it is useless to help anyone.

288
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:26,160
Be quiet.

289
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:28,306
Have you not heard anything about Dal and the rest?

290
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,700
I do not know. I think they will be back today or tomorrow.

291
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:34,135
The hunt is lasting longer than expected.

292
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:36,170
They did not go on a hunt.

293
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:38,101
I am sure they went to the palace.

294
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:42,081
Pyeongyang Castle? Why?

295
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:43,845
Is it not obvious?

296
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:47,056
He went there to see the Princess from afar.

297
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,151
My goodness, that fool.

298
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,291
(Songhwadang)

299
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:26,551
He went to bed early.

300
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,420
I have something to tell him.

301
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:32,460
He does not want anyone to disturb him.

302
00:24:34,436 --> 00:24:35,700
Okay.

303
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:58,180
I want the historians to write this down.

304
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:01,020
No matter how much power or wealth one may have,

305
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:04,291
anyone who violates the law will be held responsible.

306
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:06,291
That is the discipline...

307
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:10,036
that King Jumong had when he built Goguryeo.

308
00:25:10,036 --> 00:25:11,430
And it is the principle...

309
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:15,341
that King Pyeongwon follows as he rules the country.

310
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:30,756
Your Majesty.

311
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:34,450
I will not forgive you even after I die.

312
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:39,760
You will never be able to take over Goguryeo.

313
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:46,770
Is the daughter trying to follow...

314
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:51,571
the path where her mother fell?

315
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:09,660
What did you just say?

316
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:11,121
Eight years ago,

317
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:14,031
the Sunno Tribe was wrongfully blamed as traitors.

318
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:17,000
They need to get back on their feet.

319
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,730
That is what I just said.

320
00:26:19,936 --> 00:26:21,700
That is nonsense.

321
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:23,700
They say one who has tied a knot must untie it.

322
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:26,940
The knot you tied wrong...

323
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:29,710
can only be untied by you.

324
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:33,915
This is not a matter you should be concerned about.

325
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:37,081
I can tell you this because it is me.

326
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,750
If it were not for them, I would be dead.

327
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:49,605
Those people who saved me eight years ago...

328
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:51,531
If you give up now,

329
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:53,730
that will be the end of Goguryeo.

330
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:56,770
They saved my life this time as well.

331
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:03,186
I am the daughter of their nemesis,

332
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:06,811
but even after realizing it, they gladly looked after me.

333
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:09,321
They are kind-hearted...

334
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:12,750
and faithful, both back then and now.

335
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:15,966
Please restore their honor...

336
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:18,531
and accept them as one of us.

337
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:20,665
If you resolve their old resentment,

338
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:23,301
they will be your reliable supporters.

339
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:28,801
But there will be a strong backlash.

340
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:30,970
You are the king.

341
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:36,281
Who will dare overturn a decision made by the king?

342
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:40,710
The king...

343
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:44,351
has to listen to 10,000 resentments with his 2 ears,

344
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:49,190
but he has only one mouth to govern the nation.

345
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:54,160
Your order is the law of this nation.

346
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:59,230
The Sunno Tribe and I...

347
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:02,141
will be your supporters.

348
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,071
The Sunno Tribe?

349
00:28:32,835 --> 00:28:34,571
Are you not well?

350
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:38,611
I heard you went to bed early last night.

351
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:41,940
How can I be so well...

352
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:45,010
when I feel depressed?

353
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,256
Are you upset because you had to endure shame...

354
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:51,950
at the Five Tribe council?

355
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:54,220
Or is it because...

356
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:59,091
the silver was transferred to the national treasury?

357
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,065
Do not worry.

358
00:29:03,065 --> 00:29:05,601
I did not say anything about the silver to the Princess.

359
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:09,500
As your son, I should not harm your reputation...

360
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:13,210
before I set off a long journey.

361
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:19,581
You do not need to go to the borderline.

362
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:22,720
Pardon?

363
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:25,121
The order has been withdrawn, so you do not need to leave.

364
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:27,690
What is the reason?

365
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:36,460
I just chose to grant your wish.

366
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:40,006
I suggest you keep trying...

367
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:42,470
to win the Princess' favor.

368
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,510
Your son drowned...

369
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:21,375
and your husband is bedridden after a stroke.

370
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:25,310
My goodness. You are truly good. That is all true.

371
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:27,884
What can I do to change my fate?

372
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:30,384
I will write you a talisman. Wait downstairs.

373
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:31,949
I will. Thank you.

374
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:37,360
You should call it a day.

375
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:38,964
Each time you channel your energy,

376
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,089
- your life span... - Are you...

377
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:44,604
able to attack and kill the King?

378
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:46,000
I can.

379
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,229
I will behead the King.

380
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:53,169
With the assassins we have left,

381
00:30:53,545 --> 00:30:55,985
we cannot even scale the palace walls.

382
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,479
Our only option...

383
00:31:00,415 --> 00:31:03,550
is to make the King come and see me.

384
00:31:07,794 --> 00:31:10,460
This is so embarrassing.

385
00:31:10,764 --> 00:31:15,329
I cannot believe I am locked up in my own home.

386
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,900
It is a good excuse to get some rest.

387
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:22,645
We will hear some good news soon.

388
00:31:22,645 --> 00:31:25,240
Good news, you say?

389
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,279
What are you talking about?

390
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:34,350
Gochuga will not let the Princess act out any longer.

391
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:38,850
He will be thinking of a plan.

392
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:40,219
A plan?

393
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,219
A plan?

394
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:51,165
What happened this time that we were called...

395
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:53,475
at the crack of dawn?

396
00:31:53,475 --> 00:31:57,869
Every single day feels like I am treading on thin ice.

397
00:31:58,305 --> 00:32:01,940
Lord Hae cannot be here because he was told to repent.

398
00:32:02,615 --> 00:32:06,850
He told a chief of one of the Five Tribes to repent?

399
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:10,785
Things are getting worse and worse.

400
00:32:10,785 --> 00:32:13,519
Here comes His Majesty.

401
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:32,810
Dealing with the recent Sono Tribe incident...

402
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:36,810
weighed greatly on my heart.

403
00:32:37,044 --> 00:32:40,949
I know how loyal and hard-working the chiefs of the Five Tribes are,

404
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,519
so it made me feel even worse.

405
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:48,790
Therefore, I thought about the kind of authority...

406
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:52,495
the Five Tribe council should have as the core of our government...

407
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:54,560
I wish to speak, Your Majesty.

408
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:59,600
Before we hear your wise ideas regarding the government,

409
00:33:00,134 --> 00:33:02,375
I would like to speak.

410
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,500
What do you wish to discuss?

411
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:11,380
It is about the Princess' marriage.

412
00:33:12,854 --> 00:33:14,250
Her marriage?

413
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:26,090
Is that true? You do not have to leave for the border?

414
00:33:26,634 --> 00:33:27,790
Yes.

415
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:32,130
I will remain in Pyeongyang Castle as Head of Special Forces.

416
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:34,870
That is great. It is great news.

417
00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:36,440
But...

418
00:33:37,544 --> 00:33:39,970
do you honestly think it is great?

419
00:33:43,544 --> 00:33:47,109
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

420
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:49,079
I am not sure.

421
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,090
I can never tell what he is thinking.

422
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:55,959
Princess. Open the door.

423
00:33:56,764 --> 00:33:58,060
Princess.

424
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:02,229
You are together.

425
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:04,035
What brings you here?

426
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:06,234
Seeing you together after what I heard...

427
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:08,234
makes me think this is a pretty picture.

428
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:10,199
What are you talking about?

429
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:14,740
You two are such a great match.

430
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:21,849
My gosh, honestly.

431
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:28,620
Your Highness. Wait...

432
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:31,719
You knew, didn't you, Master Go?

433
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:34,459
It is news to me too.

434
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:37,860
Do you not believe me?

435
00:34:44,444 --> 00:34:48,784
When the people are overjoyed by their princess' return,

436
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:50,884
if she were to marry as well,

437
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:53,409
it will be such a joyous occasion.

438
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:56,354
But it is too sudden.

439
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:58,420
It is not entirely unexpected, though.

440
00:34:59,124 --> 00:35:01,054
The marriage of the kingdom's...

441
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:03,824
two main families, the Gyeru Tribe and the royal family,

442
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:06,529
is a long-standing tradition.

443
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:10,630
That is preposterous.

444
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:20,374
I have no intention of marrying.

445
00:35:20,374 --> 00:35:23,244
Why are you even discussing this?

446
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:24,539
You are...

447
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,949
of marriageable age.

448
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:29,955
This is not for you to decide.

449
00:35:29,955 --> 00:35:31,279
Are you...

450
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:34,690
not satisfied with your spouse?

451
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:40,190
If I may say about my own son,

452
00:35:40,494 --> 00:35:43,329
he is not lacking as a possible husband to the Princess.

453
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:46,304
It is not about General Go's qualifications.

454
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,500
Then what is the problem?

455
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:52,039
Father.

456
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:54,969
- I do not wish to... - I cannot...

457
00:35:55,314 --> 00:35:57,180
allow it.

458
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:10,120
When the princess is ready,

459
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,994
she will pick a man she wishes...

460
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:15,829
and marry with my blessing.

461
00:36:42,564 --> 00:36:44,025
Their plan is...

462
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:46,990
to use my marriage to restrict both you and me.

463
00:36:47,564 --> 00:36:49,760
They wish to hold me hostage.

464
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:51,800
I know that.

465
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,469
How can I not know what the sly man is thinking?

466
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:58,670
Do not worry.

467
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:00,769
Without my permission,

468
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:04,180
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.

469
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:08,209
Father.

470
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:16,789
The Princess makes him think he has all the power.

471
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:22,265
Still, would he easily give permission to the marriage?

472
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:24,899
If words do not work, I will use force.

473
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:28,630
You must have a grudge regarding the recent incident.

474
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:34,039
Gochuga, if you are planning to raise an army,

475
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,940
I will offer you my support.

476
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:48,420
Why are you smiling?

477
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:50,060
The marriage.

478
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:53,860
I am in awe of your scheme.

479
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:57,060
I was trying to think of...

480
00:37:57,705 --> 00:38:00,300
my own way to approach the Princess.

481
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:01,570
Your own way?

482
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:10,385
I wished to go to Hwayeongjeon. Why are we here?

483
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:12,810
You will find out when you go inside.

484
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:49,919
Gochuga.

485
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,889
Are you out of your mind?

486
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:56,860
Do you know whose seat that is?

487
00:38:58,224 --> 00:38:59,860
It is King Pyeongwon's.

488
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:02,189
Or rather...

489
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:05,674
it is Go Yang Seong's.

490
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:07,569
(Go Yang Seong: The King's name)

491
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,600
How dare you?

492
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:13,139
Is anyone outside?

493
00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:14,870
Guards!

494
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:18,179
I sent away your bodyguards.

495
00:39:29,964 --> 00:39:31,419
Behold.

496
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:36,159
Eight years ago, that arrow speared...

497
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:38,429
your woman's heart.

498
00:39:49,684 --> 00:39:52,145
A man crazed by jealousy...

499
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:54,710
killed his own wife and people.

500
00:39:57,324 --> 00:39:59,850
Does he deserve to sit up here?

501
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:14,230
The only reason you were able to play king until now...

502
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:18,639
was because I allowed it.

503
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:22,285
How... How dare you, Go Won Pyo.

504
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:23,539
However...

505
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:27,110
if you forget your place and act out,

506
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:30,255
I must oust you immediately.

507
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:32,279
Even if the sky caves in,

508
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:37,319
I will not permit the marriage. Never.

509
00:40:37,464 --> 00:40:41,360
I said that permission is mine to give.

510
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:51,399
When the day breaks, the people will hear the good news.

511
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:56,179
Because the King will have announced the Princess' engagement.

512
00:40:57,314 --> 00:41:01,679
You will never get your own way.

513
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:06,019
Do you truly know what my wish is?

514
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:10,964
It is to get rid of the troublesome Princess...

515
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:12,760
and to bring down...

516
00:41:13,535 --> 00:41:15,659
your sickly son from his seat as heir.

517
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:21,029
Would you like to see me get my way?

518
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:25,069
You cannot do that.

519
00:41:26,844 --> 00:41:28,710
They are my unfortunate children.

520
00:41:29,814 --> 00:41:31,139
Which is why...

521
00:41:33,454 --> 00:41:35,450
I am offering a chance.

522
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:41,789
A chance for you and your offspring to save your lives.

523
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:51,000
That salt must be heavy.

524
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:54,200
We need at least this much to last a season at Ghost Valley.

525
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:56,074
Let me help you carry it.

526
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:59,139
No way. It is fine. Leave it.

527
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:01,340
The man should do the heavy lifting.

528
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:07,149
Us Gokturks do not discriminate women from men.

529
00:42:08,084 --> 00:42:09,549
This is Goguryeo.

530
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:11,980
You should be treated like a woman.

531
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:18,059
Well... I never asked to be treated specially.

532
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:23,165
What does that say? "The King's son-in-law"?

533
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,665
- What is that? - "The King's son-in-law"?

534
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:26,235
"The King's son-in-law"?

535
00:42:26,235 --> 00:42:28,635
- What is that about? - What is going on?

536
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:30,344
- What? - The Princess should marry.

537
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:31,875
- Is she still single? - Too bad.

538
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,769
Do you know what this is about? The King's son-in-law.

539
00:42:44,684 --> 00:42:46,620
I just left the King's chambers.

540
00:42:46,824 --> 00:42:48,525
You will not be allowed to see him.

541
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,365
I still must.

542
00:42:50,365 --> 00:42:51,689
Your Highness.

543
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:55,529
I may not be the best Daedaero,

544
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:58,000
but I am still the King's subject.

545
00:42:58,105 --> 00:43:00,929
If you have a command, please call on me at any time.

546
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,985
He said no one is allowed in.

547
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:16,250
Step aside.

548
00:43:17,424 --> 00:43:18,649
Your Highness.

549
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:26,360
Father, it is Pyeonggang. Do you hear me, Father?

550
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:30,059
What is this about? A royal wedding?

551
00:43:30,135 --> 00:43:33,005
I will never become a member of the Gyeru Tribe.

552
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:35,669
Father! Please rescind your command!

553
00:43:36,304 --> 00:43:40,010
Father!

554
00:43:40,775 --> 00:43:42,010
Let go of me!

555
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:48,409
- Your Highness. - Do not touch me.

556
00:43:48,785 --> 00:43:51,350
Why are you doing this, Your Highness?

557
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:54,419
It is cold. Come to Magnolia Hall.

558
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:57,659
- Leave me be. - Your Highness.

559
00:43:58,665 --> 00:44:00,130
Oh, dear...

560
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,939
What is the problem?

561
00:44:10,844 --> 00:44:12,674
Do you truly have no idea?

562
00:44:12,674 --> 00:44:15,039
Did you not say so yourself that...

563
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:18,385
you would gain the Princess' favor and make her yours?

564
00:44:18,385 --> 00:44:22,380
I gave you an opportunity. You should be grateful.

565
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:24,679
This is an arranged marriage.

566
00:44:27,454 --> 00:44:28,919
How am I to be grateful?

567
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:35,230
I refuse to be manipulated.

568
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:52,649
Whether it is for riches,

569
00:44:53,155 --> 00:44:54,684
the want of power,

570
00:44:54,684 --> 00:44:57,720
or maybe even one's good looks,

571
00:44:58,785 --> 00:45:03,059
every marriage in the world is about manipulation.

572
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:08,235
Taming the Princess with this marriage is good enough for me.

573
00:45:08,235 --> 00:45:09,429
But...

574
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:13,330
what is it that you truly want?

575
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:33,220
Without my permission,

576
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:36,519
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.

577

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

578
00:45:58,044 --> 00:46:01,409
Your Highness. The Crown Prince is here.

579
00:46:01,954 --> 00:46:06,590
Pyeonggang. Get up. You might faint.

580
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:11,319
Pyeonggang.

581
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:32,210
Go Won Pyo.

582
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:37,220
I will not forgive you.

583
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:43,760
The Princess may try to fight,

584
00:46:44,025 --> 00:46:46,360
but she will not be able to go against the royal wedding.

585
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:49,630
If Gochuga becomes in-laws with the King,

586
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:54,669
he will become even more powerful.

587
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,370
Do not worry.

588
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,609
I know he will...

589
00:47:01,045 --> 00:47:03,480
take Prince Geon Mu's side, not the crown prince.

590
00:47:04,444 --> 00:47:08,049
You do not think the rumor going around the palace...

591
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:10,980
is true, do you?

592
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:15,390
Gochuga and the late Queen Yeon...

593
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:18,160
- had a special... - Father!

594
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:23,559
The time is out of joint.

595
00:47:24,434 --> 00:47:27,430
Be mindful of your conduct.

596
00:47:27,934 --> 00:47:31,900
I hear the Five Tribe council is choosing the King's son-in-law.

597
00:47:32,204 --> 00:47:35,069
No matter how many sons of noble there are,

598
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:37,415
they will end up choosing General Go.

599
00:47:37,415 --> 00:47:41,379
I hear General Go will not accede to becoming king's son-in-law.

600
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:54,494
My goodness. Your Highness.

601
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:57,200
What are you all waiting for? Take her back to her chamber.

602
00:47:57,865 --> 00:48:01,900
Your Highness. Wake up, Your Highness.

603
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:17,879
Taming the Princess with this marriage is good enough for me.

604
00:48:18,284 --> 00:48:19,519
But...

605
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:23,519
what is it that you truly want?

606
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:38,940
Notify Jangbaek herb store...

607
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:42,109
of my sister's condition and tell them to send medicines.

608
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:44,545
Pardon? But...

609
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:47,385
Lord Hae and his daughter are put on probation.

610
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:51,049
She is the best one in Goguryeo when it comes to handling herbs.

611
00:48:52,155 --> 00:48:54,089
I will give you permission as a crown princess.

612
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,319
So send someone right away.

613
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:57,859
Yes, Your Highness.

614
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:14,970
Hang in there, Pyeonggang.

615
00:49:18,045 --> 00:49:19,910
We need to stop the royal wedding.

616
00:49:22,014 --> 00:49:25,720
But when Gochuga mentioned it, you said it was a clever move.

617
00:49:26,194 --> 00:49:27,994
Why the sudden change in thought?

618
00:49:27,994 --> 00:49:31,160
Gochuga already has control over the state affairs.

619
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:33,660
If he takes the princess as his daughter-in-law...

620
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:35,494
and seizes control of the royal household,

621
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:37,230
the Sono Tribe,

622
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:40,200
as well as the Gwanno Tribe will become their servants.

623
00:49:41,835 --> 00:49:44,039
Power is like water.

624
00:49:44,174 --> 00:49:47,369
Once it becomes stagnant, it will rot away.

625
00:49:49,115 --> 00:49:51,214
We will need to come up with an idea...

626
00:49:51,214 --> 00:49:55,210
to defend ourselves against Gochuga's arbitrary executions.

627
00:49:56,085 --> 00:49:59,079
Quietly and secretly.

628
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:05,359
My Lord, someone came looking for you from Magnolia Hall.

629
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:09,565
Magnolia Hall? Are you saying the princess is looking for Mo Yong?

630
00:50:09,565 --> 00:50:10,730
Yes, My Lord.

631
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:28,349
We need to lower her fever first.

632
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:32,279
We will help her recover her cold as we watch her condition,

633
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:34,694
but first, please bring me some warm water and a bowl.

634
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:36,420
Yes, I will.

635
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:40,460
Father...

636
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:44,829
Please...

637
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:47,769
do not turn away from me.

638
00:50:48,934 --> 00:50:50,440
Father...

639
00:50:55,744 --> 00:50:58,480
- Welcome back! - You guys are back.

640
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:02,115
I thought you went to get some groceries, but it took you so long!

641
00:51:02,115 --> 00:51:04,349
It must have been a lot of work. Put them here.

642
00:51:04,684 --> 00:51:08,150
My gosh, what is this? It is salt!

643
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,190
Where is Dal?

644
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:11,760
I have no idea.

645
00:51:14,764 --> 00:51:18,129
- Where are you going? - Just stay here.

646
00:51:20,335 --> 00:51:23,004
Did something happen at the Capital?

647
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:24,345
Not at all.

648
00:51:24,345 --> 00:51:27,539
We had nothing much to do there, so we were really bored.

649
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:35,554
- You must be Pung Gae. - Yes, I am here.

650
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:37,555
Oh, I brought some salt.

651
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:40,119
Why did you come alone? Where is Dal?

652
00:51:41,155 --> 00:51:43,694
There were some leathers left to sell.

653
00:51:43,694 --> 00:51:45,690
How dare you lie to me?

654
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:48,365
He could not go hunting,

655
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:51,500
so there is no leather to sell at all.

656
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:54,369
- Well... - Where is Dal?

657
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:58,440
What is he up to right now? Tell me everything.

658
00:51:58,674 --> 00:52:00,740
(Looking for candidates to become the King's son-in-law)

659
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:04,379
Who will become the King's son-in-law?

660
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:07,849
I am sure all the sons of noble will apply for it.

661
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:12,284
Nonetheless, the best one among them is General Go Geon.

662
00:52:12,284 --> 00:52:13,895
Are you kidding me?

663
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:16,464
The Five Tribe council needs to evaluate them.

664
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:20,490
Does that mean Gochuga will evaluate his own son?

665
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:24,460
You are right. Then it would not be fair.

666
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:09,240
Are you up, Your Highness?

667
00:53:09,315 --> 00:53:10,809
What are you doing here?

668
00:53:11,444 --> 00:53:12,845
Did Nanny call you?

669
00:53:12,845 --> 00:53:15,480
Lady Gongson went to decoct the herbs.

670
00:53:16,524 --> 00:53:19,450
You will get better soon if you take the medicine for a day or two.

671
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:23,490
I hope you will get better soon, Your Highness.

672
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:25,589
I will leave now.

673
00:53:28,895 --> 00:53:30,200
Mo Yong.

674
00:53:31,534 --> 00:53:33,099
Yes, Your Highness.

675
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:37,200
All your hard work will go in vain.

676
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:41,444
You are a criminal who violated the law, no matter what you do.

677
00:53:41,444 --> 00:53:45,980
That is why I understand how you feel more than anyone.

678
00:53:46,244 --> 00:53:48,710
I committed a crime under duress.

679
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,619
And you have to get married against your will.

680
00:53:52,655 --> 00:53:54,490
We are undergoing the same thing.

681
00:53:54,795 --> 00:53:58,390
Are you saying you committed the crime because of Gochuga?

682
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,529
He has absolute power.

683
00:54:01,494 --> 00:54:03,760
Who would dare to go against him?

684
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:07,700
If you cannot win, then run away from him, Your Highness.

685
00:54:08,234 --> 00:54:11,670
No, I am not going anywhere.

686
00:54:13,944 --> 00:54:15,970
If I were to run away because of such a small matter,

687
00:54:16,174 --> 00:54:17,910
I would not have come back.

688
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:31,660
I am sure Dal is going to cause trouble!

689
00:54:31,865 --> 00:54:34,665
Before he does,

690
00:54:34,665 --> 00:54:36,905
we need to do something, Chief.

691
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:39,433
He is not someone to act rashly.

692
00:54:39,434 --> 00:54:42,135
Pung Gae said he saw him too!

693
00:54:42,135 --> 00:54:44,943
The face of our nemesis of the Gyeru Tribe!

694
00:54:44,944 --> 00:54:46,444
Is that not true, Pung Gae?

695
00:54:46,444 --> 00:54:50,039
On top of that, that lady is going to get married.

696
00:54:50,115 --> 00:54:53,085
So Dal must not be in his right mind.

697
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:54,115
If what you are saying is true,

698
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:56,454
we do not have any good ways to stop him.

699
00:54:56,454 --> 00:55:00,295
We need to bring him back here even if we have to drag him.

700
00:55:00,295 --> 00:55:02,055
Calm down.

701
00:55:02,055 --> 00:55:04,524
Let us trust Dal and patiently wait until he comes back.

702
00:55:04,524 --> 00:55:08,964
My goodness. This is why I told him not to go to the mountain...

703
00:55:08,964 --> 00:55:11,534
nor the Capital. Forget it, then.

704
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:14,369
I told him this so many times,

705
00:55:14,504 --> 00:55:17,440
- but there is nothing I can do. - Here, grab this.

706
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:24,710
Who is he?

707
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:27,849
He is Ga Jin's father.

708
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:30,824
The father of that fox who seduced my Dal?

709
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:34,825
You are quite harsh.

710
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:37,424
Do you expect me to say nice things then?

711
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:38,795
How poorly did you raise your daughter...

712
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:40,534
that she is causing trouble wherever she goes?

713
00:55:40,534 --> 00:55:42,365
What is wrong with my daughter?

714
00:55:42,365 --> 00:55:46,165
She is shrewd, and she has a heart of gold.

715
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:49,635
Then why did a good-hearted daughter of yours seduce my son?

716
00:55:49,635 --> 00:55:51,605
"Seduce"?

717
00:55:51,605 --> 00:55:55,545
My gosh. Your son is the one who fell head over heels for her.

718
00:55:55,545 --> 00:55:59,115
You old fogey. How dare you babble on about my son?

719
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:03,184
"Old fogey"? Look at this old fart.

720
00:56:03,184 --> 00:56:05,155
- I called you old because you are! - Yeom Deuk! Please calm down!

721
00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:08,155
- Darn you! Darn you! - You think you are young?

722
00:56:08,155 --> 00:56:10,994
- Darn you, you old fogey! - Darn you!

723
00:56:10,994 --> 00:56:13,264
- Darn it. Darn you! - Educate your daughter properly!

724
00:56:13,264 --> 00:56:14,865
What is wrong with them?

725
00:56:14,865 --> 00:56:17,504
I hear Ga Jin is getting married.

726
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:20,974
"Married"? That means there will be a royal wedding.

727
00:56:20,974 --> 00:56:22,504
Then what about Dal?

728
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,044
That is what I am saying.

729
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:28,440
So I do not think those two will become in-laws.

730
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:30,740
My goodness.

731
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:40,890
I have a favor to ask.

732
00:56:41,694 --> 00:56:43,690
I have something to tell you too.

733
00:56:44,295 --> 00:56:45,760
Come on in.

734
00:56:52,504 --> 00:56:54,004
Do not worry.

735
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:55,835
Without my permission,

736
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:58,599
you will not marry into the Gyeru Tribe.

737
00:57:01,415 --> 00:57:05,339
Are you not satisfied with your spouse?

738
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:08,750
I thought you were not feeling well.

739
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:18,789
When you have too many thoughts, you need to move.

740
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:22,289
My fever broke though.

741
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:29,099
Why do you not teach me a move?

742
00:57:34,815 --> 00:57:36,210
I will no longer...

743
00:57:38,714 --> 00:57:40,609
be your master of swordsmanship.

744
00:57:51,295 --> 00:57:52,660
From now,

745
00:57:54,694 --> 00:57:56,730
I will be your husband, Your Highness.

746
00:57:58,665 --> 00:58:01,674
What did you just say?

747
00:58:01,674 --> 00:58:03,329
Please marry me.

748
00:58:04,845 --> 00:58:06,470
I will always be...

749
00:58:07,714 --> 00:58:09,970
on your side no matter what.

750
00:58:11,845 --> 00:58:13,950
Our parents might be ill-fated,

751
00:58:14,284 --> 00:58:16,150
but we are different.

752
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:19,750
If we come together as one, we can change Goguryeo...

753
00:58:20,895 --> 00:58:22,619
and make a better world.

754
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:28,960
I will pretend I did not hear what you just said.

755
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:31,260
It is a marriage of convenience.

756
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:36,670
That is right. I know the deep resentment you have...

757
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:39,170
against my father.

758
00:58:39,405 --> 00:58:42,470
But there is no one else...

759
00:58:43,014 --> 00:58:44,980
who knows you better than I do.

760
00:58:46,345 --> 00:58:49,379
That is because I have been watching you...

761
00:58:51,984 --> 00:58:53,519
and loving you for a long time.

762
00:59:00,194 --> 00:59:01,760
I will protect you...

763
00:59:02,865 --> 00:59:04,700
without a change of heart.

764
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:08,299
Please accept...

765
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:11,539
my proposal.

766
00:59:12,075 --> 00:59:13,369
I am sorry.

767
00:59:17,585 --> 00:59:19,609
Even if it is not a marriage of convenience,

768
00:59:21,115 --> 00:59:23,210
I cannot accept your feelings.

769
00:59:23,254 --> 00:59:25,119
I will take care of my father.

770
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:27,825
I will stop him from defaming you...

771
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:30,049
- and the King. - This is not about that.

772
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:32,289
I already have someone else...

773
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:35,089
in my heart.

774
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:42,900
My heart has been telling me...

775
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:48,970
that he is the one for a while.

776
00:59:52,915 --> 00:59:54,980
If I do not see him, I feel worried.

777
00:59:56,155 --> 00:59:58,049
When I see him, I feel bad for him.

778
01:00:01,355 --> 01:00:02,819
You have feelings...

779
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:06,890
for that mere country bumpkin?

780
01:00:07,635 --> 01:00:08,859
That is right.

781
01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:11,730
He is my man.

782
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:15,230
He is the one whom I will share my fate with.

783
01:00:22,145 --> 01:00:23,710
I will never...

784
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:28,650
give up on you.

785
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:44,960
You are willing to marry the princess?

786
01:00:46,335 --> 01:00:49,069
- Is that what you are saying? - Yes.

787
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:52,740
Please proceed with the royal wedding quickly.

788
01:00:57,184 --> 01:00:59,680
Why did you change your mind?

789
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:02,750
Even yesterday, you seemed not to want it.

790
01:01:03,655 --> 01:01:05,220
If...

791
01:01:07,524 --> 01:01:09,690
there is someone I strongly desire,

792
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:14,960
I must have her...

793
01:01:17,405 --> 01:01:19,000
even if that means I have to use force.

794
01:01:22,234 --> 01:01:24,339
That is what I realized.

795
01:01:28,714 --> 01:01:31,579
Even if the princess refuses until the end?

796
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,410
She will eventually become mine.

797
01:02:04,214 --> 01:02:07,180
(River Where the Moon Rises)

798
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:11,625
We need to make a dress for your wedding.

799
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:14,625
The wedding where the bride is bartered is not a joyous occasion.

800
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:18,059
We do not need any more misfortune in the royal family.

801
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:21,165
Help me. We will stop the Gyeru Tribe from abusing their power,

802
01:02:21,165 --> 01:02:24,260
and I will punish Go Won Pyo in the end.

803
01:02:24,305 --> 01:02:27,274
You are actually the son of On Hyeop?

804
01:02:27,274 --> 01:02:31,200
On Hyeop, you are tormenting me even after your death?

805
01:02:31,405 --> 01:02:33,944
You ended up bringing disgrace on your father!

806
01:02:33,944 --> 01:02:36,440
You are no longer my daughter.

807
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:40,085
Royal wedding and marriage of convenience are all over.

808
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:41,484
What do you mean it is over?

809
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:45,279
I will kill anyone who gets in my way and the princess!

810
01:02:45,784 --> 01:02:47,089
I am sorry.

811
01:02:48,295 --> 01:02:51,895
I can track it down, whether it is a lie or not.

812
01:02:51,895 --> 01:02:53,359
Chil Gu?

813
01:02:53,964 --> 01:02:58,059
This is the only way I can avoid the royal wedding.

814
01:02:58,165 --> 01:03:01,369
Please forgive your father.

815
01:03:02,075 --> 01:03:03,470
Father.

816
01:03:04,474 --> 01:03:07,039
He is my husband.

817
01:03:07,345 --> 01:03:09,710
We got married.

818
01:03:10,484 --> 01:03:12,680
He was the general of Goguryeo.

819
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:14,750
He was a commander.

820
01:03:15,784 --> 01:03:19,079
I am the son of General On Hyeop, the 17th chief of the Sunno Tribe,

821
01:03:21,895 --> 01:03:23,519
My name is On Dal.
