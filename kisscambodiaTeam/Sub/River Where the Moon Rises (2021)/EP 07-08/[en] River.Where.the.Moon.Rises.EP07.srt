1
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:07,441
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,405
(Characters, incidents, and dates do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:13,111
Go Won Pyo captured Tara San and Tara Jin.

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:16,546
The criminals that got caught are my friends.

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,721
As soon as we save your friends,

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:20,791
we will be returning to Ghost Valley right away.

7
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,156
(Previously)

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,856
I am the eldest daughter of Goguryeo's King,

9
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,656
Princess Pyeonggang.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,866
The one we have to keep in check is the Princess, not the King.

11
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:39,110
If she takes after her late mother's nature,

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,175
soon, her claws will be directed at us.

13
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,881
It has been long.

14
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:50,446
I am delighted to see that you are in good health, Your Highness.

15
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:56,086
I have been well, thanks to you.

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,546
(Episode 7)

17
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,165
Let us go.

18
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,276
Hurry.

19
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,945
The King is pleased you are back,

20
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:03,415
but he is also very surprised.

21
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:05,920
Did you see the Crown Prince?

22
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,820
I should greet the Queen first,

23
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,716
before visiting the Crown Prince.

24
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:15,301
He looks more like his father each day.

25
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:16,496
(Prince Geon Mu)

26
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,396
He is so strong too.

27
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,406
That is good.

28
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:27,406
When the Crown Prince becomes king,

29
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:30,676
he can do his duty as a younger brother.

30
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,415
I am sorry.

31
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,785
He has a bad cold and is asleep.

32
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,095
Come to Magnolia Hall as soon as your cold heals.

33
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:59,406
There is a lot I wish to tell you.

34
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,290
You do not have a sister.

35
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,486
Princess Pyeonggang is not your true sister.

36
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,060
The late Queen Yeon had an affair,

37
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,655
and she was the dirty result.

38
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,755
She wants my son to clean up after the Crown Prince?

39
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,091
I could not believe what she said.

40
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,686
That is rightly what a sister would say.

41
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:57,300
What did I say?

42
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
We should have demoted the Crown Prince...

43
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,965
and replaced him with my Geon Mu.

44
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,876
Now it looks like the Princess will get in our way too.

45
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,135
There is a time for everything,

46
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,480
and the power must be balanced.

47
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,315
That power could go to the Princess.

48
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,155
She looked carefully at my son's face.

49
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,885
As if...

50
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:27,296
she suspects that...

51
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,195
he is not the King's offspring.

52
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,751
Oh? Is that not Dal?

53
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,445
My goodness. Chief. Chief.

54
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,015
What happened?

55
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:55,356
We heard no news, so we expected the worst.

56
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,786
There was a huge fuss.

57
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,660
You will faint if you hear what happened.

58
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,631
What happened?

59
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,996
Who are they?

60
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,296
Something happened in the Capital.

61
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:09,395
It is a long story. I will explain inside.

62
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,441
Yes. I shall come with you.

63
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:14,141
I will make some kudzu tea.

64
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:17,775
No. This is between father and son.

65
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,815
Did he have to upset me?

66
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:28,715
Princess?

67
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,255
I see.

68
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,856
She is the Princess.

69
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,366
Why do you not seem surprised, Mother?

70
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:41,236
Not much will surprise you when you are my age.

71
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,170
- It is for the best. - How so?

72
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,775
Now, because of that girl...

73
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,980
Because of the Princess, you will not have to fret anymore.

74
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,705
And Ghost Valley will be safe.

75
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,486
Think it was a crazy dream...

76
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,815
and forget about it.

77
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,395
What are you suspicious of?

78
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,410
I was told the Sunno Tribe was plotting treason,

79
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,505
so I sent soldiers over to quell the rebellion.

80
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,980
I had to save you and your mother.

81
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,376
However...

82
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,075
Mother died a gruesome death,

83
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,075
and I lost my memory and was left to wander.

84
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,945
Do you think that happened...

85
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,356
all because of me?

86
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,895
Yes. I am a good-for-nothing father, and I am ashamed.

87
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,261
Is that good enough?

88
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:45,195
I just want to know...

89
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:49,065
if you send soldiers for a different reason.

90
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,376
Was it truly just a rebellion that you suspected?

91
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,275
That is enough.

92
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:02,515
You return after eight years...

93
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,385
only to blame your father, and on top of that,

94
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,255
you even suspect nonsense.

95
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,726
I am too ashamed to face you myself.

96
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,695
At the ceremony,

97
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,135
I almost committed a crime for which I could never be forgiven.

98
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,775
We need not discuss the past.

99
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,876
Did you not do that...

100
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,905
because you had lost your memory?

101
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,145
But...

102
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,515
it will remain with me for a long time.

103
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,655
My terrible actions at the ceremony,

104
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,586
and your command to send soldiers...

105
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,126
to attack the Sunno Tribe.

106
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,435
The air is cold in the evenings.

107
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,246
Come indoors.

108
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:10,346
The moon is very bright.

109
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,295
Porridge will be easier to swallow than rice.

110
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,795
Crush this up and put it on your wounds.

111
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,035
Well...

112
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,566
I am very grateful.

113
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,336
You even got us a house to keep us from the dew.

114
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,376
This is a palace compared to a damp cave.

115
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:41,580
Did you live without a place to call home?

116
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,415
Well, something like that.

117
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,316
Do not speak too much.

118
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,885
We at least fought Goguryeo.

119
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,586
Instead of hiding like you.

120
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,055
What did you say?

121
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,966
I knew you would call on me one day.

122
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:04,966
I brought in the fake corpse.

123
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,976
Because my son told you to?

124
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,116
Is that what your excuse will be?

125
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:16,716
No.

126
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,716
General Go said the corpse was that of the assassin.

127
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,486
But I also knew that...

128
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,395
the assassin was Princess Pyeonggang.

129
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:36,696
Your herb store seems to reach every corner.

130
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,206
Your trickery...

131
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,910
is how the Princess got away.

132
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,005
I did it to save my family and my father.

133
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,415
I think highly of your honesty.

134
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:52,446
But do not think you will get off easily...

135
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,185
when you deceived me.

136
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,986
You will have no use for my worthless life.

137
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:02,356
What is it that you want me to do?

138
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:17,675
Why are you here at this hour?

139
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:21,116
Well...

140
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:25,486
Did he question you for helping me?

141
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,116
No.

142
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,430
He said he has been feeling weak and asked if I have any good herbs.

143
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,356
Quit with the nonsense.

144
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,155
It is the truth, General.

145
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,066
Even if you are threatened for what you did,

146
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,866
do not get involved in something dangerous.

147
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,135
Something dangerous?

148
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:48,535
Everything related to the Princess.

149
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,751
While brewing medicine for Gochuga,

150
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,785
shall I brew some for you as well?

151
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,135
Oh, dear. My gosh...

152
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,876
What do you want?

153
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,505
Blame Ga Jin for this.

154
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,275
She is the reason Cheonjubang scattered.

155
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,586
Our chief fled too.

156
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,255
Take him.

157
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,185
Hey.

158
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,596
What are you doing, you jerks?

159
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:46,265
Let him go. Let go of him!

160
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:48,366
Mister. Get out of the way.

161
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,126
Let us go.

162
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,435
Nice.

163
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,505
Say hello. This is Ga Jin's father.

164
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,800
I was told the Sunno Tribe was plotting treason,

165
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,761
so I sent soldiers over to quell the rebellion.

166
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:53,295
I had to save you and your mother.

167
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,240
The Sunno Tribe also suffered for no reason.

168
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:58,505
They were framed for treason.

169
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:00,135
The Queen...

170
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,675
remained with the Sunno Tribe until the end.

171
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,576
Master Go.

172
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,685
Go Geon greets you, Your Highness.

173
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,956
When too much is on your mind, you must be active.

174
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,555
I needed an opponent. I am glad you are here.

Next time, you must find a different opponent.

177
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,466
I am all alone in Pyeongyang Castle.

178
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,576
Father and the Prince find me uncomfortable.

179
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,106
I am pleased.

180
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,645
Now you are back.

181
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:17,746
I owe you a lot.

182
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,645
I will not forget it.

183
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,086
Right.

184
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,826
Have you heard of the Jangbaek herb store?

185
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
Every herb that enters the palace...

186
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,805
goes through that woman.

187
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,076
And my father is not the kind of person...

188
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,346
to call her over just to discuss herbs.

189
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:04,126
I heard you supply...

190
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:06,566
the Crown Prince's herbs.

191
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,395
Since you are good with medicinal herbs,

192
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,466
you must know well of poisons too.

193
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:46,971
Add this to the Crown Prince's morning medicine tomorrow.

194
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,076
Okay.

195
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,276
Dal.

196
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:12,616
Did you come for me?

197
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,245
Were there not some extra herbs they sent to put in?

198
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,876
You foolish girl. Such a scatterbrain.

199
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:20,145
Add this to the Crown Prince's morning medicine tomorrow.

200
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,356
The Crown Prince...

201
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,135
Stop!

202
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:43,876
Who are you?

203
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,245
Stop!

204
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:56,786
Won.

205
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,925
Your medicine will get cold.

206
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,155
Your Highness.

207
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,995
What is the use of drinking this day and night?

208
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,610
It only makes my mouth stuffy, but my body still remains weak.

209
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,036
You will soon become healthier.

210
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,245
Here. Drink up.

211
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,286
How is my sister doing?

212
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,626
You should go to Magnolia Hall to visit her.

213
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,856
She will be glad to see you.

214
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,495
No, I do not have anything to say to her anyway.

215
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:43,096
Drink up.

216
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,715
Won! No!

217
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,256
Do not drink that.

218
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,995
You did not drink a single drop, right?

219
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,066
Princess Pyeonggang, what is the matter?

220
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,366
The medicine is poisoned.

221
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,820
Why were we summoned to the palace all of a sudden?

222
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,346
I feel so perplexed.

223
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:39,330
Do you think it is because of what we sent to Northern Zhou?

224
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,756
Do not say that out loud.

225
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:46,366
Do you know what this is about?

226
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:49,366
The Crown Prince was in danger.

227
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,266
The Crown Prince?

228
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,885
What is this?

229
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,756
There was poison mixed into the medicine...

230
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,900
that the Crown Prince regularly drinks.

231
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,225
What?

232
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:22,336
"Poison"?

233
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,271
Are you sure?

234
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,506
I tasted it myself.

235
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,606
It was fatal enough to keep me paralyzed all night.

236
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,215
And this morning, the Crown Prince almost drank this.

237
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,955
An attempt to poison the Crown Prince...

238
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,991
is a severe act of treason.

239
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,661
But if you are framing someone...

240
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:49,201
by making a wild assumption,

241
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:52,300
that will also not be taken lightly.

242
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,036
I am not making an assumption. I can tell you...

243
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:58,905
that the person behind this is in this room.

244
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,781
Watch what you say, Princess.

245
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:07,306
They are all loyal servants of Goguryeo.

246
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:15,385
Sometimes, you find rice hulls among grains of rice.

247
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:19,826
If the perpetrator confesses,

248
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,596
we will be able to find out who was behind this incident.

249
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,596
Bring her in.

250
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:41,580
Your Majesty, she is my daughter.

251
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,816
Hae Mo Yong, you are the owner of the Jangbaek herb store.

252
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:47,221
Do you bring in the medicine for the Crown Prince?

253
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,761
Yes.

254
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:52,655
Yesterday, you sent a different bag of medicine...

255
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:54,826
on top of what you normally use.

256
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:58,796
What was it made of?

257
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,036
Mo Yong.

258
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,705
You put poison inside the Crown Prince's medicine.

259
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:12,076
I tasted that medicine myself.

260
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,346
Who gave you orders to do that?

261
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:22,915
I am sure that person is in this room.

262
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,856
Tell us the truth.

263
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:29,130
I never added any kind of poison, so there is nothing to tell.

264
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,225
If you are innocent,

265
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,766
drink this medicine.

266
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,735
If you are still alive even after you drink it,

267
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,935
I will believe you.

268
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,745
Mo Yong.

269
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,526
Stop.

270
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:05,995
I see you are trying to kill yourself...

271
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,995
because you are scared to tell who was behind this.

272
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:13,606
Mo Yong!

273
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:35,155
This medicine was not made to kill anyone.

274
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,566
Your Majesty.

275
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,870
Did you find out the components of the medicine?

276
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,965
Yes.

277
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:51,235
Based on the investigation carried out by the physicians,

278
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,006
Goldcrest Wilma was added to the original ingredients.

279
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,415
Goldcrest Wilma cleans your blood.

280
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,316
That cannot be true.

281
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:06,526
I am sure it was poisoned.

282
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,905
You will have no use for my worthless life.

283
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,606
What is it that you want me to do?

284
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,846
I heard you supply...

285
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,016
the Crown Prince's herbs.

286
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,346
Since you are good with medicinal herbs,

287
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,616
you must know well of poisons too.

288
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:41,326
How do you plan to get away with poisoning the Crown Prince?

289
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,856
He is not our target.

290
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,395
Geon will be back soon,

291
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,895
and I want you to pretend like you ran into him by coincidence.

292
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,566
Why are you here at this hour?

293
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,475
He said he has been feeling weak and asked if I have any good herbs.

294
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,745
Have you heard of the Jangbaek herb store?

295
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:04,981
Then he will tell the Princess...

296
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,145
that I met you.

297
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,576
Move.

298
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,846
No one is allowed inside.

299
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,266
What kind of trick did you play this time?

300
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:00,066
You upset me.

301
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:02,911
All I did was make medicine for the Crown Prince.

302
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:05,576
- I did not play any tricks. - I know that you and my father...

303
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,116
plotted to put the Princess...

304
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,021
in trouble.

305
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:12,316
I see.

306
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,856
I finally see what caused the Princess to get the wrong idea.

307
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,830
If you were going to give her a heads up,

308
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,256
you should have been more clear.

309
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,495
The Princes is in trouble.

310
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,465
She brought chaos to the palace.

311
00:29:43,472 --> 00:29:45,311
How could you doubt your loyal servants...

312
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:47,377
just because of some nonsense?

313
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:49,465
A princess...

314
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:53,860
should always be careful of her speech and behavior.

315
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:57,036
You were too careless this time around.

316
00:29:57,036 --> 00:30:00,201
My daughter may still be young and insufficient,

317
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:02,905
but her loyalty to the royal family and her country...

318
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:05,216
is as great as mine.

319
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:10,846
I cannot express how sad and upset I am, Your Majesty.

320
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:13,681
- Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.

321
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,581
Calm down, everyone.

322
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:21,126
The Princess...

323
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:23,920
surely has been through a lot outside the palace.

324
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:29,331
It is not a surprise that she is not used to the customs of the palace...

325
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,200
and the proper behaviors of a royal family member.

326
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:36,840
If you admit that her behavior was not very adequate,

327
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:40,270
we are willing to put this behind us.

328
00:30:43,315 --> 00:30:44,441
Princess.

329
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:48,251
Apologize to them.

330
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:52,320
You must admit to your faults.

331
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:54,691
I did nothing wrong.

332
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:55,790
What?

333
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:00,891
I only did what I could to save the Crown Prince.

334
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,300
I do not think...

335
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,776
I need to apologize for that.

336
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:06,871
Silence.

337
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:11,246
Starting from today, you will not be allowed to exit Magnolia Hall.

338
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,710
- Father. - You will be punished there...

339
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:16,010
until you are told otherwise.

340
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:35,948
This is outrageous. She has no respect.

341
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:38,247
- My goodness. - Goodness gracious.

342
00:32:00,743 --> 00:32:03,078
This is all my fault. I should not have said...

343
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:06,083
what I was not sure of.

344
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,178
Either that,

345
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:10,447
or you schemed this with your father...

346
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:12,418
to fool me.

347
00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:14,787
- Princess. - I do not care...

348
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:17,058
whether you fooled me...

349
00:32:18,463 --> 00:32:19,727
or got used yourself.

350
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:23,858
What I know for sure is that no one in this palace...

351
00:32:24,263 --> 00:32:26,497
cares for my father or the Crown Prince.

352
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:28,197
I will...

353
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:31,967
stand on your side.

354
00:32:34,643 --> 00:32:36,407
You? The son of the Gyeru Tribe?

355
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:46,418
He is the most powerful man in this country.

356
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:50,388
But at the same time, he is the weakest and loneliest.

357
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:54,157
I will protect him.

358
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:57,428
I must protect him.

359
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:30,521
Nanny, this necklace...

360
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:33,521
A long time ago, the King sent this here.

361
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,462
So we can keep it safe here at Magnolia Hall.

362
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:41,361
Gosh. It is like he knew that you would be coming back.

363
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:52,041
Who was it?

364
00:33:52,687 --> 00:33:53,782
Pardon?

365
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:56,381
The only person that could protect me...

366
00:33:57,357 --> 00:33:59,751
is in the mountains, very far away from the palace.

367
00:34:02,656 --> 00:34:03,751
Then,

368
00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:07,291
who was that from last night?

369
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:20,671
I am sure you mobilized an assassin.

370
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:23,593
It may be dangerous inside the palace.

371
00:34:25,368 --> 00:34:27,463
But the Princess would be alone outside the palace.

372
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,469
On top of that, she was helpless being intoxicated.

373
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:33,103
It was the perfect chance for you to secretly get rid of her.

374
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:35,043
And even if you fail,

375
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:37,543
you can argue that she wrongfully caused trouble...

376
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:40,014
and diminish her reputation.

377
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:42,213
Am I wrong?

378
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,983
Your insight is...

379
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:48,754
too good to waste at Pyeongyang Castle.

380
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,653
I heard the Gokturk twins were spotted at Gyeru Fortress.

381
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:55,793
Go and take care of them.

382
00:34:57,998 --> 00:34:59,093
Are you...

383
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,008
kicking me out to a remote area in the north?

384
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:06,004
If you accomplish greatness there, it will help our family.

385
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,279
Leave in a few days.

386
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,674
I will not go.

387
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:13,973
Withdraw your unjust order.

388
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:31,533
If you go against my order,

389
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,364
I will disown you.

390
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:39,409
Do you wish to become a lowlife instead of being the eldest son...

391
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:41,074
of Gyeru Tribe's Chief?

392
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:08,804
Is that what Gochuga told you to do?

393
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:14,874
I am talking about the herbal medicine meant for the Crown Prince.

394
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:19,014
So you lent a hand in tricking the Princess...

395
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,343
and putting her in danger, correct?

396
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:24,483
No.

397
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:27,754
I only provided medicine for the Crown Prince.

398
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:32,353
Politics is...

399
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,564
no more than an economic means for our prosperity.

400
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:37,899
I do not care if the palace is in chaos.

401
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:41,233
I will be happy as long as we are left with gold in our hands.

402
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,864
Do not get involved more than that.

403
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:46,704
Of course.

404
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,748
Oh, right. A guest...

405
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:54,983
gave us a message that their expected arrival is tomorrow.

406
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,684
It is an important and discreet guest.

407
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:03,653
Be careful, so the news does not leak.

408
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,824
I will prepare thoroughly.

409
00:37:38,012 --> 00:37:40,248
Thank you for making this long trip.

410
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:46,457
Please.

411
00:37:59,002 --> 00:38:00,337
This way.

412
00:38:08,812 --> 00:38:10,247
Make sure there are no mistakes.

413
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:11,578
Of course.

414
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:32,867
My Crown Prince.

415
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:36,607
I can come another time if I am intruding.

416
00:38:37,112 --> 00:38:39,877
You are my brother. How could you be intruding?

417
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,308
My visit will be brief.

418
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:44,747
I remembered this from my childhood.

419
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:47,617
When I whined to have more of this,

420
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:50,318
you always let me have it.

421
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:53,857
You brought me sweets.

422
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:00,158
I came here to thank you.

423
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:03,967
You believed that my medicine was poisoned.

424
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:07,068
You must have been flustered.

425
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:11,737
Even so, I am still grateful.

426
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:16,877
All right, then.

427
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:19,847
This is too much for just me.

428
00:39:20,782 --> 00:39:22,288
Would you like to have some too?

429
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:25,518
May I?

430
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:29,028
"May I?"

431
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,798
Be casual with me like you used to.

432
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:35,497
It is making me uncomfortable.

433
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,928
But...

434
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,237
Can...

435
00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:41,568
I?

436
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:44,768
Sweets will not taste good when they get soft.

437
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:51,847
After Mother's funeral,

438
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,018
Father became someone else.

439
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:57,617
He was enraged.

440
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:00,357
And at one point, he started to weep.

441
00:40:00,593 --> 00:40:02,428
He neglected the state of affairs.

442
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,698
And there were many days when he did not leave his chamber.

443
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:13,367
This must have been very difficult for you.

444
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:14,967
I...

445
00:40:16,573 --> 00:40:18,337
I am okay.

446
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,308
I am sorry.

447
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:24,308
I should have returned to the palace as soon as I could.

448
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:27,347
I am sorry.

449
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:31,318
Pyeonggang.

450
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:35,587
That woman must pay for what she did.

451
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:37,457
Who?

452
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:39,328
The woman from the Jangbaek herb store.

453
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:43,367
She is providing Father with awful drugs.

454
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:45,967
Everyone at the palace will not openly discuss it.

455
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:48,568
But I hear things too.

456
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:53,877
People say that her drugs are nibbling at Father's body and soul.

457
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:57,578
"Awful drugs"?

458
00:40:58,252 --> 00:41:00,048
She secretly brings it in from Silla.

459
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:04,518
That is a serious violation of the law, right?

460
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:08,957
Won.

461
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:12,627
Keep what you told me to yourself.

462
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,857
Why?

463
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:20,597
What if you also get punished just like me?

464
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,408
That does not scare me.

465
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:25,778
Those Five Tribes are plotting schemes behind our backs.

466
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,747
I find that disloyal.

467
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:34,318
You have grown up a lot while I was away.

468
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:44,828
Cheers to our business.

469
00:41:52,372 --> 00:41:54,443
Now, everything has been resolved.

470
00:41:54,443 --> 00:41:57,772
Mo Yong, do not just stand there. Pour him a drink.

471
00:41:57,772 --> 00:41:58,877
Yes, Father.

472
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:00,178
Here.

473
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:04,747
Gosh.

474
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:17,328
The drinks...

475
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:29,107
What a greedy man.

476
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:34,137
He must have been happy to finalize a big deal.

477
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,548
Being a daughter of such a man...

478
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:39,747
must be tough.

479
00:42:42,723 --> 00:42:44,953
You are welcome to stay overnight.

480
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:46,492
We must walk and set sail.

481
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:48,217
I do not have time to waste.

482
00:42:48,862 --> 00:42:50,387
Before I get exposed,

483
00:42:50,662 --> 00:42:52,558
I must go back to Silla.

484
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:59,742
I wrote down a list of generals, the number of soldiers,

485
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:01,237
and the weapons they carry...

486
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:03,137
on the border.

487
00:43:03,642 --> 00:43:05,073
I checked several times.

488
00:43:05,073 --> 00:43:06,707
I am certain it will match.

489
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:09,953
My King has recognized your contribution to our empire.

490
00:43:09,953 --> 00:43:11,053
(Kim Cha Seung: In charge of military forces in Silla)

491
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:12,823
When you come back to your hometown,

492
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,678
you will be graciously rewarded.

493
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,957
I am only doing my duty as a woman of Silla.

494
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:23,757
Hurry back before the morning breaks.

495
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:41,778
(16 years ago, outskirts of Bisabeol, Silla)

496
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,068
I plan to use you for something important.

497
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,467
Are you prepared?

498
00:45:20,183 --> 00:45:22,408
You saved me from certain death.

499
00:45:23,713 --> 00:45:26,117
I will jump into a fire for you.

500
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,788
Go to Goguryeo.

501
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:39,627
Let me see...

502
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:00,578
What is important...

503
00:46:00,882 --> 00:46:03,823
is that riches is the only thing that is forever!

504
00:46:03,823 --> 00:46:06,558
- Yes, that is true. - You are right.

505
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,288
- Oh, dear. My lord. - My lord.

506
00:46:09,593 --> 00:46:12,303
- My lord. - Oh, dear.

507
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:13,303
Oh, no.

508
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:16,528
- What happened? - My lord.

509
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:32,529
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] KBS E14 'River Where the Moon Rises'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

510
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:46,958
- We must have another drink. - My lord.

511
00:46:51,173 --> 00:46:54,867
What is it you want? Speak.

512
00:46:55,443 --> 00:46:57,637
Do you want silver,

513
00:46:58,413 --> 00:47:00,308
or do you want land?

514
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,847
I am an orphan with nowhere to go,

515
00:47:02,983 --> 00:47:05,748
but I know herbs and acupuncture and am quick with math.

516
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:10,847
I wish to work for you, my lord.

517
00:47:13,322 --> 00:47:15,828
May I serve you like a father?

518
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:21,228
Stand.

519
00:47:48,892 --> 00:47:50,457
Princess.

520
00:47:51,392 --> 00:47:53,527
Do not go, Princess.

521
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:57,233
- Nanny. - The King told you to behave.

522
00:47:57,233 --> 00:48:00,267
If you disobey him again and get into trouble,

523
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:03,338
then his subjects will truly revolt.

524
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:08,342
His subjects? The men who think nothing of the royals?

525
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:09,753
Princess.

526
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,808
Nothing you say will stop me.

527
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:15,277
This is for Father.

528
00:48:40,612 --> 00:48:42,138
Are you surprised?

529
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:47,178
When you were here as an assassin,

530
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:49,418
I followed you,

531
00:48:50,223 --> 00:48:52,323
and barely found this passageway.

532
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:53,793
Do not get in my way, Master Go.

533
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:56,558
- I am here to help you. - I do not need your help.

534
00:48:58,692 --> 00:49:00,727
I have a loud voice.

535
00:49:02,263 --> 00:49:05,273
I can shout from here and wake the sleepy guards...

536
00:49:05,273 --> 00:49:06,602
at the North Gate at once.

537
00:49:06,602 --> 00:49:08,773
I have no time to joke with you.

538
00:49:08,773 --> 00:49:11,838
I did not wait here just to exchange jokes with you.

539
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,037
In a few days,

540
00:49:15,783 --> 00:49:17,947
I must head to a northern fortress.

541
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:21,717
I cannot disobey my father's command.

542
00:49:23,023 --> 00:49:26,217
So I came here to keep my promise.

543
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,017
I will be on your side.

544
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:35,098
What can I do to help you?

545
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,533
I am aware that Hae Mo Yong...

546
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:08,227
is illegally smuggling herbs into the country.

547
00:50:09,432 --> 00:50:12,033
Here, she has hidden hundreds of kilos of herbs.

548
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:14,568
You know she is smuggling it in from Silla.

549
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:18,308
Her drugs are ruining the King.

550
00:50:18,773 --> 00:50:20,578
Why did you let it happen?

551
00:50:23,013 --> 00:50:26,747
Because I also made a deal with her.

552
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,477
What deal?

553
00:50:30,122 --> 00:50:31,487
Come with me.

554
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:48,142
Not long ago, I saw she had herbs here.

555
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:50,168
She moved them already.

556
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:04,017
What is it?

557
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,027
Step back.

558
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:48,757
Do not be afraid.

559
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:54,638
Princess.

560
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,437
Change clothes with me.

561
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:00,713
What are you thinking?

562
00:52:00,713 --> 00:52:04,648
I need to know why these children are here.

563
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:16,027
What is the Princess up to?

564
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,757
She does not leave Magnolia Hall.

565
00:52:19,263 --> 00:52:21,257
She just reads.

566
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:23,967
She only pretends to read.

567
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:26,497
If you notice anything suspicious,

568
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,197
alert me immediately.

569
00:52:33,213 --> 00:52:34,737
Princess.

570
00:52:35,842 --> 00:52:38,047
You must stay safe.

571
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:52,257
Come!

572
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:54,898
- Get up. - Get up.

573
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,497
- Get up. - Get up.

574
00:52:58,902 --> 00:53:00,297
Take them.

575
00:53:08,513 --> 00:53:09,648
Get up.

576
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:11,908
Come on.

577
00:53:27,132 --> 00:53:28,898
- Let us go. - Walk.

578
00:53:31,102 --> 00:53:32,328
Move it.

579
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:39,207
Walk.

580
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,388
Who are they?

581
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:53,757
Where are they going?

582
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:55,658
I do not know.

583
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:59,162
We only know that we are going to Northern Zhou.

584
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:00,457
What?

585
00:54:01,063 --> 00:54:02,973
They are the tribute to Northern Zhou?

586
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,197
Yes.

587
00:54:07,003 --> 00:54:10,543
The grain and tributary gifts were sent off a few days ago.

588
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:11,838
But...

589
00:54:12,813 --> 00:54:15,237
we were brought here before that.

590
00:54:39,973 --> 00:54:43,513
There is nothing over here. What about there?

591
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,408
Nothing but moss.

592
00:54:45,743 --> 00:54:47,313
That is odd.

593
00:54:47,313 --> 00:54:50,947
We always leave a wooden pass beneath these rocks.

594
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:53,047
They abandoned you.

595
00:54:53,922 --> 00:54:55,848
The other killers will have gathered.

596
00:54:56,023 --> 00:54:57,517
All but you.

597
00:54:58,192 --> 00:54:59,348
It is obvious.

598
00:54:59,493 --> 00:55:00,918
What did you just say?

599
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,388
Step aside.

600
00:55:08,362 --> 00:55:10,027
Quick, look underneath.

601
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:12,172
- Hang on. - You... Darn you.

602
00:55:12,172 --> 00:55:13,442
- Lift it a bit higher. - Quick.

603
00:55:13,442 --> 00:55:14,473
I found it.

604
00:55:14,473 --> 00:55:15,568
Step back.

605
00:55:22,543 --> 00:55:23,977
Where do you go?

606
00:55:25,553 --> 00:55:30,187
"Song", "hwa", "dang". Songhwadang.

607
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,148
Where is Songhwadang?

608
00:55:32,692 --> 00:55:34,558
I do not know if you do not.

609
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:37,257
I have never heard of that place.

610
00:55:41,063 --> 00:55:42,898
I have geotjeori.

611
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,848
(Songhwadang)

612
00:56:12,263 --> 00:56:14,398
I have men all over the city.

613
00:56:14,602 --> 00:56:17,398
They will spread word of a talented fortune-teller,

614
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:19,273
so people will flock in soon.

615
00:56:19,273 --> 00:56:23,037
The darkest place in the world is right beneath the lamp.

616
00:56:23,543 --> 00:56:28,308
Now, instead of a 180cm sword, I will use my tongue...

617
00:56:30,713 --> 00:56:33,918
to penetrate the King's heart.

618
00:56:34,723 --> 00:56:36,717
Have you come up with an idea of how to enter the palace?

619
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:54,068
Has the Princess woken up?

620
00:56:55,473 --> 00:56:59,068
She has not yet. It looks like she has caught a cold.

621
00:56:59,513 --> 00:57:00,777
What about the doctor?

622
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:02,483
Pardon?

623
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:05,078
You should have called the doctor for the Princess.

624
00:57:06,352 --> 00:57:10,888
Yes, you are right. I was about to call the doctor.

625
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:15,388
She must be sick because she is under heavy stress.

626
00:57:16,092 --> 00:57:17,888
I need to check how she is doing.

627
00:57:18,132 --> 00:57:22,297
But she is still in bed.

628
00:57:22,362 --> 00:57:23,628
Step back.

629
00:57:38,352 --> 00:57:42,418
You said she was sick with a cold. Where is the Princess?

630
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:45,747
I asked where the Princess is.

631
00:57:47,162 --> 00:57:48,588
Since last night...

632
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:51,388
I have not seen her.

633
00:57:51,662 --> 00:57:52,858
What?

634
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,547
Hey, you! Get up!

635
00:58:12,813 --> 00:58:15,652
We walked all night without even a sip of water.

636
00:58:15,652 --> 00:58:18,017
- How dare you? - Take a short break.

637
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:21,687
We are quite far from the Capital.

638
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,828
It will be okay to rest.

639
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,588
Yes, my lord.

640
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:28,558
- Rest! - Take a rest.

641
00:58:34,672 --> 00:58:36,237
Thank you.

642
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,277
As if the offerings are not enough, they are sending women too?

643
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:43,578
If we are not going to Northern Zhou,

644
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:45,848
what will happen to us?

645
00:58:48,952 --> 00:58:51,747
Their clothes and accent are that of Silla.

646
00:58:52,253 --> 00:58:53,717
Silla?

647
00:58:53,723 --> 00:58:55,358
We were sold off.

648
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,932
We should be going to Northern Zhou,

649
00:58:57,932 --> 00:58:59,858
but they hid us to sell us to Silla.

650
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:01,928
The great people from high up.

651
00:59:04,733 --> 00:59:06,027
Do not worry.

652
00:59:06,102 --> 00:59:08,803
The King's soldiers will come before we reach Silla.

653
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:10,472
I am from the government.

654
00:59:10,473 --> 00:59:11,707
Are you?

655
00:59:12,412 --> 00:59:14,507
What did our country ever do for us?

656
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:17,753
It is the same for us, whether we go to Northern Zhou or Silla.

657
00:59:17,753 --> 00:59:21,983
We will serve some rich lady or marry some old man.

658
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,217
No.

659
00:59:24,723 --> 00:59:28,517
All of you will get to go home. I promise.

660
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:34,058
There is a knife in my back pocket.

661
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:37,428
Get it for me.

662
00:59:42,172 --> 00:59:44,767
Will the King's men really come?

663
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:46,267
Goguryeo...

664
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,078
would not let their people be sold to another nation.

665
00:59:50,612 --> 00:59:53,977
Protecting them is the empire's duty.

666
00:59:57,452 --> 00:59:59,047
We should go now.

667
00:59:59,253 --> 01:00:03,358
- Get up now. Get up! - Stand up!

668
01:00:03,592 --> 01:00:04,928
Get up.

669
01:00:05,632 --> 01:00:08,102
What? The Princess has disappeared?

670
01:00:08,102 --> 01:00:10,098
It is such an embarrassment.

671
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:13,168
She always got up to something since her return.

672
01:00:14,803 --> 01:00:16,937
She even disobeyed my order to behave.

673
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:19,013
Where on earth did she go?

674
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:21,207
She will be somewhere in the palace.

675
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:23,283
Do not worry too much.

676
01:00:23,283 --> 01:00:25,178
We searched for her already.

677
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:28,977
She is not in the palace.

678
01:00:32,053 --> 01:00:33,987
How dare she?

679
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:35,187
Father.

680
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:36,957
Actually...

681
01:00:36,963 --> 01:00:40,027
I went to Magnolia Hall yesterday.

682
01:00:43,902 --> 01:00:47,172
Your Majesty. General Go wishes to see you.

683
01:00:47,172 --> 01:00:48,773
Tell him to come back later.

684
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:50,037
And?

685
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:51,808
General.

686
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:57,652
I was waiting to see you since early morning.

687
01:00:57,652 --> 01:00:59,408
I told you to come back later.

688
01:01:04,352 --> 01:01:06,187
It involves the Princess' safety.

689
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,668
Keep going.

690
01:01:26,342 --> 01:01:29,078
Hey. Stop there.

691
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:37,848
Whose is it?

692
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:40,223
- Is it yours? - No.

693
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,017
It is at your feet!

694
01:01:42,092 --> 01:01:44,658
No. It is hers, not mine.

695
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:10,088
(River Where the Moon Rises)

696
01:02:10,253 --> 01:02:13,717
The Princess hid herself among the women sold off as tributes?

697
01:02:13,993 --> 01:02:16,223
No matter how much power or wealth one may have,

698
01:02:16,223 --> 01:02:19,358
anyone who violates the law will be held responsible.

699
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:22,358
It is the principle King Pyeongwon follows as he rules the country.

700
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:23,973
Say hello.

701
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:28,338
It is the arrow that shot your girl eight years ago.

702
01:02:30,573 --> 01:02:32,543
You two make a good couple.

703
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:34,182
I will marry you.

704
01:02:34,182 --> 01:02:35,412
Royal marriage?

705
01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:38,308
I will never join the Gyeru Tribe.

706
01:02:38,783 --> 01:02:40,882
Is the daughter trying to follow...

707
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,922
the path where her mother fell?

708
01:02:42,922 --> 01:02:46,658
I will never give up on you.

709
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:48,517
She will eventually become mine.

710
01:02:51,632 --> 01:02:53,862
If you cannot win, you should run away.

711
01:02:53,862 --> 01:02:57,497
If I had planned to run, I would never have returned to the palace.
