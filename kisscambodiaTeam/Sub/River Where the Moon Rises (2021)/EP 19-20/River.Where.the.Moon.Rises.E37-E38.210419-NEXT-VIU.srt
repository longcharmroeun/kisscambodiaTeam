1
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:06,361
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:08,317
(Characters, incidents, and dates do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,531
Starting with Silla, I will behead Go Geon...

4
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,626
and then unify the three nations!

5
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,367
The man just right for the job...

6
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:20,837
is your husband, General On.

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,436
Go to him and persuade him.

8
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,637
Whichever mountain you hide yourself in,

9
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:28,837
I am going to find you.

10
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:30,407
You will fail...

11
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,351
because I will make sure no one finds me.

12
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:34,877
An envoy came from Silla, and he is...

13
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:37,051
An envoy from Silla?

14
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,387
Are you not the traitor Go Geon?

15
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,756
Are you here to die in your own land?

16
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,932
(Episode 19)

17
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:48,597
I came to see you, Your Highness.

18
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:52,326
I thought it would be more meaningful...

19
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,766
to see you one last time...

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,766
than to live a meaningless life in Silla.

21
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,877
Your plan will never go your way...

22
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:04,777
as the King...

23
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,716
plans to send back the envoys.

24
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:11,947
I want to ask you one more thing.

25
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:14,257
That night...

26
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:19,497
Was it your sword?

27
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,867
That stabbed my father?

28
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:38,206
That is right.

29
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:42,587
Just like how your father...

30
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:45,986
shot an arrow at my mother.

31
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:54,956
It should end with that night.

32
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:59,197
The resentment and ill fates should end with us.

33
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:01,197
Princess, the ill fates...

34
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:04,307
could have ended long ago.

35
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,137
If the two families came together through a royal wedding,

36
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:12,076
you and I would have changed this empire.

37
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:13,276
Not at all.

38
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:16,546
It would have become the world...

39
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:19,287
of the Gyeru Tribe that Gochuga dreamed of.

40
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,887
Go back to Silla.

41
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:24,956
And forget all of your memories from here.

42
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,456
There is a woman who only loves you.

43
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,996
I am here to die. I want to die...

44
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:36,107
to end our ill fate.

45
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,206
Please stop.

46
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:40,740
Leave.

47
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:42,137
I will not.

48
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:44,676
- What? - Because...

49
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,746
I followed you to save you.

50
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,347
Return safely, Master Go.

51
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,956
I will not see you out.

52
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,306
You asked to see me at such a late hour.

53
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:16,046
What is this?

54
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,676
As the leader of the Five Tribe council,

55
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,016
I came here...

56
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:24,486
to tell you that Go Geon must not be allowed to live.

57
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,717
What is this arrow for?

58
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:35,056
When I went to confiscate Gyeru Tribe's assets,

59
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,866
I happened to find it.

60
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,667
Go Won Pyo's servant...

61
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,576
told me the story behind this arrow.

62
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:53,021
This is the arrow that was used to kill...

63
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,847
Queen Yeon, your mother.

64
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,917
It is that very arrow.

65
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,717
Go Won Pyo.

66
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:05,127
He seems to have kept it like a trophy.

67
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:10,526
Will you still let that man's son live?

68
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,986
Oh my, Princess.

69
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,926
Gwanno Tribe's Lord Jin went to see the King.

70
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:45,271
What for? At this late hour?

71
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:46,897
I do not know that,

72
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:50,566
but the King just summoned his bodyguards.

73
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:59,681
Master Go, you must get away.

74
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:00,777
Why?

75
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,951
Did the King decide to kill me?

76
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,546
Yes, he will.

77
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,517
So you must get away.

78
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:11,056
If I act as kindling.

79
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:14,357
Goguryeo will go down in flames.

80
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,132
I came here expecting that.

81
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:19,401
Bring your own men and fight.

82
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,502
Do not die a pointless death.

83
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:23,866
If you want to avenge your father, do so properly.

84
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:26,736
If you return as a commander,

85
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,707
then I will take you on.

86
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:35,577
We are going to the library.

87
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:38,252
We must find some diplomatic papers.

88
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:39,791
The envoys cannot leave.

89
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,287
Are you stopping me because you do not know who I am?

90
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:44,426
If you do not believe me,

91
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,986
come with us.

92
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:08,647
Follow me.

93
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:26,537
The envoys disappeared!

94
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:27,796
Search thoroughly!

95
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,267
Find them!

96
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:40,077
This could put the Princess in danger.

97
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:44,116
Would you rather turn back now?

98
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:47,186
No.

99
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,287
She bruised my ego.

100
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,857
I must return the favor.

101
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:56,296
What did you two talk about?

102
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:57,866
Or was it...

103
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,496
a sweet conversation that you had wanted?

104
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,006
The main roads will be searched.

105
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,277
Horses will do us no good.

106
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:11,777
We will have to walk to the border. Can you manage?

107
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:14,847
We will not be safe even in Silla.

108
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:18,546
The established authority...

109
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:20,657
will not look upon us with favor.

110
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:22,417
We must get out of here first.

111
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,327
Where is Go Geon?

112
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,897
I asked you where he is.

113
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:38,936
I helped him escape.

114
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:40,407
What?

115
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:43,876
He will have left the palace by now...

116
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,876
and hid himself.

117
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:03,796
Send soldiers to go after him!

118
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:07,236
Also, arrest the Princess.

119
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:08,696
Your Majesty.

120
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,467
You heard me.

121
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:13,277
Arrest her and throw her in prison!

122
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:14,837
- Yes, sire. - Yes, sire.

123
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,176
Let me go.

124
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:19,917
I will go myself.

125
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:34,626
Your Majesty.

126
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,671
Your Majesty! Please calm down.

127
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:38,996
Shut your mouth!

128
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,207
Walk!

129
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:51,707
Get down!

130
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:53,717
Let go!

131
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,587
You must hold back.

132
00:08:58,352 --> 00:08:59,687
You fools!

133
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:04,187
Do you know who you have tied up?

134
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:07,602
We were ordered to bring in everyone from the Sunno Tribe.

135
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,472
What? That is just nonsense!

136
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:11,801
Release them.

137
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,896
Lord Yeon.

138
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,901
This is nonsense.

139
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,541
Treason?

140
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,006
Our tribe has been through this before.

141
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:22,536
We will not repeat it.

142
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:26,051
So tell your men to stand down.

143
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:27,622
But the Princess and Lord Sa...

144
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:29,616
If we cause a fuss here,

145
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:32,386
it will only put the Princess at risk.

146
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:44,626
Did you catch Go Geon?

147
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:48,036
We cannot trace him.

148
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,177
You failed to get him?

149
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:59,207
That news just ruined my appetite.

150
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:01,616
Your Majesty.

151
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:09,286
Do you truly believe the Princess plotted treason?

152
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:12,486
Is that why you ordered the Sunno Tribe to be brought in?

153
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:17,067
You have served since my father's reign, so you must know.

154
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:18,526
My sister...

155
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,536
had never hidden her ambition to become the ruler.

156
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:24,136
That is not true.

157
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,512
She only did what she could for the royal family...

158
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,177
I do not care what she thinks.

159
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:32,146
As King, I decide whether she is a traitor or not.

160
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:36,246
She helped Go Geon escape and that made things clear.

161
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:39,447
Your father also made the same mistake.

162
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:43,857
He chose to doubt rather than to believe.

163
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:48,996
I beg you to not repeat that tragedy.

164
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,227
That hangs on the Princess' decision.

165
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:55,141
- Get in there! - Move it.

166
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,771
- Lord Sa! - Move!

167
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:57,866
Stop!

168
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:01,437
I apologize.

169
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:05,252
I lacked judgment and got you in trouble.

170
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,016
Why are you here as well?

171
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:09,916
General Sa. Jin.

172
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:11,187
Princess.

173
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,156
Since you first came to Ghost Valley,

174
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:17,327
we became your subjects.

175
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,457
Please do not fear...

176
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:22,427
and do not falter.

177
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,972
- Move! - Walk ahead.

178
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,271
- Move along! - They say that right prevails.

179
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,571
It will all work out.

180
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:31,036
Do not worry, Ga Jin.

181
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,077
- Princess! Do not do this! - Princess.

182
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:39,882
I must see the King!

183
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:41,276
Send word!

184
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,047
Go, now!

185
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:52,427
Release the Sunno Tribe chief and the warriors.

186
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:55,396
If I do,

187
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,827
they will side with you and threaten me.

188
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:02,067
That will not happen.

189
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:03,307
Then...

190
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,876
prove your loyalty.

191
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:16,077
Silla took Adan Fortress from us during our father's reign.

192
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:18,547
I want to recover that key point.

193
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:23,457
Get General On to take it back.

194
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:25,656
I already told you.

195
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:31,567
General On will not fight again.

196
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,266
Then...

197
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,467
why did you go to see him?

198
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,707
You went to his hiding place.

199
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,882
What did you talk about?

200
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:49,847
How do you know that?

201
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:52,416
Did you ask him to fight with you?

202
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,031
To help you oust the young, lacking King,

203
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:59,057
so you could take over?

204
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:04,366
Won.

205
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:11,366
If you feel wronged,

206
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,136
show your loyalty.

207
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,097
I would rather...

208
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:39,766
you kill me.

209
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:43,607
Take my life...

210
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:47,337
as a token of my loyalty.

211
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,557
I understand.

212
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:28,977
What did I tell you?

213
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,317
She will not listen.

214
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:36,656
I am tired. Please leave.

215
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:41,597
What will you do about General On?

216
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:44,297
He may live as a hermit now,

217
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,427
but if something happens to the Princess,

218
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,437
he will come after you first.

219

220
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,116
Be careful.

221
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,557
Lord Sa. Are you all right?

222
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,427
I am fine.

223
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:18,827
I am glad this is the end of it.

224
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,571
The skies have helped us.

225
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,166
That is not true.

226
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:25,266
- Jin. - What do you mean?

227
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,212
Lord Sa. Were you not all released...

228
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,607
because the misunderstanding was explained?

229
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:34,146
The Princess took the fall.

230
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:36,952
Instead of denying it, she just...

231
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:38,321
Jin, that is enough.

232
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:39,687
Keep your mouth shut.

233
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,317
The Princess...

234
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:45,827
took the blame for something that did not happen.

235
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:47,496
What?

236
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:49,457
To avoid going against the King,

237
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:52,702
she said she would take the blame.

238
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,766
Then what will happen to her?

239
00:15:57,742 --> 00:15:59,036
Lord Sa.

240
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:03,506
The King ordered...

241
00:16:07,252 --> 00:16:09,016
she be beheaded.

242
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,957
(Seorabeol, Silla)

243
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:20,057
They insulted our name.

244
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:22,262
Our offer of alliance was refused,

245
00:16:22,262 --> 00:16:24,872
and the officers who accompanied them were imprisoned.

246
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:27,242
And yet, to save their own skin,

247
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:28,602
they fled in disgrace.

248
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:32,437
This is a grave crime and they must pay with their lives.

249
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:37,406
Is any of that untrue?

250
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:42,246
Lord Kim, you think so much of Silla's reputation,

251
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:44,187
and yet your actions do not follow your words.

252
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:47,457
What you just said does not sound honest.

253
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:49,187
What?

254
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:52,057
His actions do not follow his words?

255
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:53,927
Yes.

256
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:56,896
Lord Kim...

257
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:02,297
sent this woman as a spy...

258
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:05,271
and traveled to Goguryeo many times.

259
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:09,037
Each time, he took valuable jewels, silver,

260
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:12,777
and even Goguryeo women.

261
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:15,847
For his personal gain.

262
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,487
With the excuse of serving Silla,

263
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:20,787
did you fill your own pockets?

264
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:22,692
That is not true.

265
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:25,226
He said the riches were for the King.

266
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:27,226
As it was to benefit Silla,

267
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:30,002
I was told not to care about profits or losses.

268
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:31,531
Once a thief...

269
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:33,472
is forever a thief, Your Majesty.

270
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:36,202
I asked around myself.

271
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:38,837
I was able to confirm that...

272
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,581
whenever he visited Baekje, he took riches for his own gain.

273
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,012
Even from Baekje?

274
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:47,621
I took in you Goguryeo stragglers...

275
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:50,652
and now you are stabbing me in the back?

276
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,186
Before his nation,

277
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,487
he puts his livelihood first.

278
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,926
You must not keep him close.

279
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:01,097
Do not believe them.

280
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:02,497
This is a trap.

281
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:05,126
I am bring framed.

282
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:07,497
We will see about that.

283
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:15,012
- Drag him outside. - Yes, sire!

284
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,436
You cannot do this.

285
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,452
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

286
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:20,277
I am innocent!

287
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:26,047
Leave us.

288
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:35,626
Kim Cha Seung...

289
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:40,067
will be punished for whatever crimes he committed.

290
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,267
How will you...

291
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:46,166
pay for failing to do your duty...

292
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:48,537
as my envoy?

293
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:53,307
Give me...

294
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,747
10,000 of your men.

295
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:02,186
I will attack Goguryeo...

296
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,186
and expand Silla's territory.

297
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:12,827
How can I...

298
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,837
entrust you with 10,000 of my soldiers?

299
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,476
I saw for myself that...

300
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:28,146
Goguryeo does not have a commander to defend their land.

301
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,017
They only have paper tigers...

302
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:32,247
who are sick and old.

303
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:35,386
I heard that...

304
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,386
Princess Pyeonggang managed to fight off Baekje's attack.

305
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:43,626
King Yeongyang is jealous of his sister,

306
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,866
so he has her locked up.

307
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:49,166
Now is the right time.

308
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,166
If you give me 10,000 men,

309
00:19:52,912 --> 00:19:54,307
I will turn Goguryeo land...

310
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,646
into Silla.

311
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:04,916
How about 30,000 men?

312
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:14,557
To take Pyeongyang Castle as well,

313
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:17,997
I think you will need at least 30,000 soldiers.

314
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,337
You cannot.

315
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:22,997
If you go now,

316
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:25,406
you will not return alive.

317
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:27,476
Then on my funeral rite,

318
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:30,881
light enough incense for me.

319
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:31,881
General!

320
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:34,616
I need no signs to show me the path I must take.

321
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:36,146
I must follow it.

322
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:40,886
I do not know about the consequences.

323
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:43,357
Even if you win, General,

324
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:47,896
you will not win the Princess.

325
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:51,827
The Princess...

326
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:54,837
will soon be executed.

327
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,176
I know.

328
00:21:12,591 --> 00:21:14,757
That is why I must fight.

329
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:20,186
It is the only path left for me.

330
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,476
I wonder if this is too small to build a hut, Mother.

331
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:46,307
You scoundrels.

332
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:52,386
You must be here to rob a house when the owner is not home.

333
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,116
Where is On Dal?

334
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:55,557
On Dal?

335
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,987
Is that the name of the mutt in your yard?

336
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,061
This is my house.

337
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:01,297
It is your house?

338
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:05,567
Then reveal your identity.

339
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:09,767
How dare some petty thieves order me around?

340
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:10,866
Get him.

341
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:53,706
Wol Gwang?

342
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:01,456
Master?

343
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:15,896
Master?

344
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:18,366
Master!

345
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:25,047
Master.

346
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,847
Master.

347
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:02,716
What are you doing?

348
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:05,487
I am digging a grave.

349
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:09,186
- Whose grave? - Of course, it is for my Master.

350
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:13,926
You died!

351
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,027
Did you not die?

352
00:25:18,002 --> 00:25:20,666
This must be your grave, not mine.

353
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,406
It hurts.

354
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:37,077
Are you really alive?

355
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:39,386
You are not a ghost, are you?

356
00:25:39,992 --> 00:25:41,561
I am not a ghost,

357
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:42,817
but I do feel like a pig.

358
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,732
You definitely had no pulse,

359
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:47,131
and you were not breathing.

360
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:49,262
Once you have trained as much as I,

361
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:51,172
you can last an entire night...

362
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:53,067
as if you are dead, even though you are alive.

363
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:54,871
Is that true?

364
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:56,371
Why are you so curious...

365
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:58,136
when you are the one who left before learning all I have to teach?

366
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:00,712
I knew those assassins would only leave once they had fulfilled...

367
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:02,307
their duty to the last.

368
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:05,077
So I simply pretended to be dead for a little while.

369
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:23,926
Were those assassins really sent by the King?

370
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:26,426
To kill me?

371
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,267
Rest assured.

372
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:34,341
Now they know you do not live in this house,

373
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:36,341
and they believe they have killed the owner of the house.

374
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:37,747
They will not return.

375
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:43,577
If he has sent assassins after me,

376
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:46,347
that means something has happened to Ga Jin as well.

377
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,392
What has happened?

378
00:26:48,392 --> 00:26:49,956
You know, do you not?

379
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:54,057
Why does it matter to you?

380
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:57,357
You have become a recluse, cutting yourself off from the world.

381
00:26:58,071 --> 00:26:59,666
Please tell me, Master.

382
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:08,507
The King has imprisoned Ga Jin.

383
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:10,281
What?

384
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:12,446
He has become suspicious...

385
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:14,351
that Ga Jin is plotting treason.

386
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:16,916
That makes no sense. Why would Ga Jin do that?

387
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:20,886
Power cannot be split, even between a parent and child.

388
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:25,757
Furthermore, once a sister who is both wise and skilled...

389
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:28,327
began to receive the respect of the people,

390
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:31,327
the King must have become anxious.

391
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:33,297
So...

392
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,767
what will happen to Ga Jin?

393
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:38,267
If she cannot prove her innocence,

394
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:40,706
she will be executed.

395
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:46,507
This is absurd.

396
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:50,577
How can she prove her innocence of something she has not done?

397
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,057
Sister.

398
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:05,926
Do not choose a path that leads to death, when there is one to life.

399
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,166
General On is your sword.

400
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:13,636
As soon as we recover Adan Fortress...

401
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:17,547
both you and my brother-in-law will be able to live.

402
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:19,976
My path to life...

403
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:26,186
is to die for that person.

404
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,216
Must you be so stubborn?

405
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,257
You can save yourself if you just persuade the General.

406
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:38,696
Won.

407
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:42,366
He is someone who became my sword...

408
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,636
and waded through a river of blood.

409
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:51,206
To satisfy my ambitions,

410
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,216
he continued to wound himself.

411
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:59,087
At last, he has returned...

412
00:29:00,392 --> 00:29:02,616
to the life he desired.

413
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,027
Therefore,

414
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:09,797
I am ashamed...

415
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,896
and grateful.

416
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:15,696
Is that truly...

417
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:20,537
your dying wish?

418
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:25,706
My life...

419
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:29,347
is not under your control.

420
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,247
I have already decided...

421
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,916
to dedicate it to him.

422
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,497
That was a great meal.

423
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:48,936
Master.

424
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:51,936
You said it was Adan Fortress?

425
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:55,277
Does the King wish to have it?

426
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:57,381
Do not think foolish thoughts.

427
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,381
But Ga Jin...

428
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,476
If you find it difficult to let go,

429
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:02,317
come to the temple with me.

430
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:05,646
I have no intention of becoming a monk.

431
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,392
My mother's grave is here as well.

432
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,757
That is all anguish and obsession.

433
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:13,386
You have not even let go of your mother, much less the Princess.

434
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:17,626
How must I deal with this fool?

435
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:21,737
Master.

436
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:24,136
I have a request.

437
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:29,337
You want me to find out what situation the Princess is in.

438
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:31,476
I will not do it. It is too much of a bother.

439
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:34,416
That is not it.

440
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:38,847
It is a different request.

441
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,689
Mother.

442
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,029
Are you going?

443
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:13,068
Have you decided to go?

444
00:32:14,143 --> 00:32:15,368
Yes.

445
00:32:18,514 --> 00:32:21,779
You sure are the biggest fool...

446
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:24,178
in the whole wide world.

447
00:32:25,354 --> 00:32:28,178
Whom you took in and raised.

448
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:34,059
I will see you again when I come back...

449
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:36,389
after seeing Ga Jin.

450
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:41,299
This is the last time.

451
00:32:46,143 --> 00:32:47,669
Your Highness.

452
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:53,009
I am grateful...

453
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:55,708
that a lowly woman like me...

454
00:32:56,313 --> 00:32:59,979
had the honor of looking after you for so many years.

455
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:07,088
Now go back to the Princess...

456
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:12,558
and live a long happy life with her.

457
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:23,368
If you will excuse me now, Your Highness.

458
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:31,408
Do not call me that.

459
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:35,919
I will always be your son,

460
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:40,519
and you will always be my mother.

461
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,859
My dear Dal.

462
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,498
My sweet Dal.

463
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:53,799
Thank you so much.

464
00:33:55,514 --> 00:33:57,039
Thank you.

465
00:33:58,414 --> 00:33:59,938
Mother.

466
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:45,819
Dal.

467
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:48,688
I will see you...

468
00:34:49,664 --> 00:34:50,889
in the next life.

469
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,319
My goodness.

470
00:35:31,073 --> 00:35:32,338
Stop.

471
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:40,139
You are here, Dal.

472
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:06,569
I am honored...

473
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:12,538
to see you again, Princess.

474
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,489
To repay the kindness of Your Majesty,

475
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:32,658
I, On Dal,

476
00:36:35,604 --> 00:36:38,228
vow to retake Adan Fortress.

477
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,418
Lord Sa.

478
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:04,389
Lord Sa.

479
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,228
Was the execution carried out?

480
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:09,798
It was stopped.

481
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,203
What are you talking about?

482
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:16,269
General On Dal is back.

483
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:18,879
Dal is back?

484
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,414
What happened to the Princess?

485
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:22,784
What happened to her?

486
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,809
She was put back in prison.

487
00:37:27,224 --> 00:37:28,823
Let us enter the palace.

488
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:31,019
Sure. We must. Let us go.

489
00:37:35,164 --> 00:37:36,559
I am so relieved.

490
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:39,199
Poor Ga Jin.

491
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:40,699
Therefore,

492
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:44,769
I humbly ask you to allow me 5,000 troops.

493
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:47,144
Did you say 5,000?

494
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:50,343
If I do, are you sure you can retake Adan Fortress?

495
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:51,869
Yes, Your Majesty.

496
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:53,838
In addition,

497
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:58,449
I will retake Gaeripyeong as well as the land west of Jungryeong.

498
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:03,918
You should not make an empty promise.

499
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:07,393
I can guess why you returned here...

500
00:38:07,394 --> 00:38:09,329
all of a sudden.

501
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:12,559
It is out of your desperation to save the Princess,

502
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:14,699
is it not?

503
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,429
Yes, Your Majesty.

504
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:20,668
As a man trying to save his wife,

505
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,869
I do not make an empty promise.

506
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,183
It is not acceptable...

507
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,648
to make a promise that cannot be carried out...

508
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,079
just to win His Majesty's favor.

509
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:35,284
The troops are still exhausted...

510
00:38:35,284 --> 00:38:37,449
from fighting off the Baekje troops.

511
00:38:37,953 --> 00:38:40,023
Daedaero is right.

512
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:42,294
It will take a while for them to fully recover.

513
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:44,894
I am sure General On can take care of it.

514
00:38:44,894 --> 00:38:46,759
Silence, all of you.

515
00:38:47,763 --> 00:38:51,429
Given the situation, I can only allow you 3,000 troops.

516
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:55,239
Can you still retake Adan Fortress?

517
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:02,309
If you can believe the Princess' innocence and set her free,

518
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:05,079
I am ready...

519
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,749
to go out and fight.

520
00:39:19,963 --> 00:39:21,229
Dal.

521
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:26,869
His Majesty has given his permission.

522
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:28,869
You are free.

523
00:39:30,544 --> 00:39:32,009
Let me take you to Magnolia Hall.

524
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:33,813
What did you promise him?

525
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:36,109
Did you promise to retake Adan Fortress?

526
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,614
Is that why His Majesty set me free?

527
00:39:38,614 --> 00:39:41,548
- No, it is not like that. - On Dal.

528
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:44,389
You did.

529
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,459
You promised that.

530
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:49,489
Ga Jin.

531
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:52,499
I am excited to be back in the palace after many years.

532
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:56,469
I want to eat good food and see some people.

533
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:58,938
Why did you do that?

534
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:02,139
You should not have come.

535
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:03,869
You fool.

536
00:40:04,144 --> 00:40:06,609
Why do you never think about yourself?

537
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:10,709
Yes, I am...

538
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:13,678
a fool.

539
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:15,889
But let us get out of here first.

540
00:40:16,754 --> 00:40:20,259
I hate seeing you locked up like this.

541
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:23,889
You promised me to go hide in the mountains.

542
00:40:23,894 --> 00:40:26,028
I could not find anywhere to hide.

543
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:30,428
I had no choice but to come back to you.

544
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:37,544
Please send General On back.

545
00:40:37,544 --> 00:40:39,883
I will retake Adan Fortress.

546
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:41,014
Princess.

547
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:43,048
I would have been executed anyway.

548
00:40:43,614 --> 00:40:45,884
I will give up my life to get the fortress back.

549
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:47,883
Who says you may step in?

550
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:49,793
I am the one who received His Majesty's order.

551
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:51,948
It is not your choice to make.

552
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:55,119
I will go. Please give the order.

553
00:40:55,223 --> 00:40:58,264
It has already been decided. Please do not take your order back.

554
00:40:58,264 --> 00:40:59,558
Dal.

555
00:41:00,164 --> 00:41:02,099
I said I will go.

556
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,573
Seeing the two of you fight out of loyalty,

557
00:41:09,573 --> 00:41:12,379
I cannot believe what a fortunate king I am.

558
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:19,178
What could they be talking about in secret?

559
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,794
There is nothing to worry about.

560
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:25,254
He is back here after many years.

561
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:27,593
I am sure there is much to talk about.

562
00:41:27,593 --> 00:41:29,962
Did you not see it?

563
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:33,398
He confidently announced that he came to receive His Majesty's order.

564
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:36,168
All he has is 3,000 troops.

565
00:41:37,374 --> 00:41:41,139
General On may be a brilliant warrior,

566
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:44,369
but it will be an impossible task...

567
00:41:44,874 --> 00:41:46,313
to recover Adan Fortress.

568
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:48,479
How can you be so relaxed?

569
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,379
If he happens to win,

570
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,753
he will get in Geon Mu's way. Do you not know that?

571
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:56,693
What do you mean by that?

572
00:41:56,693 --> 00:41:59,859
The Princess has strong support from the people.

573
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:02,863
Now that General On joined her,

574
00:42:02,864 --> 00:42:04,928
who will be able to stop them?

575
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,798
We still have His Majesty.

576
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,274
His Majesty will not sit back...

577
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:14,599
and let them gain power.

578
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:19,144
General On should not have been given such an important task.

579
00:42:19,144 --> 00:42:21,778
There is nothing to worry about.

580
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:25,278
He will not be victorious.

581
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,879
He is only going to face death.

582
00:42:30,524 --> 00:42:32,658
But we cannot take...

583
00:42:33,424 --> 00:42:34,719
any chances.

584
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:38,562
Then...

585
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:41,058
how about the both of you go off to war together?

586
00:42:42,374 --> 00:42:44,928
- That cannot be done. - No, it cannot.

587
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:49,168
It cannot be done?

588
00:42:50,144 --> 00:42:51,339
No.

589
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:54,308
I do not wish General On...

590
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:55,879
to fight in a war ever again.

591
00:42:56,154 --> 00:42:59,024
Do you know why I told you...

592
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,418
to call General On to the Capital?

593
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:05,019
It is for the crucial task that the late King has left me.

594
00:43:07,124 --> 00:43:08,688
The unification of the three empires.

595
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:15,528
We need General On to accomplish the task.

596
00:43:19,374 --> 00:43:22,273
Adan Fortress is only the first step of our task.

597
00:43:22,274 --> 00:43:24,639
It has not been long since we defended our empire from Baekje.

598
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:27,839
We cannot make our people ravaged by war.

599
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:30,678
It is the unification of the three empires.

600
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:32,879
Not a war.

601
00:43:42,563 --> 00:43:44,963
I clearly told you three days ago...

602
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:47,129
to renew the weapons...

603
00:43:47,164 --> 00:43:48,959
that have become rusty.

604
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:52,298
And to change all the grips...

605
00:43:52,774 --> 00:43:55,068
that have rotted.

606
00:43:56,174 --> 00:43:58,343
Can you not see the rust?

607
00:43:58,343 --> 00:43:59,884
We tried as hard as we could,

608
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:02,283
but three days were just not enough.

609
00:44:02,284 --> 00:44:04,278
We are about to go off to war,

610
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:07,924
and you want my soldiers to fight with these rusty swords?

611
00:44:07,924 --> 00:44:10,448
I will take care of the weapons...

612
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:12,759
since you must not know how things are done in Silla.

613
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:21,798
Did you see that?

614
00:44:22,874 --> 00:44:24,969
The swords are too dull...

615
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:26,999
for me to kill him with one strike.

616
00:44:31,514 --> 00:44:32,808
General.

617
00:44:33,313 --> 00:44:34,979
I will kill you with my sword.

618
00:44:37,514 --> 00:44:39,778
Those who disobey a royal command...

619
00:44:41,754 --> 00:44:44,188
shall be ruled by death...

620
00:44:44,353 --> 00:44:46,158
regardless of rank.

621
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:48,489
Make full preparations for war.

622
00:44:48,494 --> 00:44:49,889
- Yes, General. - Yes, General.

623
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:58,129
I hear you killed an officer in the armory.

624
00:44:58,374 --> 00:44:59,603
That is true, Your Majesty.

625
00:44:59,603 --> 00:45:01,973
I told him to repair all the weapons, but...

626
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:04,408
That was an irrational act.

627
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:08,109
The soldiers are about to go off to war.

628
00:45:08,644 --> 00:45:10,953
You are to raise their morale,

629
00:45:10,953 --> 00:45:12,823
not kill one of them.

630
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:16,452
It is essential to establish discipline to raise their morale.

631
00:45:16,453 --> 00:45:18,048
You can get up.

632
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:22,933
Silla's soldiers are different from Goguryeo's soldiers.

633
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:25,833
As a general, you must figure out the difference...

634
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,603
to command them.

635
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:29,568
You are right, Your Majesty.

636
00:45:30,203 --> 00:45:32,798
From what I have observed,

637
00:45:33,744 --> 00:45:36,408
the soldiers of Silla are too lazy.

638
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:39,408
What did you say?

639
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:41,343
The soldiers of Goguryeo...

640
00:45:41,343 --> 00:45:43,053
defend their empire from Northern Zhou in the north,

641
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:45,749
and from Baekje and Silla in the south.

642
00:45:46,284 --> 00:45:48,753
All of their borders are practically at war.

643
00:45:48,754 --> 00:45:51,024
That is why their soldiers in all ranks...

644
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:53,223
are ready to fight at all times.

645
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:55,322
- But the soldiers of Silla... - Shut it.

646
00:45:55,323 --> 00:45:56,994
Are you insulting my soldiers...

647
00:45:56,994 --> 00:45:59,063
in my presence?

648
00:45:59,063 --> 00:46:01,499
As you have granted me the authority to control the army,

649
00:46:02,874 --> 00:46:04,668
I will fight with soldiers...

650
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:07,298
that are capable of winning.

651
00:46:11,044 --> 00:46:13,479
If my resolution seemed reckless,

652
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:15,839
you may take away my authority instantly.

653
00:46:19,823 --> 00:46:23,349
If you only said words of flattery,

654
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:26,019
I would have dismissed you right away.

655
00:46:26,894 --> 00:46:28,359
General,

656
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,658
make my soldiers stronger.

657
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:36,269
I will pour my heart and soul into it, Your Majesty.

658
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:50,908
General On Dal is back in Pyeongyang Castle.

659
00:46:53,424 --> 00:46:54,884
He will head to Adan Fortress in a few days...

660
00:46:54,884 --> 00:46:57,648
to attack the soldiers of Silla and uphold the royal command.

661
00:46:58,254 --> 00:47:00,918
Princess Pyeonggang may go off to war with him.

662
00:47:02,424 --> 00:47:04,433
I am concerned that they may win the hearts of the people again...

663
00:47:04,433 --> 00:47:06,898
and command the empire.

664
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:09,099
Deal with this quickly.

665
00:47:10,634 --> 00:47:12,068
Princess Pyeonggang.

666
00:47:14,004 --> 00:47:16,269
I will write her a letter. Take it with you.

667
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:17,538
Yes, My Lady.

668
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:27,539
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] KBS E38 'River Where the Moon Rises'</font>
<font color="#ff8080">"Adan Fortress"</font>
<font color="#ff0080">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>
<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

669
00:47:32,254 --> 00:47:35,089
I hear you are almost done with the preparation.

670
00:47:38,364 --> 00:47:39,859
I just saw...

671
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,298
your messenger...

672
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:45,669
who frequently goes to Pyeongyang Castle.

673
00:47:49,844 --> 00:47:52,368
Do you still send spies to Goguryeo?

674
00:47:54,614 --> 00:47:56,048
To whom?

675
00:47:57,483 --> 00:47:58,909
For what?

676
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:01,749
It is just one of those regular spying.

677
00:48:04,193 --> 00:48:07,459
You just burned away the message, and you call it regular spying?

678
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:12,729
You are secretly exchanging messages with Queen Jin, are you not?

679
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:16,269
I must be right.

680
00:48:18,203 --> 00:48:20,169
I wondered why Queen Jin...

681
00:48:20,674 --> 00:48:22,838
took my side.

682
00:48:22,914 --> 00:48:24,909
She was conspiring with you.

683
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:26,884
Did you promise her that you will...

684
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:29,278
give them Silla's confidential information to save me?

685
00:48:31,713 --> 00:48:33,783
You do not need to be concerned about this.

686
00:48:33,783 --> 00:48:35,979
Then what was the message that you burned away about?

687
00:48:38,723 --> 00:48:40,019
Lady Hae.

688
00:48:41,693 --> 00:48:43,128
The King...

689
00:48:43,864 --> 00:48:46,229
ordered to strengthen the security around the Capital.

690
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:50,528
I feel bad that it was not about the Princess...

691
00:48:51,003 --> 00:48:52,399
you wanted to hear about.

692
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:14,058
I, On Dal, honorably accept the King's command...

693
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:16,588
to go and retake Adan Fortress.

694
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:18,894
We will regain Goguryeo's territory...

695
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:20,699
and offer it to you, Your Majesty.

696
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,229
I hope you will govern our empire...

697
00:49:23,404 --> 00:49:25,699
and regain Goguryeo's glory.

698
00:49:26,273 --> 00:49:28,098
I will look forward to your victory.

699
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:31,674
At your command.

700
00:49:31,674 --> 00:49:36,854
- At your command. - At your command.

701
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:40,154
- At your command. - At your command.

702
00:49:40,154 --> 00:49:45,219
- At your command. - At your command.

703
00:50:12,483 --> 00:50:15,249
I have received your message safely.

704
00:50:15,924 --> 00:50:18,618
The soldiers of Silla are soon leaving to fight against Goguryeo.

705
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:21,088
Adan Fortress will be ready for them as well.

706
00:50:21,263 --> 00:50:25,358
The Princess and General On will not make it out alive,

707
00:50:25,763 --> 00:50:27,699
so do not worry.

708
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:33,769
Mother.

709
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:36,868
Prince Geon Mu.

710
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,314
What happened?

711
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:43,354
I fell while running on the stairs.

712
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:44,814
My goodness.

713
00:50:44,814 --> 00:50:47,283
It is nothing. It is just a scratch.

714
00:50:47,283 --> 00:50:49,689
What do you mean? You are bleeding.

715
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,223
- Bring a towel and an ointment. - Yes, Your Highness.

716
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:53,459
Come here.

717
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:03,699
Geon Mu.

718
00:51:03,804 --> 00:51:06,838
Your body is not yours alone.

719
00:51:07,503 --> 00:51:10,509
Your health is what determines the fate of Goguryeo.

720
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:14,114
So make sure not to be hurt carelessly.

721
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:15,739
I will keep that in mind.

722
00:51:16,814 --> 00:51:19,919
Mother, His Majesty is waiting for me.

723
00:51:20,124 --> 00:51:22,179
All right. You can go ahead.

724
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:29,933
The stairs in front of the Hall of Convenience...

725
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:31,358
is fun to run up and down.

726
00:51:31,493 --> 00:51:33,763
I also often had fun running up and down those stairs.

727
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:35,104
I got hurt too.

728
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:37,499
- You did too? - Of course.

729
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:39,973
Pyeonggang jumped from several stairs...

730
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,703
although she was a girl.

731
00:51:41,703 --> 00:51:45,509
Since our brave sister and her husband went to fight,

732
00:51:45,614 --> 00:51:48,808
we will soon regain Adan Fortress.

733
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:52,608
It will not be easy.

734
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:55,424
We must pray the skies will look after them.

735
00:51:55,424 --> 00:51:59,449
Even without its help, I am sure they will make it.

736
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:02,888
Because they will fight for Goguryeo with their loyalty to you.

737
00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:04,528
Loyalty?

738
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:14,703
Where did you put the book that was here?

739
00:52:14,703 --> 00:52:17,608
Prince Geon Mu took it with him.

740
00:52:18,743 --> 00:52:20,084
What?

741
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:23,878
All right. Let us start from where we left off.

742
00:52:34,124 --> 00:52:35,618
What is that letter?

743
00:52:39,394 --> 00:52:40,959
Give it to me.

744
00:53:16,203 --> 00:53:17,598
What are you waiting for?

745
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,138
- Make her kneel. - Your Majesty.

746
00:53:21,203 --> 00:53:24,409
Your Majesty, you cannot do this to her!

747
00:53:24,414 --> 00:53:25,909
Mother!

748
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:27,638
Geon Mu.

749
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:29,138
Step aside, Prince Geon Mu.

750
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:31,848
Now!

751
00:53:40,763 --> 00:53:43,164
You are the Queen of Goguryeo,

752
00:53:43,164 --> 00:53:46,558
and yet you sold our empire to Silla by conspiring with them?

753
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:53,669
Are you not ashamed to stand in front of the late King?

754
00:53:57,574 --> 00:53:59,638
It was foolish of me,

755
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:04,154
but I only did that for you, Your Majesty.

756
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:05,378
What did you just say?

757
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:09,584
You did that for me?

758
00:54:09,584 --> 00:54:12,588
What will happen if the Princess and General On win the war?

759
00:54:13,064 --> 00:54:15,419
They will covet your throne...

760
00:54:15,493 --> 00:54:19,229
with the support from the people.

761
00:54:19,263 --> 00:54:21,128
Did you not also...

762
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:23,634
worry about the Princess's traitorous mind?

763
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:25,368
Shut your mouth!

764
00:54:25,634 --> 00:54:28,574
She must have conspired with them even when Go Geon was here.

765
00:54:28,574 --> 00:54:32,273
That must be why she asked you to send him back alive!

766
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:34,084
That is...

767
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:36,713
She has committed an unpardonable sin.

768
00:54:36,713 --> 00:54:39,649
She deserves to be executed, Your Majesty.

769
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:42,253
But she is the Queen of the late King...

770
00:54:42,253 --> 00:54:43,953
and the mother of Prince Geon Mu.

771
00:54:43,953 --> 00:54:46,759
That is why her sin is even graver.

772
00:54:47,023 --> 00:54:49,058
Your Majesty!

773
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:56,134
I will pay for the sin...

774
00:54:56,134 --> 00:54:58,368
the Queen has committed!

775
00:54:59,203 --> 00:55:01,838
Please execute me instead!

776
00:55:01,874 --> 00:55:04,638
- Father... - Let go of me!

777
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:10,249
I was never enough as a father...

778
00:55:10,753 --> 00:55:12,914
to have a blessed daughter like her.

779
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:14,949
She is my daughter...

780
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:17,223
before she is the Queen.

781
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:20,259
I will pay for her sin as her father!

782
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:24,558
Please be understanding, Your Majesty!

783
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:27,699
Mother...

784
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:31,269
Your Majesty!

785
00:55:40,243 --> 00:55:41,713
We will be able to reach Adan Fortress...

786
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,409
when the day breaks if we keep moving at night.

787
00:55:44,713 --> 00:55:46,824
We cannot fight against them without getting any sleep.

788
00:55:46,824 --> 00:55:48,578
We should move as fast as we can...

789
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:51,588
so that the soldiers can take a nap at least.

790
00:55:52,124 --> 00:55:53,463
How is the security around Adan Fortress?

791
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:56,164
The security at the north and the west gate are the heaviest.

792
00:55:56,164 --> 00:55:57,463
Then the advance party...

793
00:55:57,463 --> 00:55:59,788
should infiltrate through the waterway underneath the east gate.

794
00:55:59,904 --> 00:56:01,833
As soon as we take down the gate,

795
00:56:01,834 --> 00:56:04,229
we will force our way into its headquarters.

796
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:05,674
General Woo,

797
00:56:05,674 --> 00:56:08,473
Jin, and General Sa. Please take care of the rest.

798
00:56:08,473 --> 00:56:09,798
- Yes, Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness.

799
00:56:26,723 --> 00:56:28,659
The soldiers are watching.

800
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:30,788
That is why I am leaning on you.

801
00:56:31,463 --> 00:56:35,263
I want them to think that we are very much in love,

802
00:56:35,263 --> 00:56:38,669
so that they will be full of fighting spirit.

803
00:56:39,574 --> 00:56:41,199
Ga Jin.

804
00:56:41,404 --> 00:56:44,308
You are smart and good at what you do,

805
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:48,439
but you can be silly sometimes.

806
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:52,909
I have been thinking.

807
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,054
About what?

808
00:56:54,054 --> 00:56:56,554
I think our first child should be a girl to help me with house chores.

809
00:56:56,554 --> 00:56:58,394
And then we could have boys.

810
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:00,364
Since the youngest is the cutest,

811
00:57:00,364 --> 00:57:01,463
let us have a daughter.

812
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:03,334
You are too ahead of yourself.

813
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:05,733
We are already very much in love.

814
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:07,699
We just need to take the next step.

815
00:57:30,854 --> 00:57:32,924
Oh, look. Look over there!

816
00:57:32,924 --> 00:57:34,858
Hurry! Come!

817
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:37,693
It is wild ginseng!

818
00:57:37,693 --> 00:57:39,189
Come over here!

819
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:43,868
A wild ginseng that tastes like bellflower root?

820
00:57:44,904 --> 00:57:48,199
Quiet. If I say it is wild ginseng, then it is wild ginseng.

821
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:52,909
Wow, look at this.

822
00:57:54,414 --> 00:57:55,638
Here.

823
00:57:57,614 --> 00:57:59,409
Have some wild ginseng and cheer up.

824
00:58:05,293 --> 00:58:07,259
Do not be afraid, Dal.

825
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:11,358
I am not afraid of anything because I am with you.

826
00:58:11,493 --> 00:58:14,028
Once we retake Adan Fortress tomorrow,

827
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:17,098
let us leave right away...

828
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:19,469
after putting Jin and Pung Gae in charge.

829
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:21,298
I know.

830
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:25,868
I know that tomorrow...

831
00:58:26,614 --> 00:58:28,538
will be the last time to use my father's sword.

832
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:43,293
Are you well-prepared for war?

833
00:58:43,293 --> 00:58:47,003
Yes, Your Majesty. We have enough weapons and war horses.

834
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:49,664
And the soldiers are in high morale.

835
00:58:49,664 --> 00:58:53,499
Once you give us your command, we can set off immediately.

836
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:56,499
It is different from what I heard.

837
00:58:56,773 --> 00:58:58,043
I heard that...

838
00:58:58,043 --> 00:59:00,644
you cornered them without mercy...

839
00:59:00,644 --> 00:59:03,078
and made them resent you.

840
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:06,924
You have also killed an officer at the armory.

841
00:59:06,924 --> 00:59:09,179
I must sacrifice the lesser...

842
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:11,618
for the greater good.

843
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:17,259
You put great importance on the greater good,

844
00:59:17,993 --> 00:59:20,729
but you are wavered by your personal feelings.

845
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:26,969
I do not understand.

846
00:59:28,874 --> 00:59:32,808
General Go is deeply...

847
00:59:34,114 --> 00:59:36,679
in love with Princess Pyeonggang.

848
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:39,713
In love?

849
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:41,424
General Go is strongly determined...

850
00:59:41,424 --> 00:59:43,594
to destroy Goguryeo...

851
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:46,719
so that he can have Princess Pyeonggang.

852
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:49,058
That is his only reason.

853
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:54,533
You have blessed us with your grace,

854
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:57,298
and now we are living a decent life.

855
00:59:57,503 --> 00:59:59,904
To repay your kindness,

856
00:59:59,904 --> 01:00:02,899
I am telling you this out of my loyalty to you...

857
01:00:02,973 --> 01:00:06,568
when war is just around the corner.

858
01:00:07,144 --> 01:00:08,909
This is outrageous!

859
01:00:08,914 --> 01:00:10,979
I do not know who told you that,

860
01:00:12,384 --> 01:00:14,618
but I am sure it is a trick to slander me.

861
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:19,818
Then are you saying...

862
01:00:19,854 --> 01:00:22,689
you have no feelings left for Pyeonggang at all?

863
01:00:28,263 --> 01:00:29,729
When we were young,

864
01:00:31,273 --> 01:00:33,739
I taught her martial arts.

865
01:00:34,703 --> 01:00:35,939
But...

866
01:00:37,314 --> 01:00:40,308
the royal household and my family were deeply ill-fated.

867
01:00:41,983 --> 01:00:44,108
We ended up becoming enemies.

868
01:00:46,513 --> 01:00:49,649
What about the royal wedding that got canceled?

869
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:54,094
You were a strong candidate as the king's son-in-law,

870
01:00:54,094 --> 01:00:57,888
but Princess Pyeonggang chose On Dal instead.

871
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:03,098
As a man, you must hold a deep grudge against her.

872
01:01:03,203 --> 01:01:05,374
But you insist that you have no feelings left for her,

873
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:07,368
so I will believe your words.

874
01:01:07,904 --> 01:01:11,409
But you will not have the authority to command the army.

875
01:01:11,943 --> 01:01:13,273
Your Majesty, that means...

876
01:01:13,273 --> 01:01:17,509
I will entrust you with a more important duty next time.

877
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:23,788
Then who will command the army?

878
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:31,288
I will go myself.

879
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:34,333
It is too dangerous, Your Majesty.

880
01:01:34,334 --> 01:01:36,002
There is someone...

881
01:01:36,003 --> 01:01:38,729
I wish to fight on the battlefield.

882
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:43,169
That is why I am going to Adan Fortress.

883
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:45,043
You are going to Adan Fortress?

884
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:48,739
The soldiers of Goguryeo are coming to attack Adan Fortress.

885
01:01:50,914 --> 01:01:52,249
On Dal...

886
01:01:52,713 --> 01:01:54,949
and Princess Pyeonggang are coming together.

887
01:01:55,824 --> 01:01:57,493
Do you understand it now?

888
01:01:57,493 --> 01:01:59,554
If you want to prove that you have no feelings for the Princess,

889
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:02,588
you must stay out of this battle.

890
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:29,219
Why? Are you here...

891
01:02:30,824 --> 01:02:32,649
to see how ruined I am?

892
01:02:32,953 --> 01:02:36,493
You will get another chance.

893
01:02:36,493 --> 01:02:38,388
There is no such thing!

894
01:02:39,394 --> 01:02:41,058
There is no next time.

895
01:02:42,064 --> 01:02:43,459
Do not...

896
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:46,429
talk to me about chances.

897
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,509
You can yell at me...

898
01:02:58,084 --> 01:02:59,679
and get angry.

899
01:03:02,124 --> 01:03:04,388
I will tolerate everything.

900
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,348
(Adan Fortress)

901
01:03:53,473 --> 01:03:55,499
General On!

902
01:03:57,644 --> 01:04:00,909
General, the advance party tore down the east gate.

903
01:04:02,144 --> 01:04:03,914
Before their main force blocks the gate,

904
01:04:03,914 --> 01:04:05,709
we need to enter the fortress.

905
01:04:09,154 --> 01:04:11,023
Are you here to live?

906
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:13,094
- We are here to win! - We are here to win!

907
01:04:13,094 --> 01:04:15,924
Are you going to lose and die?

908
01:04:15,924 --> 01:04:18,933
- We will win and live! - We will win and live!

909
01:04:18,933 --> 01:04:21,399
Warriors of Goguryeo.

910
01:04:22,503 --> 01:04:24,328
Let us march forward!

911
01:05:52,594 --> 01:05:54,093
(River Where the Moon Rises)

912
01:05:54,094 --> 01:05:55,094
As a man of Goguryeo,

913
01:05:55,094 --> 01:05:56,663
I cannot abandon the land of Goguryeo.

914
01:05:56,663 --> 01:05:58,264
I am going to fight until the last man standing.

915
01:05:58,264 --> 01:05:59,833
The King of Silla is here to fight himself.

916
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,603
It is meaningless to go on with this fight.

917
01:06:01,603 --> 01:06:02,804
Whether we win or lose,

918
01:06:02,804 --> 01:06:05,129
I must fight until the end. That is my fate as a general.

919
01:06:05,134 --> 01:06:07,002
I know you.

920
01:06:07,003 --> 01:06:09,373
A princess of an empire hid a dagger...

921
01:06:09,373 --> 01:06:11,269
and infiltrated deep into the enemy's camp?

922
01:06:11,313 --> 01:06:13,574
The Princess was captured by the Silla soldiers.

923
01:06:13,574 --> 01:06:16,178
You only think of the Princess even in the end.

924
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:20,724
Have you loved me at all?

925
01:06:20,724 --> 01:06:22,454
I loved you.

926
01:06:22,454 --> 01:06:25,019
- Dal! - No!

927
01:06:25,154 --> 01:06:26,419
Dal!
