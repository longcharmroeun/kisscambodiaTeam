1
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:07,361
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:09,317
(Characters, incidents, and dates do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,531
Starting with Silla, I will behead Go Geon...

4
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,626
and then unify the three nations!

5
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:19,367
The man just right for the job...

6
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:21,837
is your husband, General On.

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,436
Go to him and persuade him.

8
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:26,637
Whichever mountain you hide yourself in,

9
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:29,837
I am going to find you.

10
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:31,407
You will fail...

11
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:33,351
because I will make sure no one finds me.

12
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:35,877
An envoy came from Silla, and he is...

13
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:38,051
An envoy from Silla?

14
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,387
Are you not the traitor Go Geon?

15
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:45,756
Are you here to die in your own land?

16
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:47,932
(Episode 19)

17
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:49,597
I came to see you, Your Highness.

18
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:53,326
I thought it would be more meaningful...

19
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,766
to see you one last time...

20
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:57,766
than to live a meaningless life in Silla.

21
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,877
Your plan will never go your way...

22
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:05,777
as the King...

23
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:08,716
plans to send back the envoys.

24
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:12,947
I want to ask you one more thing.

25
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,257
That night...

26
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,497
Was it your sword?

27
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:24,867
That stabbed my father?

28
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:39,206
That is right.

29
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:43,587
Just like how your father...

30
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:46,986
shot an arrow at my mother.

31
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,956
It should end with that night.

32
00:01:56,331 --> 00:02:00,197
The resentment and ill fates should end with us.

33
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:02,197
Princess, the ill fates...

34
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:05,307
could have ended long ago.

35
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:08,137
If the two families came together through a royal wedding,

36
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:13,076
you and I would have changed this empire.

37
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:14,276
Not at all.

38
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:17,546
It would have become the world...

39
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:20,287
of the Gyeru Tribe that Gochuga dreamed of.

40
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,887
Go back to Silla.

41
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,956
And forget all of your memories from here.

42
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,456
There is a woman who only loves you.

43
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:33,996
I am here to die. I want to die...

44
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:37,107
to end our ill fate.

45
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:40,206
Please stop.

46
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,740
Leave.

47
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,137
I will not.

48
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:45,676
- What? - Because...

49
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:49,746
I followed you to save you.

50
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:53,347
Return safely, Master Go.

51
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:55,956
I will not see you out.

52
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,306
You asked to see me at such a late hour.

53
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:17,046
What is this?

54
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:19,676
As the leader of the Five Tribe council,

55
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,016
I came here...

56
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:25,486
to tell you that Go Geon must not be allowed to live.

57
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,717
What is this arrow for?

58
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:36,056
When I went to confiscate Gyeru Tribe's assets,

59
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:38,866
I happened to find it.

60
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,667
Go Won Pyo's servant...

61
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:47,576
told me the story behind this arrow.

62
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:54,021
This is the arrow that was used to kill...

63
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:55,847
Queen Yeon, your mother.

64
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,917
It is that very arrow.

65
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,717
Go Won Pyo.

66
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:06,127
He seems to have kept it like a trophy.

67
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:11,526
Will you still let that man's son live?

68
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:38,986
Oh my, Princess.

69
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:42,926
Gwanno Tribe's Lord Jin went to see the King.

70
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:46,271
What for? At this late hour?

71
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,897
I do not know that,

72
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:51,566
but the King just summoned his bodyguards.

73
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:00,681
Master Go, you must get away.

74
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:01,777
Why?

75
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,951
Did the King decide to kill me?

76
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,546
Yes, he will.

77
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:08,517
So you must get away.

78
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:12,056
If I act as kindling.

79
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:15,357
Goguryeo will go down in flames.

80
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,132
I came here expecting that.

81
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:20,401
Bring your own men and fight.

82
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,502
Do not die a pointless death.

83
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:24,866
If you want to avenge your father, do so properly.

84
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,736
If you return as a commander,

85
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,707
then I will take you on.

86
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:36,577
We are going to the library.

87
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:39,252
We must find some diplomatic papers.

88
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,791
The envoys cannot leave.

89
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,287
Are you stopping me because you do not know who I am?

90
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:45,426
If you do not believe me,

91
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:46,986
come with us.

92
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:09,647
Follow me.

93
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,537
The envoys disappeared!

94
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:28,796
Search thoroughly!

95
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:31,267
Find them!

96
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:41,077
This could put the Princess in danger.

97
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:45,116
Would you rather turn back now?

98
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,186
No.

99
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,287
She bruised my ego.

100
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:54,857
I must return the favor.

101
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:57,296
What did you two talk about?

102
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,866
Or was it...

103
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:02,496
a sweet conversation that you had wanted?

104
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:07,006
The main roads will be searched.

105
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:09,277
Horses will do us no good.

106
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:12,777
We will have to walk to the border. Can you manage?

107
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:15,847
We will not be safe even in Silla.

108
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:19,546
The established authority...

109
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,657
will not look upon us with favor.

110
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:23,417
We must get out of here first.

111
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,327
Where is Go Geon?

112
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:34,897
I asked you where he is.

113
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:39,936
I helped him escape.

114
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:41,407
What?

115
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:44,876
He will have left the palace by now...

116
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:46,876
and hid himself.

117
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:04,796
Send soldiers to go after him!

118
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:08,236
Also, arrest the Princess.

119
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,696
Your Majesty.

120
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,467
You heard me.

121
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,277
Arrest her and throw her in prison!

122
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:15,837
- Yes, sire. - Yes, sire.

123
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,176
Let me go.

124
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:20,917
I will go myself.

125
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:35,626
Your Majesty.

126
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:38,671
Your Majesty! Please calm down.

127
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:39,996
Shut your mouth!

128
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,207
Walk!

129
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:52,707
Get down!

130
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:54,717
Let go!

131
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:58,587
You must hold back.

132
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:00,687
You fools!

133
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:05,187
Do you know who you have tied up?

134
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:08,602
We were ordered to bring in everyone from the Sunno Tribe.

135
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:11,472
What? That is just nonsense!

136
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:12,801
Release them.

137
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:13,896
Lord Yeon.

138
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:15,901
This is nonsense.

139
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,541
Treason?

140
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,006
Our tribe has been through this before.

141
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:23,536
We will not repeat it.

142
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:27,051
So tell your men to stand down.

143
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:28,622
But the Princess and Lord Sa...

144
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:30,616
If we cause a fuss here,

145
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:33,386
it will only put the Princess at risk.

146
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:45,626
Did you catch Go Geon?

147
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:49,036
We cannot trace him.

148
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,177
You failed to get him?

149
00:09:57,141 --> 00:10:00,207
That news just ruined my appetite.

150
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:02,616
Your Majesty.

151
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:10,286
Do you truly believe the Princess plotted treason?

152
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,486
Is that why you ordered the Sunno Tribe to be brought in?

153
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:18,067
You have served since my father's reign, so you must know.

154
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,526
My sister...

155
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:23,536
had never hidden her ambition to become the ruler.

156
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,136
That is not true.

157
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,512
She only did what she could for the royal family...

158
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:29,177
I do not care what she thinks.

159
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:33,146
As King, I decide whether she is a traitor or not.

160
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:37,246
She helped Go Geon escape and that made things clear.

161
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:40,447
Your father also made the same mistake.

162
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:44,857
He chose to doubt rather than to believe.

163
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:49,996
I beg you to not repeat that tragedy.

164
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:52,227
That hangs on the Princess' decision.

165
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:56,141
- Get in there! - Move it.

166
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:57,771
- Lord Sa! - Move!

167
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:58,866
Stop!

168
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:02,437
I apologize.

169
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:06,252
I lacked judgment and got you in trouble.

170
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,016
Why are you here as well?

171
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,916
General Sa. Jin.

172
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:12,187
Princess.

173
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,156
Since you first came to Ghost Valley,

174
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:18,327
we became your subjects.

175
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,457
Please do not fear...

176
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,427
and do not falter.

177
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,972
- Move! - Walk ahead.

178
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:29,271
- Move along! - They say that right prevails.

179
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,571
It will all work out.

180
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:32,036
Do not worry, Ga Jin.

181
00:11:36,641 --> 00:11:39,077
- Princess! Do not do this! - Princess.

182
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,882
I must see the King!

183
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:42,276
Send word!

184
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,047
Go, now!

185
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:53,427
Release the Sunno Tribe chief and the warriors.

186
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:56,396
If I do,

187
00:11:57,771 --> 00:12:00,827
they will side with you and threaten me.

188
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,067
That will not happen.

189
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:04,307
Then...

190
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:10,876
prove your loyalty.

191
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:17,077
Silla took Adan Fortress from us during our father's reign.

192
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,547
I want to recover that key point.

193
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,457
Get General On to take it back.

194
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:26,656
I already told you.

195
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:32,567
General On will not fight again.

196
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,266
Then...

197
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:39,467
why did you go to see him?

198
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,707
You went to his hiding place.

199
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:47,882
What did you talk about?

200
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:50,847
How do you know that?

201
00:12:51,092 --> 00:12:53,416
Did you ask him to fight with you?

202
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,031
To help you oust the young, lacking King,

203
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:00,057
so you could take over?

204
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:05,366
Won.

205
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:12,366
If you feel wronged,

206
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:16,136
show your loyalty.

207
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,097
I would rather...

208
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,766
you kill me.

209
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,607
Take my life...

210
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:48,337
as a token of my loyalty.

211
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:08,557
I understand.

212
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:29,977
What did I tell you?

213
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,317
She will not listen.

214
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:37,656
I am tired. Please leave.

215
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,597
What will you do about General On?

216
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:45,297
He may live as a hermit now,

217
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:47,427
but if something happens to the Princess,

218
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:50,437
he will come after you first.

219

220
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,116
Be careful.

221
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,557
Lord Sa. Are you all right?

222
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,427
I am fine.

223
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:19,827
I am glad this is the end of it.

224
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:21,571
The skies have helped us.

225
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,166
That is not true.

226
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,266
- Jin. - What do you mean?

227
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:29,212
Lord Sa. Were you not all released...

228
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:31,607
because the misunderstanding was explained?

229
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:35,146
The Princess took the fall.

230
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:37,952
Instead of denying it, she just...

231
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,321
Jin, that is enough.

232
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:40,687
Keep your mouth shut.

233
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,317
The Princess...

234
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:46,827
took the blame for something that did not happen.

235
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:48,496
What?

236
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:50,457
To avoid going against the King,

237
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,702
she said she would take the blame.

238
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,766
Then what will happen to her?

239
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,036
Lord Sa.

240
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,506
The King ordered...

241
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:10,016
she be beheaded.

242
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:17,957
(Seorabeol, Silla)

243
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:21,057
They insulted our name.

244
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,262
Our offer of alliance was refused,

245
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,872
and the officers who accompanied them were imprisoned.

246
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,242
And yet, to save their own skin,

247
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,602
they fled in disgrace.

248
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:33,437
This is a grave crime and they must pay with their lives.

249
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,406
Is any of that untrue?

250
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:43,246
Lord Kim, you think so much of Silla's reputation,

251
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,187
and yet your actions do not follow your words.

252
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:48,457
What you just said does not sound honest.

253
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,187
What?

254
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,057
His actions do not follow his words?

255
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:54,927
Yes.

256
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:57,896
Lord Kim...

257
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:03,297
sent this woman as a spy...

258
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:06,271
and traveled to Goguryeo many times.

259
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:10,037
Each time, he took valuable jewels, silver,

260
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:13,777
and even Goguryeo women.

261
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,847
For his personal gain.

262
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:19,487
With the excuse of serving Silla,

263
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:21,787
did you fill your own pockets?

264
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:23,692
That is not true.

265
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:26,226
He said the riches were for the King.

266
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,226
As it was to benefit Silla,

267
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,002
I was told not to care about profits or losses.

268
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:32,531
Once a thief...

269
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:34,472
is forever a thief, Your Majesty.

270
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:37,202
I asked around myself.

271
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:39,837
I was able to confirm that...

272
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,581
whenever he visited Baekje, he took riches for his own gain.

273
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,012
Even from Baekje?

274
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:48,621
I took in you Goguryeo stragglers...

275
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:51,652
and now you are stabbing me in the back?

276
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:53,186
Before his nation,

277
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,487
he puts his livelihood first.

278
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,926
You must not keep him close.

279
00:18:00,591 --> 00:18:02,097
Do not believe them.

280
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:03,497
This is a trap.

281
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:06,126
I am bring framed.

282
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:08,497
We will see about that.

283
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:16,012
- Drag him outside. - Yes, sire!

284
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,436
You cannot do this.

285
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,452
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

286
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:21,277
I am innocent!

287
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:27,047
Leave us.

288
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:36,626
Kim Cha Seung...

289
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:41,067
will be punished for whatever crimes he committed.

290
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:43,267
How will you...

291
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:47,166
pay for failing to do your duty...

292
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,537
as my envoy?

293
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:54,307
Give me...

294
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:59,747
10,000 of your men.

295
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:03,186
I will attack Goguryeo...

296
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:06,186
and expand Silla's territory.

297
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:13,827
How can I...

298
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:16,837
entrust you with 10,000 of my soldiers?

299
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:24,476
I saw for myself that...

300
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:29,146
Goguryeo does not have a commander to defend their land.

301
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:31,017
They only have paper tigers...

302
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,247
who are sick and old.

303
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:36,386
I heard that...

304
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:40,386
Princess Pyeonggang managed to fight off Baekje's attack.

305
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:44,626
King Yeongyang is jealous of his sister,

306
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,866
so he has her locked up.

307
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:50,166
Now is the right time.

308
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:53,166
If you give me 10,000 men,

309
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:55,307
I will turn Goguryeo land...

310
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:58,646
into Silla.

311
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:05,916
How about 30,000 men?

312
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:15,557
To take Pyeongyang Castle as well,

313
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:18,997
I think you will need at least 30,000 soldiers.

314
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,337
You cannot.

315
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:23,997
If you go now,

316
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,406
you will not return alive.

317
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:28,476
Then on my funeral rite,

318
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:31,881
light enough incense for me.

319
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:32,881
General!

320
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:35,616
I need no signs to show me the path I must take.

321
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:37,146
I must follow it.

322
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:41,886
I do not know about the consequences.

323
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,357
Even if you win, General,

324
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:48,896
you will not win the Princess.

325
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:52,827
The Princess...

326
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:55,837
will soon be executed.

327
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:10,176
I know.

328
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:15,757
That is why I must fight.

329
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:21,186
It is the only path left for me.

330
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:09,476
I wonder if this is too small to build a hut, Mother.

331
00:22:46,051 --> 00:22:47,307
You scoundrels.

332
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:53,386
You must be here to rob a house when the owner is not home.

333
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:55,116
Where is On Dal?

334
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:56,557
On Dal?

335
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:58,987
Is that the name of the mutt in your yard?

336
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:01,061
This is my house.

337
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,297
It is your house?

338
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:06,567
Then reveal your identity.

339
00:23:08,642 --> 00:23:10,767
How dare some petty thieves order me around?

340
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:11,866
Get him.

341
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:54,706
Wol Gwang?

342
00:24:01,252 --> 00:24:02,456
Master?

343
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:16,896
Master?

344
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:19,366
Master!

345
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,047
Master.

346
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,847
Master.

347
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:03,716
What are you doing?

348
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:06,487
I am digging a grave.

349
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:10,186
- Whose grave? - Of course, it is for my Master.

350
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:14,926
You died!

351
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:17,027
Did you not die?

352
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:21,666
This must be your grave, not mine.

353
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:32,406
It hurts.

354
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:38,077
Are you really alive?

355
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:40,386
You are not a ghost, are you?

356
00:25:40,992 --> 00:25:42,561
I am not a ghost,

357
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:43,817
but I do feel like a pig.

358
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:46,732
You definitely had no pulse,

359
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:48,131
and you were not breathing.

360
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,262
Once you have trained as much as I,

361
00:25:50,262 --> 00:25:52,172
you can last an entire night...

362
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:54,067
as if you are dead, even though you are alive.

363
00:25:54,732 --> 00:25:55,871
Is that true?

364
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:57,371
Why are you so curious...

365
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:59,136
when you are the one who left before learning all I have to teach?

366
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:01,712
I knew those assassins would only leave once they had fulfilled...

367
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:03,307
their duty to the last.

368
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:06,077
So I simply pretended to be dead for a little while.

369
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:24,926
Were those assassins really sent by the King?

370
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:27,426
To kill me?

371
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,267
Rest assured.

372
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:35,341
Now they know you do not live in this house,

373
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:37,341
and they believe they have killed the owner of the house.

374
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:38,747
They will not return.

375
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,577
If he has sent assassins after me,

376
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:47,347
that means something has happened to Ga Jin as well.

377
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:49,392
What has happened?

378
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:50,956
You know, do you not?

379
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:55,057
Why does it matter to you?

380
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,357
You have become a recluse, cutting yourself off from the world.

381
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:00,666
Please tell me, Master.

382
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:09,507
The King has imprisoned Ga Jin.

383
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:11,281
What?

384
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:13,446
He has become suspicious...

385
00:27:13,752 --> 00:27:15,351
that Ga Jin is plotting treason.

386
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:17,916
That makes no sense. Why would Ga Jin do that?

387
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:21,886
Power cannot be split, even between a parent and child.

388
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:26,757
Furthermore, once a sister who is both wise and skilled...

389
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:29,327
began to receive the respect of the people,

390
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,327
the King must have become anxious.

391
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:34,297
So...

392
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:36,767
what will happen to Ga Jin?

393
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:39,267
If she cannot prove her innocence,

394
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:41,706
she will be executed.

395
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:47,507
This is absurd.

396
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:51,577
How can she prove her innocence of something she has not done?

397
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:03,057
Sister.

398
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:06,926
Do not choose a path that leads to death, when there is one to life.

399
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,166
General On is your sword.

400
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,636
As soon as we recover Adan Fortress...

401
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:18,547
both you and my brother-in-law will be able to live.

402
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,976
My path to life...

403
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:27,186
is to die for that person.

404
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:31,216
Must you be so stubborn?

405
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:35,257
You can save yourself if you just persuade the General.

406
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,696
Won.

407
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:43,366
He is someone who became my sword...

408
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:46,636
and waded through a river of blood.

409
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:52,206
To satisfy my ambitions,

410
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:55,216
he continued to wound himself.

411
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,087
At last, he has returned...

412
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:03,616
to the life he desired.

413
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:06,027
Therefore,

414
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:10,797
I am ashamed...

415
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:13,896
and grateful.

416
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:16,696
Is that truly...

417
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:21,537
your dying wish?

418
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,706
My life...

419
00:29:28,252 --> 00:29:30,347
is not under your control.

420
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:33,247
I have already decided...

421
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,916
to dedicate it to him.

422
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:48,497
That was a great meal.

423
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:49,936
Master.

424
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:52,936
You said it was Adan Fortress?

425
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,277
Does the King wish to have it?

426
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:58,381
Do not think foolish thoughts.

427
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,381
But Ga Jin...

428
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,476
If you find it difficult to let go,

429
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:03,317
come to the temple with me.

430
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:06,646
I have no intention of becoming a monk.

431
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,392
My mother's grave is here as well.

432
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,757
That is all anguish and obsession.

433
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:14,386
You have not even let go of your mother, much less the Princess.

434
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:18,626
How must I deal with this fool?

435
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:22,737
Master.

436
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,136
I have a request.

437
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:30,337
You want me to find out what situation the Princess is in.

438
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:32,476
I will not do it. It is too much of a bother.

439
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:35,416
That is not it.

440
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:39,847
It is a different request.

441
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:57,689
Mother.

442
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,029
Are you going?

443
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:14,068
Have you decided to go?

444
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,368
Yes.

445
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:22,779
You sure are the biggest fool...

446
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:25,178
in the whole wide world.

447
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:29,178
Whom you took in and raised.

448
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:35,059
I will see you again when I come back...

449
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:37,389
after seeing Ga Jin.

450
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:42,299
This is the last time.

451
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:48,669
Your Highness.

452
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:54,009
I am grateful...

453
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:56,708
that a lowly woman like me...

454
00:32:57,313 --> 00:33:00,979
had the honor of looking after you for so many years.

455
00:33:04,123 --> 00:33:08,088
Now go back to the Princess...

456
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:13,558
and live a long happy life with her.

457
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:24,368
If you will excuse me now, Your Highness.

458
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:32,408
Do not call me that.

459
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:36,919
I will always be your son,

460
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:41,519
and you will always be my mother.

461
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,859
My dear Dal.

462
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:51,498
My sweet Dal.

463
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:54,799
Thank you so much.

464
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:58,039
Thank you.

465
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:00,938
Mother.

466
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:46,819
Dal.

467
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:49,688
I will see you...

468
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:51,889
in the next life.

469
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:14,319
My goodness.

470
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:33,338
Stop.

471
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:41,139
You are here, Dal.

472
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:07,569
I am honored...

473
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:13,538
to see you again, Princess.

474
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:31,489
To repay the kindness of Your Majesty,

475
00:36:31,964 --> 00:36:33,658
I, On Dal,

476
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:39,228
vow to retake Adan Fortress.

477
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,418
Lord Sa.

478
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:05,389
Lord Sa.

479
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,228
Was the execution carried out?

480
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:10,798
It was stopped.

481
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,203
What are you talking about?

482
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:17,269
General On Dal is back.

483
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:19,879
Dal is back?

484
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:22,414
What happened to the Princess?

485
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:23,784
What happened to her?

486
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,809
She was put back in prison.

487
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:29,823
Let us enter the palace.

488
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:32,019
Sure. We must. Let us go.

489
00:37:36,164 --> 00:37:37,559
I am so relieved.

490
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:40,199
Poor Ga Jin.

491
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:41,699
Therefore,

492
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:45,769
I humbly ask you to allow me 5,000 troops.

493
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:48,144
Did you say 5,000?

494
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:51,343
If I do, are you sure you can retake Adan Fortress?

495
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:52,869
Yes, Your Majesty.

496
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:54,838
In addition,

497
00:37:55,844 --> 00:37:59,449
I will retake Gaeripyeong as well as the land west of Jungryeong.

498
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,918
You should not make an empty promise.

499
00:38:05,394 --> 00:38:08,393
I can guess why you returned here...

500
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:10,329
all of a sudden.

501
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:13,559
It is out of your desperation to save the Princess,

502
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:15,699
is it not?

503
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:17,429
Yes, Your Majesty.

504
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:21,668
As a man trying to save his wife,

505
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:24,869
I do not make an empty promise.

506
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:28,183
It is not acceptable...

507
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:30,648
to make a promise that cannot be carried out...

508
00:38:31,683 --> 00:38:34,079
just to win His Majesty's favor.

509
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:36,284
The troops are still exhausted...

510
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:38,449
from fighting off the Baekje troops.

511
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:41,023
Daedaero is right.

512
00:38:41,024 --> 00:38:43,294
It will take a while for them to fully recover.

513
00:38:43,294 --> 00:38:45,894
I am sure General On can take care of it.

514
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:47,759
Silence, all of you.

515
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:52,429
Given the situation, I can only allow you 3,000 troops.

516
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:56,239
Can you still retake Adan Fortress?

517
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:03,309
If you can believe the Princess' innocence and set her free,

518
00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:06,079
I am ready...

519
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:09,749
to go out and fight.

520
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,229
Dal.

521
00:39:26,174 --> 00:39:27,869
His Majesty has given his permission.

522
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:29,869
You are free.

523
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:33,009
Let me take you to Magnolia Hall.

524
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:34,813
What did you promise him?

525
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:37,109
Did you promise to retake Adan Fortress?

526
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:39,614
Is that why His Majesty set me free?

527
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:42,548
- No, it is not like that. - On Dal.

528
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,389
You did.

529
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,459
You promised that.

530
00:39:49,193 --> 00:39:50,489
Ga Jin.

531
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:53,499
I am excited to be back in the palace after many years.

532
00:39:54,504 --> 00:39:57,469
I want to eat good food and see some people.

533
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,938
Why did you do that?

534
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:03,139
You should not have come.

535
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:04,869
You fool.

536
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:07,609
Why do you never think about yourself?

537
00:40:10,453 --> 00:40:11,709
Yes, I am...

538
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,678
a fool.

539
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:16,889
But let us get out of here first.

540
00:40:17,754 --> 00:40:21,259
I hate seeing you locked up like this.

541
00:40:22,093 --> 00:40:24,889
You promised me to go hide in the mountains.

542
00:40:24,894 --> 00:40:27,028
I could not find anywhere to hide.

543
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,428
I had no choice but to come back to you.

544
00:40:36,674 --> 00:40:38,544
Please send General On back.

545
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,883
I will retake Adan Fortress.

546
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:42,014
Princess.

547
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:44,048
I would have been executed anyway.

548
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:46,884
I will give up my life to get the fortress back.

549
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:48,883
Who says you may step in?

550
00:40:48,884 --> 00:40:50,793
I am the one who received His Majesty's order.

551
00:40:50,794 --> 00:40:52,948
It is not your choice to make.

552
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:56,119
I will go. Please give the order.

553
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:59,264
It has already been decided. Please do not take your order back.

554
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:00,558
Dal.

555
00:41:01,164 --> 00:41:03,099
I said I will go.

556
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:10,573
Seeing the two of you fight out of loyalty,

557
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:13,379
I cannot believe what a fortunate king I am.

558
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:20,178
What could they be talking about in secret?

559
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,794
There is nothing to worry about.

560
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:26,254
He is back here after many years.

561
00:41:26,254 --> 00:41:28,593
I am sure there is much to talk about.

562
00:41:28,593 --> 00:41:30,962
Did you not see it?

563
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:34,398
He confidently announced that he came to receive His Majesty's order.

564
00:41:34,603 --> 00:41:37,168
All he has is 3,000 troops.

565
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:42,139
General On may be a brilliant warrior,

566
00:41:42,573 --> 00:41:45,369
but it will be an impossible task...

567
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:47,313
to recover Adan Fortress.

568
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:49,479
How can you be so relaxed?

569
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:52,379
If he happens to win,

570
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:55,753
he will get in Geon Mu's way. Do you not know that?

571
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:57,693
What do you mean by that?

572
00:41:57,693 --> 00:42:00,859
The Princess has strong support from the people.

573
00:42:01,164 --> 00:42:03,863
Now that General On joined her,

574
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:05,928
who will be able to stop them?

575
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:10,798
We still have His Majesty.

576
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:13,274
His Majesty will not sit back...

577
00:42:13,274 --> 00:42:15,599
and let them gain power.

578
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:20,144
General On should not have been given such an important task.

579
00:42:20,144 --> 00:42:22,778
There is nothing to worry about.

580
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:26,278
He will not be victorious.

581
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:28,879
He is only going to face death.

582
00:42:31,524 --> 00:42:33,658
But we cannot take...

583
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:35,719
any chances.

584
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,562
Then...

585
00:42:39,563 --> 00:42:42,058
how about the both of you go off to war together?

586
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:45,928
- That cannot be done. - No, it cannot.

587
00:42:48,744 --> 00:42:50,168
It cannot be done?

588
00:42:51,144 --> 00:42:52,339
No.

589
00:42:52,774 --> 00:42:55,308
I do not wish General On...

590
00:42:55,443 --> 00:42:56,879
to fight in a war ever again.

591
00:42:57,154 --> 00:43:00,024
Do you know why I told you...

592
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:01,418
to call General On to the Capital?

593
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,019
It is for the crucial task that the late King has left me.

594
00:43:08,124 --> 00:43:09,688
The unification of the three empires.

595
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:16,528
We need General On to accomplish the task.

596
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:23,273
Adan Fortress is only the first step of our task.

597
00:43:23,274 --> 00:43:25,639
It has not been long since we defended our empire from Baekje.

598
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:28,839
We cannot make our people ravaged by war.

599
00:43:30,053 --> 00:43:31,678
It is the unification of the three empires.

600
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:33,879
Not a war.

601
00:43:43,563 --> 00:43:45,963
I clearly told you three days ago...

602
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:48,129
to renew the weapons...

603
00:43:48,164 --> 00:43:49,959
that have become rusty.

604
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:53,298
And to change all the grips...

605
00:43:53,774 --> 00:43:56,068
that have rotted.

606
00:43:57,174 --> 00:43:59,343
Can you not see the rust?

607
00:43:59,343 --> 00:44:00,884
We tried as hard as we could,

608
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:03,283
but three days were just not enough.

609
00:44:03,284 --> 00:44:05,278
We are about to go off to war,

610
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:08,924
and you want my soldiers to fight with these rusty swords?

611
00:44:08,924 --> 00:44:11,448
I will take care of the weapons...

612
00:44:11,453 --> 00:44:13,759
since you must not know how things are done in Silla.

613
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:22,798
Did you see that?

614
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:25,969
The swords are too dull...

615
00:44:26,004 --> 00:44:27,999
for me to kill him with one strike.

616
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:33,808
General.

617
00:44:34,313 --> 00:44:35,979
I will kill you with my sword.

618
00:44:38,514 --> 00:44:40,778
Those who disobey a royal command...

619
00:44:42,754 --> 00:44:45,188
shall be ruled by death...

620
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:47,158
regardless of rank.

621
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:49,489
Make full preparations for war.

622
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:50,889
- Yes, General. - Yes, General.

623
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:59,129
I hear you killed an officer in the armory.

624
00:44:59,374 --> 00:45:00,603
That is true, Your Majesty.

625
00:45:00,603 --> 00:45:02,973
I told him to repair all the weapons, but...

626
00:45:02,973 --> 00:45:05,408
That was an irrational act.

627
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:09,109
The soldiers are about to go off to war.

628
00:45:09,644 --> 00:45:11,953
You are to raise their morale,

629
00:45:11,953 --> 00:45:13,823
not kill one of them.

630
00:45:13,823 --> 00:45:17,452
It is essential to establish discipline to raise their morale.

631
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:19,048
You can get up.

632
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:23,933
Silla's soldiers are different from Goguryeo's soldiers.

633
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:26,833
As a general, you must figure out the difference...

634
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,603
to command them.

635
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:30,568
You are right, Your Majesty.

636
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:33,798
From what I have observed,

637
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:37,408
the soldiers of Silla are too lazy.

638
00:45:39,044 --> 00:45:40,408
What did you say?

639
00:45:40,414 --> 00:45:42,343
The soldiers of Goguryeo...

640
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:44,053
defend their empire from Northern Zhou in the north,

641
00:45:44,053 --> 00:45:46,749
and from Baekje and Silla in the south.

642
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:49,753
All of their borders are practically at war.

643
00:45:49,754 --> 00:45:52,024
That is why their soldiers in all ranks...

644
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:54,223
are ready to fight at all times.

645
00:45:54,223 --> 00:45:56,322
- But the soldiers of Silla... - Shut it.

646
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:57,994
Are you insulting my soldiers...

647
00:45:57,994 --> 00:46:00,063
in my presence?

648
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:02,499
As you have granted me the authority to control the army,

649
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:05,668
I will fight with soldiers...

650
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,298
that are capable of winning.

651
00:46:12,044 --> 00:46:14,479
If my resolution seemed reckless,

652
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:16,839
you may take away my authority instantly.

653
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:24,349
If you only said words of flattery,

654
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:27,019
I would have dismissed you right away.

655
00:46:27,894 --> 00:46:29,359
General,

656
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:33,658
make my soldiers stronger.

657
00:46:35,134 --> 00:46:37,269
I will pour my heart and soul into it, Your Majesty.

658
00:46:49,414 --> 00:46:51,908
General On Dal is back in Pyeongyang Castle.

659
00:46:54,424 --> 00:46:55,884
He will head to Adan Fortress in a few days...

660
00:46:55,884 --> 00:46:58,648
to attack the soldiers of Silla and uphold the royal command.

661
00:46:59,254 --> 00:47:01,918
Princess Pyeonggang may go off to war with him.

662
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:05,433
I am concerned that they may win the hearts of the people again...

663
00:47:05,433 --> 00:47:07,898
and command the empire.

664
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,099
Deal with this quickly.

665
00:47:11,634 --> 00:47:13,068
Princess Pyeonggang.

666
00:47:15,004 --> 00:47:17,269
I will write her a letter. Take it with you.

667
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:18,538
Yes, My Lady.

668
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:28,539
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] KBS E38 'River Where the Moon Rises'</font>
<font color="#ff8080">"Adan Fortress"</font>
<font color="#ff0080">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>
<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

669
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:36,089
I hear you are almost done with the preparation.

670
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:40,859
I just saw...

671
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:44,298
your messenger...

672
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:46,669
who frequently goes to Pyeongyang Castle.

673
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:53,368
Do you still send spies to Goguryeo?

674
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:57,048
To whom?

675
00:47:58,483 --> 00:47:59,909
For what?

676
00:47:59,914 --> 00:48:02,749
It is just one of those regular spying.

677
00:48:05,193 --> 00:48:08,459
You just burned away the message, and you call it regular spying?

678
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:13,729
You are secretly exchanging messages with Queen Jin, are you not?

679
00:48:15,804 --> 00:48:17,269
I must be right.

680
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:21,169
I wondered why Queen Jin...

681
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:23,838
took my side.

682
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:25,909
She was conspiring with you.

683
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:27,884
Did you promise her that you will...

684
00:48:27,884 --> 00:48:30,278
give them Silla's confidential information to save me?

685
00:48:32,713 --> 00:48:34,783
You do not need to be concerned about this.

686
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:36,979
Then what was the message that you burned away about?

687
00:48:39,723 --> 00:48:41,019
Lady Hae.

688
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:44,128
The King...

689
00:48:44,864 --> 00:48:47,229
ordered to strengthen the security around the Capital.

690
00:48:48,963 --> 00:48:51,528
I feel bad that it was not about the Princess...

691
00:48:52,003 --> 00:48:53,399
you wanted to hear about.

692
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:15,058
I, On Dal, honorably accept the King's command...

693
00:49:15,124 --> 00:49:17,588
to go and retake Adan Fortress.

694
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:19,894
We will regain Goguryeo's territory...

695
00:49:19,894 --> 00:49:21,699
and offer it to you, Your Majesty.

696
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,229
I hope you will govern our empire...

697
00:49:24,404 --> 00:49:26,699
and regain Goguryeo's glory.

698
00:49:27,273 --> 00:49:29,098
I will look forward to your victory.

699
00:49:30,344 --> 00:49:32,674
At your command.

700
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:37,854
- At your command. - At your command.

701
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:41,154
- At your command. - At your command.

702
00:49:41,154 --> 00:49:46,219
- At your command. - At your command.

703
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:16,249
I have received your message safely.

704
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:19,618
The soldiers of Silla are soon leaving to fight against Goguryeo.

705
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:22,088
Adan Fortress will be ready for them as well.

706
00:50:22,263 --> 00:50:26,358
The Princess and General On will not make it out alive,

707
00:50:26,763 --> 00:50:28,699
so do not worry.

708
00:50:33,574 --> 00:50:34,769
Mother.

709
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:37,868
Prince Geon Mu.

710
00:50:39,243 --> 00:50:42,314
What happened?

711
00:50:42,314 --> 00:50:44,354
I fell while running on the stairs.

712
00:50:44,354 --> 00:50:45,814
My goodness.

713
00:50:45,814 --> 00:50:48,283
It is nothing. It is just a scratch.

714
00:50:48,283 --> 00:50:50,689
What do you mean? You are bleeding.

715
00:50:50,993 --> 00:50:53,223
- Bring a towel and an ointment. - Yes, Your Highness.

716
00:50:53,223 --> 00:50:54,459
Come here.

717
00:51:03,404 --> 00:51:04,699
Geon Mu.

718
00:51:04,804 --> 00:51:07,838
Your body is not yours alone.

719
00:51:08,503 --> 00:51:11,509
Your health is what determines the fate of Goguryeo.

720
00:51:12,513 --> 00:51:15,114
So make sure not to be hurt carelessly.

721
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,739
I will keep that in mind.

722
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:20,919
Mother, His Majesty is waiting for me.

723
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:23,179
All right. You can go ahead.

724
00:51:29,523 --> 00:51:30,933
The stairs in front of the Hall of Convenience...

725
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:32,358
is fun to run up and down.

726
00:51:32,493 --> 00:51:34,763
I also often had fun running up and down those stairs.

727
00:51:34,763 --> 00:51:36,104
I got hurt too.

728
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:38,499
- You did too? - Of course.

729
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:40,973
Pyeonggang jumped from several stairs...

730
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,703
although she was a girl.

731
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:46,509
Since our brave sister and her husband went to fight,

732
00:51:46,614 --> 00:51:49,808
we will soon regain Adan Fortress.

733
00:51:51,753 --> 00:51:53,608
It will not be easy.

734
00:51:54,424 --> 00:51:56,424
We must pray the skies will look after them.

735
00:51:56,424 --> 00:52:00,449
Even without its help, I am sure they will make it.

736
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:03,888
Because they will fight for Goguryeo with their loyalty to you.

737
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:05,528
Loyalty?

738
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:15,703
Where did you put the book that was here?

739
00:52:15,703 --> 00:52:18,608
Prince Geon Mu took it with him.

740
00:52:19,743 --> 00:52:21,084
What?

741
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:24,878
All right. Let us start from where we left off.

742
00:52:35,124 --> 00:52:36,618
What is that letter?

743
00:52:40,394 --> 00:52:41,959
Give it to me.

744
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:18,598
What are you waiting for?

745
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:21,138
- Make her kneel. - Your Majesty.

746
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:25,409
Your Majesty, you cannot do this to her!

747
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:26,909
Mother!

748
00:53:27,314 --> 00:53:28,638
Geon Mu.

749
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:30,138
Step aside, Prince Geon Mu.

750
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,848
Now!

751
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:44,164
You are the Queen of Goguryeo,

752
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:47,558
and yet you sold our empire to Silla by conspiring with them?

753
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:54,669
Are you not ashamed to stand in front of the late King?

754
00:53:58,574 --> 00:54:00,638
It was foolish of me,

755
00:54:01,183 --> 00:54:05,154
but I only did that for you, Your Majesty.

756
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:06,378
What did you just say?

757
00:54:09,253 --> 00:54:10,584
You did that for me?

758
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,588
What will happen if the Princess and General On win the war?

759
00:54:14,064 --> 00:54:16,419
They will covet your throne...

760
00:54:16,493 --> 00:54:20,229
with the support from the people.

761
00:54:20,263 --> 00:54:22,128
Did you not also...

762
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,634
worry about the Princess's traitorous mind?

763
00:54:24,634 --> 00:54:26,368
Shut your mouth!

764
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:29,574
She must have conspired with them even when Go Geon was here.

765
00:54:29,574 --> 00:54:33,273
That must be why she asked you to send him back alive!

766
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,084
That is...

767
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:37,713
She has committed an unpardonable sin.

768
00:54:37,713 --> 00:54:40,649
She deserves to be executed, Your Majesty.

769
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:43,253
But she is the Queen of the late King...

770
00:54:43,253 --> 00:54:44,953
and the mother of Prince Geon Mu.

771
00:54:44,953 --> 00:54:47,759
That is why her sin is even graver.

772
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:50,058
Your Majesty!

773
00:54:54,904 --> 00:54:57,134
I will pay for the sin...

774
00:54:57,134 --> 00:54:59,368
the Queen has committed!

775
00:55:00,203 --> 00:55:02,838
Please execute me instead!

776
00:55:02,874 --> 00:55:05,638
- Father... - Let go of me!

777
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:11,249
I was never enough as a father...

778
00:55:11,753 --> 00:55:13,914
to have a blessed daughter like her.

779
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:15,949
She is my daughter...

780
00:55:16,084 --> 00:55:18,223
before she is the Queen.

781
00:55:18,223 --> 00:55:21,259
I will pay for her sin as her father!

782
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,558
Please be understanding, Your Majesty!

783
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:28,699
Mother...

784
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:32,269
Your Majesty!

785
00:55:41,243 --> 00:55:42,713
We will be able to reach Adan Fortress...

786
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:44,409
when the day breaks if we keep moving at night.

787
00:55:45,713 --> 00:55:47,824
We cannot fight against them without getting any sleep.

788
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:49,578
We should move as fast as we can...

789
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:52,588
so that the soldiers can take a nap at least.

790
00:55:53,124 --> 00:55:54,463
How is the security around Adan Fortress?

791
00:55:54,463 --> 00:55:57,164
The security at the north and the west gate are the heaviest.

792
00:55:57,164 --> 00:55:58,463
Then the advance party...

793
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,788
should infiltrate through the waterway underneath the east gate.

794
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:02,833
As soon as we take down the gate,

795
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:05,229
we will force our way into its headquarters.

796
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,674
General Woo,

797
00:56:06,674 --> 00:56:09,473
Jin, and General Sa. Please take care of the rest.

798
00:56:09,473 --> 00:56:10,798
- Yes, Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness.

799
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:29,659
The soldiers are watching.

800
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:31,788
That is why I am leaning on you.

801
00:56:32,463 --> 00:56:36,263
I want them to think that we are very much in love,

802
00:56:36,263 --> 00:56:39,669
so that they will be full of fighting spirit.

803
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:42,199
Ga Jin.

804
00:56:42,404 --> 00:56:45,308
You are smart and good at what you do,

805
00:56:46,513 --> 00:56:49,439
but you can be silly sometimes.

806
00:56:51,253 --> 00:56:53,909
I have been thinking.

807
00:56:54,013 --> 00:56:55,054
About what?

808
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:57,554
I think our first child should be a girl to help me with house chores.

809
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:59,394
And then we could have boys.

810
00:56:59,394 --> 00:57:01,364
Since the youngest is the cutest,

811
00:57:01,364 --> 00:57:02,463
let us have a daughter.

812
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,334
You are too ahead of yourself.

813
00:57:04,334 --> 00:57:06,733
We are already very much in love.

814
00:57:06,733 --> 00:57:08,699
We just need to take the next step.

815
00:57:31,854 --> 00:57:33,924
Oh, look. Look over there!

816
00:57:33,924 --> 00:57:35,858
Hurry! Come!

817
00:57:36,793 --> 00:57:38,693
It is wild ginseng!

818
00:57:38,693 --> 00:57:40,189
Come over here!

819
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:44,868
A wild ginseng that tastes like bellflower root?

820
00:57:45,904 --> 00:57:49,199
Quiet. If I say it is wild ginseng, then it is wild ginseng.

821
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:53,909
Wow, look at this.

822
00:57:55,414 --> 00:57:56,638
Here.

823
00:57:58,614 --> 00:58:00,409
Have some wild ginseng and cheer up.

824
00:58:06,293 --> 00:58:08,259
Do not be afraid, Dal.

825
00:58:09,693 --> 00:58:12,358
I am not afraid of anything because I am with you.

826
00:58:12,493 --> 00:58:15,028
Once we retake Adan Fortress tomorrow,

827
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:18,098
let us leave right away...

828
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:20,469
after putting Jin and Pung Gae in charge.

829
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:22,298
I know.

830
00:58:25,074 --> 00:58:26,868
I know that tomorrow...

831
00:58:27,614 --> 00:58:29,538
will be the last time to use my father's sword.

832
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:44,293
Are you well-prepared for war?

833
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:48,003
Yes, Your Majesty. We have enough weapons and war horses.

834
00:58:48,003 --> 00:58:50,664
And the soldiers are in high morale.

835
00:58:50,664 --> 00:58:54,499
Once you give us your command, we can set off immediately.

836
00:58:54,904 --> 00:58:57,499
It is different from what I heard.

837
00:58:57,773 --> 00:58:59,043
I heard that...

838
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:01,644
you cornered them without mercy...

839
00:59:01,644 --> 00:59:04,078
and made them resent you.

840
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:07,924
You have also killed an officer at the armory.

841
00:59:07,924 --> 00:59:10,179
I must sacrifice the lesser...

842
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:12,618
for the greater good.

843
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:18,259
You put great importance on the greater good,

844
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:21,729
but you are wavered by your personal feelings.

845
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:27,969
I do not understand.

846
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:33,808
General Go is deeply...

847
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,679
in love with Princess Pyeonggang.

848
00:59:39,154 --> 00:59:40,713
In love?

849
00:59:40,713 --> 00:59:42,424
General Go is strongly determined...

850
00:59:42,424 --> 00:59:44,594
to destroy Goguryeo...

851
00:59:44,594 --> 00:59:47,719
so that he can have Princess Pyeonggang.

852
00:59:47,763 --> 00:59:50,058
That is his only reason.

853
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:55,533
You have blessed us with your grace,

854
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:58,298
and now we are living a decent life.

855
00:59:58,503 --> 01:00:00,904
To repay your kindness,

856
01:00:00,904 --> 01:00:03,899
I am telling you this out of my loyalty to you...

857
01:00:03,973 --> 01:00:07,568
when war is just around the corner.

858
01:00:08,144 --> 01:00:09,909
This is outrageous!

859
01:00:09,914 --> 01:00:11,979
I do not know who told you that,

860
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:15,618
but I am sure it is a trick to slander me.

861
01:00:17,054 --> 01:00:20,818
Then are you saying...

862
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:23,689
you have no feelings left for Pyeonggang at all?

863
01:00:29,263 --> 01:00:30,729
When we were young,

864
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:34,739
I taught her martial arts.

865
01:00:35,703 --> 01:00:36,939
But...

866
01:00:38,314 --> 01:00:41,308
the royal household and my family were deeply ill-fated.

867
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:45,108
We ended up becoming enemies.

868
01:00:47,513 --> 01:00:50,649
What about the royal wedding that got canceled?

869
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:55,094
You were a strong candidate as the king's son-in-law,

870
01:00:55,094 --> 01:00:58,888
but Princess Pyeonggang chose On Dal instead.

871
01:01:00,263 --> 01:01:04,098
As a man, you must hold a deep grudge against her.

872
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:06,374
But you insist that you have no feelings left for her,

873
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:08,368
so I will believe your words.

874
01:01:08,904 --> 01:01:12,409
But you will not have the authority to command the army.

875
01:01:12,943 --> 01:01:14,273
Your Majesty, that means...

876
01:01:14,273 --> 01:01:18,509
I will entrust you with a more important duty next time.

877
01:01:21,013 --> 01:01:24,788
Then who will command the army?

878
01:01:29,763 --> 01:01:32,288
I will go myself.

879
01:01:33,793 --> 01:01:35,333
It is too dangerous, Your Majesty.

880
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:37,002
There is someone...

881
01:01:37,003 --> 01:01:39,729
I wish to fight on the battlefield.

882
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:44,169
That is why I am going to Adan Fortress.

883
01:01:44,203 --> 01:01:46,043
You are going to Adan Fortress?

884
01:01:46,043 --> 01:01:49,739
The soldiers of Goguryeo are coming to attack Adan Fortress.

885
01:01:51,914 --> 01:01:53,249
On Dal...

886
01:01:53,713 --> 01:01:55,949
and Princess Pyeonggang are coming together.

887
01:01:56,824 --> 01:01:58,493
Do you understand it now?

888
01:01:58,493 --> 01:02:00,554
If you want to prove that you have no feelings for the Princess,

889
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:03,588
you must stay out of this battle.

890
01:02:26,783 --> 01:02:30,219
Why? Are you here...

891
01:02:31,824 --> 01:02:33,649
to see how ruined I am?

892
01:02:33,953 --> 01:02:37,493
You will get another chance.

893
01:02:37,493 --> 01:02:39,388
There is no such thing!

894
01:02:40,394 --> 01:02:42,058
There is no next time.

895
01:02:43,064 --> 01:02:44,459
Do not...

896
01:02:45,574 --> 01:02:47,429
talk to me about chances.

897
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,509
You can yell at me...

898
01:02:59,084 --> 01:03:00,679
and get angry.

899
01:03:03,124 --> 01:03:05,388
I will tolerate everything.

900
01:03:29,513 --> 01:03:32,348
(Adan Fortress)

901
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:56,499
General On!

902
01:03:58,644 --> 01:04:01,909
General, the advance party tore down the east gate.

903
01:04:03,144 --> 01:04:04,914
Before their main force blocks the gate,

904
01:04:04,914 --> 01:04:06,709
we need to enter the fortress.

905
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:12,023
Are you here to live?

906
01:04:12,023 --> 01:04:14,094
- We are here to win! - We are here to win!

907
01:04:14,094 --> 01:04:16,924
Are you going to lose and die?

908
01:04:16,924 --> 01:04:19,933
- We will win and live! - We will win and live!

909
01:04:19,933 --> 01:04:22,399
Warriors of Goguryeo.

910
01:04:23,503 --> 01:04:25,328
Let us march forward!

911
01:05:53,594 --> 01:05:55,093
(River Where the Moon Rises)

912
01:05:55,094 --> 01:05:56,094
As a man of Goguryeo,

913
01:05:56,094 --> 01:05:57,663
I cannot abandon the land of Goguryeo.

914
01:05:57,663 --> 01:05:59,264
I am going to fight until the last man standing.

915
01:05:59,264 --> 01:06:00,833
The King of Silla is here to fight himself.

916
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:02,603
It is meaningless to go on with this fight.

917
01:06:02,603 --> 01:06:03,804
Whether we win or lose,

918
01:06:03,804 --> 01:06:06,129
I must fight until the end. That is my fate as a general.

919
01:06:06,134 --> 01:06:08,002
I know you.

920
01:06:08,003 --> 01:06:10,373
A princess of an empire hid a dagger...

921
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:12,269
and infiltrated deep into the enemy's camp?

922
01:06:12,313 --> 01:06:14,574
The Princess was captured by the Silla soldiers.

923
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:17,178
You only think of the Princess even in the end.

924
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:21,724
Have you loved me at all?

925
01:06:21,724 --> 01:06:23,454
I loved you.

926
01:06:23,454 --> 01:06:26,019
- Dal! - No!

927
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:27,419
Dal!
