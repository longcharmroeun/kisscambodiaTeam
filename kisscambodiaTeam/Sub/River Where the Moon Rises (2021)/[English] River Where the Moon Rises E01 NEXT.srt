00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:07,432
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:09,257
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,952
EPISODE 1

4
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:53,363
Dal. Wait for me.

5
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:05,303
Hang in there, until I come.

6
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:53,613
Dal.

7
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,303
Ga Jin.

8
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:20,942
I miss you.

9
00:03:57,013 --> 00:04:00,143
Dal. Dal.

10
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:09,852
We won.

11
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,222
By fighting to the death.

12
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,393
You should have waited.

13
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:17,532
You are so stupid.

14
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:22,833
Ga Jin.

15
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:25,842
You are my Goguryeo.

16
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:28,713
You are my nation.

17
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:37,422
Thank you for staying alive.

18
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:07,612
Your Highness. Where are you going?

19
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:10,482
PRINCESS PYEONGGANG, KING
PYEONGWON'S ELDEST DAUGHTER

20
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:31,873
GOGURYEO'S PYEONGYANG CASTLE,
561A.D., 3RD YEAR OF KING PYEONGWON

21
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:40,242
Come on!

22
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:45,083
Is that even right?

23
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:48,393
How dare a servant act like
he rules Father's nation?

24
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:51,162
Watch what you say, Princess.

25
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:53,193
Are you not even angry, Mother?

26
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:54,563
Then what?

27
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,532
Must I shed blood?

28
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:26,422
They want their new tribe...

29
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:32,232
to have exclusive rights
to salt for eternity?

30
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:34,873
The exclusive rights to salt...

31
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:38,742
is what the Five Tribes live on.

32
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,643
That is true, Your Majesty.

33
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:45,213
It would be utterly unreasonable
to take back the rights now.

34
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:48,383
Please be understanding.

35
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:54,123
So you brought your private army...

36
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,792
to threaten me?

37
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,292
That is not the truth.

38
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:01,292
Shut your mouth.

39
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:09,302
KIM PYEONG JI, DAEDAERO, HEAD OF OFFICE

40
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:34,162
Approve the request, Your Majesty.

41
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:38,802
All of this...

42
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:42,032
was your idea, was it not?

43
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:45,403
Who currently holds the power
that keeps Goguryeo standing?

44
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:48,972
The Jeollo and Sunno Tribes
are defending the borders,

45
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:51,813
and our other three tribes stayed together...

46
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,153
to keep our nation going.

47
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:56,782
Your throne...

48
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,023
only exists because of us.

49
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:04,662
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

50
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:22,273
I must rest.

51
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:26,583
The salt monopoly,

52
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:30,153
I will leave it to you to decide.

53
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:03,052
GO SANG CHEOL, GYERU TRIBE COMMANDER

54
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:32,343
I will patrol our land as planned.

55
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:33,613
PATROLLING WAS A MEANS
OF SURVEYING THE LAND.

56
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:37,523
Is that truly the only way?

57
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,692
If we let the Five Tribes
continue to have their way,

58
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:43,523
it will threaten the royal household.

59
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:49,932
Princess.

60
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,103
Why did you sneak in here like a mouse?

61
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,442
It is just that...

62
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,843
I missed out on the timing to greet you.

63
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:02,912
I came out of concern for Father.

64
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:07,282
I will go and catch a real mouse.

65
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:08,483
Princess.

66
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:13,253
I apologize.

67
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:41,912
The king is like a glass bowl.

68
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:46,523
If you so much as touch his jealous spirit,

69
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:48,523
he will shatter easily.

70
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:50,893
ROYAL CONSORT JIN, KING
PYEONGWON'S CONCUBINE

71
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:56,062
You got to monopolize salt.

72
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,432
What more do you want?

73
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:03,672
His queen is egging him on.

74
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:06,802
She insists on going on patrol
in these circumstances...

75
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,773
because she has a plan.

76
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:12,843
The Jeollo Tribe's heroine.

77
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:17,212
She may be young, but we
must not take her lightly.

78
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,153
Are you jealous because
she is younger than you?

79
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:29,332
Hide this in the queen's chambers
after she leaves on patrol.

80
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:32,633
What is this?

81
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,503
A talisman that will make you queen.

82
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:38,103
The current queen is young and healthy.

83
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:41,513
I would not dare dream of replacing her.

84
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:47,513
Who knows what could happen
while she is on patrol?

85
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,542
What are you doing here, Your Highness?

86
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:19,182
Where were you the whole day?

87
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:28,952
I could use a ruler and still
not be as accurate as you.

88
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,922
It does not show, so do not worry.

89
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:34,133
Mice keep sneaking into the palace.

90
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:36,993
I shall have the maids catch them.

91
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,133
Should I let loose some cats?

92
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,873
They will be hard to catch.

93
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:43,302
They are really nasty.

94
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,702
- Pardon?
- Bring my training outfit.

95
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,712
Your Highness.

96
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:51,712
Why do you want to train
in pointless martial arts?

97
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:53,542
Not that again.

98
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,812
Is it because a woman cannot be king?

99
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:58,723
- Of course not.
- You are wrong.

100
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:02,523
I will follow in my father's
footsteps and become ruler.

101
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:10,863
Slicing with the blade comes later.

102
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:12,662
Gather your strength.

103
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,973
You must see but not look,

104
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:28,853
and hear but not listen for
your family to be at peace.

105
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:31,782
I pray that...

106
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:35,153
you return from the patrol safely.

107
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,763
You are trying to run
when you cannot even walk.

108
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:48,873
- Master Go.
- Yes, Your Highness.

109
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:52,143
Did you hear about the salt monopoly?

110
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:55,912
And that the Five Tribes threatened the king?

111
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:57,582
Concentrate on your training.

112
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:01,052
It is possible that in the near future,

113
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:07,422
I might get to meet your father.

114
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:11,822
That will make us sworn enemies.

115
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:13,863
That will not happen.

116
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:16,393
I am Go Geon, Gyeru Tribe's first in line,

117
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,562
and I will loyally serve your family.

118
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:21,503
What if you must choose between...

119
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,143
the royal household and your tribe?

120
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:26,042
I do not care for either.

121
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:30,013
Because I will choose you.

122
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:58,572
Won. While I am on patrol,

123
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:00,743
you must be well.

124
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:03,013
I want to go with you.

125
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:04,843
We are not going for enjoyment.

126
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,552
- Here.
- A sweet snack?

127
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,052
We will only be gone a few days.

128
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:18,763
Can you wait?

129
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:21,493
- You must come home quick.
- I will.

130
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:27,973
Let us go.

131
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,032
I sent my carrier pigeon.

132
00:15:58,403 --> 00:15:59,733
A carrier pigeon?

133
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,432
You are concerned for your queen's safety.

134
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:04,542
Did you think I would not notice?

135
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,973
If anything untoward is to happen,
we will hear of it immediately.

136
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:15,782
Then you will hear of
it in due time yourself.

137
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:20,223
Before visiting her native Jeollo Tribe,

138
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:22,653
she said she would visit the Sunno Tribe.

139
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:25,422
The Sunno Tribe?

140
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:28,893
Are you saying...

141
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,832
she went to see General On Hyeop?

142
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:49,753
SUNNO TRIBE BORDER

143
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,493
ON HYEOP, SUNNO TRIBE CHIEF

144
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:06,303
SUNNO: ONE OF THE FIVE TRIBES,
DEFENDS THE JEOLLA BORDER

145
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:13,742
Move faster!

146
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:18,583
You should have attended
the Five Tribe meeting.

147
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:21,353
I do not care for pathetic political games.

148
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:24,682
But our tribe always lags in the back.

149
00:17:24,682 --> 00:17:26,182
Do not be silly.

150
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:29,793
Guarding the southern border...

151
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:31,962
is our tribe's greatest duty.

152
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:33,893
Yes, sir.

153
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:38,762
General!

154
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:41,502
General!

155
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,643
General. I have terrible news.

156
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:49,813
Your treasured sword is missing.

157
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:58,252
You will get squashed by it
before you get to wield it.

158
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,522
I must be able to lift
it to be a great general.

159
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:02,893
You should put it back before you get caught.

160
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,522
Go and bring a wooden sword instead.

161
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,192
You cannot beat me with that.

162
00:18:07,222 --> 00:18:09,593
- Do not fall over.
- Come at me.

163
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:13,333
Hey, hey!

164
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:18,073
Hey, you. My gosh.

165
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:23,843
What are you doing?

166
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:43,232
Before you learn how to take a life,

167
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,732
you must learn how to save one.

168
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,982
This is not any fun.

169
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:01,353
It is training required to defend the border.

170
00:19:01,883 --> 00:19:03,653
It is not for fun.

171
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:07,422
I can do this when the time
comes. It is not hard anyway.

172
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:09,293
Go and grab a rope.

173
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:11,922
If you can hang on until I reach the top,

174
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:14,692
this sword...

175
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,962
- I will give it to you.
- Are you serious?

176
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:29,373
General. Do you think Dal can manage?

177
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:32,412
Ignore him even if he asks for help.

178
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:43,893
Hey.

179
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:53,833
Oh, dear.

180
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,873
Do not give up!

181
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,512
If you give up,

182
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:04,373
your father and your comrade loses his life.

183
00:20:09,553 --> 00:20:12,883
A man's life is in your hands.

184
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:17,992
Oh, dear.

185
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,662
Do not come closer!

186
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:27,803
I can do this. I will do it on my own!

187
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,043
Hold on!

188
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,452
General, are you all right?

189
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,022
Father!

190
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:47,722
General.

191
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:51,123
Father.

192
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:13,843
Your father just died.

193
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:33,863
Bury it.

194
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:00,662
Where are we, Father?

195
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,863
It looks like a grave.

196
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:05,533
Later.

197
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:09,573
I will tell you later.

198
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:12,603
When you are ready to be a true fighter.

199
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:31,492
Father.

200
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:38,063
I am sorry for what I did...

201
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,393
The queen sent him.

202
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:05,063
- The queen?
- Yes.

203
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:08,732
She's headed to our tribe to meet you.

204
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:12,202
She should arrive around dawn tomorrow.

205
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,783
Mother.

206
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:29,653
Who is the strongest person in our nation?

207
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:33,482
By that, do you mean power...

208
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:36,293
or military training and capability?

209
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:39,962
I am asking if anyone can beat Gochuga.

210
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:42,893
You mean Gyeru Tribe's Go Won Pyo?

211
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:43,962
Yes.

212
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:47,762
The man who brought his private
army to threaten Father.

213
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,043
A little further up is a
temple called Yibullansa.

214
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:55,843
Famed for his skills, General Son...

215
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:58,543
I mean, Wol Gwang lives there.

216
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:02,682
A monk? Can a monk beat Gochuga?

217
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:06,182
Before he became a monk, he
was Jeollo's greatest fighter.

218
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:10,192
You are from the Jeollo Tribe, Mother.

219
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:14,192
Let us drop by. I would like to meet him.

220
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,232
It is very late.

221
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:19,732
You should sleep.

222
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:04,143
Well done, General Son.

223
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:14,653
So, with this sword,

224
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:18,293
you beheaded the leader of
the Gokturks that invaded?

225
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:20,462
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:01,432
You must forget such dreadful rumors.

227
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:03,133
Rumors?

228
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,702
12 years ago,

229
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:09,912
you married the young queen.

230
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:13,742
Less than eight months
later, the princess was born.

231
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:19,123
It just so happened, that winter,
Jeollo Tribe's General Son...

232
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:22,853
resigned from his station to become a monk.

233
00:26:24,093 --> 00:26:27,863
Do you dare voice doubt
about the princess' heritage?

234
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:30,833
Your queen is so young and beautiful.

235
00:26:31,563 --> 00:26:35,232
That must make you anxious.

236
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:51,783
A woman's love runs strong and deep.

237
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:55,623
Even if she tries to hide it,

238
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,393
it is bound to leave a trace.

239
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:12,472
A carrier pigeon arrived
from the patrol party.

240
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:14,643
The queen...

241
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:17,343
went to the temple Yibullansa.

242
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:23,313
Wol Gwang. That is where he is.

243
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:40,262
I found it!

244
00:27:55,613 --> 00:27:58,383
A talisman that will make you queen.

245
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:14,033
You left the troubled world behind,

246
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:18,133
and I am left alone in sorrow.

247
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:21,242
YIBULLANSA

248
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:27,783
We are separated by 120km,

249
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:37,393
but our hearts are just 10cm apart.

250
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:43,162
THE SUNNO TRIBE

251
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:47,162
I run to you ever single moment.

252
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:51,633
My lover, my master.

253
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:00,583
You must relax.

254
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,482
I will kill them.

255
00:29:02,553 --> 00:29:04,712
The immoral witch and scum both!

256
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:07,583
Your queen gave you a son.

257
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:10,022
How would killing her make you look?

258
00:29:11,153 --> 00:29:12,692
I do not care.

259
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:15,793
I will kill them both myself.

260
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:20,133
Then...

261
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,502
will you leave it to me, Your Majesty?

262
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:38,182
Greetings, Your Highness. I am On Hyeop.

263
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,153
You may stand, General.

264
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:49,762
As of now, the man
stronger than Go Won Pyo...

265
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,603
is General On Hyeop who stands before us.

266
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:15,686
Are you curious about my sword?

267
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:20,156
You are the strongest general in Goguryeo.

268
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:23,196
So I want to know what kind of sword you use.

269
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:26,665
I am sorry.

270
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:29,735
I used to have a sword that was
much more precious than this one.

271
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:34,536
But it broke, so I cannot show it to you.

272
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:37,575
That is a pity. I wanted to see it.

273
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:46,145
I advise you to stay away from swords.

274
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:49,356
It is okay. I am going to become a ruler.

275
00:30:51,825 --> 00:30:52,926
I am proud to hear that.

276
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:58,066
When that day comes, that sword
will be used to protect you.

277
00:30:58,965 --> 00:30:59,965
Princess.

278
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,755
You want us to dispatch our troops?

279
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:32,096
Go Won Pyo keeps looking
down on the royal family.

280
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:36,335
Sooner or later, he will
try to take over the throne.

281
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:44,176
But I am just a soldier.

282
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:46,605
I am not interested in politics and power,

283
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:47,915
and I do not know much either.

284
00:31:48,376 --> 00:31:52,085
The king recently banned
the monopolization of salt,

285
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:56,255
but he brought soldiers and
threatened the royal family.

286
00:31:57,686 --> 00:31:59,186
I am not just asking you to
protect the royal family.

287
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:03,025
I am asking you to protect
the people of our country.

288
00:32:05,395 --> 00:32:06,395
She is right.

289
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:09,665
That man, Gochuga, is a horrible man.

290
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:12,005
He told me to keep my mouth shut...

291
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,906
even though I saw everything.

292
00:32:15,406 --> 00:32:17,346
What did you see?

293
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:21,515
I saw him secretly meet up with
Royal Consort Jin a few days ago.

294
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:26,485
She heard about the patrol, and
she told him that right away.

295
00:32:27,086 --> 00:32:28,955
Why are you telling me that now?

296
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:33,556
Mother.

297
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:37,026
Go and wait somewhere else.

298
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:41,366
Did I do something wrong?

299
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:42,695
I told you to go.

300
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,186
I guess princesses also receive scoldings.

301
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:00,286
My father scolds me all the time.

302
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:03,616
Do you want to see this?

303
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:06,485
Is it not great? I carved it myself.

304
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:10,255
If you look here, you can
see the saddle and helmet.

305
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:12,265
I still need to carve this
part a little more though.

306
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:13,265
Get that out of my face.

307
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,836
What is so great about a wood carving?

308
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:21,575
Once I become a ruler, I
will rule the entire cavalry.

309
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,346
How can a princess become a ruler?

310
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,445
How dare you talk to a princess that way?

311
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:29,445
Only a prince can become a ruler.

312
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:31,015
It is a man's job, not a woman's.

313
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:33,415
Says who? What kind of a rule is that?

314
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:36,316
you are a princess, but you
are even stupider than I am.

315
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,586
- What is your name?
- Why?

316
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:41,496
I will teach you a lesson as
soon as I become the ruler.

317
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:43,496
You cannot become a ruler
just because you want to.

318
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:44,795
You need to receive
acknowledgement from our people.

319
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:46,325
What is your name?

320
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:49,396
My name is On Dal, the future
general of this country.

321
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:52,735
Hey!

322
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:12,626
I must go back.

323
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:15,795
If Go Won Pyo asked about the patrol,

324
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:18,265
he definitely would have planned something.

325
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:22,396
Your Majesty, the guards will
not be enough to protect you.

326
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:25,636
I will go to the village
and gather more troops.

327
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:26,935
Please wait until I come back.

328
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:33,105
I will take you to the palace.

329
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:20,526
Father.

330
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:22,826
Guard Her Majesty.

331
00:35:46,115 --> 00:35:47,115
Hurry!

332
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:48,586
Get going!

333
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:49,886
- Please do not kill us.
- Please.

334
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:51,625
- Go!
- Please show us mercy.

335
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:02,365
You have permission to
kill whoever fights back.

336
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:06,006
Arrest all the traitors!

337
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:13,605
What happened to the queen?

338
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:15,646
Tell me what happened!

339
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:17,115
What are you talking about?

340
00:36:17,115 --> 00:36:18,886
We are not traitors!

341
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:20,115
What did we do?

342
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:21,115
Shut your mouth!

343
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,355
You expect to stay alive
after having killed the queen?

344
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,125
Take them.

345
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:31,225
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

346
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:32,326
- Get up!
- Come on!

347
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:38,706
They turned us into traitors
so they could get rid of us.

348
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,805
I was a fool.

349
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:45,576
I underestimated Go Won Pyo.

350
00:36:46,646 --> 00:36:49,815
You should go to Yibullansa and hide there.

351
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,286
If you ask the monks for help,

352
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:54,516
they will send a letter to Pyeongyang Castle.

353
00:36:55,185 --> 00:36:56,185
Dal.

354
00:36:56,855 --> 00:37:00,125
I want you to lead the queen and princess.

355
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,696
What? How?

356
00:37:02,826 --> 00:37:03,826
Get to your senses.

357
00:37:04,665 --> 00:37:05,995
This is a life and death situation.

358
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,136
I will stay here.

359
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,636
- Your Majesty.
- Mother.

360
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:14,776
This happened because of me.

361
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:17,706
I cannot leave my people and just run away.

362
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:20,815
- But...
- I will...

363
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:23,315
deal with this.

364
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,415
Leave this place to me.

365
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:31,286
Meanwhile, I want you to follow him.

366
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:34,495
No, I want to stay with you.

367
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:36,495
You are the princess of Goguryeo.

368
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:38,365
Keep your dignity.

369
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:42,235
If anything happens to me, make sure...

370
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:44,565
you tell your father everything.

371
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:47,975
Until then,

372
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,745
this stone will keep you safe.

373
00:37:58,586 --> 00:37:59,745
Mother.

374
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:05,326
Please take good care of the princess.

375
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:11,196
You are the only person who knows the forest.

376
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:16,766
This time, do not ever let go of the rope.

377
00:38:18,435 --> 00:38:19,636
Do you understand?

378
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:21,935
Yes.

379
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:35,955
Princess.

380
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:40,856
Let go.

381
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:52,305
Hurry.

382
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:55,876
Move it!

383
00:38:58,445 --> 00:38:59,445
Go!

384
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:00,845
- My goodness.
- Please show us mercy.

385
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:03,616
- Spare us!
- Stop what you are doing!

386
00:39:06,315 --> 00:39:08,715
- General!
- General!

387
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,026
No one here is a traitor!

388
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,626
What do you think you are doing?

389
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,396
Withdraw your troops right now.

390
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:42,256
Long time no see, Hyeop.

391
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,286
Go Won Pyo.

392
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:46,925
What do you think you are doing?

393
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:49,095
That is what I would like to ask.

394
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:53,226
I thought you left to patrol our land.

395
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:56,095
But I guess your goal was
to conspire against me.

396
00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:38,575
We pledged our alliance to Goguryeo.

397
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:40,805
What made you become so disgraceful?

398
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:44,146
Did you suddenly become greedy for power?

399
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:46,915
You arrogant punk. Get out of my way.

400
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:51,156
I have no interest in you and your tribe.

401
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,085
Go Won Pyo.

402
00:40:55,095 --> 00:40:57,126
Withdraw your troops right now.

403
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:01,195
Do you think you will be able to
get away with killing the queen?

404
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:03,965
Do you not understand?

405
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:09,406
His Majesty was the person who told me...

406
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:12,506
to kill you.

407
00:41:58,455 --> 00:41:59,526
No!

408
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:23,876
Your Majesty.

409
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:35,516
I will not forgive you even after I die.

410
00:43:36,055 --> 00:43:40,585
You will never be able to take over Goguryeo.

411
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:43,695
Goguryeo is...

412
00:43:45,496 --> 00:43:46,825
already mine.

413
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:51,065
Your Majesty!

414
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,175
Your Majesty.

415
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:16,026
If you admit that you are a traitor,

416
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:20,726
I will spare the lives of everyone else.

417
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,106
General.

418
00:44:26,636 --> 00:44:28,976
No, General!

419
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:31,606
- Do not do it!
- No!

420
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:33,406
- General!
- Please do not!

421
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:35,445
General!

422
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:38,715
General!

423
00:44:48,955 --> 00:44:51,665
General, do not!

424
00:45:01,876 --> 00:45:02,876
Princess.

425
00:45:08,276 --> 00:45:11,045
I cannot go. I cannot go alone.

426
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:12,585
How am I supposed to do this?

427
00:45:13,616 --> 00:45:15,185
Then do you just want to die?

428
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:18,986
My father and the queen stayed there
to fight so they could save us.

429
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:20,325
Do you want them to fight in vain?

430
00:45:20,756 --> 00:45:22,555
How can you call yourself
the princess of Goguryeo?

431
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:24,726
I thought you wanted to become the ruler.

432
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:27,366
If you give up now,

433
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:29,435
that will be the end of Goguryeo.

434
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:32,435
Who says I am going to give up?

435
00:45:55,026 --> 00:45:56,026
Keep climbing!

436
00:45:56,425 --> 00:45:57,965
No, get up here!

437
00:45:58,766 --> 00:46:00,465
If you give up now,

438
00:46:01,065 --> 00:46:02,766
that will be the end of Goguryeo.

439
00:46:03,465 --> 00:46:05,136
Get up here!

440
00:46:05,536 --> 00:46:07,106
Just keep climbing!

441
00:46:09,406 --> 00:46:10,876
Keep climbing!

442
00:46:14,616 --> 00:46:15,715
Hey!

443
00:47:40,926 --> 00:47:41,936
Wol Gwang!

444
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:43,996
Where are you hiding, Wol Gwang?

445
00:47:44,436 --> 00:47:46,006
Find Wol Gwang!

446
00:48:03,516 --> 00:48:05,926
Tell me where Wol Gwang is.

447
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:06,926
I do not know.

448
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:12,696
Wol Gwang!

449
00:48:15,196 --> 00:48:19,036
Where are you hiding? Wol
Gwang, where are you hiding?

450
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:23,276
I am going to find you
and rip you into pieces!

451
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:27,375
Mother.

452
00:48:28,045 --> 00:48:30,545
Tell me where Wol Gwang is.

453
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:32,645
I do not know anything. Please spare me.

454
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:05,686
The Princess is missing.

455
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:08,315
Search the area thoroughly.

456
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:39,706
Pyeonggang.

457
00:50:50,385 --> 00:50:52,226
Ga Jin, are you okay?

458
00:50:55,496 --> 00:50:58,125
8 YEARS LATER

459
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,266
Is it clear?

460
00:51:07,706 --> 00:51:08,706
Let us go.

461
00:52:04,426 --> 00:52:05,426
Hey!

462
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:51,236
Who are you?

463
00:52:51,946 --> 00:52:55,645
I heard about a group of weaklings
leeching off the late royal family.

464
00:52:56,545 --> 00:52:58,145
And one of them is right here.

465
00:52:58,585 --> 00:53:00,145
I am here to punish...

466
00:53:00,516 --> 00:53:02,456
the brute of Goguryeo on
behalf of the universe.

467
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:06,926
When they said the group consisted
of mere assassins of low status,

468
00:53:07,325 --> 00:53:08,825
they were talking about you.

469
00:53:26,506 --> 00:53:28,676
I will be drinking your blood tonight.

470
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:32,305
It was the chief's order.

471
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:34,776
We must eradicate every
descendant of Goguryeo.

472
00:54:35,176 --> 00:54:37,875
If you consider yourself as the
best swordswoman of Cheonjubang,

473
00:54:39,016 --> 00:54:40,016
there is no room for mercy.

474
00:54:47,786 --> 00:54:48,795
No!

475
00:54:49,756 --> 00:54:51,865
Ga Jin, what is wrong?
Are you out of your mind?

476
00:54:52,466 --> 00:54:53,466
No, Ga Jin.

477
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:57,266
- Go ahead.
- You too. Stop it.

478
00:54:57,996 --> 00:55:00,036
Ga Jin, you cannot do this.

479
00:55:00,036 --> 00:55:01,936
How will you explain this to the chief?

480
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:44,045
Did you have another nightmare?

481
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:55,895
You already have nightmares.

482
00:55:56,555 --> 00:55:58,966
But when you wake up from
them, you have headaches.

483
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:02,466
How could you live in that state?

484
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:08,236
You have been...

485
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:11,575
having more nightmares lately.

486
00:56:12,276 --> 00:56:15,176
Perhaps, your job is catching up with you.

487
00:56:15,815 --> 00:56:18,585
And that is why you must be
having piercing headaches.

488
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:20,645
You said it was because I had a fever.

489
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:23,516
What?

490
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:25,286
You said I had a fever when I was little.

491
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:26,825
And that is why my brain is messed up.

492
00:56:28,526 --> 00:56:31,055
You said that is why I cannot
remember my past clearly.

493
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,426
Right. Yes.

494
00:56:32,426 --> 00:56:35,895
Gosh. This all happened
because of that darned fever.

495
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,436
Of course. Yes.

496
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:42,405
- Dad.
- Yes?

497
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:46,476
Give me a bit more time.

498
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:49,246
I have something in mind.

499
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:51,276
What is that?

500
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:00,956
I told you to kill every
single person from Goguryeo.

501
00:57:02,026 --> 00:57:04,956
Tae Mo followed my order as my swordsman.

502
00:57:05,196 --> 00:57:07,595
How come you scolded Tae
Mo for following my order?

503
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,565
I believed Cheonjubang was not...

504
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,436
justified to kill a baby.

505
00:57:12,506 --> 00:57:14,666
When that baby is old
enough to wield a sword,

506
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,976
it could have been directed at you and me.

507
00:57:17,506 --> 00:57:21,706
Have you forgotten that our
sworn enemy is Goguryeo?

508
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:23,516
You graciously welcomed my father and me...

509
00:57:23,516 --> 00:57:25,145
when we had nowhere to go...

510
00:57:26,045 --> 00:57:28,085
after losing our family to
the soldiers of Goguryeo.

511
00:57:28,555 --> 00:57:30,155
And I will never forget your kindness.

512
00:57:30,315 --> 00:57:33,986
That is why after being
selected as the swordswoman,

513
00:57:34,526 --> 00:57:38,496
I have followed all of your orders
at the expense of my own life.

514
00:57:39,395 --> 00:57:40,395
However,

515
00:57:44,095 --> 00:57:46,365
I do not wish to see blood anymore.

516
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:51,075
If I could live my life in peace
with my father working with salt,

517
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,145
I would have nothing more to ask for.

518
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:56,176
Please...

519
00:57:57,615 --> 00:57:59,645
give me your blessing...

520
00:58:01,016 --> 00:58:03,055
to stop taking away lives.

521
00:58:19,865 --> 00:58:22,375
It cannot seem to fly when
the door is wide open.

522
00:58:26,476 --> 00:58:28,246
Do you think you can fly?

523
00:58:28,575 --> 00:58:30,145
I am not trying to fly.

524
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:32,916
I am only asking, so I can live my life.

525
00:58:33,486 --> 00:58:35,416
I want to be free of nightmares and pain.

526
00:58:36,385 --> 00:58:37,986
I want to live a peaceful life.

527
00:58:40,286 --> 00:58:41,286
Please...

528
00:58:43,526 --> 00:58:45,295
consider my request.

529
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:52,135
Get up.

530
00:58:55,105 --> 00:58:56,335
In a few days,

531
00:58:57,135 --> 00:59:00,375
the King of Goguryeo will climb
to Cheonjedan at Mount Songhak.

532
00:59:02,845 --> 00:59:05,246
Where are you, my ladies?

533
00:59:05,246 --> 00:59:06,446
Where are you?

534
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:08,045
There you are.

535
00:59:10,516 --> 00:59:12,286
I want you to kill...

536
00:59:12,926 --> 00:59:14,286
the enemy of Cheonjubang,

537
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:16,426
the King of Goguryeo.

538
00:59:19,696 --> 00:59:21,996
I have already come up with
a plan and prepared for it.

539
00:59:22,095 --> 00:59:25,166
You will act as my sword and
stab him. That will be...

540
00:59:25,835 --> 00:59:28,105
your last mission.

541
00:59:28,436 --> 00:59:29,835
"Last"?

542
00:59:30,006 --> 00:59:33,676
That will be the end of
your duty as my swordswoman.

543
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:43,655
Bring death to that man,

544
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:46,825
Pyeongwon.

545
01:00:39,176 --> 01:00:40,905
- Gosh.
- We must have caught something.

546
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:41,976
- We caught it.
- Really?

547
01:00:41,976 --> 01:00:43,746
- We got it.
- Let us hurry.

548
01:00:43,746 --> 01:00:45,016
Hurry up.

549
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,716
- We got it.
- I wonder what we got.

550
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:48,385
- Hurry.
- Let us go.

551
01:00:48,756 --> 01:00:49,885
We got one!

552
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:51,815
- Score.
- We got it.

553
01:00:53,256 --> 01:00:54,726
We got a big one.

554
01:00:55,226 --> 01:00:56,395
It is still alive. Cut them.

555
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:57,456
Cut where?

556
01:00:57,555 --> 01:00:59,426
- Cut the antlers.
- But it is still breathing.

557
01:00:59,426 --> 01:01:00,526
Come on.

558
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:01,926
- Cut them.
- All right.

559
01:01:03,895 --> 01:01:05,506
What? What was that?

560
01:01:05,506 --> 01:01:07,135
- It hurts!
- Who are you?

561
01:01:07,135 --> 01:01:08,736
Who did that?

562
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:18,045
Let go of the deer.

563
01:01:19,315 --> 01:01:22,355
Hey, who do you think you are?

564
01:01:25,055 --> 01:01:26,655
Hey, are you okay?

565
01:01:27,055 --> 01:01:28,125
It hurts, right?

566
01:01:29,196 --> 01:01:30,696
- The deer feels pain too.
- Come here.

567
01:01:30,996 --> 01:01:34,196
Even if animals cannot speak,
they still hate being in pain.

568
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:38,766
Gosh. You are unbelievable.

569
01:01:43,835 --> 01:01:45,976
You are going to get hurt too!

570
01:01:54,486 --> 01:01:55,916
- Hey.
- You little brat.

571
01:02:22,246 --> 01:02:23,276
Sorry.

572
01:02:25,476 --> 01:02:26,845
I really hope in your next life,

573
01:02:28,085 --> 01:02:29,786
you will be a human.

574
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,926
When you do, do not be awful like them.

575
01:02:35,825 --> 01:02:36,825
Be good.

576
01:02:50,575 --> 01:02:51,575
Gosh.

577
01:03:06,286 --> 01:03:07,686
No need to thank me.

578
01:03:10,055 --> 01:03:11,055
Hey.

579
01:03:16,395 --> 01:03:18,036
You cannot leave just yet.

580
01:03:36,516 --> 01:03:37,786
What are you doing?

581
01:03:46,726 --> 01:03:47,825
I know you.

582
01:03:53,905 --> 01:03:55,365
I know you.
