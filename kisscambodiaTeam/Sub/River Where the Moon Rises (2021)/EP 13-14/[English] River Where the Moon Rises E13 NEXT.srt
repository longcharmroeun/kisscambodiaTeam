00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:12,991
EPISODE 13

4
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,979
50,000 Northern Zhou men attacked
and broke through Liaodong Fortress,

5
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,420
and then they felled Baekam Fortress.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,889
The main army is moving south
quickly to cross the Paesu.

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,500
It has only been a few years
since we vowed to stay friendly...

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,159
and help each other.

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,500
But they raised an army against us?

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,469
You must focus on your health...

11
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:42,899
Our border was penetrated...

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,670
and you want me to lie in bed?

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,180
Gochuga, what do you think?

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,180
First of all,

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,110
you must summon all the
men who serve Daemodal...

16
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,019
and the Five Bu soldiers of the Central Army.

17
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,089
I agree with you.

18
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:02,060
Also, the Five Tribes'
private army should also...

19
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,759
prepare to fight.

20
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,229
Your Majesty.

21
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,759
The longer we drag this on,

22
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:10,529
the more disadvantageous it will be.

23
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,729
We must gather my men and yours...

24
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:16,470
to defeat the enemy before
they cross the Paesu.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,040
You should reconsider going to war.

26
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:28,649
It is the King's duty.

27
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:31,949
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,359
- General Go!
- What is it?

29
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,460
The Northern Zhou has invaded our border.

30
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,899
Then we are at war?

31
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,339
Yes. Gochuga commands you
to gather your army...

32
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:49,639
and return quickly.

33
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,050
What your scout reported.
What was that about?

34
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,320
Princess. If you are that curious,
return with me to the palace.

35
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,389
Master Go.

36
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,859
The Northern Zhou army crossed the border...

37
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,660
and are headed south toward the Paesu.

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,100
THE PAESU: THE RIVER SERVING
AS THE BORDER TO CHINA

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,769
- I heard that.
- Also,

40
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,470
the King will lead the army himself.

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,669
Do you get that?

42
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,410
In times like these,

43
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,840
this is not where you should be.

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,679
I decide where I must be.

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,220
Since I am here with my men,

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,750
I could decide for you.

47
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,060
Hey.

48
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,389
What are you threatening her with this time?

49
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,500
Do not rejoice that you survived.

50
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,500
Your death was only postponed.

51
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,900
You and your tribe will
eventually be suppressed.

52
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,440
You punk.

53
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,340
We have no time for this.

54
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,709
We must go.

55
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:01,739
Hurry!

56
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:02,739
Yes, General.

57
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,009
Hurry!

58
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,120
You cannot go to war.

59
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,190
You only managed to
recover from your illness.

60
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,859
You cannot go to war like this.

61
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:16,929
Please change your mind.

62
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,590
The Crown Prince will accompany me.

63
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,600
Crown Prince.

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,199
The five fortresses to
the north of the Paesu.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,000
The fortresses and camps...

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,940
that stretch across Liaodong, I built myself.

67
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,509
This fight is to protect that land.

68
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,280
I shall willingly fight
alongside you, Father.

69
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:36,679
Good.

70
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,620
Will Prince Geon Mu rise to the throne?

71
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,320
Your prince has the fortune to become...

72
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,859
a king one day.

73
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,630
Are you sure about that?

74
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,400
I swear that on my life.

75
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,139
Since you have decided to go to war,

76
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,910
there is nothing I can do to stop you.

77
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,150
I wish that you return safely, Crown Prince.

78
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,720
Do not worry.

79
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:17,950
My goodness.

80
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:21,660
Me, go to war at this age?

81
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,960
Lord Hae, why did you not say anything?

82
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,059
The King himself said he will...

83
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,059
lead his men into battle in his frail state.

84
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,499
When we are at war, we of the Five Tribes...

85
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:35,900
cannot just try to save our skin.

86
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,309
War is a crisis,

87
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,479
but it also serves as an opportunity to...

88
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,679
eliminate concerns inside and out.

89
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,020
The skies have blessed Goguryeo.

90
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,030
Do you wish to go to war?

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,999
It is a small number,

92
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,530
but we have enough men to form an army.

93
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,040
And we also have weapons.

94
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,010
So we raise the Sunno flag...

95
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,910
and go to battle?

96
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,580
This is an opportunity from on high.

97
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,609
If we gain victory,

98
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,850
the King will willingly agree
to reinstate the Sunno Tribe.

99
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,489
What do you say, General?

100
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,960
If you give the order,

101
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,030
I will take my men and fight.

102
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,559
Yes, Father. The time has come.

103
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,760
We should fight.

104
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,340
Hey. Why are you so quiet?

105
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,270
Well...

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,369
Fighting to protect the village...

107
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,080
is completely different from going to war.

108
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,780
Once we set out with our
men, we cannot stop...

109
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,850
nor turn back.

110
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,679
Are you backing down because you are afraid?

111
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,619
Dal. If the Northern Zhou
manages to come down south,

112
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,419
we will no longer be safe here.

113
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:02,819
This is for Goguryeo, but it is also...

114
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,760
to protect the village.

115
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,460
If General On were here,

116
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,069
he would have gone to fight.

117
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
We need you.

118
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,010
We leave at daybreak.

119
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,809
Set off first with 500 men.

120
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,350
You must secure an area south
of the Paesu for our camp.

121
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,489
We will leave as soon as we are ready.

122
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,290
The Princess. Did you see her?

123
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,359
Yes.

124
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,330
She will have armed the Sunno Tribe,

125
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,770
along with On Hyeop's son.

126
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,200
This is just my guess,

127
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,309
but I have a feeling the
Sunno Tribe will join the war.

128
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,350
I see.

129
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,350
I did not think of that.

130
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,189
They will try to use the
war to regain their honor.

131
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:09,989
That is it.

132
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,729
Do not take them lightly.

133
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:13,929
General On's son...

134
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,499
was an immature fool.

135
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,999
He has become a strong fighter.

136
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:23,100
The bloodline of the defeated
leads only to more defeats.

137
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,169
Geon.

138
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,879
You must remind him of his fate.

139
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
I will.

140
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,640
Are you curious about my sword?

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,510
I am sorry.

142
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:00,169
I used to have a sword that was
much more precious than this one.

143
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,239
But it broke, so I cannot show it to you.

144
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:05,650
I advise you to stay away from swords.

145
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,749
It is okay. I am going to become a ruler.

146
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,350
I am proud to hear that.

147
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:17,530
When that day comes, that sword
will be used to protect you.

148
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,760
You should tell your mother.

149
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,199
That you are leaving to war.

150
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,069
This was General On's armor.

151
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,380
He wore it when he went to battle.

152
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,910
I prayed to the skies and spirits...

153
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:14,219
that the day you wear it would never come.

154
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:18,650
It cannot be helped now. Our
nation is about to be ruined.

155
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:24,329
General On will protect you.

156
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,260
Believe that.

157
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I will.

158
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,770
I am sure the thread will follow the needle.

159
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,740
Do not worry too much.

160
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:46,110
Dal and I will return safely.

161
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,250
You should go.

162
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,419
Every moment counts.

163
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,589
How did you fall in love in times like these?

164
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,380
Why are you here when you must
be busy with preparations?

165
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,620
I did not come to ask you
to pray for my safety.

166
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,449
PRAYERS WERE SAID SO MEN
WOULD RETURN FROM WAR SAFELY.

167
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:24,750
We are at war,

168
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:28,660
and you will send a secret letter to Silla.

169
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
Write exactly what I say.

170
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,770
"Goguryeo's main army fights
against Northern Zhou,"

171
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,969
"but they do not neglect
security to the Silla border."

172
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,110
"Do not use the war..."

173
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,209
"as an excuse to attack rashly."

174
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,510
Write that.

175
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:59,250
Are you commanding me to betray Silla?

176
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,449
I am...

177
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,230
helping your king to not make a bad decision.

178
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,360
If my letter is exposed as a lie,

179
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,530
my life will be threatened.

180
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,770
You achieved a lot so far as a spy.

181
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,069
They will not harm you easily.

182
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:16,799
I would rather you cut me down.

183
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,709
That way, there will be no backlash.

184
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,910
I have no intention of doing that.

185
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Because...

186
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:32,919
you will do as I say.

187
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,459
Do not be so sure of that.

188
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,400
I am not your woman.

189
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,699
I will contribute greatly
to our victory and return.

190
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:48,699
I hope you will welcome me then.

191
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,209
You think you are great to the very end.

192
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,319
That is what I am truly like.

193
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,760
I hope you do not get hurt.

194
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:29,839
What is it?

195
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:31,809
Nothing.

196
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:35,219
Here.

197
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:38,419
It is a signal pouch with colored powder.

198
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:39,790
A signal pouch?

199
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,189
If you are in danger,

200
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,760
tie it to an arrow and shoot.

201
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,459
Then I can see even from far away.

202
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,130
I doubt I will need it.

203
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:50,329
I will always be next to you even in battle.

204
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,770
How do you manage to crack jokes?

205
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,370
Northern Zhou or Goguryeo,

206
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,309
I know nothing about all that,

207
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,280
nor do I care.

208
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:05,349
I only...

209
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,719
fight for you.

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,699
I will protect you too.

211
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:31,410
At your side.

212
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,610
50,000 Northern Zhou men
are camped across the Paesu.

213
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,809
They are transporting
wood to cross the river.

214
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:10,780
Do we have 30,000 men?

215
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,049
20,000 more will join us within days.

216
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,650
It is worth a fight.

217
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,319
The problem is Northern
Zhou's Mercenary Army.

218
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,120
The Mercenary Army?

219
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,929
You mean their special forces
made up of foreign barbarians?

220
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,730
I heard they are vicious beyond imagination.

221
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,199
My scouts say...

222
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,370
they are detouring around the
front away from the main army.

223
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
I believe...

224
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,270
they plan to cross this plain.

225
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,439
They plan to delay...

226
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:42,280
the 20,000 men on the way to join us.

227
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,049
While they distract our rear,

228
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:47,449
the main army will cross the Paesu.

229
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,319
If their main army of
50,000 attacks our 30,000,

230
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,419
do you think we stand a chance?

231
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:54,620
Lord Jin.

232
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,630
I would like to send General Go Geon...

233
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,000
and my elite troop to the plain.

234
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,360
They can stop the Mercenary Army...

235
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,370
and protect our main army's rear.

236
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:06,770
- General Go.
- Yes, Sire.

237
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,669
It is a hard and important fight...

238
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,140
that will decide the outcome of our battle.

239
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:12,839
Leave it to me.

240
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,110
Barbarian blood will flow like a river.

241
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,069
I must leave for the plains soon.

242
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,669
You were right.

243
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,809
The Sunno Tribe seems to want to fight.

244
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,380
Really?

245
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,110
You are up against a vicious army,

246
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,049
which you also cannot guarantee victory.

247
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,880
So I sent a secret message to the Princess.

248
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,419
What do you mean?

249
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,559
"The King showed favor to you traitors."

250
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,189
"The Sunno Tribe is to
go to Pyeongsa Plain..."

251
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,730
"and stop Northern Zhou's Mercenary Army."

252
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,329
That is what my letter says.

253
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,770
They are a rag-tag bunch with very few men.

254
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,199
How could they...

255
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,270
You sent them...

256
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:21,640
to their death.

257
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:23,809
"Borrow one's strength to win."

258
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:27,679
TO USE SOMEONE TO TAKE OUT ANOTHER.

259
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,849
The traitors will be eliminated
at the hands of the barbarians.

260
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,319
They will stall the barbarians
until you get there,

261
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,760
and most likely weaken their force.

262
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,059
At the end of that fight,

263
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,660
you just have to return victoriously.

264
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,329
Father.

265
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:46,500
The Princess is among them.

266
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,669
I already gave you a chance,

267
00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:51,110
but you failed to persuade her.

268
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,510
Whether she chooses to live or die...

269
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,939
is up to the Princess now.

270
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:08,089
This does not make sense.

271
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,260
We cannot fight 1,000 men with just 300.

272
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,559
And the Mercenary Army is
Northern Zhou's strongest army.

273
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,369
I have also heard of the Mercenary Army.

274
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,839
They're a group of barbarians
like the Gokturks and Mohe.

275
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,270
They want us to die, Father.

276
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,309
This is Go Won Pyo's trick.

277
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,040
He made a plausible excuse
to send us to our deaths,

278
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,750
hoping that we will be annihilated.

279
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:36,020
Chief. The Princess is right.

280
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,889
As planned, we should join
Goguryeo's main army...

281
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,190
That will not work.

282
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,659
We will make no difference
if we mix in with them.

283
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,460
We should crush the barbarians,

284
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,299
the Mercenary Army, or whatever they are,

285
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,200
if we are to proudly say
we accomplished something.

286
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,500
Hey. They are paid soldiers.

287
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,970
Experienced fighters in battle.

288
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,970
Exactly.

289
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,409
We just have to get the leader.

290
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,879
- What?
- That is what mercenaries are.

291
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,680
They fight for money.

292
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,980
If they see their leader die,

293
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,849
would they risk their lives to fight?

294
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,119
If we kill the leader,

295
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,720
they will scatter.

296
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,960
Okay, fine. But how do we get the leader?

297
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,460
That is something for my
smart wife to figure out.

298
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Dal.

299
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,270
I get what you mean,

300
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,139
but the outcome of this fight is obvious.

301
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:34,579
We cannot win.

302
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:37,980
You call this an opportunity from on high.

303
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:42,520
If it were that easy, the
skies would not have sent it.

304
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:47,450
We are much closer to Pyeongsa Plain.

305
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,619
Before anyone else gets to them,

306
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:51,030
we must get them first.

307
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,659
I will do it, Ga Jin.

308
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:01,869
Hey.

309
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,839
Have you not seen me before?

310
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,540
You are ignoring me.

311
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:09,980
Hey. What are you doing?

312
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,980
He is Go Won Pyo's minion.

313
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,649
When they had us,

314
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,920
I bet he beat us up too.

315
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,549
Yes or no, he is a messenger.

316
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,250
Do you know what that is?

317
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,859
It is the same as an envoy.

318
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,260
You cannot hurt him.

319
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:26,159
What is the matter?

320
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,159
No. It is nothing.

321
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,599
You became a Goguryeo
person all because of a man.

322
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:39,369
You are crazy.

323
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
What?

324
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,980
Inform the main army.

325
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:50,549
The Sunno Tribe will go
to Pyeongsa Plain and...

326
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:53,450
that we will preemptively wipe out
the Northern Zhou Mercenary Army.

327
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,139
Please be safe.

328
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:12,809
This war came out of nowhere,
and now it is taking you away.

329
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,740
Stop crying already.

330
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,780
My goodness.

331
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:18,849
Here.

332
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,079
It is a talisman.

333
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,619
If you keep it with you, you will be safe.

334
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:26,920
Why are you giving this to me?

335
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,520
Everyone else has a partner,

336
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,329
but you do not have anyone.

337
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,329
Why, this little...

338
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you.

339
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,770
Ga Jin, if you find you cannot stand it,

340
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,730
just close your eyes...

341
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,440
and surrender.

342
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:43,839
The battle...

343
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,210
is not worth your life.

344
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,879
Do not worry, Father.

345
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,809
- I shall win.
- All right.

346
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,049
Dal, I'm leaving her in your hands.

347
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,780
I will be right by her side, protecting her.

348
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,549
Now.

349
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,359
To battle!

350
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,700
The Princess is heading to battle?

351
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,940
According to the information
provided by the messenger,

352
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:56,409
she is leading an army of 300 from
the Sunno Tribe to the border.

353
00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:00,049
Does that mean she is planning to
face the Northern Zhou mercenaries?

354
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,879
That is as useless as trying
to break a boulder with an egg.

355
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,349
Order her to disband immediately.

356
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:09,859
Is this not very much like her?

357
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
What?

358
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,359
She has undertaken a difficult fight...

359
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,399
for the Sunno Tribe, knowing that
they are suspected of treason.

360
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:18,329
Why not give the Sunno Tribe
this chance to redeem themselves?

361
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:20,299
General Go is also on his way there,

362
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,540
so their odds are not impossible.

363
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,809
First, you suggested that we suppress them...

364
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,139
because you suspected them of treason,

365
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,040
and now you suggest giving
them an opportunity?

366
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,250
These are critical times.
When the nation is at stake,

367
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,819
personal feelings must be set aside.

368
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,250
If the Sunno Tribe achieves victory,

369
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,859
I will reward them accordingly
to the Non Gong Haeng Sang.

370
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:45,460
Including reinstating
their status, of course.

371
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,960
NON GONG HAENG SANG: REWARD BY
THE MAGNITUDE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT

372
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,260
Indeed, Sire.

373
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:15,589
The scouts have confirmed...

374
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:17,790
that they were unable to
discover traces of ambush.

375
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,790
SCOUTS: SOLDIERS CONDUCTING
RECONNAISSANCE OF THE ENEMY

376
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,990
If we keep marching,

377
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,599
we will reach Pyeongsa
Plain by sundown tomorrow.

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
That is so.

379
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
That will be too late.

380
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,540
We will cross Mount Seonak.

381
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,040
- Yes, sir.
- Once we cross the mountain,

382
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,109
we will arrive at Pyeongsa
Plain during the day.

383
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:35,609
However, that is a dangerous path.

384
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,010
How can we cross it with
our horses and equipment?

385
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,879
If there is no path, we will make one.

386
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:42,549
Those who cannot keep up will be left behind.

387
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:44,349
General.

388
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,250
I do not care if the Sunno
Tribe gets annihilated.

389
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,260
However, the Princess is there.

390
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,230
That is why we must hurry.

391
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,030
This plan will be difficult to pull off.

392
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:59,970
Yes, it is dangerous for
you, Princess, and for Dal.

393
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,200
Yet we have no hopes of winning
if we face them head-on.

394
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,170
We will have to take the risk.

395
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,170
- But...
- Trust Ga Jin.

396
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,879
I will be there, as well as Pung Gae.

397
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,980
We also have San and Jin.

398
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,569
Not long after I had joined Cheonjubang,

399
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:36,099
the two of you came.

400
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:39,440
San was such a troublemaker.

401
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:42,339
Jin, you were the one who took care of him.

402
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,710
What about it?

403
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:45,180
Whenever I struggle,

404
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,220
I think it would be nice
to have siblings like that.

405
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,020
I was envious.

406
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,690
San must feel lonely these days.

407
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,159
I have Dal,

408
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,960
and you have Pung Gae.

409
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,859
But Pung Gae is not...

410
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,030
Does that mean he has to be so sulky?

411
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,839
You saw him earlier, did you not? So rude.

412
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,409
How frustrating.

413
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:13,409
Jin.

414
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,579
We are fighting for our dignity.

415
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,750
If you and San are not on good terms,

416
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,819
all of us will feel bad.

417
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,170
Dismount.

418
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,170
Yes, sir.

419
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,869
Do not lose sight of the course.

420
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,670
Those who fall behind will be left behind.

421
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,839
Yes, sir.

422
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,109
Now, quickly!

423
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,460
Everyone is walking on a tightrope.

424
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,059
With even a single misstep,

425
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:06,490
they will fall into the abyss.

426
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,799
Is that not true for you also, My lady?

427
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,329
That is why you asked me to see...

428
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,000
whether General Go would die.

429
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:16,339
I see.

430
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,670
So he is the one you love.

431
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,780
Just answer the question.

432
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:25,349
I take no pleasure in our conversation.

433
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,319
My lady, you and that fellow...

434
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,089
will be a boon to one another if you succeed.

435
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:37,290
But if you fail,

436
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,829
you will be buried together.

437
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:47,770
Fortune-tellers and shamans
always say the same thing.

438
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:49,670
Regardless of what they say,

439
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,970
they craft words in wily sentences,

440
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,670
and later put forward just
the parts they got right.

441
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:57,540
Go back.

442
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:00,849
What do you think will
happen to the Princess?

443
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,049
Do you not wish to know
whether she will live or die?

444
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,990
The Princess must disappear...

445
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,059
for your love to blossom.

446
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,670
We pray, we pray.

447
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,170
We pray to the skies and the spirits.

448
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:27,869
We pray for the safe return...

449
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:30,940
of Dal and my daughter-in-law.

450
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,280
We pray for the safety of our Chief as well.

451
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,819
That's right.

452
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:43,159
Please ensure that everyone
from the village is safe.

453
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:45,030
This we pray.

454
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,690
This we pray.

455
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,859
This we pray.

456
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,119
I am Pyeonggang, the eldest daughter
of King Pyeongwon of Goguryeo.

457
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,889
I am the eldest son of General
On of the Sunno Tribe, On Dal.

458
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,549
We have come to surrender
to the Northern Zhou army.

459
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,490
Lay down your arms.

460
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,339
GENERAL WIBALTA, LEADER OF THE
NORTHERN ZHOU MERCENARY ARMY

461
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,510
The Sunno soldiers...

462
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:38,010
have surrendered to the Northern Zhou army.

463
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:40,280
What do you mean, surrender?

464
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,680
Do you mean they surrendered
even without a fight?

465
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,349
Yes, I believe so.

466
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:46,089
What about the Princess?

467
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,760
It is said that the Princess herself
has led the soldiers to surrender.

468
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,790
The Princess, herself?

469
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,430
Why, this is...

470
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,309
I heard a rumor that you
were planning to face us...

471
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,109
with fewer than 300 soldiers.

472
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:10,139
Do you now fear death?

473
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:11,909
I do not fear death.

474
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,109
I simply do not wish for death without honor.

475
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:15,420
What?

476
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:19,690
The Sunno Tribe was abandoned
by Goguryeo long ago.

477
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:24,220
However, they sent us to the
frontlines of war to die.

478
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,829
Who would wish to fight?

479
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,559
Where is the rest of your army?

480
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,099
There were far fewer than
300 when we counted them.

481
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:35,339
Several of them fled on our march here.

482
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:06,755
The princess of Goguryeo is...

483
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:08,895
betraying her father and
surrendering herself?

484
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,594
Do you expect me to believe that nonsense?

485
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:15,804
I got kicked out because I
aroused my father's anger.

486
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:19,775
He cut ties with me, and I was
forced to leave the palace.

487
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,444
Now he is telling me to
die on the battlefield.

488
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:24,275
I cannot obey his order.

489
00:30:25,614 --> 00:30:28,215
I am not betraying him. I
am only trying to survive.

490
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,385
So I heard the rumors about you.

491
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:34,014
They said the princess of
Goguryeo got married to a fool...

492
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:35,455
and got kicked out of the palace.

493
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:38,124
That was you guys.

494
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:41,324
Did you just call me a fool?

495
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:45,795
Please have mercy on us, General.

496
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:49,265
This is not for me to decide.

497
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:51,334
I will send you to our military headquarters.

498
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:54,804
You can kneel before our
head general and beg.

499
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:56,744
I am coming along.

500
00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:58,614
One of you should stay here.

501
00:30:59,444 --> 00:31:00,714
Get the horses ready.

502
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:07,914
What shall we do? This
was not part of our plan.

503
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:10,724
It is okay. It will only delay our plan.

504
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:12,194
What do you mean it is okay?

505
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,625
You are going to the headquarters
of Northern Zhou alone.

506
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,625
I can protect myself.

507
00:31:16,895 --> 00:31:18,235
Ga Jin.

508
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:21,494
I will come back before the sun sets.

509
00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:24,464
Until then, stay put and wait for me.

510
00:31:26,774 --> 00:31:29,974
If you get hurt even a little,

511
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:33,675
I will...

512
00:31:34,774 --> 00:31:36,685
crush all of them.

513
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:40,754
You should be careful too.

514
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:01,675
Giddy-up!

515
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:32,175
Do not worry so much.

516
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,874
You know Pyeonggang would not
surrender without even trying.

517
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:38,175
She must have a hidden plan.

518
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:39,344
I know that.

519
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:41,985
That is why I am even more worried.

520
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:43,314
Pardon?

521
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:45,784
Pyeonggang has only taken the rough paths,

522
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:48,684
refusing to take the comfortable ones.

523
00:32:49,455 --> 00:32:51,455
She is firm with her choices,

524
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:54,225
but I wonder if she will
be lucky this time as well.

525
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:56,295
I believe in Pyeonggang.

526
00:32:56,895 --> 00:32:59,235
As soon as she destroys the
Northern Zhou Mercenary Army,

527
00:32:59,695 --> 00:33:02,964
you should strike the
headquarters of the Northern Zhou.

528
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:07,475
Of course. I will do that.

529
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:09,045
I must do that.

530
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:22,584
What will you do?

531
00:33:23,325 --> 00:33:25,455
Have you checked where they put our weapons?

532
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,425
They moved them to the
wagons behind the barracks.

533
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:32,434
We will make our move at
night when Ga Jin comes back.

534
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:40,005
Did you hear? I hear General
Wibalta is going to kill them all.

535
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:41,075
Really?

536
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:43,774
I hear they took the girl to kill her.

537
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:49,784
Hey! We are in trouble!

538
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:52,455
- Why are you causing a fuss again?
- What is it?

539
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:55,455
I heard them talking in Turkic while working.

540
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,584
They said Ga Jin will not be coming back.

541
00:33:58,024 --> 00:33:59,495
They said the headquarters
will hold Ga Jin hostage,

542
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,455
and if that becomes
useless, they will kill her.

543
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:03,825
They will also kill all of
us as soon as the sun rises.

544
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:06,265
- Are you sure about it?
- Of course!

545
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:09,104
They did not believe it when Ga Jin
said she will surrender herself.

546
00:34:09,104 --> 00:34:10,604
Are you sure you did not hear them wrong?

547
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:13,104
I am a Gokturk. Do you think I
would mishear my own language?

548
00:34:13,104 --> 00:34:15,274
It is because you are the clumsy type.

549
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:17,445
- What did you just say?
- Hey, hey. Cut it out.

550
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:19,645
If what San said is true,

551
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:21,674
we are like rats in a trap.

552
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:23,745
What is worse is that we
walked into the trap ourselves.

553
00:34:25,084 --> 00:34:26,615
Then we should break out of the trap.

554
00:34:27,455 --> 00:34:28,555
After that,

555
00:34:30,555 --> 00:34:32,125
we are going to save Ga Jin too.

556
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,135
- What is going on?
- Darn you!

557
00:34:46,135 --> 00:34:48,474
- What is happening?
- What is wrong with you?

558
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:50,844
- Do not do that!
- Stop!

559
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:53,575
- What is wrong with you?
- Stop it!

560
00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:56,344
- Hey, come on!
- Stop!

561
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,084
- What is happening?
- Move!

562
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:01,214
Calm down, everyone.

563
00:35:01,555 --> 00:35:03,084
It is nothing.

564
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:06,294
We were just playing around.

565
00:35:11,294 --> 00:35:14,534
This is scary. Why would
you put these in our faces?

566
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:16,964
- Let go of it!
- Hey!

567
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,104
What do you mean, let go?

568
00:36:09,055 --> 00:36:10,854
Let us go!

569
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:15,895
Whoa.

570
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:21,964
Dal.

571
00:36:44,354 --> 00:36:46,325
Get him!

572
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,375
Dal, wait for me.

573
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:30,604
Father.

574
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:32,935
Our army is here!

575
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:47,375
Please hang in there until I make it back.

576
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:37,064
It seems like it is already over.

577
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:41,895
Did I come too late?

578
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:45,674
The Northern Zhou Mercenary
Army must be exhausted.

579
00:39:46,975 --> 00:39:48,635
Let us go and destroy them.

580
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,444
Are you okay?

581
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,774
San!

582
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:31,284
San!

583
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:33,914
Wake up!

584
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:37,954
You fool! Wake up! Are you okay?

585
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:40,154
You said...

586
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:44,064
you cannot live without me, right?

587
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:46,095
I cannot, so do not die!

588
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:50,465
No! Wake up, San!

589
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:52,674
San! San!

590
00:41:22,135 --> 00:41:23,564
Ga Jin...

591
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:42,225
Dal.

592
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:02,345
I miss you,

593
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:06,274
Ga Jin.

594
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,625
Wibalta is down!

595
00:42:21,755 --> 00:42:23,965
Wibalta is down!

596
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:25,664
Yes!

597
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:28,765
- Wibalta is down!
- We won!

598
00:42:28,765 --> 00:42:31,704
We won!

599
00:42:32,274 --> 00:42:33,605
Yes!

600
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:35,774
Wibalta is down!

601
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:50,125
General Go, please give us your order now.

602
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:53,855
That is the flag of Goguryeo.

603
00:42:58,365 --> 00:42:59,895
That is the flag of the Sunno Tribe.

604
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:04,534
How did they...

605
00:43:28,194 --> 00:43:30,895
Dal. Dal.

606
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:47,515
We won.

607
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,985
I fought to the death.

608
00:43:52,454 --> 00:43:56,125
You should have just waited for me, you fool.

609
00:43:57,824 --> 00:43:59,355
Ga Jin, you are...

610
00:44:02,865 --> 00:44:04,225
my Goguryeo,

611
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:09,365
my kingdom.

612
00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:18,174
Thank you for staying alive.

613
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:39,995
- Salute!
- Salute!

614
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:42,735
The enemies will cross the river.

615
00:44:42,865 --> 00:44:44,664
Have the reinforcements arrived?

616
00:44:44,664 --> 00:44:47,074
They just joined the Sunno Tribe.

617
00:44:47,074 --> 00:44:48,304
This is all thanks to Princess Pyeonggang...

618
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:49,944
who destroyed the Northern
Zhou Mercenary Army.

619
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:55,515
Now, it is time for our
kingdom to show our bravery.

620
00:44:57,245 --> 00:45:01,784
Advance the troops and horses to the river!

621
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:05,385
- Salute!
- Salute!

622
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:08,895
- Salute!
- Salute!

623
00:45:08,995 --> 00:45:12,434
- Salute!
- Salute!

624
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:16,064
- Salute!
- Salute!

625
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:17,664
- Salute!
- Salute!

626
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,924
Hey, are you up?

627
00:45:39,225 --> 00:45:40,824
Hey!

628
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:43,164
Hey, are you up?

629
00:45:43,164 --> 00:45:45,495
- My gosh.
- What is it? What happened?

630
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:50,804
A man came from the battlefield.

631
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:51,835
And?

632
00:45:52,304 --> 00:45:56,145
And what happened? Tell me
quickly, I am dying here.

633
00:45:56,574 --> 00:45:58,044
They won.

634
00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:01,115
- They did?
- Yes.

635
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:04,615
The Sunno Tribe won a great victory.

636
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:08,085
Continuing the winning
streak, the King's army...

637
00:46:08,085 --> 00:46:11,424
kicked those Northern Zhou
rascals out of Goguryeo!

638
00:46:11,424 --> 00:46:14,355
The war is over now!

639
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,294
Oh, so then...

640
00:46:17,294 --> 00:46:19,595
what about Dal and my daughter-in-law?

641
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:22,664
They are safe. They did not get hurt either.

642
00:46:22,664 --> 00:46:25,804
My goodness. Thank you.

643
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:29,704
Thank the skies and the
spirits! Thank you so much.

644
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:33,245
I was worried sick that something
terrible would happen to the Chief.

645
00:46:33,515 --> 00:46:35,345
There is no time to lose.

646
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:38,145
I should hurry and boil some chicken.

647
00:46:38,145 --> 00:46:40,755
No. They are not coming straight home.

648
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:42,684
They are heading to Pyeongyang.

649
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,324
For what?

650
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:46,494
What else?

651
00:46:46,494 --> 00:46:49,395
He is going to be rewarded
for his contribution.

652
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,664
He was summoned by His Majesty himself.

653
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:55,335
I see.

654
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:17,355
Pung Gae.

655
00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:19,055
Yes?

656
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:21,025
You do not have to go to Pyeongyang.

657
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:24,625
Take the boy to Ghost Valley.

658
00:47:25,664 --> 00:47:26,865
Yes.

659
00:47:33,275 --> 00:47:35,375
- Good work.
- Bye.

660
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:46,785
San did not only save us...

661
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:49,855
but also our country.

662
00:47:51,355 --> 00:47:53,595
And he is not even from Goguryeo.

663
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,194
I am sorry, Jin. I am so sorry.

664
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:14,345
Princess Pyeonggang and her husband, On Dal.

665
00:48:47,345 --> 00:48:49,385
Your Majesty.

666
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:51,345
I, On Hyeop, the chief of the Sunno Tribe,

667
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:55,115
have successfully defended
the country against Silla.

668
00:48:55,514 --> 00:48:58,424
I am proud of your bravery.

669
00:48:59,994 --> 00:49:01,855
- Much obliged, Your Majesty.
- Much obliged, Your Majesty.

670
00:49:05,764 --> 00:49:08,135
Your unknown and
insignificant subject, On Dal,

671
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,704
bow down humbly at your service.

672
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,145
You may stand up.

673
00:49:18,204 --> 00:49:19,645
Stand up.

674
00:49:23,785 --> 00:49:25,645
You are my daughter,

675
00:49:25,984 --> 00:49:28,085
and you are my son.

676
00:49:29,254 --> 00:49:30,954
You all are...

677
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:34,454
my soldiers and subjects.

678
00:49:34,654 --> 00:49:36,125
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

679
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,895
- Much obliged, Your Majesty.
- Much obliged, Your Majesty.

680
00:49:38,365 --> 00:49:41,535
Considering their outstanding
contributions to our victory,

681
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:43,964
the Sunno Tribe may return
to the Five Tribe council...

682
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:45,535
as of this day.

683
00:49:46,035 --> 00:49:47,135
Also,

684
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:50,775
they shall no longer be recorded as traitors.

685
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:52,174
All the wealth and property...

686
00:49:52,174 --> 00:49:55,014
that was confiscated shall
be returned to them as well.

687
00:49:56,214 --> 00:49:58,385
As you wish, Your Majesty.

688
00:50:00,315 --> 00:50:01,514
Gochuga.

689
00:50:03,025 --> 00:50:04,984
This has already been agreed upon,

690
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:07,355
so I assume that you have no objection.

691
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:13,994
You made a reasonable and
generous decision, Your Majesty.

692
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:25,474
Thanks to everyone's bravery and loyalty,

693
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:28,075
we overcame a crisis and prevented war.

694
00:50:28,214 --> 00:50:31,845
Everyone in Goguryeo deserves a feast.

695
00:50:32,045 --> 00:50:34,454
Open the royal storehouses!

696
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:36,484
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

697
00:50:52,305 --> 00:50:54,305
Is your attire uncomfortable?

698
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:55,974
No.

699
00:50:56,145 --> 00:50:59,105
It is just a bit too long.

700
00:51:00,045 --> 00:51:03,145
Get used to it quickly. You
will be wearing it every day.

701
00:51:04,444 --> 00:51:05,545
Pyeonggang.

702
00:51:06,285 --> 00:51:09,055
- Won.
- Won.

703
00:51:10,285 --> 00:51:13,295
I mean, Your Highness.

704
00:51:16,664 --> 00:51:19,865
I heard that you fought as
well. I am proud of you.

705
00:51:19,964 --> 00:51:22,295
Father led 50,000 troops.

706
00:51:22,635 --> 00:51:24,704
His dignity was breathtaking.

707
00:51:25,764 --> 00:51:27,434
I wish you could have seen him.

708
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,585
Won, you should go back now.

709
00:51:39,984 --> 00:51:41,785
You have preparations to make.

710
00:51:41,785 --> 00:51:44,184
But it will be hours before the sun sets.

711
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,855
Do as she says.

712
00:51:46,154 --> 00:51:48,895
Dal and I will visit you
at your chambers soon.

713
00:52:11,014 --> 00:52:13,885
As His Majesty has acknowledged you both,

714
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:16,325
I believe that it is time to hold a wedding.

715
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:18,825
It shall be known to everyone.

716
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:21,795
I appreciate your offer,
but I must decline it.

717
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:25,795
We already had a wedding ourselves...

718
00:52:25,795 --> 00:52:29,135
and exchanged our tokens of
affection. That is enough for us.

719
00:52:29,504 --> 00:52:32,234
Tokens of affection? Which
gemstones did you choose?

720
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:33,605
Can you show me?

721
00:52:38,174 --> 00:52:39,305
Lovely.

722
00:52:41,115 --> 00:52:44,684
If that is what you want, I will not insist.

723
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:47,355
Magnolia Hall will be under
renovation starting tomorrow.

724
00:52:47,815 --> 00:52:50,855
There is much work to do before
you two can stay there together.

725
00:52:51,224 --> 00:52:52,484
Magnolia Hall?

726
00:52:53,194 --> 00:52:55,095
Is that where we are going to live?

727
00:52:55,525 --> 00:52:56,865
I will explain later.

728
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:00,194
I heard that you took very
good care of Father...

729
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:02,234
while he was bedridden.

730
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:04,135
I cannot thank you enough.

731
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:05,934
Do not mention it.

732
00:53:06,135 --> 00:53:08,835
It is the Queen's duty
to look after the King.

733
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:11,345
There is no need for you to thank me.

734
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,375
I understand.

735
00:53:14,645 --> 00:53:16,885
It was truly a divine blessing.

736
00:53:16,885 --> 00:53:18,385
A DIVINE BLESSING: FAVOR
AND PROTECTION FROM ON HIGH

737
00:53:18,385 --> 00:53:21,514
It was with the help of an
excellent fortune-teller...

738
00:53:21,585 --> 00:53:23,654
that His Majesty recovered.

739
00:53:41,035 --> 00:53:42,504
All preparations are complete.

740
00:53:44,974 --> 00:53:47,244
With Ga Jin moving into the palace,

741
00:53:48,244 --> 00:53:50,645
today is the last day I
will play a fortune-teller.

742
00:53:55,254 --> 00:53:59,125
I have waited for more than a decade
to carry out my divine mission.

743
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,424
Today is a good day.

744
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:12,065
On my way back from Pyeongsa Plain,

745
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:15,875
I realized something.

746
00:54:19,444 --> 00:54:21,014
The real war...

747
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:23,785
did not begin in Northern Zhou...

748
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:25,984
but in Pyeongyang.

749
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:30,484
Right in the middle of the palace.

750
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:33,555
Princess Pyeonggang and the
son of General On Hyeop are,

751
00:54:33,654 --> 00:54:35,825
by no means, easy opponents. Even so,

752
00:54:36,095 --> 00:54:39,365
I will win this war at
all costs. And I will...

753
00:54:43,835 --> 00:54:46,635
offer the two of them to you as trophies.

754
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,994
What do you think you are doing?

755
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:13,764
You showed me this portrait once,

756
00:55:14,795 --> 00:55:16,835
telling me you were looking for this woman.

757
00:55:18,504 --> 00:55:20,434
So have you found her?

758
00:55:21,734 --> 00:55:23,474
Have you won her over?

759
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:32,545
Burning the portrait will not erase
your feelings for her as well.

760
00:55:35,055 --> 00:55:36,954
Please do not despair.

761
00:55:38,355 --> 00:55:40,355
If you stop here,

762
00:55:42,395 --> 00:55:44,224
you will be swallowing the
ashes this woman left behind...

763
00:55:44,365 --> 00:55:47,065
for the rest of your life.

764
00:55:47,865 --> 00:55:49,535
Lady Hae, you are wrong.

765
00:55:52,504 --> 00:55:53,934
My heart...

766
00:55:56,204 --> 00:55:57,974
is already a field of ashes.

767
00:55:59,004 --> 00:56:00,744
The ashes are clumping together...

768
00:56:02,545 --> 00:56:04,285
and hardening as we speak.

769
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:06,514
That cannot be true.

770
00:56:08,914 --> 00:56:10,555
Your feelings are not ones to settle...

771
00:56:12,025 --> 00:56:14,724
as easily as that.

772
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:16,025
Lady Hae!

773
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:24,535
- Do you know me?
- No.

774
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:30,075
But I know my own heart.

775
00:56:31,974 --> 00:56:35,045
Because I wrote a secret
letter for you, General Go.

776
00:56:42,154 --> 00:56:44,254
I see it must have been in vain.

777
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,974
I hear that your medical
skills saved my life.

778
00:57:35,004 --> 00:57:36,845
I hear that your fortune-telling
abilities are impressive as well.

779
00:57:36,845 --> 00:57:38,504
It is my honor, Your Majesty.

780
00:57:39,174 --> 00:57:40,974
Despite winning the battle,

781
00:57:40,974 --> 00:57:42,944
I cannot simply enjoy the victory.

782
00:57:42,944 --> 00:57:45,785
There are too many layers
at play in this country.

783
00:57:46,145 --> 00:57:49,484
That is why I have called you here.

784
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:51,254
Reading the fortunes of palace affairs...

785
00:57:51,254 --> 00:57:54,325
is quite different from telling
an individual's fortune.

786
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:57,865
Therefore, I have been so bold as
to ask your servants to withdraw,

787
00:57:57,964 --> 00:58:01,494
to allow for a private audience
with you and the Crown Prince.

788
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,135
I have heard.

789
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:06,734
What will you do now?

790
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,004
I will read the flow of your energies,

791
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:11,944
and examine their synergy
with the skies and the earth.

792
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,654
In order to read your energy,
your mind and body must be pure.

793
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:29,055
Please drink.

794
00:58:31,325 --> 00:58:34,135
Crown Prince, you have even
fought on the battlefield.

795
00:58:34,234 --> 00:58:36,095
Do you fear this now?

796
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,704
I do not, Father.

797
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:13,704
Do you still not like it?

798
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:16,545
Like what?

799
00:59:17,545 --> 00:59:21,174
That we are now living
together in the palace.

800
00:59:21,275 --> 00:59:22,875
What are you talking about?

801
00:59:23,345 --> 00:59:25,744
How can someone who used to
live in a little shack...

802
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:27,315
complain about living in the palace?

803
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:30,525
The Chief also said he will have
a residence in Pyeongyang Castle.

804
00:59:30,855 --> 00:59:32,454
Pung Gae will be here too.

805
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:34,994
I like it. I am excited.

806
00:59:35,194 --> 00:59:37,764
But you are worried about Mother.

807
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:41,934
Do not worry too much.

808
00:59:41,934 --> 00:59:44,234
I will make sure we can bring her here.

809
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:50,345
- What is it?
- Our victory in battle,

810
00:59:51,174 --> 00:59:52,775
and the revival of the Sunno Tribe,

811
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:56,444
all of it is great.

812
00:59:58,944 --> 01:00:02,454
But my favorite part about
all of this is something else.

813
01:00:07,795 --> 01:00:11,194
It was when the king called me his son...

814
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:14,835
and said that I was your husband.

815
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:19,835
I liked hearing that the most.

816
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:43,194
Do you know what happens when
you drink poison hemlock?

817
01:00:43,464 --> 01:00:45,895
Your body turns to stone,

818
01:00:46,025 --> 01:00:48,095
but your mind remains clear.

819
01:00:51,305 --> 01:00:53,164
In other words,

820
01:00:57,805 --> 01:01:00,145
I am telling you to watch...

821
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:03,885
as I carve up your son, alive,

822
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:06,785
piece by piece.

823
01:01:20,095 --> 01:01:21,395
Princess.

824
01:01:25,734 --> 01:01:27,835
Forget about dinner. You can just skip it.

825
01:01:27,835 --> 01:01:30,275
- Nanny.
- No, do not worry.

826
01:01:30,275 --> 01:01:32,545
I will prepare supper for you separately.

827
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:35,075
I was planning to eat with Father and Won.

828
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:39,014
The two of them went to the shrine,
so I do not think that is possible.

829
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:41,555
- The shrine?
- Yes.

830
01:01:41,855 --> 01:01:45,285
He went there at sunset to discuss
the fortunes of the kingdom.

831
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,855
Apparently, there is a very
skilled fortune-teller.

832
01:01:48,355 --> 01:01:51,924
Queen Yeon has been singing
the praises of Songhwadang.

833
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:54,434
Songhwadang?

834
01:01:55,865 --> 01:01:57,464
I have heard that before.

835
01:01:58,234 --> 01:02:01,375
"Song", "hwa", "dang".

836
01:02:01,575 --> 01:02:04,645
Songhwadang. Where is Songhwadang?

837
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:10,385
Songhwadang. It is he.

838
01:02:11,244 --> 01:02:13,285
- Who?
- It is he.

839
01:02:13,815 --> 01:02:15,184
The Chief of Cheonjubang.

840
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:46,385
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

841
01:02:46,544 --> 01:02:48,514
<i>My wife has no time for rest.</i>

842
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,754
<i>Enemies abound in your vicinity.</i>

843
01:02:50,754 --> 01:02:54,625
<i>Lady Hae, from now on, you are
closer to me than any woman.</i>

844
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:57,364
<i>General On Dal, receive this command.</i>

845
01:02:57,364 --> 01:02:59,195
<i>I will do my best, unto death.</i>

846
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:00,665
<i>Their influence is trivial.</i>

847
01:03:00,665 --> 01:03:02,294
<i>But at their center is the Princess.</i>

848
01:03:02,294 --> 01:03:04,834
<i>The letter from the Queen to Go Won Pyo...</i>

849
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:07,905
<i>is evidence of their illicit relationship.</i>

850
01:03:07,905 --> 01:03:09,274
<i>It is all over now.</i>
