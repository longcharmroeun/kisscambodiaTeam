00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,161
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:09,162
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,582
Do you know what happens...

4
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:23,481
when you drink poison hemlock?

5
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:26,152
Your body turns to stone,

6
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,352
but your mind remains clear.

7
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:30,952
In other words,

8
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:37,831
I am telling you to watch...

9
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,501
as I carve up your son, alive,

10
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,431
piece by piece.

11
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:56,482
EPISODE 14

12
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,992
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:06,552
I was told to leave the shrine
for fear of bringing evil.

14
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:07,821
Step aside.

15
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:10,431
He commanded that no one be allowed in.

16
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:12,061
Move!

17
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:19,032
Princess!

18
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:23,871
Do you remember me?

19
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:26,841
Over ten years ago,

20
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:30,981
for you and for Goguryeo, right here,

21
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:34,921
I used to help serve the rites.

22
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:39,591
One word from you and I
lost my wife and child,

23
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:42,421
and I became a spirit that wanders the world.

24
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:46,061
Each time I inhale and exhale,

25
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,061
I suffer from a gut-wrenching pain.

26
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:52,602
You have no idea that my
life is endless torture.

27
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:56,541
To make you feel just one-hundredth
of the pain I went through,

28
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:00,942
I took in your daughter...

29
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:03,951
and raised her to be an assassin.

30
00:02:11,222 --> 00:02:14,062
She failed to kill you at the ceremony,

31
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:17,731
but I will show you today.

32
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:21,361
The pain of...

33
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:25,472
losing a family member in front of your eyes.

34
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:26,032
Ga Jin. You have changed beyond
recognition in the meantime.

35
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,602
You are a monster.

36
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,361
Have you forgotten already?

37
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:32,301
- I am your chief.
- Shut your mouth!

38
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,271
Escort the King out!

39
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:14,782
Bring death to that man, Pyeongwon.

40
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:26,621
Ga Jin.

41
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,262
Everyone is safe.

42
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,842
It is all over.

43
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:19,142
Is the King safe?

44
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:22,481
His physician gave him an
antidote for the poison.

45
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,751
And the Crown Prince?

46
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:29,522
Fortunately, he is well.

47
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:32,522
The Princess and her husband went to see him.

48
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:37,962
How did this happen?

49
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:41,061
I deserve death for this.

50
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,012
He lived with the goal of getting revenge.

51
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:00,181
He created Cheonjubang...

52
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,652
and manipulated my memory...

53
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,121
to make me a killer.

54
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,722
It was all to get to my father.

55
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,061
I almost lost my brother too.

56
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:13,462
I never imagined he would enter
the palace as a fortune-teller.

57
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:17,631
He is a good trickster.

58
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,441
Calm down.

59
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,311
Everyone is safe.

60
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:31,782
It is not over yet.

61
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,121
What do you mean it is not over?

62
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:36,782
I am sorry, Dal.

63
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:39,152
Go to Ghost Valley on your own.

64
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,491
- Ga Jin.
- Who is behind Du Jung Seo,

65
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,931
and who threatened my
father. I must find out.

66
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,472
Okay. Do that with me.

67
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:54,072
You have a lot to do with the chief.

68
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:58,741
The sooner your tribe
settles in Pyeongyang Castle,

69
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,441
the more you can help me.

70
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:03,111
Please, Dal.

71
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:06,352
My wife has no time for rest.

72
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:10,822
Enemies abound in your vicinity.

73
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,852
If you give a woman that look,

74
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:47,762
you are bound to give the wrong impression.

75
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:51,231
You can misunderstand all you want.

76
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:54,061
I will willingly put up with any ridicule.

77
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:09,881
The sun is rising already.

78
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:15,181
Does love wither away because
the sun shines brighter?

79
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,462
I do not want to let you go.

80
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:34,672
I have something to tell you.

81
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:37,371
What is it?

82
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,741
What happened last night.

83
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,381
Do not think of it.

84
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:47,182
If I can help you in any way, just ask.

85
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:50,121
I will ask for help if I need it.

86
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,491
Are you talking about work?

87
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:55,422
Love shared over one night...

88
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:58,131
will be forgotten in time.

89
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:01,161
Helping each other...

90
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:03,972
is more important than our feelings.

91
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,271
As it was until now.

92
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:14,641
I cannot do that now.

93
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:20,481
That might have been so until now.

94
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,352
But Lady Hae, from now on,

95
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,391
you are closer to me...

96
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,521
than any woman.

97
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:51,981
I need to go.

98
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:54,922
Okay.

99
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:03,391
General.

100
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:06,391
What is it?

101
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:09,332
Gochuga hurriedly went to the palace.

102
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:11,472
At this hour?

103
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:12,932
What happened?

104
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,672
There was an unfortunate incident.

105
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:17,611
An unfortunate incident?

106
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,292
As soon as the King woke,

107
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:42,702
he summoned me and Royal Consort Hyeon.

108
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:46,231
He will question me about
admitting the fortune-teller.

109
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:48,072
What should I do?

110
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:50,842
If he punishes you, accept the punishment.

111
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,472
How could you say that?

112
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,911
If I am thrown out of the palace,

113
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,312
what will happen to Geon Mu?

114
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:03,722
Geon Mu.

115
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:08,261
Yes.

116
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:11,432
I cannot let my son live without a mother.

117
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,102
So...

118
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,501
tell me what to do to survive.

119
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:32,411
If word were to get out,

120
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:35,151
it will damage our reputation. So...

121
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:38,192
I summoned you in secret.

122
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,151
I know nothing.

123
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:42,822
I heard of a skilled fortune-teller...

124
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:44,432
and requested an impregnation ceremony.

125
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,602
I did not know who he was.

126
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:52,401
He saved you when you were
bedridden from sickness.

127
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,472
Why would I suspect him?

128
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:56,572
I was deceived also.

129
00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:58,172
Do not deny your involvement.

130
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,042
The Crown Prince almost died.

131
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:19,332
Please excuse us.

132
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,832
Your Majesty...

133
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:32,712
Sit down.

134
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,352
You saved Goguryeo from Northern Zhou,

135
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,852
and this time you saved
me and the Crown Prince.

136
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:46,521
You flatter me.

137
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:48,761
Your husband. Did he not come with you?

138
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:51,792
He left with the Sunno Tribe
people to take care of things.

139
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:59,771
She invited a fortune-teller in
for an impregnation ceremony.

140
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,342
The Royal Consort had no ill will,

141
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:04,241
so you can show her mercy on this issue.

142
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:06,472
However,

143
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:09,781
it is different for you, Your Highness.

144
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:13,511
Are you saying I had ill will?

145
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:17,151
He asked to see the King
and Crown Prince in private.

146
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:21,261
Did you not suspect anything at all?

147
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:23,962
He said any other company
would jinx the ceremony.

148
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:25,562
"I did not know. I was deceived."

149
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:28,661
Do you try to avoid punishment with excuses?

150
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,031
As Queen,

151
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:35,241
you cannot avoid responsibility
for what happened.

152
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,102
I understand.

153
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,111
If I must be penalized for not knowing,

154
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,852
you should punish the Princess also.

155
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,452
Leave us.

156
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:03,761
You brandished a sword to
take your father's life.

157
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:08,001
At the bid of the very same man,

158
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:11,542
did you not try to go
against all earthy morals?

159
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:32,891
Who are you?

160
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:39,131
Just because you had no memory...

161
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,672
does not excuse you for...

162
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,401
what you did at the ceremony.

163
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:49,511
If you wish to punish me,

164
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:52,511
punish the Princess also.

165
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,151
I had no choice.

166
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,922
As did I.

167
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:59,251
I was duped, just like you.

168
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:03,491
Then we should inform the subjects
and have them decide who is worse.

169
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:05,231
That is a good idea.

170
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:06,592
Shut your mouths.

171
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,172
If word of the past ceremony...

172
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:13,731
or this incident were to get out,

173
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,271
it would do us no good.

174
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:18,712
- Father.
- Queen.

175
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:21,481
And Princess.

176
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:25,281
Do not bring up the past again.

177
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:46,271
How did you find out?

178
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:47,942
About what?

179
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:49,542
What happened at the ceremony.

180
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,111
Who told you about it?

181
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:58,981
In the palace,

182
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,781
even the walls have ears.

183
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:05,192
If you live here,

184
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:07,592
you will get used to it.

185
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:09,121
By the way,

186
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:12,491
your husband does not know
proper palace etiquette.

187
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,531
Instead of getting involved
in what does not concern you,

188
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,702
you should teach him that first.

189
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,422
Who are you?

190
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,391
Tell me who you are.

191
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,001
They knocked out the guards...

192
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,802
and took him before anyone noticed.

193
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,542
How could someone escape within the Capital?

194
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,641
Did you find out who they were?

195
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:06,151
Is it not obvious?

196
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,752
The killers got involved...

197
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,921
to save their chief.

198
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:13,691
Arrest them quickly.

199
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:14,891
Yes, sir.

200
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:17,661
I have men searching the Capital.

201
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,832
Do not...

202
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:22,732
try to bring him in alive.

203
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,032
As soon as he is found,

204
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:27,471
have him beheaded.

205
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,471
I will do as you command.

206
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:34,512
Your Majesty. About who
brought him into the Palace...

207
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,242
As of this day,

208
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,381
no one is to speak of him or that incident.

209
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,881
Whoever says so much as a word...

210
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,621
will be punished severely.

211
00:17:58,832 --> 00:17:59,832
Dal...

212
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:03,141
What is it?

213
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:05,242
It is nothing.

214
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:07,471
Who is there?

215
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:09,441
I said it is nothing.

216
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:16,752
You got me!

217
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:18,492
You startled me.

218
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,461
How have you been?

219
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:25,631
You are as light as a feather.

220
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:28,032
Why are you home without notice?

221
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:30,302
I came because I missed you.

222
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:33,072
I am here to see you.

223
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:36,201
This is a welcome surprise.

224
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:52,391
It has been a long time.

225
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:54,492
I heard you came to Pyeongsa Plain...

226
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,592
but turned back with your men.

227
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:58,732
The battle was already ending.

228
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:00,232
I had no business there.

229
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,762
You and your husband gained victory.

230
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:05,032
That is enough for me.

231
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:08,842
Right. I will soon arrest
the man that got away.

232
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:10,302
Goodbye.

233
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:11,971
Master Go.

234
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:18,812
I heard that my father trusts you.

235
00:19:19,512 --> 00:19:20,812
I do my duty.

236
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,181
You also trained the Crown Prince.

237
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:25,322
Thank you.

238
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:28,361
You flatter me.

239
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:42,671
Why are you so stubborn?

240
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:45,072
Ga Jin and I are leaving,

241
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:48,342
and so are the chief and most
of the Ghost Valley people.

242
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,582
How can you remain here alone?

243
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:53,752
I will not be alone. I will live with Weol.

244
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:57,151
She is saying she will
stay only because of you.

245
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,752
We will not live in a thatched hut.

246
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,121
We will live in a huge tiled house...

247
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:03,691
I will not listen to any more.

248
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:05,992
Just the thought of the
clustered city suffocates me.

249
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:08,461
I do not wish for riches or honor at my age.

250
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:10,361
If you insist on staying here,

251
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:12,431
would Ga Jin and I be able to rest?

252
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:15,542
Do I have to suffer just so
that you two do not feel bad?

253
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:16,842
Forget it.

254
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,171
I am not interested in
feasts and silk sheets.

255
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:21,582
I am better off with simple
meals and cotton sheets.

256
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,911
- Mother.
- What?

257
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:26,552
General Dal.

258
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:30,522
Do as she says.

259
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,592
I will think of her as my own
mother and take good care of her.

260
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:36,992
Goodness.

261
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:41,401
Goodness.

262
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:49,772
Gosh, be careful.

263
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:55,411
Should we load that chest
over there onto the cart too?

264
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:58,911
That is for those moving
to Pyeongyang to decide.

265
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:03,381
Be careful.

266
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:04,381
Yes.

267
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,391
Why are you not helping out?

268
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:10,461
We are leaving first thing in the morning.

269
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:12,661
I sprained my back.

270
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:15,131
That is too bad. Is it serious?

271
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:17,701
I will be fine after
sleeping on a heated floor.

272
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:21,542
You are in a rush. Do not mind me.

273
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:23,901
This is not good.

274
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,812
There will be much housework to
do once we arrive in Pyeongyang.

275
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,181
What shall we do if you sprained your back?

276
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:33,711
Housework?

277
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:36,951
The entire Sunno Tribe
will be living together.

278
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:39,391
Who else will be up to
the task if not for you?

279
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:41,691
Do you mean...

280
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,191
I am coming with you?

281
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:47,901
Do not make me repeat myself.

282
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:52,272
My goodness. Chief!

283
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:55,272
My dear. Come on.

284
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:58,411
Pack up your things.

285
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:01,611
Why are you not packing up?

286
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,812
Chief.

287
00:22:04,312 --> 00:22:08,282
I am not sure if I should
follow you to Pyeongyang.

288
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:10,022
What are you talking about?

289
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:12,391
The Princess's stepfather
should, of course, come.

290
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:16,822
I am destined to shave salt
in Ghost Valley all my life.

291
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:19,431
None of us belong in Pyeongyang.

292
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:21,262
But without Dal,

293
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:23,032
we would have continued to
wander around aimlessly.

294
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:24,631
We are only coming with him to repay him.

295
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:27,072
We are almost done loading the carts.

296
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,802
- Good work.
- Thank you.

297
00:22:29,242 --> 00:22:32,611
The Princess will need you there.

298
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:36,582
Deuk, we all are just as worried as you.

299
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,951
But it does not matter whether you
are in Ghost Valley or Pyeongyang.

300
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,582
After some getting used to,

301
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:42,221
you will feel at home.

302
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:45,191
I know that. I do understand all of that.

303
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,522
But it just does not feel right.

304
00:22:47,522 --> 00:22:48,822
Why are you taking it out on me?

305
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:50,961
- I am sorry.
- Stop it.

306
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,292
Let it go.

307
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:54,332
Shall we get going?

308
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,361
Fine, let us go.

309
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:56,562
- Are you coming?
- I am.

310
00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:58,171
- Are you sure?
- Yes, let us go!

311
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,302
So you are coming!

312
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:02,901
Do not be like that.

313
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,342
I am not coming.

314
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:06,911
I mean it.

315
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:08,782
Why are you two fighting?

316
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:10,312
Should you not be busy packing up?

317
00:23:10,312 --> 00:23:12,881
I am telling her to come with
us, but she will not listen.

318
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:15,822
Where would I be going with
San buried in the field?

319
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,621
Fine, stay then.

320
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:18,921
I do not care.

321
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,401
If you are going to say the same thing,

322
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,701
I do not want to hear it.

323
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:40,542
I do not want to move to Pyeongyang either.

324
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,181
It is unfamiliar...

325
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:45,111
and somehow suffocating.

326
00:23:46,812 --> 00:23:50,151
Still, I could not leave Ga Jin there alone.

327
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:55,262
She is surrounded by evil people everywhere.

328
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,232
Your chief got caught recently.

329
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,431
While trying to harm the King.

330
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:08,102
And the man he was with...

331
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:11,871
died by my sword.

332
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:20,482
It is not your fault.

333
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:22,951
He would have...

334
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:27,421
even covered himself in oil
and jumped into the fire...

335
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:30,421
if the chief had told him to.

336
00:24:31,832 --> 00:24:33,732
That is exactly what Ga Jin said.

337
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:40,131
With San gone and you far away,

338
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:43,772
Ga Jin will have no one to turn to.

339
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:46,671
You will be there for her.

340
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:49,982
That is different.

341
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:52,211
She needs her friend as well as her husband.

342
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,421
So?

343
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:56,621
So?

344
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:30,421
You must see but not look,

345
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:32,252
and hear but not listen...

346
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:34,252
for your family to be at peace.

347
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:39,891
What happened at the ceremony.
Who told you about it?

348
00:25:40,232 --> 00:25:44,062
In the palace, even the walls have ears.

349
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:04,121
I assume that he has not been found yet.

350
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:06,621
He must either have run far away...

351
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:08,391
or hidden himself somewhere.

352
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:09,391
Or maybe...

353
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:12,461
someone is harboring him.

354
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:16,631
Either way, I will find him as soon as I can.

355
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:18,871
Of course.

356
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,032
By the way,

357
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:22,072
have you heard?

358
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:25,971
General Yeon of the Jeollo Tribe...

359
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:28,312
is returning to the Five Tribe Council.

360
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:32,181
It is said to have been the
Princess's desperate request.

361
00:26:32,352 --> 00:26:34,082
Dealing with barbarians all her life,

362
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:35,921
she must have gotten bored.

363
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:39,451
He is a close relative of the late Queen.

364
00:26:39,822 --> 00:26:41,421
He is a relative to the Princess.

365
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:44,891
What are you trying to say?

366
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,931
The Sunno Tribe and Jeollo Tribe.

367
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:51,232
The two vacancies...

368
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:53,502
at the Five Tribe Council have been filled.

369
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,542
It is obvious...

370
00:26:57,102 --> 00:26:59,611
that they will side with His
Majesty and obey the Princess.

371
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:02,242
They are nothing to be afraid of.

372
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:04,181
At the center of all this is the Princess.

373
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:08,151
Are you lecturing me on politics?

374
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:10,582
I am just concerned.

375
00:27:11,121 --> 00:27:13,621
Before they settle in and gain a foothold,

376
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,322
we must nip them in the bud.

377
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:22,602
I have told you this before.
Did you already forget?

378
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:26,302
Violence without a cause
is a house built on sand.

379
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:28,131
It is that lax attitude of yours...

380
00:27:28,131 --> 00:27:29,242
HOUSE ON SAND: SOMETHING WITHOUT
A STRONG BASE AND LIKELY TO FAIL

381
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:30,971
that got you in this situation.

382
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:32,772
Watch your mouth.

383
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:34,881
I must say this.

384
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:37,042
Do not underestimate the Princess.

385
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:40,512
The son of General On Hyeop
may cause trouble as well.

386
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,822
- Leave.
- Let me take care of it.

387
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:46,052
I will take charge.

388
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:47,721
I said, leave!

389
00:27:56,302 --> 00:27:57,302
Sure.

390
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,332
This medicine will boost your energy.

391
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:35,242
Take it twice a day.

392
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:40,242
What you wish for is my wish as well.

393
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:43,881
Everything will go as planned.

394
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:45,982
Do not worry too much.

395
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:55,322
Do not get too close to Go Geon.

396
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:07,732
Father, what are you talking about?

397
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:13,772
I have eyes to see...

398
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:15,641
and ears to hear.

399
00:29:16,611 --> 00:29:19,651
Did you think I did not know...

400
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:22,082
you were getting close to him?

401
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:28,221
The Princess and the Gyeru
Tribe are in fierce conflict.

402
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:31,691
If you get involved with
General Go at times like this,

403
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:34,931
you may get hurt...

404
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:38,572
or put the entire Sono Tribe in danger.

405
00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:40,732
If that is the reason,

406
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:43,272
I will not keep a distance from him.

407
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:44,572
Mo Yong.

408
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:47,111
He cares for me sincerely.

409
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:50,042
I also accepted him without calculating.

410
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:53,752
I will never cause trouble for our family.

411
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:56,022
Please do not say anything more.

412
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:00,092
Father.

413
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,921
You are forbidden to go
out for the time being.

414
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:20,843
Gosh.

415
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:22,714
Chief!

416
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:25,284
- The Princess is here!
- Gosh.

417
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:27,883
- What? The Princess?
- She is here.

418
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:33,253
Goodness.

419
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:35,093
You are here.

420
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:36,893
The journey here must have been tough.

421
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:38,564
Tough? No.

422
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:42,764
My son-in-law took good care of
me. I was comfortable on a wagon.

423
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:47,503
Thank you for taking care
of him. What about Mother?

424
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,073
Her stubbornness has won.

425
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:52,943
I will go see her later and
make sure I bring her here.

426
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:55,143
She is a stubborn old lady
who loves crossing people.

427
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:57,943
Why would you want to bring
such a lady? Forget it.

428
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:02,214
Do not just stand here.
Everyone, let us go back to work.

429
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:03,914
- Okay.
- Okay.

430
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:07,524
Thank you for your hard work, Lord Sa.

431
00:31:07,524 --> 00:31:09,024
Thank you.

432
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,563
The exclusive rights to sell salt?

433
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:23,274
Right now, the Five Tribes have exclusivity.

434
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:25,504
Originally, it belonged to the royal family.

435
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:27,173
Of course.

436
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:30,573
That jerk, Go Won Pyo, stole everything.

437
00:31:32,813 --> 00:31:36,653
We must take it back even
if it has been too long.

438
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:41,923
Moreover, it was a wish of my late mother.

439
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:46,664
Chief, Ga Jin has been
planning this for a long time.

440
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:50,634
I mean, please help us, Lord Sa.

441
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,134
There will be a huge backlash.

442
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:55,774
Even so, what could they do?

443
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:59,144
The King has given his order. And
the Sunno Tribe will agree to it.

444
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,774
The Jeollo Tribe will join our cause soon.

445
00:32:03,274 --> 00:32:04,884
The first thing we must do is...

446
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:07,513
to check the size of the salt ponds
and the yield of salt accurately.

447
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:10,283
Can you guys find that out?
Father, I would like your help too.

448
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,183
Say no more.

449
00:32:12,183 --> 00:32:13,354
It is not just a task for the empire...

450
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:15,293
but a favor for my daughter.

451
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:17,423
Do not worry, My Princess.

452
00:32:18,263 --> 00:32:20,224
Please do not worry.

453
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,764
When I used to work as a peddler,

454
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:24,804
I visited every nook and
corner of this empire.

455
00:32:24,964 --> 00:32:28,133
- She does not need to hear that.
- You should talk less.

456
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:29,473
Thank you.

457
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:32,704
You have a visitor from the palace.

458
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:34,343
Our attendance is required at the palace.

459
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:35,744
- We have to go to the palace?
- The palace?

460
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:45,324
Obey the King and accept
your official position.

461
00:32:46,954 --> 00:32:50,324
General On Dal, the King has
assigned you with Eighth Rank.

462
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:53,764
Moreover, the King has appointed
you the Head of Capital Defense.

463
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,394
Do your best to achieve
peace within the capital.

464
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:57,593
I will.

465
00:32:57,593 --> 00:33:01,334
Accept your duties wholeheartedly
as General On Hyeop had done.

466
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:11,144
I will do my best, unto death.

467
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:28,633
Next. Generals from the
Sunno Tribe, come forward.

468
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:48,214
So tell me. How tall was
the general of our enemy?

469
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:49,683
Here.

470
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:52,683
He was about the same
height as me. Oh, right.

471
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,554
But his ax was something else.

472
00:33:55,554 --> 00:33:59,924
Whenever he swung it, I could
feel the breeze from it.

473
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:02,933
Do not kid with me.

474
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:06,364
My son-in-law turns out to be a jokester.

475
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:08,704
Gosh. I am not joking, Sire.

476
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:11,843
- All right. Pour me a drink.
- Okay.

477
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,204
He shows no class.

478
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:15,973
All right.

479
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:20,413
Take it back.

480
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,813
That is way too greasy for my father.

481
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:23,913
Right.

482
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:30,193
- All right. Let us drink.
- Okay.

483
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:43,574
Their get-together must be running long.

484
00:34:43,903 --> 00:34:46,743
It is his first time having
drinks with his son-in-law.

485
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:50,014
The evening is too early for
it to end. Do you not agree?

486
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:53,283
General On has a low tolerance
for alcohol. So it will end soon.

487
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:57,014
What good will come from getting drunk?

488
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:58,884
Gosh, men.

489
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:01,283
Escort the Prince to his chambers.

490
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:02,394
Yes, Your Highness.

491
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:06,593
Is he going to sleep now?

492
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:09,134
Once you are done with the
refreshments, you may leave.

493
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:23,113
She is such a snob. She must
think she is better than everyone.

494
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:26,314
She is the one who brought such
a dangerous man to the shrine!

495
00:35:26,314 --> 00:35:28,254
Please do not speak of that again.

496
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:33,053
See? The King has let it slide again.

497
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:36,093
This is why I must give birth to a prince.

498
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:41,863
Or I must write him love letters diligently.

499
00:35:44,593 --> 00:35:45,964
Love letters?

500
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:06,254
Gosh. How beautiful.

501
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,223
You did not even knock first.

502
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:11,493
Is that for the King?

503
00:36:12,723 --> 00:36:14,124
Do not ask me such a question.

504
00:36:15,863 --> 00:36:18,134
Gosh, this is beautiful.

505
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,134
You put this beautiful flower
on the love letter, right?

506
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:24,473
Should I write one too?

507
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:27,504
I tried to write one as well.

508
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,743
But I am not good with words.

509
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:34,214
So she wrote a love letter?

510
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:36,814
Yes. Why do you ask?

511
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:46,564
Gosh, the robe was suffocating.

512
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:48,694
It really was.

513
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:55,403
Dal, drink this.

514
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,113
That hits the spot.

515
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,184
Leave us be.

516
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,954
Come here, my wife.

517
00:37:12,954 --> 00:37:14,524
You must be drunk.

518
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:16,593
Where are you going?

519
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:18,894
Go to sleep first. I need
time to think about something.

520
00:37:18,894 --> 00:37:21,694
- About what?
- Go to sleep already.

521
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:24,033
By myself?

522
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,533
You are acting like a baby. Just go to sleep.

523
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:36,374
- Ga Jin.
- Yes?

524
00:37:38,814 --> 00:37:40,084
It is nothing.

525
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:43,314
I am going to sleep now.

526
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:30,834
What are you doing?

527
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:33,064
You have greatly angered...

528
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:35,934
Lord Kim Cha Seung.

529
00:38:39,673 --> 00:38:41,243
- Tie her up.
- Yes.

530
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:47,383
JANGBAEK

531
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:49,853
Are you serious?

532
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:52,753
She just disappeared without a trace!

533
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:54,753
What do you mean you know nothing about this?

534
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:57,023
We are searching inside
and outside the store,

535
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,763
- but we have not found her yet.
- Did she say...

536
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:01,223
she was going somewhere?

537
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:02,733
No, I have not heard anything.

538
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,334
- Oh, no.
- Lord Hae.

539
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:11,973
Send a message to General Go.

540
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:15,513
- What are you doing? Do it now!
- Yes, my lord.

541
00:39:29,554 --> 00:39:31,324
What on earth happened?

542
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:33,123
What do you mean she disappeared?

543
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:37,164
If this incident was caused
by affection between you two,

544
00:39:37,164 --> 00:39:38,603
this is enough.

545
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:41,263
I will not tell your father about this.

546
00:39:41,263 --> 00:39:43,574
What are you talking about?

547
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,944
Do not tell me you did not know about this.

548
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:50,914
I am sure someone has kidnapped her.

549
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:52,444
We must find her first.

550
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:58,853
Oh, no. She...

551
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:31,983
What did you do with Lady Hae?

552
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:35,454
I am sure your subordinates are behind this.

553
00:40:35,454 --> 00:40:36,954
Never.

554
00:40:38,054 --> 00:40:42,233
However, she does have
enemies all around her.

555
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:44,934
She only has herself to blame.

556
00:40:47,964 --> 00:40:51,273
I kept you alive to give you
one last chance to survive.

557
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:54,003
If I find out that you were involved in this,

558
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:56,973
I will tear you to pieces.

559
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:01,643
- Keep him locked up.
- As you wish.

560
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:12,393
One last chance?

561
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,574
What do you mean, Your Highness?

562
00:41:25,804 --> 00:41:29,044
You think Gochuga and the
Queen are having an affair?

563
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:36,753
I still remember clearly how I ran into him.

564
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:40,483
I remember the face Go Won Pyo
put on when he threatened me.

565
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:45,123
If they kept their inappropriate
relationship until now...

566
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:47,393
Please do not say that.

567
00:41:47,723 --> 00:41:49,564
What if someone hears us?

568
00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:51,534
Why are you so startled?

569
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:54,503
I only asked if you knew something.

570
00:41:57,103 --> 00:42:01,373
I do not know anything, and
I have not heard anything.

571
00:42:05,284 --> 00:42:08,444
Nanny, how do I look?

572
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:10,554
Today is my first day of work.

573
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,784
I see.

574
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:31,704
What happened?

575
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:35,314
It is nothing.

576
00:42:36,444 --> 00:42:37,944
You are not telling me again.

577
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:42,054
Ever since we came here, you
have been keeping things from me.

578
00:42:43,054 --> 00:42:46,723
When we were in Ghost Valley,
we told each other everything.

579
00:42:47,723 --> 00:42:48,853
Dal.

580
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:55,863
Anyway, I wonder how Weol is
doing with Mother's nagging.

581
00:43:06,704 --> 00:43:08,814
- Weol.
- Yes?

582
00:43:10,013 --> 00:43:12,544
What on earth are you doing?

583
00:43:12,944 --> 00:43:15,853
I am only blind. It is not
like I do not have hands.

584
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:17,554
My goodness.

585
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,853
Just get used to being
comfortable, and have your meal.

586
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:23,223
If I wanted to be comfortable,

587
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:25,424
I would have gone to Pyeongyang with my son.

588
00:43:25,424 --> 00:43:27,294
I would not have made you serve me.

589
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:31,534
You must be sad now that
Dal is not here anymore.

590
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:36,074
No matter how cozy the nest
is, if their wings get too big,

591
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:38,643
they should find another tree and fly away.

592
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:40,643
That is the way of the world.

593
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:44,444
And you, Weol.

594
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:47,383
Do not behave like this, as if you
are walking on eggshells around me.

595
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:50,383
I did not take you in to make you my servant.

596
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,723
I am not going to live as your servant.

597
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:55,393
I will run away if you make me.

598
00:43:55,393 --> 00:43:58,964
My goodness. Where would you go?

599
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:02,194
Are you going to fly away
to Baekje or something?

600
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:09,873
Wait. I did not mean that.

601
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:13,544
I am fine. Let us have our meal.

602
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:20,143
- Put it on my spoon one last time.
- Sure.

603
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,784
This will be the last time, okay?

604
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:25,983
- Go ahead and have your meal.
- Okay.

605
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:36,034
What is this?

606
00:44:36,964 --> 00:44:39,834
Get on. It is the horse for
the Head of Capital Defense.

607
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:41,834
I prepared it for you.

608
00:44:41,834 --> 00:44:43,773
Forget it. I do not need a horse.

609
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:48,044
It is better for me to walk to
look around the capital carefully.

610
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:50,273
Get rid of it.

611
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:53,383
Troops, march.

612
00:45:03,593 --> 00:45:05,763
- Just let me go in.
- I cannot do that.

613
00:45:05,763 --> 00:45:08,893
- Why do you not understand me?
- You cannot go in.

614
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:11,534
- Pil Gu.
- You are here right on time.

615
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:12,763
What is happening, Father?

616
00:45:12,763 --> 00:45:15,674
We lost the pass to enter the capital.

617
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:18,003
We have an important
message for the Princess,

618
00:45:18,003 --> 00:45:21,273
but they are just treating
us like a bunch of beggars.

619
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:23,343
Maybe we smell like salt
because we have been...

620
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:25,684
checking the salt ponds.

621
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:28,784
He is the Princess' step-father,
and they belong to the Sunno Tribe.

622
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:30,584
We cannot let a man without
a pass in the capital...

623
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:31,613
just with a few words.

624
00:45:31,613 --> 00:45:34,353
- How dare you. What did you say?
- He is right.

625
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:42,334
You are doing well by following the rules.

626
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:46,434
I will tell them to be careful,
so please let them in for now.

627
00:45:46,434 --> 00:45:47,534
Yes, My Lord.

628
00:45:49,034 --> 00:45:50,304
There you go.

629
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:05,954
Dal is indeed amazing.

630
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:11,123
Our flag needs to be fluttering
even when seen from far away.

631
00:46:12,123 --> 00:46:13,694
That is one of the rules too.

632
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:15,194
Yes, My Lord!

633
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:19,934
- Let us go in.
- Sure. You are practically flying.

634
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:22,633
He is my son-in-law! You heard me?

635
00:46:23,034 --> 00:46:26,373
- Dal is the best.
- He is my son-in-law!

636
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:31,973
What is this nonsense?

637
00:46:32,143 --> 00:46:34,643
You want us to give you the
exclusive rights to salt?

638
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,013
The exclusive rights to salt...

639
00:46:37,013 --> 00:46:39,253
belong to the royal household.

640
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:41,654
You are not giving them to us.

641
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,493
You are only returning them.

642
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:48,623
Lord Hae! Why are you not saying anything?

643
00:46:48,623 --> 00:46:51,694
It is not a matter worth our time to discuss.

644
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:54,834
The King has given us the
rights a long time ago.

645
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:58,273
Anyway, we are looking into
the status of the salt ponds,

646
00:46:58,704 --> 00:47:01,343
so as soon as General Yeon
from the Jeollo Tribe arrives,

647
00:47:01,343 --> 00:47:02,944
let us all take a vote.

648
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:09,784
A vote? It is 2 against 3.

649
00:47:09,784 --> 00:47:12,054
Is it not useless to take a vote?

650
00:47:12,054 --> 00:47:14,684
The Five Tribe council is a
coalition among five tribes...

651
00:47:14,684 --> 00:47:17,424
where they come together to lead Goguryeo.

652
00:47:18,993 --> 00:47:21,293
It took your tribe a long time to return.

653
00:47:22,664 --> 00:47:25,194
Do you really want to spend your
time cleaning up after the Princess?

654
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:39,513
I will bear your advice in mind.

655
00:47:42,313 --> 00:47:44,753
How dare he!

656
00:47:49,454 --> 00:47:52,424
We must get back the
exclusive rights to salt.

657
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:55,023
Since Lord Sa has told the
other lords of the Five Tribes,

658
00:47:55,023 --> 00:47:57,533
you two must keep an eye
on the Five Tribe council.

659
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:59,803
Do you think they will back off easily?

660
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:04,904
We need to find a way to make them.

661
00:48:04,904 --> 00:48:06,604
I know you have a lot on your plate,

662
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:09,644
but do not be too inattentive to Dal.

663
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:11,813
What do you mean?

664
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:14,444
It is okay for us since we live together,

665
00:48:14,614 --> 00:48:16,614
but Dal is all alone in the palace.

666
00:48:16,983 --> 00:48:20,624
If you do not look after him,
he will remain an outcast.

667
00:48:20,854 --> 00:48:22,553
You are worrying too much.

668
00:48:22,854 --> 00:48:25,154
He is not a child. I do not
need to follow him around...

669
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:26,223
and take care of him.

670
00:48:26,223 --> 00:48:29,634
Do not forget for whom
he fought in the war...

671
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:33,503
and for whom he is living in the palace.

672
00:48:45,983 --> 00:48:48,813
Dal. I am sorry.

673
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:51,614
For what?

674
00:48:52,214 --> 00:48:55,483
I could not pay attention to you
because I was immersed in my work.

675
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:57,553
We are married. You do not
need to worry about that.

676
00:48:58,023 --> 00:48:59,424
I am okay.

677
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,594
This is what has been keeping me busy.

678
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:06,763
What is this?

679
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:16,374
It looks like a letter.

680
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:20,214
It is a love letter that the
Queen sent to Go Won Pyo.

681
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:23,954
The Queen...

682
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,253
sent this to Go Won Pyo?

683
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:31,424
It is the evidence that proves
they are having an affair.

684
00:49:45,003 --> 00:49:47,374
I will clean this up right away.

685
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,394
What did you say?

686
00:50:06,364 --> 00:50:08,763
How did the Princess lay her hands on it?

687
00:50:09,594 --> 00:50:11,233
I am not sure about that.

688
00:50:11,993 --> 00:50:13,134
I am...

689
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:17,134
not telling you this for
you and the Queen's sake.

690
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:20,704
If that love letter causes trouble,

691
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:24,573
the Crown Prince and Prince Geon Mu...

692
00:50:24,573 --> 00:50:27,013
will be deeply scarred.

693
00:50:30,354 --> 00:50:31,954
I understand.

694
00:50:38,424 --> 00:50:42,293
Then you must know what
you should do about it.

695
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:51,803
That is impossible.

696
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:54,773
The letters have never
fallen into anyone's hands.

697
00:50:56,874 --> 00:51:00,844
Are you smiling right now?

698
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:04,313
Maybe the Princess is playing tricks on us.

699
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,884
- Pardon?
- Maybe she is trying to...

700
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:10,293
set us up using a fake letter.

701
00:51:10,654 --> 00:51:12,664
Just like how her mother was tricked.

702
00:51:15,223 --> 00:51:18,634
Hide this in the queen's chambers
after she leaves on patrol.

703
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:20,833
What is this?

704
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:23,674
A talisman that will make you queen.

705
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:28,904
But what if she really has our letter?

706
00:51:30,614 --> 00:51:33,983
We have no time for this. We
need to find the letter first.

707
00:51:34,243 --> 00:51:35,543
Ja Gyeong.

708
00:51:44,553 --> 00:51:45,894
What...

709
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:50,563
did you just call me?

710
00:51:50,563 --> 00:51:52,094
Jin Ja Gyeong.

711
00:51:54,164 --> 00:51:56,604
I am calling my longtime lover's name.

712
00:51:57,003 --> 00:51:59,844
Also, I already know...

713
00:52:00,844 --> 00:52:03,043
that Geon Mu is not my son.

714
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:07,483
You...

715
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:11,783
already knew?

716
00:52:11,813 --> 00:52:14,823
If you could make your son
the king of this empire,

717
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:19,053
you would have done anything.

718
00:52:20,364 --> 00:52:22,594
I loved your avarice,

719
00:52:22,894 --> 00:52:24,763
which is why I willingly fell for your lie.

720
00:52:35,043 --> 00:52:36,513
Please...

721
00:52:37,243 --> 00:52:38,813
forgive me.

722
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,844
Forgive?

723
00:52:40,844 --> 00:52:43,854
I admired you for you resembled me.

724
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:47,023
So how would I forgive you?

725
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:53,823
We only need to get rid of
the letter if there is one.

726
00:52:57,634 --> 00:52:59,333
Do not be afraid.

727
00:53:46,844 --> 00:53:49,313
Are you deeply moved...

728
00:53:49,914 --> 00:53:51,654
to be back on Silla land again?

729
00:53:52,114 --> 00:53:55,753
You must have had no idea that
you would return this way.

730
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:57,823
My Lord.

731
00:53:57,823 --> 00:54:01,763
I did not punish you when
Silla was destructed.

732
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:03,434
But you...

733
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:06,733
made a false report on
Goguryeo and the Northern Zhou.

734
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:09,773
Have you forgotten who you are...

735
00:54:09,773 --> 00:54:12,233
and what your duty is?

736
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:14,243
That is not true.

737
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,313
- Please give me another chance.
- Shut it!

738
00:54:23,283 --> 00:54:27,424
Since I am the one who saved
you, I will kill you myself.

739
00:54:27,924 --> 00:54:29,154
My Lord!

740
00:54:30,424 --> 00:54:31,694
What is it?

741
00:54:36,094 --> 00:54:39,364
SILLA, SEORABEOL

742
00:55:11,293 --> 00:55:15,333
KING JINHEUNG, 24TH KING OF SILLA

743
00:55:15,763 --> 00:55:19,303
I, Kim Cha Seung, am here as I was
granted an audience to Your Majesty.

744
00:55:20,743 --> 00:55:22,273
Get up.

745
00:55:28,684 --> 00:55:30,214
Lift your head.

746
00:55:32,513 --> 00:55:35,583
Are you Hae Mo Yong?

747
00:55:36,094 --> 00:55:38,753
Yes, Your Majesty.

748
00:55:48,563 --> 00:55:50,533
King Wideok of Baekje...

749
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:54,174
is a dishonorable man, so I do
not need to worry about him.

750
00:55:54,174 --> 00:55:55,503
DISHONORABLE: A PERSON WHO BRINGS
SHAME OR DISGRACE ON THEMSELVES

751
00:55:55,503 --> 00:55:57,114
King Pyeongwon of Goguryeo...

752
00:55:57,914 --> 00:56:00,813
has been busy looking after himself.

753
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:03,214
So...

754
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:07,954
do you know what gets in the way...

755
00:56:08,023 --> 00:56:10,454
of my great cause to unite the three empires?

756
00:56:11,194 --> 00:56:13,424
How dare I assume anything?

757
00:56:19,664 --> 00:56:23,033
It is Princess Pyeonggang, the
daughter of King Pyeongwon.

758
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:28,973
Whose son is the man...

759
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:30,674
Princess Pyeonggang got married to?

760
00:56:30,674 --> 00:56:34,083
The former chief of the Sunno
Tribe, General On Hyeop.

761
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,854
He defended the border against us.

762
00:56:36,854 --> 00:56:38,354
That is right.

763
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:42,553
She took in the son of a tiger
and made him into a general.

764
00:56:43,124 --> 00:56:45,354
And she helped her powerless father...

765
00:56:45,354 --> 00:56:47,293
to defend her country
against the Northern Zhou.

766
00:56:49,793 --> 00:56:52,394
I am concerned about...

767
00:56:52,394 --> 00:56:54,503
what she will do next.

768
00:56:56,904 --> 00:56:58,333
That means...

769
00:57:08,914 --> 00:57:11,053
For the great cause of the three empires,

770
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:13,083
I want you to return to Goguryeo.

771
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:14,323
And...

772
00:57:16,394 --> 00:57:17,723
kill...

773
00:57:18,694 --> 00:57:19,924
Princess Pyeonggang.

774
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:39,174
It is nice to be gathered together.

775
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,344
Princess, you are here.

776
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:44,684
Hi, you are here.

777
00:57:46,154 --> 00:57:48,323
I thought it was an urgent call.

778
00:57:48,323 --> 00:57:50,694
We wanted you to get some fresh air...

779
00:57:50,694 --> 00:57:52,053
outside Magnolia Hall.

780
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:54,364
The Queen suggested that we gather for tea.

781
00:57:55,364 --> 00:57:57,533
All of us have gathered after a long time.

782
00:57:57,533 --> 00:57:59,934
Do not think much of it and have a seat.

783
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:06,844
The Crown Prince has been
remarkable with his studies.

784
00:58:06,844 --> 00:58:08,144
You are too kind.

785
00:58:08,144 --> 00:58:11,944
Please continue to teach your brother well.

786
00:58:12,313 --> 00:58:13,344
Yes.

787
00:58:15,384 --> 00:58:18,654
Pyeonggang, do you want to see my book?

788
00:58:18,783 --> 00:58:20,924
Show it to me too. I want
to see it, Your Highness.

789
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:24,394
What else have you learned?

790
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,694
Wow, that is amazing.

791
00:59:52,114 --> 00:59:53,884
I checked the ferry Lady Hae uses...

792
00:59:53,944 --> 00:59:56,783
and all the big herb stores in the capital,

793
00:59:56,914 --> 00:59:58,983
but no one has seen her.

794
01:00:00,424 --> 01:00:02,993
Did she soar up to the sky...

795
01:00:03,993 --> 01:00:06,563
or did she sink into the ground?

796
01:00:07,323 --> 01:00:08,563
Lord Hae.

797
01:00:09,493 --> 01:00:12,333
I will go farther outside the
capital to look for her tomorrow.

798
01:00:14,404 --> 01:00:16,973
- Lord Hae.
- Yes?

799
01:00:16,973 --> 01:00:18,333
Lady Hae is back.

800
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:21,604
What? She is back?

801
01:00:26,214 --> 01:00:27,344
Lady Hae!

802
01:00:28,283 --> 01:00:29,513
Mo Yong!

803
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:35,684
- General Go.
- What happened?

804
01:00:38,624 --> 01:00:41,723
Mo Yong! Mo Yong...

805
01:00:42,293 --> 01:00:43,634
Get up.

806
01:00:54,674 --> 01:00:56,644
You found it?

807
01:00:56,773 --> 01:00:58,874
I told you not to be afraid.

808
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,983
It is the grace of the skies.
The skies must have helped.

809
01:01:01,983 --> 01:01:03,884
No, they did not do anything.

810
01:01:03,884 --> 01:01:06,154
It is because you called the
Princess out of Magnolia Hall.

811
01:01:06,354 --> 01:01:07,753
That is not true.

812
01:01:07,983 --> 01:01:11,253
You and I did this together.

813
01:01:18,493 --> 01:01:22,434
Wait. This is not my handwriting.

814
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:27,973
Are you here to exchange love letters?

815
01:01:37,684 --> 01:01:40,624
That looks like my letter though.

816
01:01:43,223 --> 01:01:45,053
What do you think you are doing, Princess?

817
01:01:46,964 --> 01:01:48,493
What about you two?

818
01:01:48,763 --> 01:01:51,263
What is this discreet meeting
at this time of night?

819
01:01:51,864 --> 01:01:54,664
What do you mean? Watch what you say.

820
01:01:54,664 --> 01:01:56,533
The Princess must have gotten us wrong.

821
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:58,033
Stop right there, Go Won Pyo.

822
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:34,471
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

823
01:02:34,604 --> 01:02:36,344
<i>Are you going to keep deceiving me?</i>

824
01:02:36,344 --> 01:02:38,813
<i>You can stop pretending
to be a loyal subject.</i>

825
01:02:38,813 --> 01:02:40,483
<i>I will go against your will...</i>

826
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:43,783
<i>and get rid of everyone who is corrupt.</i>

827
01:02:43,884 --> 01:02:45,414
<i>You need to give it up.</i>

828
01:02:45,884 --> 01:02:48,053
<i>Do not try so hard. Just do one at a time.</i>

829
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:49,894
<i>Do one at a time, enough for you to bear.</i>

830
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:51,624
<i>So why do you not take a break?</i>

831
01:02:51,624 --> 01:02:53,194
<i>I cannot afford to be idle.</i>

832
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:56,533
<i>The general of Hwangju Castle
raised hundreds of soldiers.</i>

833
01:02:56,533 --> 01:02:57,634
<i>I will go.</i>

834
01:02:57,634 --> 01:03:00,333
<i>That is the only way the
Princess will be at ease.</i>

835
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:01,964
<i>Trust me.</i>
