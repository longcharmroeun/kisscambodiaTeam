1
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:07,249
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:09,179
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,719
She only knows her name. Yeom Ga Jin.

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,988
Can you please let her stay here?

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,258
The day Mother died.

6
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:20,359
I must know what happened that day.

7
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:22,828
Whose memorial service is it?

8
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:26,898
Dal is his son. General On Hyeop.

9
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,139
"General On Hyeop"?

10
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:31,808
The Sunno Tribe also suffered for no reason.

11
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:33,578
They were framed for treason.

12
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,849
I have no time for a country bumpkin.

13
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:39,279
I am here to find someone.

14
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:42,319
The Jangbaek herb store!

15
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,448
You left that place along with the princess!

16
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:47,419
She is the daughter of the
king. Princess Pyeonggang.

17
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:52,628
Listen to me carefully.

18
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:56,398
Your life is not yours alone.

19
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,669
The people of the Sunno Tribe
sacrificed their lives to save you.

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,539
If you want to kill yourself,
you need to get their permission.

21
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:06,068
Are you going to stay in this village?

22
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,609
The princess is dead.

23
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:18,449
EPISODE 5

24
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,128
"Pyeonggang".

25
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,699
It is a strong and blessed name.

26
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:33,499
That is your name, Pyeonggang. Do you like it?

27
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,068
There seemed to be circumstances
she could not explain.

28
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,809
I could not bring her with me.

29
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:44,749
But I can tell you this on my life.

30
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,949
It is definitely the Princess.

31
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,288
Does she resent me?

32
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:53,288
No. She did not say anything as such.

33
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,889
She will have grudges.

34
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,529
She will hate her heartless father.

35
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:02,328
Right now, bringing her
back safely is our priority.

36
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,068
If the rebels hear of this...

37
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:06,529
The rebels...

38
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,408
would include Gochuga, right?

39
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,079
My father does not yet know.

40
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,448
How far...

41
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:24,318
can I trust you?

42
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:27,219
You must trust me...

43
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,719
to see the Princess again.

44
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:35,158
I will find a way to bring her back safely.

45
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:37,429
When we are ready,

46
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,938
you just have to give the command.

47
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:57,348
I am a filial and thoughtful son,

48
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:01,589
I do not wish to cause my father concern.

49
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,119
By that, you mean...

50
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,929
I was never in to see the King,

51
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:08,628
and you...

52
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,228
never saw me.

53
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:13,329
I do not know what is going on,

54
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:17,839
but how will you suffer the wrath
if Gochuga were to find out?

55
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,138
Head Eunuch.

56
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,049
That depends on your sly tongue.

57
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:26,978
Speak less...

58
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:29,948
and extend your lifespan.

59
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,138
The King went to Magnolia Hall?

60
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:58,908
I heard he came by suddenly
and took a look around.

61
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:04,549
But that is not the only strange thing.

62
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,719
He was usually drunk on
alcohol or high on drugs.

63
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,858
Today, he touched neither...

64
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:15,258
and stayed in his chambers.

65
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,399
When one acts out of the ordinary,

66
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,098
they say their time here has ended.

67
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,308
You might get your way much easier.

68
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:33,209
Great things do not happen by luck.

69
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:38,319
The King is obsessed with the Princess' ghost.

70
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:42,558
We must turn that fear into reality.

71
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,498
The Princess?

72
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:57,139
The young girl who went missing
when the Queen was killed?

73
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:00,538
Yes. After that, she lost her memory...

74
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:02,509
and lived in Cheonjubang.

75
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:06,678
How could this be?

76
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:09,879
We should throw her out immediately
for the safety of the village.

77
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,759
She said she wished to leave out of guilt.

78
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,389
I am not sure, Chief.

79
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:22,058
What would my father have done?

80
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,798
The general...

81
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,069
would have followed the flow.

82
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:28,598
The flow?

83
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,209
Sometimes one must stay
even if we want them gone,

84
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,238
and one must go even if we ask them to stay.

85
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,408
Do not try to work against nature.

86
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:40,649
But what happened that day
tore our tribe to pieces.

87
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,089
My father died framed and shamed.

88
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,219
That was not the Princess' fault.

89
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,918
I know that, but...

90
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:55,529
I cannot even look at her face now.

91
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:00,399
It is just too hard.

92
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:09,808
Are you home?

93
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:17,019
Where is she? Did she really leave?

94
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:20,418
My goodness.

95
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,658
I thought you had just left.

96
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,759
What is this?

97
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:30,629
On Dal's mother made it
for me. Do I look strange?

98
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:33,029
No, no. It suits you perfectly.

99
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:36,798
Dressed like that, you look like one of us.

100
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,779
Will you stay with us and not go anywhere now?

101
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,879
If only I can.

102
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,509
If you want to, it is done.
What are you worried about?

103
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:48,848
I must throw something away.

104
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,918
Oh? There she comes.

105
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:57,928
The young lady brightened up the whole village.

106
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:00,858
That pretty thing was a killer?

107
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:02,529
That is so dreadful.

108
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,069
She said she quit. Do not bring it up.

109
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,469
Can a meat-eater...

110
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,868
survive on vegetables and herbs alone?

111
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:13,238
I am sure Dal has a lot on his mind.

112
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,209
Will you really not eat?

113
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,048
Where is he?

114
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,519
You stayed up all night,

115
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,889
will not eat all day, or move a finger!

116
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,288
Will you shrivel and die where you lie?

117
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:32,029
You fool!

118
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:34,228
You fool!

119
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,798
You got your way!

120
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:39,868
You brought the girl back,

121
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:41,738
the King's army did not get what they came for.

122
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:43,439
What else is there?

123
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,839
The villagers said they accept
her knowing she was a killer!

124
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,038
What are you so upset about?

125
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,649
You broke your word with
me to leave the mountain,

126
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,779
and you even went to Pyeongyang Castle?

127
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,649
I would love to break your legs,

128
00:07:58,649 --> 00:07:59,949
but I am holding back.

129
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:02,959
I am sorry, Mother.

130
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,488
If you know that, come in and eat.

131
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,668
I should be punished for doing wrong.

132
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,339
Just like we promised.

133
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,738
Dal.

134
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,408
Dal.

135
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:31,848
He is truly captivated.

136
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,059
My gosh.

137
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,758
The well was almost dry, and so is the stream.

138
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:43,159
We might all wither away
if the drought continues.

139
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,598
Let us go higher up.

140
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:48,898
Oh? Dal!

141
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:50,368
What?

142
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,939
Why is he suddenly keeping a distance?

143
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:58,809
Did you and Dal fight?

144
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:00,778
No.

145
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:02,848
As if I have the right to fight him.

146
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,919
I wronged him in many ways.

147
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:09,719
Dal may speak like an uncultured swine,

148
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:12,888
but he is really sweet.

149
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:14,799
He will get over it soon.

150
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,858
Do not worry at all.

151
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:19,699
You just saw him.

152
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:22,268
He is taking his hoe to get punished.

153
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:25,569
To get punished?

154
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,858
Did you promise your mother...

155
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,488
you would work if you ever...

156
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,559
left the mountain again?

157
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,569
You are doing this because of me.

158
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:53,628
I should be the one to get punished.

159
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:06,179
I came to say something upsetting.

160
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:10,549
I will stay in Ghost Valley.

161
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,758
I know I am guilty and being shameless,

162
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,488
but I want to live.

163
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,059
I do not want to go to the palace
where Father acts like I am a ghost.

164
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:24,498
I will no longer...

165
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:27,839
do anything that gets blood on my hands.

166
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:33,738
I will work in the fields,
fell trees, and gather herbs...

167
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:37,409
and live a good life, like you.

168
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,278
If you do not like it and say no,

169
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,248
I will leave.

170
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,569
The stars are not aligned.

171
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,169
What?

172
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,939
The drought will go on for a while.

173
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:07,608
That is why I am digging a
well. It is not because of you.

174
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:11,648
Then are you okay with me
staying at Ghost Valley?

175
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,378
The villagers accepted you.

176
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:17,549
You. What do you think?

177
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:19,089
My thoughts?

178
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:21,459
My thoughts?

179
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,888
I should start thinking how I feel about it.

180
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,839
Are there any leftover iron pieces?

181
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:42,508
Could you add this and melt it all?

182
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,858
Yes. She brought them here herself.

183
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:02,929
She told me to make sickles or
whatever the villagers need.

184
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:07,028
If a killer throws away their blade,
it must mean serious business.

185
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,179
How could it be you?

186
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,679
Your father...

187
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:25,319
killed my father...

188
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,888
and annihilated my tribe.

189
00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:30,289
- Dal.
- Do not ask.

190
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:31,929
You can go...

191
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,598
and find a way to live on your own.

192
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:02,459
You returned from the mountain empty-handed.

193
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,358
Why are you here now?

194
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:06,758
If I am empty-handed,

195
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:08,559
I can carry whatever I find.

196
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,598
The King is up to something.

197
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:15,998
If you do not do something about the Princess,

198
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:17,809
I will get involved myself.

199
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:27,549
You must be busy with politics.

200
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:29,949
Leave it to me, Father.

201
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,108
What brings you here late at night?

202
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,319
I heard you are trading illegal herbs.

203
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:06,348
I came to investigate.

204
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:11,888
This cannot be found in Goguryeo.

205
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:14,699
Did you buy it from Baekje or Silla?

206
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:16,299
You defend our Capital,

207
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,868
and you care about what a herb store sells?

208
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:21,868
If you are smuggling items,
which is against the law,

209
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:24,169
you deserve to be punished.

210
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,839
Even the Five Tribe council
overlooks our trade.

211
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,209
Listen.

212
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,409
I am Head of Capital Defense.

213
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:36,648
Not a puppet of the Five Tribe council.

214
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:43,858
Burn everything.

215
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:45,028
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

216
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,939
Come inside.

217
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,608
To save over 180kg of herbs,

218
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,748
what must a woman do?

219
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:13,748
The information you gave me last time...

220
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:16,559
was useless.

221
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:20,289
I did not catch a wild
animal, let alone an assassin.

222
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:22,998
Did you not?

223
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:28,939
My father pressures me every single day,

224
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:31,569
and I do not know where the assassin is.

225
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,679
So...

226
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:38,909
I need you to help me in secret.

227
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:42,248
What help could the owner of a herb store be?

228
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:45,719
General Go.

229
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:47,758
Through the Head Eunuch,

230
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,689
you are smuggling drugs into the palace.

231
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:53,459
To cloud the King's mind.

232
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,098
You are gradually increasing the dose.

233
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,868
That is not true.

234
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:03,969
I knew it.

235
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,768
You are lying,

236
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,839
and your pulse is still level.

237
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:16,618
- Your jokes are too extreme.
- It is a joke?

238
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,888
I need your cunningness and courage.

239
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:30,799
Your ability to make one...

240
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:32,868
believe a lie.

241
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:07,998
I carved it myself.

242
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:13,609
Anyway, this means that
we are on the same side.

243
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,788
How are you?

244
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,558
What brings you here before breakfast?

245
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:39,469
I wish to return something to On Dal.

246
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,439
Put it over there.

247
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:44,409
He left at the crack of dawn...

248
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:46,068
without eating anything.

249
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,879
Did he go to dig the well?

250
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:52,379
How would I know where he went
when I do not know what he thinks?

251
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:58,048
What is it that you brought?

252
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,048
It is not much.

253
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:03,018
I just do not think I should have it.

254
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:06,288
I will return it to him myself.

255
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,558
Wait, stay where you are.
Can you take this too?

256
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:13,328
He asks for food the moment he wakes,

257
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,599
and he hasn't eaten in a while.

258
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,179
Does he not eat now?

259
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:27,379
Since...

260
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:30,879
you have decided to stay here in Ghost Valley,

261
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:33,119
let me say just one thing.

262
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,719
I am listening.

263
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,889
Please do not cause...

264
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,728
any strife or bloodshed in this valley.

265
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,459
I am sure you went through a lot,

266
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,298
but there is none as pitiful as Dal.

267
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,099
If you ever think something bad might happen,

268
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,439
then please leave then in silence.

269
00:18:57,308 --> 00:18:59,109
Do you get what I am saying?

270
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:02,478
I know why you say this,

271
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,119
but I will not leave.

272
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,988
I owe Dal very much.

273
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,088
I must make it up to the villagers too.

274
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:17,599
I decided to turn a new leaf,

275
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:20,998
and I will show Dal...

276
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:23,639
how determined I am.

277
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,109
The world...

278
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,939
does not always give you what you want.

279
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,449
My goodness.

280
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:45,028
I wonder why you are ignoring Ga Jin.

281
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:49,129
I thought long and hard
and still could not get it,

282
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:51,699
but then I suddenly got it.

283
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:53,568
It is jealousy.

284
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:58,969
The soldier who came to catch her.

285
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,478
My gosh.

286
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,248
The handsome man with the lovely voice.

287
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:08,619
I thought he was here to catch her,

288
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:12,288
but I got this tickling feeling.

289
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:15,389
- So what?
- So...

290
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:18,389
those two have some sort of a relationship.

291
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:22,228
What relationship? Some sort of a relationship.

292
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,469
You noticed that and got upset.

293
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,028
Out of jealousy.

294
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:30,399
Silly. If it were that, I
would actually feel better.

295
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:32,738
Then what is the problem?

296
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,709
There are lots of instances in the world.

297
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:41,619
Stupid instances between people
that people cannot change.

298
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:49,988
You get into a mess when
you are caught in a noose.

299
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:53,988
Is Ga Jin a noose, then?

300
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,399
You are here.

301
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,258
It is such slow going with a hoe.

302
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,268
- Get out.
- Give me the pick.

303
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:34,998
I will dig out a rock for you.

304
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:37,568
I said get out.

305
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:55,088
I should make myself useful
if I am to stay here.

306
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,328
Leave the well to me and eat something.

307
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,328
Your mother is worried you
have been skipping meals.

308
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:13,169
Do not waste food.

309
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,679
I get that you hate me,

310
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,109
but the food is harmless.

311
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,488
I was young then too.

312
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:34,159
I did not know what was going on.

313
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:38,169
It was utter confusion and I was scared.

314
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:40,728
So...

315
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:44,369
why should I be treated like a criminal?

316
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:49,738
I am angry too. It is unfair and I am angry.

317
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:53,209
Still...

318
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:56,619
I hoped that at least you would understand me.

319
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:02,518
Then I could forget my past.

320
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:06,328
I could live happily in Ghost Valley and...

321
00:23:06,328 --> 00:23:07,788
Did I say it is your fault?

322
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,699
It is hard on me too.

323
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:15,038
I worry about you and want to look out for you,

324
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,798
but I cannot.

325
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:19,869
Whenever I see you, I am reminded of my father.

326
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:23,209
I saw him die.

327
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:26,048
I feel guilty...

328
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,119
towards my father and the villagers.

329
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:32,248
"She is the King's daughter."

330
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,518
"But I still like her."

331
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:37,818
That would make me a shameless fool.

332
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:46,369
We did not do anything wrong.

333
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,869
Yet we are being punished.

334
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,609
Thank you for telling me.

335
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,818
I will return this.

336
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,689
I hope you find water soon.

337
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:48,998
I will work in the fields,
fell trees, and gather herbs...

338
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:51,328
and live a good life, like you.

339
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:56,838
Why should I be treated like a criminal?

340
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:01,609
We did not do anything wrong.

341
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,778
Yet we are being punished.

342
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,099
Ga Jin!

343
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:43,179
Do not go.

344
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:46,748
Stay here as Yeom Ga Jin.

345
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:50,258
Work in the fields and gather herbs...

346
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:52,828
and live simply like that.

347
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:10,078
Do whatever you want.

348
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:13,248
You are not a princess or a killer.

349
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,748
You are just Yeom Ga Jin.

350
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,919
Okay?

351
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:25,929
Will you do that?

352
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:31,798
Do you...

353
00:26:33,328 --> 00:26:34,939
forgive me?

354
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,899
Why forgive you when you did nothing wrong?

355
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:47,078
Thank you.

356
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:10,998
I gave a chief of a meager
tribe an important task,

357
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,709
and you have done a terrible job.

358
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:20,278
I gave you time and you still
have not sent the assassin's head.

359
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:23,518
You are bringing upon your own demise.

360
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:28,088
The moment I run out of patience,

361
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:32,389
your dwelling will be
burned down and your life...

362
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:36,028
will be ended, so remember that.

363
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:47,068
Before we kill the King,

364
00:27:48,578 --> 00:27:52,578
we must get rid of Go Won Pyo.

365
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:06,828
Who are you?

366
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,328
Jangbaek herb store's owner
is here to see Gochuga.

367
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:13,568
Report it.

368
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:18,298
What? They brought the assassin's body?

369
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:22,209
Yes. The herb store owner came here in person.

370
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:25,048
That cannot be.

371
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:27,508
Gochuga wishes to see you.

372
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:43,199
The pickers found it washed up downstream.

373
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:47,028
It has swollen grossly, but the features...

374
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,038
looked similar to the face on the posters.

375
00:28:51,838 --> 00:28:54,068
This is unrecognizable.

376
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:56,808
You asked to see me?

377
00:28:57,238 --> 00:29:00,179
You fought her closely,
so you must recognize her.

378
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,318
See if this is the assassin.

379
00:29:02,318 --> 00:29:03,419
I will.

380
00:29:10,488 --> 00:29:11,689
It is her.

381
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:15,528
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

382
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:18,359
This is the assassin I saw at the ceremony.

383
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:24,238
Come inside.

384
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:36,702
You have sharp eyes.

385
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:38,932
I see why your father always boasts about you.

386
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:41,071
That is too grand of a compliment.

387
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:47,842
I must decline the offer.

388
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:50,811
That is not necessary.

389
00:29:51,252 --> 00:29:53,151
We promised a reward in return
for the assassin's head,

390
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:54,522
so you are only getting what you deserve.

391
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:05,631
I did not do it to get paid.

392
00:30:06,032 --> 00:30:09,362
You are always kind and
caring toward our family,

393
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:12,131
so I wanted to do something in return.

394
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:13,672
How praiseworthy of you.

395
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:16,271
I have always wanted to meet you in person...

396
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:17,871
after having heard great things about you.

397
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:22,682
Thanks to her, we were able to avoid trouble.

398
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:28,621
Feel free to visit me
whenever you need my help.

399
00:30:29,182 --> 00:30:30,551
I am honored.

400
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:47,741
The herb store owner has
made a big contribution.

401
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,142
I trust people's greed.

402
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:53,642
Pardon?

403
00:30:55,782 --> 00:30:58,351
An act of kindness to repay one's gratitude.

404
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:02,681
I do not trust those who say things...

405
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:05,351
that are not visible to the eye.

406
00:31:05,892 --> 00:31:09,321
Does that mean something is bothering you?

407
00:31:16,402 --> 00:31:18,372
You found a dead body faster than expected.

408
00:31:19,431 --> 00:31:20,801
There are tons of dead bodies...

409
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:24,071
piled up outside the city walls
due to illnesses and starvation.

410
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:26,241
I had to pick a girl who
was of a similar age...

411
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:28,342
and had to bloat it underwater,
which is what caused the delay.

412
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:32,952
You purposely threw a dead
body underwater to bloat it?

413
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:39,522
You really are relentless.

414
00:31:41,092 --> 00:31:43,562
Are you not the one who asked me
to do something so relentless?

415
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:46,532
I am talking about the man who
made me do the dirty work...

416
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,532
because he did not want anyone
to be suspicious of him.

417
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:51,002
I will repay you for what I owe.

418
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:54,902
You should brace yourself.

419
00:31:57,372 --> 00:31:59,372
I will add a lot of interest.

420
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:13,592
We did great. Nice job.

421
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,432
He yelled and called me a ghost.

422
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:24,101
But then again, he thought I was dead.

423
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:25,972
I would have been startled as well.

424
00:32:25,972 --> 00:32:28,402
But even so, you are his daughter.

425
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:30,742
I would be happy rather than scared.

426
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:34,881
So did you just run away?

427
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:38,782
I may be alive, but I am good as dead.

428
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:40,682
What about your little brother?

429
00:32:40,682 --> 00:32:42,222
Even if we meet again,

430
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:43,752
he will not be able to recognize me.

431
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:49,022
My life in the palace feels like a dream.

432
00:32:51,731 --> 00:32:54,701
My real father and friends...

433
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:57,802
are at Cheonjubang.

434
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:03,872
But that is also useless.

435
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,041
Let us go.

436
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:10,782
- Where?
- Just follow me.

437
00:33:30,002 --> 00:33:31,002
What are you doing?

438
00:33:31,332 --> 00:33:32,432
Can you not tell?

439
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:34,101
I am measuring.

440
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,502
To do what?

441
00:33:36,571 --> 00:33:40,212
My gosh. We need to make one more room.

442
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:44,951
This place is too small for two people.

443
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,421
You are unbelievable.

444
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:50,491
Why would you move here when
you have your own place?

445
00:33:50,692 --> 00:33:52,152
And who says I will let you live here?

446
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:54,921
Do not come near me.

447
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:57,592
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

448
00:33:57,592 --> 00:33:59,392
I told you not to come near me.

449
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:01,702
I think you are mistaken...

450
00:34:09,402 --> 00:34:12,772
Wood? Why do you need wood to dig up a well?

451
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:16,681
Find me one that is long and
sturdy, not one that is bent.

452
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,981
And as for you, make her a straw mattress.

453
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:20,952
I know you cannot afford to
make her a silk mattress,

454
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:22,952
but a straw mattress is not good enough.

455
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:26,152
- What?
- Trust me when it comes to women.

456
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:29,621
I know you are doing this for Ga Jin.

457
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:35,202
Yes, that is right. You all
told her she could stay.

458
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:37,501
So we should keep our word and help her settle.

459
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,001
This is a big step.

460
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:43,301
Did you get your mother's approval?

461
00:34:43,301 --> 00:34:44,811
Why do I need her approval...

462
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:46,342
to bring Ga Jin's father?

463
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:47,382
- What?
- What?

464
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,411
I thought you were moving in with her.

465
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:51,012
I thought you were going to marry her.

466
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,012
"Marry"?

467
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:53,851
- Who? Me?
- Yes.

468
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:54,851
With Ga Jin?

469
00:34:57,822 --> 00:34:59,121
- That is what you want, right?
- You cheeky punk.

470
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:02,421
My gosh, I am already angry
that I got a nosebleed.

471
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:04,061
I will not take this!

472
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:06,192
- So that is not it?
- Were we wrong?

473
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:07,861
You are not going to marry her?

474
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:10,272
- You are not marrying her?
- What kind of nonsense is that?

475
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:23,981
You become so violent every time you get angry.

476
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:26,181
You really need to fix that.

477
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:30,652
You should have been more clear.

478
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:32,692
You were the one who made it sound strange.

479
00:35:32,692 --> 00:35:34,822
I cannot believe you are angry at
me when you are the one who hit me.

480
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:36,491
I am the one with the nosebleed, you know.

481
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:41,301
Are you laughing?

482
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:43,972
Sorry. I will not laugh.

483
00:35:47,142 --> 00:35:48,902
- Hey...
- What now?

484
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:52,272
About bringing my father...

485
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:56,582
- Do you not want him here?
- No, it is not that.

486
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,582
I am grateful for the gesture.

487
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:00,681
But I feel bad toward you and the villagers.

488
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:01,981
You do not need to feel that way.

489
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:04,392
Let us go get him once we
finish digging up the well.

490
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,192
Until then, we can fix the house.

491
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:10,192
Dal.

492
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:14,462
You are doing everything for me.

493
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:15,702
Is there anything I can do for you?

494
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:17,931
Just tell me anything you want.

495
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:19,702
I will do anything I can.

496
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:25,871
It is something very difficult.

497
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:28,712
Will you be okay with it?

498
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:31,952
What is it?

499
00:36:38,452 --> 00:36:40,921
Live a normal life, Ga Jin.

500
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:43,322
That is what you wished for.

501
00:36:46,262 --> 00:36:47,632
How lame.

502
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:49,101
I already promised you that.

503
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:51,972
A promise holds no power.

504
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:54,072
Sticking to your word is the difficult part.

505
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:58,541
Are you sure you will never kill anyone again?

506
00:37:00,582 --> 00:37:03,851
I threw away all my weapons.

507
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:06,282
Even if your life is at risk?

508
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:10,152
I will no longer do anything
to cover my hands with blood.

509
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:13,561
- Then what about this?
- Gosh.

510
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:15,592
I already apologized.

511
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:20,962
Ga Jin.

512
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:30,712
You deserve to be happy now.

513
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:34,181
Do not worry about anything else.

514
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:36,642
Just do what is best for you.

515
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:07,412
He is waiting.

516
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:08,912
Hurry up and check.

517
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:09,912
Yes.

518
00:38:44,582 --> 00:38:46,111
It is not her.

519
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:00,162
Are you sure?

520
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,501
It is not her.

521
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:03,932
She is of a similar age.

522
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:07,001
But she is a completely different person.

523
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:13,212
She is not the Princess?

524
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:15,042
I am sure...

525
00:39:16,582 --> 00:39:17,981
it is not her.

526
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,322
Take her out.

527
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:33,092
I am sure she is mistaken.

528
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:38,072
She is the assassin... No.

529
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:40,741
She is the Princess.

530
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:45,212
She swore to stay loyal to me
to protect the Crown Prince.

531
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:47,981
There is no reason for her to lie.

532
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:49,281
Then...

533
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:53,582
are you saying I am lying to you?

534
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:58,021
You are my son, and you seem certain.

535
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:00,722
- So I will have to believe you.
- Father.

536
00:40:00,722 --> 00:40:02,962
Learn how to keep away from trouble.

537
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:07,261
Otherwise, you will shed blood.

538
00:40:42,662 --> 00:40:44,472
The well is all dried up.

539
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:49,371
I may not be able to see, but it hears like it.

540
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:52,972
I have water at my house. I will give you some.

541
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:55,812
No, it is okay. I will ask Dal to bring water.

542
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:58,582
He went to check the traps he set.

543
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,292
He never tells me where he goes.

544
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:32,182
What is this vegetable?

545
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:34,621
I bet they will taste nice with seasoning.

546
00:41:36,521 --> 00:41:39,521
I may be blind, but I can hear
well and have a healthy body.

547
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:41,192
So do not pity me so much.

548
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:43,422
No, I do not pity you.

549
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:46,062
Then what?

550
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:50,432
Are you trying to repay Dal for his kindness?

551
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:54,442
There is no need.

552
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:56,501
You are not the only person he is kind to.

553
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,212
Gosh, look at you.

554
00:42:00,582 --> 00:42:01,812
You should be with your mother.

555
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:04,712
What are you doing here all alone?

556
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:10,991
Go on.

557
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:16,621
He was born with a kind heart.

558
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:18,891
Whether it is humans or animals,

559
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:21,261
he is not able to ignore...

560
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:23,031
those who have nowhere to go.

561
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:25,871
He has a heart like no other.

562
00:42:28,942 --> 00:42:30,771
But how is that possible?

563
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:33,011
What do you mean?

564
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:37,351
I heard his family and villagers...

565
00:42:38,052 --> 00:42:40,082
ended up dying a miserable death.

566
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:44,692
I am sure he felt resentful.

567
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:48,491
How could he not feel the urge to take revenge?

568
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:52,092
Has he forgotten...

569
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:55,501
about what happened that day?

570
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:03,302
Life would be easier if we could
forget what we wanted to forget.

571
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:06,972
He is merely trying his
best to put it past him.

572
00:43:07,682 --> 00:43:09,312
Every time he thinks of that day,

573
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:13,851
he becomes heartbroken and furious.

574
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:18,952
But he suppresses that
and puts it behind him...

575
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:20,922
because he wants to be a decent human being.

576
00:43:32,771 --> 00:43:34,302
"A decent human being".

577
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:49,651
Are you here to keep an eye on me?

578
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:55,391
I know I promised to share
rabbit meat, but I take it back.

579
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:57,662
I am not lying. Look.

580
00:43:57,932 --> 00:43:59,332
I could not catch any.

581
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:01,231
I can see that. I am disappointed.

582
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:04,631
Gosh, just eat vegetables.

583
00:44:04,631 --> 00:44:06,271
That is healthier for you.

584
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,472
I grew up eating dried radish
greens and dried radish.

585
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:11,212
And look at how energetic I am.

586
00:44:11,312 --> 00:44:13,442
- You and your excuses.
- I am serious.

587
00:44:14,412 --> 00:44:17,452
We will never get to eat meat
if we continue to trust you.

588
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:19,682
From now on, leave the hunting to me.

589
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:22,351
We should also get rid of the
stones from the green farm.

590
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:23,781
The ladies seem to be having a hard time.

591
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:26,651
And when we dry herbs, we
should all do it together.

592
00:44:26,651 --> 00:44:27,962
That will save time.

593
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:31,962
What? is there a problem?

594
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:33,131
No, it is not that.

595
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:39,802
Were you always this talkative?

596
00:44:42,542 --> 00:44:44,111
You are even beating people now?

597
00:44:46,472 --> 00:44:48,812
Let us take time with fixing the house.

598
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:51,281
The well is more urgent,
so we should dig it up.

599
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:52,552
I will help with that too.

600
00:44:56,351 --> 00:44:59,922
Gosh, you talk like you are one of us now.

601
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:04,031
Or are you a fox pretending to be Ga Jin...

602
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:05,662
so that you can eat my liver?

603
00:45:15,202 --> 00:45:16,401
Goodness.

604
00:45:27,052 --> 00:45:30,021
Ga Jin really hid herself well.

605
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:33,092
I cannot even guess where she might be.

606
00:45:33,592 --> 00:45:35,222
I wonder where I can find her.

607
00:45:35,891 --> 00:45:40,292
Therefore, you must take her
place and do her job instead.

608
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:42,932
Chief.

609
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:45,932
If we keep delaying it, Go
Won Pyo will kill us all.

610
00:45:45,932 --> 00:45:48,342
Leave it to me. I will take care of it.

611
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:50,042
What makes you think I am going to ask you?

612
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:00,511
This is a very important task.

613
00:46:00,851 --> 00:46:02,021
You must hurry.

614
00:46:02,582 --> 00:46:03,582
- We will.
- We will.

615
00:46:14,202 --> 00:46:15,202
We should go.

616
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:27,481
Once we arrive at Pyeongyang Castle,

617
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:29,682
we do not know how things will unfold.

618
00:46:29,842 --> 00:46:33,111
We will not be able to take
care of you any longer.

619
00:46:33,281 --> 00:46:35,422
Do you have a dangerous mission?

620
00:46:35,622 --> 00:46:36,781
That is not it.

621
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:39,852
Gosh. It is better to check all corners.

622
00:46:39,852 --> 00:46:43,061
You have nothing to worry
about. Go and stay with Ga Jin.

623
00:46:48,531 --> 00:46:52,602
I also consider you guys as my own children.

624
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:56,442
Whatever it is, please take care of yourselves.

625
00:46:57,341 --> 00:47:00,811
There is a village named Ghost
Valley at Mount Daeseong.

626
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:02,581
"Ghost Valley"?

627
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:47,622
I have a gate, so people
do not jump over the walls.

628
00:47:57,162 --> 00:47:59,771
Why do you need to talk to me
without letting people know?

629
00:48:02,902 --> 00:48:04,172
Depending on your answer,

630
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:08,041
I might have to take your life.

631
00:48:08,241 --> 00:48:11,981
I heard that Gochuga is
suspecting the corpse to be fake.

632
00:48:12,781 --> 00:48:15,321
It was very difficult to earn his trust.

633
00:48:15,481 --> 00:48:17,952
But I may be seen as a schemer and get blamed.

634
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:22,422
You already knew the identity
of the assassin, did you not?

635
00:48:22,722 --> 00:48:24,091
You would not return after making
the trip to Mount Daeseong...

636
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:25,692
without finding out anything.

637
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:29,202
As long as the assassin is not the Princess,

638
00:48:32,972 --> 00:48:34,702
the identity of the corpse does not matter.

639
00:48:34,702 --> 00:48:36,702
I cannot trust you.

640
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:44,551
You served those awful drugs to the King.

641
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:48,321
But you helped his daughter get away.

642
00:48:49,521 --> 00:48:51,051
Whose side are you on?

643
00:48:57,862 --> 00:49:00,031
I fear Gochuga.

644
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:04,202
I understand that there are Five Tribes.

645
00:49:05,672 --> 00:49:08,172
But we, the Sono Tribe,
cannot go against him...

646
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:13,041
because if we do, it will not
end with a few drops of blood.

647
00:49:13,442 --> 00:49:16,281
Is that why you are trying
to get on every tribe's side,

648
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:20,612
so you can come up with a way to survive?

649
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:21,852
You are correct.

650
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:26,821
He has already slain innocent
people of our tribe in the past.

651
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:30,021
And the Queen died from a
false accusation as well.

652
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:31,091
Shut your mouth!

653
00:49:37,031 --> 00:49:39,872
My father was ordered by the King...

654
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:42,702
and only subdued the plot of treason.

655
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:45,612
Even the King fears Gochuga.

656
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:49,212
Now, he is trying to murder a princess.

657
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:55,152
You will be forced to make
a decision soon enough.

658
00:49:58,222 --> 00:50:01,091
Will you follow in your father's
footsteps onto a blood-stained path?

659
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:04,632
Or will you embark on your own path?

660
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:36,922
Are you fighting with the
rock? You are so foolish.

661
00:50:36,922 --> 00:50:38,192
I am okay. I can do it.

662
00:50:38,192 --> 00:50:39,491
Do not move.

663
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:41,801
If you damage your nails,
it will inconvenience you.

664
00:50:42,932 --> 00:50:44,902
Hey, I said I was fine.

665
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:49,372
I think you got the wrong spot.

666
00:50:49,372 --> 00:50:52,472
We have been digging for a while,
and we only see rocks, not water.

667
00:50:53,972 --> 00:50:57,712
Do you not know the saying,
"Sincerity is the way to paradise"?

668
00:50:59,281 --> 00:51:02,521
There is a saying that goes,
"Pour water into a cracked pot."

669
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,152
Let us see which one of us is right.

670
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:08,061
Hey, you will hurt your hands.
That is enough. Stop it.

671
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,291
Hey!

672
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:10,892
Stop it.

673
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:14,632
Hey! What is it? Are you okay?

674
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:16,501
Where did you get hurt? Let me see.

675
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:17,702
Hey.

676
00:51:17,972 --> 00:51:19,372
Come on.

677
00:51:26,942 --> 00:51:28,811
Well, I did not hurt my hand.

678
00:51:29,382 --> 00:51:30,581
But it feels better.

679
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:34,981
You teased me about it.

680
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:36,581
But you were the one fighting with the rock.

681
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:39,021
Look.

682
00:51:48,602 --> 00:51:50,001
I won.

683
00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:52,331
That is amazing.

684
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:06,051
This is nice.

685
00:52:07,682 --> 00:52:09,821
Everything I am seeing and hearing here...

686
00:52:10,122 --> 00:52:11,452
makes me think I am dreaming.

687
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:12,722
Dream?

688
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:16,061
Yes. If I were dreaming,

689
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:18,231
I would never want to wake up.

690
00:52:20,392 --> 00:52:22,761
"I want to keep dreaming to the end of time."

691
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:25,372
Then, sleep all you want.

692
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:26,831
I will not wake you up.

693
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:30,241
I will really go to sleep here.

694
00:52:30,341 --> 00:52:31,472
Knock yourself out.

695
00:53:03,872 --> 00:53:07,412
Do you remember a long time ago,
you and I sat on a rock like this?

696
00:53:08,682 --> 00:53:10,442
You bragged about your carved wooden horse.

697
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:12,182
Do you remember what you insisted that day?

698
00:53:12,182 --> 00:53:15,422
That you would become the ruler
and reign over the entire empire.

699
00:53:16,722 --> 00:53:18,892
And you said you would become a general.

700
00:53:22,962 --> 00:53:24,061
Do you still...

701
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:26,491
want to become the ruler?

702
00:53:26,932 --> 00:53:28,402
I was young back then.

703
00:53:29,362 --> 00:53:32,432
Now, everything seems so far-off.

704
00:53:33,872 --> 00:53:37,071
Right. That is what you need to do.

705
00:53:38,142 --> 00:53:40,212
Get rid of bad memories little by little.

706
00:53:40,212 --> 00:53:42,011
And fill your life with something good.

707
00:53:42,412 --> 00:53:43,412
What about you?

708
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:45,912
Did you get rid of all the bad memories?

709
00:53:48,882 --> 00:53:50,652
Far from it.

710
00:53:52,152 --> 00:53:53,152
Not yet.

711
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:16,311
This is so nice!

712
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:35,801
What is the point of wielding
your sword into the thin air?

713
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:43,202
You should have taken the assassin's
life when you had the chance.

714
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,172
No matter how hard I push myself,

715
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,912
I do not have the guts to
kill a princess of an empire.

716
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:53,112
But I know that you had done the
deed yourself a long time ago.

717
00:55:12,071 --> 00:55:13,501
Let me teach you something.

718
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:24,811
A sword attracts blood.

719
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:27,912
If that scares you, I advise
you to hold onto a sickle.

720
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:30,622
Where the sword points at is also important.

721
00:55:32,352 --> 00:55:34,591
Did you really point the sword at the Queen...

722
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:36,291
when it should have slain our enemies?

723
00:55:45,402 --> 00:55:48,571
My decision was solely for our family's sake.

724
00:55:49,872 --> 00:55:52,172
It was back then and still is.

725
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:54,241
But you...

726
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:57,882
lied to your own father,
blinded by your affection.

727
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:03,652
Yes.

728
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:06,192
I am...

729
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:08,462
your foolish son.

730
00:56:10,922 --> 00:56:13,331
Starting tomorrow, you will resign
as the Head of Capital Defense.

731
00:57:29,972 --> 00:57:30,972
Who is there?

732
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:46,751
- Are you all right?
- Catch them!

733
00:57:48,462 --> 00:57:49,561
Assassins!

734
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:03,472
Go now. Hurry!

735
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:38,341
You are the hunting dogs from Cheonjubang.

736
00:58:46,682 --> 00:58:49,952
Mother, I am on my way to
carry out my punishment.

737
00:58:50,481 --> 00:58:53,122
If you have to carry out your punishment again,

738
00:58:53,122 --> 00:58:54,551
you might end up with a bride.

739
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:58,862
Gosh. Do not ruin my great
morning with such an absurd claim.

740
00:58:59,061 --> 00:59:00,061
Here.

741
00:59:02,432 --> 00:59:03,702
Why is it so heavy?

742
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:06,932
If you share your meal with
her, it will not be filling.

743
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:18,652
When my dear husband is returning

744
00:59:18,912 --> 00:59:21,821
- There was
- He is ridiculous.

745
00:59:28,321 --> 00:59:30,462
- Ga Jin.
- What?

746
00:59:30,462 --> 00:59:32,662
Once we get the well going,
you should go home first.

747
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:34,231
We can fix the house in due time,

748
00:59:34,231 --> 00:59:35,962
but you should bring your father first.

749
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:37,662
What if we never get the well going?

750
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:40,731
My father might die from waiting.

751
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:42,642
Do not jinx it.

752
00:59:45,942 --> 00:59:46,942
Move.

753
00:59:55,981 --> 00:59:56,981
Hey!

754
00:59:57,652 --> 00:59:58,852
You...

755
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:07,031
What?

756
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:09,261
Hey!

757
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:10,331
Hey. Gosh.

758
01:00:10,831 --> 01:00:13,432
This is... It is...

759
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:15,172
Hey!

760
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:16,942
Water!

761
01:00:17,102 --> 01:00:19,511
We have water! Water!

762
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:20,571
- Water!
- Yes!

763
01:00:21,112 --> 01:00:23,511
Hey, what did I tell you?

764
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:25,511
I said we would find water here. Take a look.

765
01:00:25,511 --> 01:00:27,051
Okay. Stop bragging.

766
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:29,051
Water! We have water!

767
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:49,142
Well, I will go and bring the people.

768
01:00:49,402 --> 01:00:50,501
Wait here.

769
01:00:51,142 --> 01:00:52,142
Okay.

770
01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:04,251
Did you find water?

771
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:46,662
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

772
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,702
<i>The people in our village
are happy to have you.</i>

773
01:01:49,702 --> 01:01:52,031
<i>Perhaps, the Princess ended up here...</i>

774
01:01:52,031 --> 01:01:55,472
<i>to tell us to forget about our
past and live our lives in peace.</i>

775
01:01:55,472 --> 01:01:57,801
<i>Do not be rash and think of revenge.</i>

776
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:00,041
<i>Locate the Princess first.</i>

777
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:03,841
<i>We must be more cautious of
the Princess than the King.</i>

778
01:02:04,112 --> 01:02:06,882
<i>If her nature resembles her late mother's,</i>

779
01:02:06,882 --> 01:02:10,281
<i>her claws will hurt us pretty soon.</i>

780
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:11,952
<i>How dare you lay your hand on me?</i>

781
01:02:12,452 --> 01:02:14,452
<i>I am the eldest daughter of the King...</i>

782
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:16,521
<i>and carry on the bloodline of the late Queen.</i>

783
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:18,122
<i>I am Princess Pyeonggang.</i>
