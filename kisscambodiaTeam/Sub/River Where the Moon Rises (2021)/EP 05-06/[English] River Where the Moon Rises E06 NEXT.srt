1
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:07,343
THIS IS BASED ON THE TALE OF ON DAL
IN CHRONICLES OF THE THREE STATES.

2
00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:09,183
CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, AND DATES
DO NOT MATCH HISTORICAL FACTS.

3
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:12,143
Stop where you are. Hey!

4
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:13,342
EPISODE 6

5
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:15,312
Darn you.

6
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:30,292
Well, I will go and bring the people.

7
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,792
Wait here.

8
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:33,332
Okay.

9
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:45,572
Did you find water?

10
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:13,132
It is true! There is water!

11
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,502
- There is water?
- That is amazing!

12
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:19,873
When did Dal ever tell a lie?

13
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:21,112
- Never.
- Right.

14
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:23,653
I did not believe it. How
did you manage on your own?

15
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:25,912
I had Ga Jin's help.

16
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:29,953
Let us not waste time.
We should widen the hole.

17
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:32,522
We finally have more water.

18
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:34,763
Why are there so many rocks?

19
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,222
Why are you coming from that way?

20
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:41,332
Should I pee in the open, then?

21
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:47,873
Hey, Ga Jin! You did so well!

22
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:51,143
- We should get more buckets.
- Sure.

23
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:02,623
You met Ga Jin?

24
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,393
You can take a horse or cattle to a stream,

25
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,862
but you cannot make them drink.

26
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:12,332
I need Ga Jin to thirst,

27
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,663
so I sprinkled some salt.

28
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:18,872
Chief. Kill me instead...

29
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,943
and please, let Ga Jin go.

30
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,473
Who will die?

31
00:02:25,443 --> 00:02:27,883
I am trying to save everyone's life.

32
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,812
To save the twins,

33
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:37,592
Ga Jin will have to kill again.

34
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:42,923
Stop.

35
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:52,473
Your chief sent you, did he not?

36
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:57,342
I know nothing about any chief.

37
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:01,483
That is right. We are just small thieves.

38
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,913
Where did you hide the
assassin during the ceremony?

39
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,782
Assassin? What assassin?

40
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:09,652
You keep asking things we
do not know the answers to.

41
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:15,723
Stop! I will kill you!

42
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:18,492
I will kill you! Please.

43
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:19,862
Stop!

44
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:22,862
We will see how long you last.

45
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:26,233
I have more than enough clubs and sticks.

46
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,913
You must go to sleep.

47
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:43,383
I will when I feel like it.

48
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:45,622
If you are not at ease,

49
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,122
that will cause our nation concern.

50
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,122
Queen.

51
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:56,233
Do you remember the Princess?

52
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,173
The Princess?

53
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,302
Who do you speak of?

54
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,842
Pyeonggang.

55
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:08,582
My most favorite daughter.

56
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,712
The child I lost.

57
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:16,053
Why would you suddenly...

58
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,953
speak of the Princess?

59
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:20,922
I miss her...

60
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,863
even more today.

61
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,902
Since you hallucinated in the library,

62
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,003
you are not in your right mind.

63
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,633
You must sleep deeply tonight.

64
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:35,472
- I will bring some medicine.
- Leave it.

65
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:39,513
More than medicine,

66
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:44,152
I hoped for a warm word from you.

67
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:49,453
Forget about it.

68
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,073
The Princess is alive.

69
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:13,373
I will find a way to bring her back safely.

70
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:15,313
When we are ready,

71
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,652
you just have to give the command.

72
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:29,422
- We have more water now.
- The water is so clear.

73
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,933
Dal, have a drink.

74
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,633
- This is so precious.
- We have water again.

75
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,933
- Do not waste a drop.
- This is so valuable.

76
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,873
It has been so long since we had water.

77
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:48,383
Here you go. Drink all you want.

78
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:55,782
- There is so much now.
- Yes.

79
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,092
- You worked hard. Refresh yourself.
- Thanks.

80
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,962
They brought more. This is so nice.

81
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,102
It is good to have water.

82
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,672
On Hyeop's son took you in.

83
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,672
Karma works in strange ways.

84
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:19,113
How long have you known?

85
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:23,243
Did you send me to the ceremony...

86
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,553
knowing who I was?

87
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:28,183
If the daughter killed her father,

88
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,123
Goguryeo would have fallen into
turmoil and never recovered.

89
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,522
It is a pity it did not happen.

90
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:38,493
- How could you...
- It is easy to kill me,

91
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,832
but then Yeom Deuk will die too.

92
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:45,532
Even now, he shaves salt...

93
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:47,503
as he waits for you.

94
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,943
You rested for long enough.

95
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:53,912
Return to Cheonjubang now.

96
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,282
I said I will never kill again.

97
00:06:57,412 --> 00:07:00,823
Then do you want to return
to the foolish King...

98
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:02,323
to play being a princess?

99
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:05,693
I have given up both killing
and being a princess.

100
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:10,592
I will live quietly on this mountain.

101
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:18,672
This is where cowards who do not have...

102
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,943
the courage to die live in hiding.

103
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:24,272
And Ga Jin you wish to live like that?

104
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:29,183
Do not fight your fate.

105
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:31,712
Even before I took you in,

106
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:35,623
you were destined to bring down Goguryeo.

107
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,222
Please leave.

108
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:46,292
I will get into trouble
if the villagers see us.

109
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:49,662
You are afraid.

110
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,573
You are afraid to face...

111
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:54,503
the King's crimes and the corrupt world.

112
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:56,842
I will not miss this time.

113
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:04,313
You found water,

114
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:06,852
but not yet a way to survive.

115
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:11,852
Go Won Pyo captured Tara San and Tara Jin.

116
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,792
They were looking for you
and then took your place.

117
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,763
The decision is yours to make.

118
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:21,933
Will you remain here and play house...

119
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:25,332
or return to Cheonjubang?

120
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,243
"The rules of a king are like a rock."

121
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,143
"They are weighty and never change."

122
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:14,052
"Also, the rules of a
king are like a blue sky."

123
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:16,353
"The depth cannot be fathomed."

124
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:21,822
Is the writing hard to read
or are you afraid of me?

125
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:24,062
No.

126
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,202
I am just...

127
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:28,702
Just what?

128
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,402
I am not used to...

129
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:33,802
seeing you sober.

130
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:42,812
Crown Prince.

131
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:44,753
Yes, Father.

132
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:49,682
Do you remember your sister?

133
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:51,792
My sister?

134
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:55,223
I do not remember much of her.

135
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:59,763
Only that she gave me a candy
before she left to patrol.

136
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:06,932
A candy?

137
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:09,743
I see.

138
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,013
These are so beautiful.

139
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,652
To see that you are this
pleased, Your Highness,

140
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:25,253
I am even more grateful.

141
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,493
Not at all.

142
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:29,322
I received an unexpected but great gift.

143
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,292
What should I do?

144
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:35,532
I like this and I like that too.

145
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:37,503
Pick what you want.

146
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,873
Can I really?

147
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,272
Your name is Mo Yong?

148
00:10:45,113 --> 00:10:46,213
Yes.

149
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:49,182
The gifts you brought
show you have great taste,

150
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,213
but I am pleased that you care for my son.

151
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,282
I am honored.

152
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:56,682
I heard your daughter is good with money.

153
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,192
You must rely on her a lot.

154
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:03,093
She also has great knowledge
of herbs and medicine.

155
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:06,932
Keep her close and she will
be of great use to you.

156
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:17,172
We spent way too much money.

157
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:21,682
She would have been pleased with
something that cost half that much.

158
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:24,613
Small branches create more smoke than flames.

159
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:27,753
To light a fire, you must use firewood.

160
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:31,123
Will that fire melt Gochuga's heart too?

161
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:34,792
He does not easily give his trust.

162
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,562
Even he who conquers the world...

163
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,593
is powerless against talk shared in the bed.

164
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:43,973
Then are the rumors that...

165
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:47,672
the two are having an affair true?

166
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:51,343
I thought the King was the
only one oblivious to the fact.

167
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:54,343
Are you ignorant as well, Father?

168
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:55,542
My goodness.

169
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:13,963
What are they all flocking
over to plot this time?

170
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,003
We must gain Gochuga's
trust as soon as possible.

171
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,672
Only then can we join in the plotting.

172
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,213
The Princess is alive?

173
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,643
Is that really true?

174
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,682
Yes.

175
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:33,883
I am positive.

176
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:40,652
Gochuga.

177
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:43,662
What do you think?

178
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,463
If the Princess we held
the ceremony for is alive,

179
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:51,032
then we should be thankful for the miracle.

180
00:12:56,873 --> 00:13:00,072
Who brought you the great news?

181
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,412
That is not important.

182
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:06,853
The fact that the Princess is alive...

183
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:09,652
could perhaps...

184
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:14,393
become a problem down the line.

185
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:20,802
We must decide on preventative measures,

186
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,662
and that is why I summoned you.

187
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:26,633
The nation would rejoice at the news.

188
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,503
Why would it be a problem?

189
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:32,243
Yes. That is utterly unreasonable.

190
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,412
When the Princess disappeared,

191
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,452
many people died or got hurt.

192
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:43,552
If word of that were to spread again,

193
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,292
it could cause trouble.

194
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,692
I will prevent groundless talk.

195
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,233
You need not worry.

196
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,333
Then...

197
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,432
find the Princess first.

198
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:02,442
General Go.

199
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:04,772
Yes, Your Majesty?

200
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,013
I trust in you.

201
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:12,353
Thank you.

202
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:30,763
You have the King's trust.

203
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:32,873
He called you to discuss an important matter.

204
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,143
I am still a bit flustered.

205
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:39,013
I just cannot believe it.

206
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,883
The Princess is alive?

207
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:45,483
The King has shown his
intention. That is good enough.

208
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:47,522
Pardon?

209
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:50,322
He is afraid the Princess will return.

210
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,952
A daughter who remembers
her father's ugly actions.

211
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,863
She is no longer an offspring.

212
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,292
She is a bringer of death.

213
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:18,952
I heard that Dal...

214
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:23,282
told only you who I am, Chief.

215
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:31,263
I would like to ask you about something.

216
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,763
- Come inside.
- That day...

217
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,162
Did you remain in the village
with General On Hyeop?

218
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:43,103
- Yes, I did.
- Then did you...

219
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,942
see the last of...

220
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,613
my mother?

221
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,623
After Dal and I left for Yibullansa,

222
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,192
what happened?

223
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,822
That is what I wish to know.

224
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,733
It is all in the past.

225
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,532
What would you do with that knowledge?

226
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:15,072
Was Gyeru Tribe's Go Won Pyo...

227
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,442
there that day?

228
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,552
He was, right?

229
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,243
Go Won Pyo.

230
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:51,272
Withdraw your troops right now.

231
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:55,483
Do you think you will be able to
get away with killing the queen?

232
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:58,682
His Majesty was the person who told me...

233
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,853
to kill you.

234
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:29,742
Your Majesty.

235
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:39,222
I will not forgive you even after I die.

236
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:44,462
You will never be able to take over Goguryeo.

237
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,293
Goguryeo is...

238
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,502
already mine.

239
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,603
Your Majesty!

240
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,043
The Queen...

241
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,512
remained with the Sunno Tribe until the end.

242
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:09,752
She did not give in to the treachery.

243
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,133
Thank you.

244
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,172
Something had been plaguing me.

245
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,702
You just cleared my head.

246
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,442
Princess.

247
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:35,442
Do not think of getting revenge.

248
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:38,512
You might be here now
because the late Queen...

249
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,482
wishes you forget the past and live quietly.

250
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,623
Dal said something similar.

251
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,133
Do not worry.

252
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:03,843
Now that we have a new well,

253
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:06,143
to welcome Ga Jin to the village,

254
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:07,843
we should kill a few chickens.

255
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:10,643
How far do you think a few chickens will go?

256
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,353
A pig. We should slaughter a pig.

257
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,682
That is worth a feast.

258
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:17,722
If you eat too much meat during a drought,

259
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:18,992
you could get sick.

260
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,952
That is so disgusting.

261
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,922
Buy her a sewing kit.

262
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:26,462
Would she like something like that?

263
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,702
I had a look around her house.

264
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,863
She does not have a mirror.

265
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,932
- A mirror?
- A woman...

266
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:35,202
needs a mirror in the house.

267
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:37,672
Ga Jin does not care for that.

268
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:41,412
How can you know so little about women?

269
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:43,712
No woman dislikes putting on makeup...

270
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:45,452
or wearing accessories...

271
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:48,583
Right. Where is the necklace?

272
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,982
I did not see her wearing it.

273
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:54,192
I think she threw it away.

274
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,523
Why would she throw away
something that valuable?

275
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:59,093
She had her knives and daggers melted too.

276
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,432
She wanted to get rid of her old things.

277
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:07,232
She must have a lot on her mind too.

278
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,422
The decision is yours to make.

279
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:25,452
Will you remain here and play house...

280
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:28,192
or return to Cheonjubang?

281
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,962
Do not think of getting revenge.

282
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:33,363
You might be here now
because the late Queen...

283
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,402
wishes you forget the past and live quietly.

284
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:52,583
It is dark. Are you looking at the moon?

285
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:55,823
Why are you here?

286
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,853
Tell me if you need anything.

287
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,023
What?

288
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:03,623
I am going into the city to
sell animal hides and herbs.

289
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,863
Do you need any tools or household items?

290
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:09,962
- No.
- Are you sure?

291
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:12,502
Do not complain later on.

292
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,202
Have a safe trip.

293
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,273
Okay.

294
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:29,583
You have been acting strange since yesterday.

295
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:32,652
- How so?
- You will not speak to me.

296
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,492
You are always on your own.

297
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:37,393
Why is that?

298
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:41,333
Do not blame the innocent. I never did that.

299
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,603
Then what is it?

300
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:46,502
Did I do something to upset you?

301
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:50,773
You must be bored. Go home.

302
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,212
Go.

303
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:19,103
I remember this feeling.

304
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:33,783
Ga Jin.

305
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,722
The villagers...

306
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:39,452
are pleased you are here.

307
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:42,722
Not to mention me.

308
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:47,033
So do not get any ideas.

309
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:51,773
I wish you enjoy your life here.

310
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:16,992
An unidentified killer attacked Go Won Pyo...

311
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,432
but failed.

312
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,033
Things in Goguryeo...

313
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,262
Mo Yong. Why are you still here?

314
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:27,672
Did you not say you would trade with someone?

315
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:30,643
I was just about to leave.

316
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,273
Right now, while you are about to leave,

317
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:36,742
some others will have already made bargains.

318
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:39,952
Riches are fleeting.

319
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,883
They only stay with those who move fast.

320
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:46,053
Would I forget something you
said until my ears would bleed?

321
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,863
The negotiations are done. I
just have to check the items.

322
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:53,293
Even if you find even one
flaw, haggle the price down.

323
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:56,402
No. I will haggle even if there are no flaws.

324
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:00,773
Yes.

325
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,553
I do not need anything.

326
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,432
Do herb shop owners...

327
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,672
frequent bars as well?

328
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:09,573
I heard this place makes
good money and might buy it.

329
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:17,643
If it will make you money,

330
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,883
you will do anything.

331
00:25:22,152 --> 00:25:25,393
I am truly impressed.

332
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,563
I did not know you were
bored enough to drink alone.

333
00:25:34,563 --> 00:25:35,962
It is the opposite.

334
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:41,502
I have so much to do, my head might explode.

335
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:45,273
Shall I share my meager wisdom?

336
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:46,373
Why?

337
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:51,912
Do you want to know why I met the King?

338
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,952
Once I tell you,

339
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,883
you will weigh things out
to decide whom to side with.

340
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,922
No, thank you.

341
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:08,432
Are you concerned for the Princess?

342
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,103
Gochuga wants to kill her...

343
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,472
and you wish to protect her.

344
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:17,942
You are torn.

345
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,773
It is none of your business.

346
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:22,643
I do not wish to care, but it bothers me.

347
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:27,252
Because you are suffering.

348
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:40,063
I hope the Princess decides to return.

349
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:44,162
She is the King's daughter.

350
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,033
Pyeongyang Castle is where she belongs.

351
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:49,972
I will make it so.

352
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:51,942
You are determined.

353
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,412
Is that out of love...

354
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:01,982
or out of loyalty?

355
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:03,982
It is both.

356
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:13,462
You said I must make a choice.

357
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,803
Whether I will follow my father...

358
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:20,373
and take a path drenched in blood or not.

359
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:24,972
You are clever, so make a guess.

360
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:27,643
Do you...

361
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:32,912
smell blood on me?

362
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,652
General.

363
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:57,803
I was demoted from Head of Capital Defense.

364
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,613
I was upset, so I had a drink.

365
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:03,883
Oh, right.

366
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,682
I have not yet told the King.

367
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:11,353
That I am no longer Head of Capital Defense.

368
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:13,393
Thanks to you,

369
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:15,922
I am alive.

370
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:24,402
I will behead the assassins
in public tomorrow.

371
00:28:29,672 --> 00:28:32,613
I will give you 300 mounted men with armor...

372
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:35,543
and 300 soldiers.

373
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,383
Pardon?

374
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,512
That is a bigger force than the place guards.

375
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:43,323
Can you handle them?

376
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:53,033
Whom do you want me to attack?

377
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,152
I am sorry.

378
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:21,893
Just this once, forgive me.

379
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,863
I will return once my friends are safe.

380
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:03,033
Salute!

381
00:30:03,363 --> 00:30:06,932
- Salute! Salute!
- Salute! Salute!

382
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:10,573
- Salute! Salute!
- Salute! Salute!

383
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:13,972
- Salute! Salute!
- Salute! Salute!

384
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,426
I heard the Gyeru Tribe have
gathered a bunch of soldiers.

385
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:23,896
Yes, I heard it too.

386
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:27,125
I heard the troops are
led by General Go Geon.

387
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,765
Do you know what is going on?

388
00:30:30,735 --> 00:30:31,765
No.

389
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:34,965
How would I know what
the Gyeru Tribe is up to?

390
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:39,505
Gochuga has always been
a very suspicious man.

391
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,605
Father.

392
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,645
Something serious is happening
in and outside the palace.

393
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:46,785
How can you be so calm?

394
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:49,285
When the world is going through chaos,

395
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:52,325
the best thing to do is to sit
back and watch what happens.

396
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:56,295
What if you get involved only
to get yourself in a mess?

397
00:30:56,596 --> 00:30:58,096
You are so frustrating.

398
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:07,965
Until Geon Mu becomes the crown prince...

399
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:10,035
No.

400
00:31:11,206 --> 00:31:13,905
Until he finally takes the throne,

401
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:20,186
you and I must always be on our toes.

402
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:24,816
Do you understand?

403
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:26,826
Yes.

404
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:30,596
Of course.

405
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:52,645
I filled the pot with water,

406
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,645
so use as much as you want. You can wash too.

407
00:31:54,986 --> 00:31:57,856
What kind of a fool washes during a drought?

408
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:01,255
But must you leave?

409
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:04,395
I will be back as soon as I sell the herbs...

410
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,865
and buy the things I need.

411
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:09,195
I had an unpleasant dream.

412
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:11,466
What did you dream of?

413
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:14,906
You know that new girl, Yeom something...

414
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:18,005
Mother, she has a name.

415
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,676
- Yeom Ga Jin.
- Anyway,

416
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:22,576
she was wearing something really expensive...

417
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:25,016
that looked like the wings of a dragonfly.

418
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:28,315
She was sitting somewhere very high up.

419
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:32,125
And you were sobbing in front of her.

420
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,756
You seemed heartbroken.

421
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:37,726
What a silly dream.

422
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:39,296
I will be off now.

423
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:41,326
Please be careful.

424
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:45,206
My goodness, what a nasty dream.

425
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,305
Why not take me with you so I
can help you carry all that?

426
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:50,976
What good will she do?

427
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:54,006
I am sure you do not have the
eyes to pick out a mirror.

428
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,176
You are going to buy a mirror?

429
00:32:56,946 --> 00:32:58,516
I need one too.

430
00:32:58,516 --> 00:33:00,486
Goodness, I will not take long.

431
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:03,185
I heard people in the city are
also suffering due to the drought.

432
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:04,555
It is okay if you fail to sell everything.

433
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,386
- Just come back quickly.
- He is right.

434
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:09,895
But where is Ga Jin? I
have not seen her anywhere.

435
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:11,655
I am sure she is fine.

436
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:16,696
Come on. We are spending
way too long saying goodbye.

437
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,335
- We will be back.
- Goodbye.

438
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:21,266
- Bye.
- See you.

439
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,136
- Bye.
- Bye.

440
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,706
- Do not take too long.
- Wol seems so excited.

441
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:40,226
I will go save Jin and San.

442
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,696
This is the last thing I can
do to repay you for raising me.

443
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:45,865
And?

444
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:47,766
Then I will leave with my father.

445
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,236
Do not ever look for me again.

446
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,935
Your fate will come looking
for you even if I do not.

447
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,405
I will not be there.

448
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:00,476
Do you think you will be
able to escape forever?

449
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:02,715
If a moment comes where
I can no longer avoid it,

450
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,215
I will have to fight.

451
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,125
Yes.

452
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:18,256
You will soon end up facing
a fight you cannot avoid.

453
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:24,636
Father.

454
00:34:24,835 --> 00:34:25,835
Are you okay?

455
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:30,935
Ga Jin, what are you doing here?

456
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,805
I told you not to come near this place.

457
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,146
Do not worry.

458
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:37,075
Once I bring back San and Jin,

459
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,315
we can leave together.

460
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:40,646
I found a place for the both of us.

461
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,255
Will you be okay on your own?

462
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,986
There will be a lot of soldiers.

463
00:34:43,986 --> 00:34:45,426
Take him to the hut.

464
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:47,156
Do not do anything to harm him.

465
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:48,796
Ga Jin.

466
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:50,555
Do not worry.

467
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:54,565
This will really be my last time.

468
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:42,216
I have a message for my people of Goguryeo.

469
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:47,546
Due to the cruelty of the skies,
the lands have turned dry.

470
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:52,656
And migrant thieves have started
to bring more chaos to the country.

471
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:56,995
Think of all the castles
they have burned down...

472
00:35:57,896 --> 00:36:02,166
and the countless people they have killed.

473
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:05,135
They dared to be hostile to our country...

474
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:08,606
and threaten the safety of your King,

475
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:10,505
which makes them the root of all evil.

476
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:15,945
Therefore, I will execute those thieves...

477
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:18,146
in front of thousands of people...

478
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:22,455
to teach everyone the power
and dignity of Goguryeo.

479
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:29,026
There are so many people gathered here.

480
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:31,896
Let us sell our stuff here.
We can see the criminals too.

481
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:33,065
Sure.

482
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:34,396
Do you think it is a show?

483
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:36,966
That kind of stuff is not something to watch.

484
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:38,635
Let us get going.

485
00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:52,745
Are they assassins?

486
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,995
Are you sure you will
never kill anyone again?

487
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:13,606
I will no longer do anything
to cover my hands with blood.

488
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,466
What are you doing here?

489
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:47,705
You should be in Ghost Valley.
Why are you here instead?

490
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,075
And what are you wearing?

491
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:52,805
The criminals that got caught...

492
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,875
are my friends.

493
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:57,846
They got caught...

494
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:00,445
while doing my job instead of me.

495
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:04,755
Do not tell me...

496
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:06,555
They are like my family.

497
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:09,195
I cannot let them die.

498
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:12,966
So what? Are you saying
you are going to fight...

499
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:14,825
with all those soldiers?

500
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,396
I just need to save my friends.

501
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,466
I will not hurt anyone.

502
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,476
Dal, this will be my last time.

503
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:26,445
Please let me do this.

504
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:31,875
Dal!

505
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:34,615
Ga Jin.

506
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,055
What brings you here?

507
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:39,526
Pung Gae.

508
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:44,256
We need to help Ga Jin.

509
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,296
- What?
- Dal.

510
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:47,465
You cannot do this alone.

511
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:48,626
This is not something you
should get involved in.

512
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,595
No, this is our problem.

513
00:38:52,136 --> 00:38:53,835
You are a member of Ghost Valley.

514
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:05,176
The criminals are outside.

515
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:09,916
He is going to behead them...

516
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,786
to hide who was behind the
incident of the ceremony.

517
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:15,725
And thus, he wishes to suppress
the people by instilling fear.

518
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,766
Gochuga is a very greedy man.

519
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:23,396
He is trying to catch many
birds with just one stone.

520
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,536
Is General Go in charge of the scene?

521
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:30,435
The guards are there,

522
00:39:31,506 --> 00:39:34,006
but the person in charge was not General Go.

523
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,136
We found the entrance.

524
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:59,536
- Did you check the surroundings?
- There was no one.

525
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,776
There is not a single rat here.

526
00:40:43,546 --> 00:40:45,116
Where are they hiding?

527
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,555
Search the entire place.

528
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:57,426
Search the place!

529
00:40:57,426 --> 00:40:58,426
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

530
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:05,195
You dogs of Goguryeo have
traveled a long way for nothing.

531
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:08,305
Cheonjubangs are everywhere,

532
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:10,305
but at the same time, we do not exist.

533
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:14,205
You will never be able to find us.

534
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:18,616
I wish you dogs a peaceful death...

535
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,585
inside your grave.

536
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:25,085
Do not touch anything!

537
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:29,595
- Run!
- Get out of here!

538
00:41:48,176 --> 00:41:49,616
Let us go back to the palace.

539
00:42:07,465 --> 00:42:09,065
As soon as we save your friends,

540
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:11,296
we will be returning to
Ghost Valley right away.

541
00:42:12,636 --> 00:42:13,636
Be careful.

542
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:36,626
What is that?

543
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:40,396
- My goodness, look.
- Look at that.

544
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:41,725
- Goodness!
- It is a fire!

545
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,195
- Oh, dear!
- What happened?

546
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:46,235
- There is fire!
- What are we going to do?

547
00:42:46,235 --> 00:42:47,906
- My goodness!
- Oh, my gosh!

548
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:56,046
Pung Gae, is this really okay?

549
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:57,575
The fire is too big.

550
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:00,046
It will be fine. The stable
was all rotten anyway.

551
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:01,945
People will come and put it out. Let us go.

552
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:02,955
Okay.

553
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:10,626
- Look.
- Goodness.

554
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,866
My goodness.

555
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:14,766
Now.

556
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:22,006
- My goodness.
- What is going on?

557
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:23,006
Ga Jin.

558
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:31,246
Ga Jin.

559
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:33,246
Ga Jin.

560
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:35,146
We need to go!

561
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:45,595
Hurry! Hurry up!

562
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:52,636
Get going!

563
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:17,256
Hurry up and leave! Go!

564
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,266
Dal!

565
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,526
- Go!
- Hurry.

566
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,666
Hurry up and go!

567
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,266
Just go!

568
00:44:46,555 --> 00:44:47,626
What are you going to do now?

569
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,325
They will not be able to leave
the city looking like that.

570
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,725
Will Dal be okay?

571
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,565
How am I supposed to know? Darn it.

572
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:58,296
Why are you taking it out on me?

573
00:45:06,406 --> 00:45:08,105
- Where are you going?
- Hey.

574
00:45:13,345 --> 00:45:14,445
Who are you?

575
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,016
Do you remember me?

576
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:21,085
You must pay what you owe.
You cannot just leave.

577
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:23,855
I promise to pay what I owe.

578
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,555
Oh, it is you.

579
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,195
Please help me with a few injured people.

580
00:45:35,506 --> 00:45:37,876
I want you guys to hide at the herb store.

581
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:40,146
- What about you?
- I need to go find Dal.

582
00:45:48,786 --> 00:45:50,286
Are you also a Cheonjubang?

583
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:52,156
What is that?

584
00:45:53,825 --> 00:45:55,626
Where are the criminals?

585
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:57,926
"Criminals"?

586
00:45:58,695 --> 00:46:02,095
You guys are the ones who do bad things.

587
00:46:06,105 --> 00:46:08,766
Tell me right now, or I will behead you.

588
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,546
Father...

589
00:46:28,825 --> 00:46:29,825
Stop!

590
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:51,646
How dare a petty killer come back here?

591
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:56,616
How dare you...

592
00:46:57,355 --> 00:46:59,116
lay your hands on me?

593
00:47:09,695 --> 00:47:11,735
I am the eldest daughter
of Goguryeo's King...

594
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,605
and the late Queen Yeon,

595
00:47:15,605 --> 00:47:16,906
Princess Pyeonggang.

596
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,705
How dare you claim the title
of the royal household?

597
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:25,846
You must want to be beheaded.

598
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:27,346
Go Sang Cheol.

599
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,656
I remember you.

600
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:32,616
I also remember how you
mercilessly massacred...

601
00:47:33,656 --> 00:47:34,985
the people of the Sunno Tribe.

602
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:36,896
Shut your mouth!

603
00:47:37,195 --> 00:47:40,166
What are you waiting for?
Behead these two right now!

604
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,126
If you dare touch the body of a princess,

605
00:47:43,396 --> 00:47:45,336
your entire family and
relatives will be annihilated.

606
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:46,806
She is lying!

607
00:47:46,806 --> 00:47:48,935
The Princess has long been dead!

608
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:50,005
Kill them!

609
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,376
Step back!

610
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:09,856
She is Princess Pyeonggang!

611
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:14,366
Make your curtsy to Her Highness.

612
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:38,586
I am Head of Special Forces Go Geon,
paying respects to Your Highness.

613
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,306
Dal.

614
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,816
Where is my friend?

615
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:11,485
- Tell me where my friend went!
- Come here!

616
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:20,666
Hey! Hey!

617
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:22,195
Can you not hear me?

618
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:24,495
Where is my friend?

619
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,366
Tell me where she is!

620
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:27,965
Hey!

621
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:39,275
Oh, my.

622
00:49:40,346 --> 00:49:41,816
My goodness.

623
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:47,255
My gosh. Princess Pyeonggang?

624
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,376
I, Princess Pyeonggang,

625
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:08,646
have made it back to the palace.

626
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:14,715
Please forgive your
undutiful daughter, Father.

627
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:21,426
So it was not a dream.

628
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:24,626
You were not a ghost.

629
00:50:25,126 --> 00:50:29,666
You were actually alive, Princess Pyeonggang.

630
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,695
I lost my memory...

631
00:50:32,965 --> 00:50:35,235
and have been living
without knowing who I was.

632
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:39,275
I apologize for making you worry.

633
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:49,485
Not at all.

634
00:50:50,116 --> 00:50:52,086
It is all good since you made it back alive.

635
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:57,455
Thank you for coming back to
your father who has failed you.

636
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:55,086
Princess?

637
00:51:56,886 --> 00:51:57,886
What happened?

638
00:52:02,156 --> 00:52:04,225
I guess your friends will
live longer than I thought.

639
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:09,126
Dal...

640
00:52:16,906 --> 00:52:18,935
You do not have to worry.

641
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,515
Nothing will change just
because the Princess is back.

642
00:52:23,945 --> 00:52:27,146
I am sure the King is not
that glad to have her back...

643
00:52:27,146 --> 00:52:29,445
as he is guilty about
what he did to Queen Yeon.

644
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:31,715
Regardless of what happened in the past,

645
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,656
she is his daughter after all.

646
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,025
We cannot feel relieved as we do not know...

647
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:40,965
how the King will change
because of the Princess.

648
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:46,136
You must pay close attention
to both of them, Daedaero.

649
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:49,935
Why are you not saying anything, Gochuga?

650
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:58,576
A princess who lost her
memory became a killer?

651
00:53:00,646 --> 00:53:04,356
She survived and managed
to come back to the palace.

652
00:53:07,626 --> 00:53:11,426
The one we have to keep in check
is the Princess, not the King.

653
00:53:12,596 --> 00:53:15,166
Why should we keep an eye
on that mere chit of a girl?

654
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,695
She is a cub.

655
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:23,576
If she takes after her late mother's nature,

656
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,205
soon, her claws...

657
00:53:26,406 --> 00:53:28,275
will be directed at us.

658
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,556
Mother.

659
00:53:37,886 --> 00:53:40,056
Your unfilial daughter, Pyeonggang,

660
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:43,856
has finally come back.

661
00:53:45,596 --> 00:53:47,695
I can finally tell you...

662
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,035
the long patrol is now over.

663
00:53:57,775 --> 00:53:59,705
Her funeral was grand.

664
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:09,445
People of all ages and
gender mourned for her.

665
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:14,626
She adored the people of Goguryeo.

666
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:18,926
Even at her last moment,

667
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:22,495
she protected the people of the Sunno Tribe.

668
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,735
You must be tired. You should get some rest.

669
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:31,975
Tell me all those stories later.

670
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:33,775
They put my friend...

671
00:54:34,906 --> 00:54:36,406
in jail.

672
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:40,185
He was trying to help me.

673
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:43,755
I think you should let him go.

674
00:54:43,755 --> 00:54:48,255
The Five Tribe council is in
charge of prisoner dispositions.

675
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:49,955
If you give an order as a king,

676
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:52,056
the Five Tribe council should follow it too.

677
00:54:54,265 --> 00:54:55,926
Did you say he is your friend?

678
00:54:57,235 --> 00:54:58,235
Yes.

679
00:54:59,235 --> 00:55:00,606
He is also my savior...

680
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:04,705
who saved my life several times.

681
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,245
Commander Go said...

682
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,545
he could have gotten rid of the Princess...

683
00:55:13,545 --> 00:55:15,945
if you did not get in the way.

684
00:55:16,556 --> 00:55:17,656
Is that true?

685
00:55:20,386 --> 00:55:22,985
How could he kill the Princess
at the heart of the Capital?

686
00:55:23,426 --> 00:55:25,156
How will you deal with the consequences?

687
00:55:26,025 --> 00:55:29,195
I only stopped him for the sake of my family.

688
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:33,806
Was it not because you admire the Princess?

689
00:55:38,406 --> 00:55:41,445
Laying aside your family
because of your feelings...

690
00:55:42,045 --> 00:55:44,346
is not appropriate for the
next head of the Gyeru Tribe.

691
00:55:46,116 --> 00:55:47,416
You should be more careful.

692
00:55:48,086 --> 00:55:49,416
It is not something I should be careful of.

693
00:55:54,386 --> 00:55:55,386
What did you say?

694
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:56,656
The woman...

695
00:55:57,826 --> 00:56:01,025
whom I have buried in my heart for
a long time has returned alive.

696
00:56:02,265 --> 00:56:04,265
Earning her heart is as important as...

697
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,336
ruling the world.

698
00:56:35,265 --> 00:56:39,666
Hey! Bring back my friend!

699
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:43,806
Can you not pretend to listen at least?

700
00:56:44,106 --> 00:56:45,106
Hey!

701
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:48,705
Quiet down. How dare you act up?

702
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,445
Do you wish to die in here?

703
00:56:52,515 --> 00:56:54,316
My goodness. Good sir.

704
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:59,056
I have something to tell my
friend, so please call her.

705
00:56:59,056 --> 00:57:00,656
- Please?
- Hey!

706
00:57:01,025 --> 00:57:03,455
- Look at this guy.
- How dare you?

707
00:57:03,955 --> 00:57:04,955
Move.

708
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:06,926
Let me teach you a lesson.

709
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:08,765
- Sit still, you jerk!
- Oh, gosh!

710
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,005
Is Tae Mo not back yet?

711
00:57:17,806 --> 00:57:19,136
He will be here soon.

712
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:23,416
Chief, everyone is anxious.

713
00:57:24,116 --> 00:57:26,376
Perhaps this plan is too dangerous.

714
00:57:33,356 --> 00:57:34,356
Chief.

715
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:37,326
Ga Jin went into the palace.

716
00:57:38,795 --> 00:57:41,195
I hear she is the Princess of
Goguryeo who died a long time ago,

717
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:43,836
and the whole Capital is in chaos now.

718
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:45,866
So she...

719
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:49,505
returned to the palace?

720
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:50,505
Does that mean...

721
00:57:51,406 --> 00:57:53,745
you knew who Ga Jin was?

722
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:15,525
The people of Cheonjubang were born
in a field and raised in a mountain.

723
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:19,435
Only the ones with a strong mind
and soul to kill the King...

724
00:58:20,765 --> 00:58:22,336
can follow my path.

725
00:58:23,235 --> 00:58:26,035
If you are afraid, stay. Those who are brave,

726
00:58:27,806 --> 00:58:28,806
come with me.

727
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:27,705
The heads of the Five Tribes would
like to greet you, Your Highness.

728
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:40,146
I am Gochuga of the Gyeru Tribe, Go Won Pyo.

729
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:44,056
I would like to congratulate you
on your return to the palace.

730
00:59:44,215 --> 00:59:46,755
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Congratulations, Your Highness.

731
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,606
What is this?

732
01:00:00,935 --> 01:00:03,505
A talisman that will make you queen.

733
01:00:03,806 --> 01:00:06,035
You must see but not look,

734
01:00:06,475 --> 01:00:09,975
and hear but not listen for
your family to be at peace.

735
01:00:13,646 --> 01:00:15,215
Goguryeo is...

736
01:00:16,285 --> 01:00:17,515
already mine.

737
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:24,896
It has been long.

738
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:30,465
I am delighted to see that you
are in good health, Your Highness.

739
01:00:34,106 --> 01:00:35,465
I have been well,

740
01:00:36,235 --> 01:00:37,235
thanks to you.

741
01:01:48,045 --> 01:01:49,545
RIVER WHERE THE MOON RISES

742
01:01:50,146 --> 01:01:51,616
<i>You should come with me.</i>

743
01:01:51,816 --> 01:01:52,876
<i>I cannot.</i>

744
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:56,215
<i>I am back as a princess, so
I should live at the palace.</i>

745
01:01:56,215 --> 01:01:58,515
<i>I hear you could have
gotten rid of the Princess.</i>

746
01:01:58,515 --> 01:01:59,916
<i>I am all alone in Pyeongyang Castle.</i>

747
01:02:00,156 --> 01:02:03,126
<i>Father and the Prince find me uncomfortable.</i>

748
01:02:03,556 --> 01:02:06,126
<i>I will be on your side.</i>

749
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:07,826
<i>You? The next head of the Gyeru Tribe?</i>

750
01:02:07,826 --> 01:02:10,935
<i>If you disobey my order, I will disown you.</i>

751
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,695
<i>Something dangerous?</i>

752
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:14,906
<i>What is it that you want me to do?</i>

753
01:02:15,205 --> 01:02:17,205
<i>Everything related to the Princess.</i>
