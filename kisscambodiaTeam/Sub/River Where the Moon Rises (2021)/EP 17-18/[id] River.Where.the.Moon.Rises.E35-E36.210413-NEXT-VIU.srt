1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,342
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,367
(Characters, incidents, and dates do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:11,743
(Episode 18)

4
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:15,043
The Princess went too far in the King's presence.

5
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:16,208
That was too far?

6
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,052
So many lost their lives...

7
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,712
due to the lack of support.

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,852
How can you say such nonsense?

9
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,217
Nonsense?

10
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,852
Lord Yeon! You should watch what you say!

11
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:27,723
I spent my whole life up north...

12
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,857
fighting barbarians and sandstorms,

13
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,333
so I am incapable of watching what I say.

14
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,432
What?

15
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,957
Will you two stop it?

16
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,457
Please calm down.

17
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,868
How dare he?

18
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:44,513
The King is reluctant to see the Princess,

19
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:46,013
and it is a great concern.

20
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,377
She managed to fend off the Baekje soldiers,

21
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:50,478
so that contribution stands.

22
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,017
Pyeonggang.

23
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:00,557
Are you showing off because you won?

24
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:01,957
What do you mean?

25
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:06,898
I hear the Goguryeo people weep tears of gratitude.

26
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,402
The Princess aided the young King...

27
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,268
and made a great accomplishment at war.

28
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,503
If it had not been for you,

29
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:17,437
how would your insufficient brother have managed his kingly duties?

30
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:20,068
That is not what I meant.

31
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:24,077
It is not?

32
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:25,947
That is how it sounded to me.

33
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:30,152
All I voiced was the pity that we needlessly lost good men.

34
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:32,348
And so, during a meeting,

35
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,887
in front of all the ministers, you scolded the King?

36
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:40,958
Who do you take me for?

37
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:44,497
Answer me, Pyeonggang.

38
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:47,398
Am I the King?

39
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:50,738
Or am I your younger brother?

40
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:52,607
You are the King.

41
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:55,607
Do you mean that?

42
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,607
Yes.

43
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:02,753
If you went any further,

44
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:04,547
I would have severely punished you.

45
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,518
But I will stop at stripping your military title.

46
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,057
Love you or hate you,

47
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,328
you are my sister.

48
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:16,328
You are excused.

49
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:32,948
Will you not do anything about it?

50
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,918
Did we fight for an award?

51
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:37,252
Did we fight to gain honors?

52
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:40,048
Jin. The Princess needs to rest.

53
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,388
We should go.

54
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,388
Let go of me.

55
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,293
What is this mess?

56
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:46,562
We fought Baekje,

57
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:48,733
and you, me, and Ga Jin...

58
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,898
got back after nearly losing our own lives.

59
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:53,227
And the King treats us like insects.

60
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,238
Jin.

61
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:02,777
He is our King.

62
00:03:03,212 --> 00:03:04,648
He is my brother,

63
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:06,877
but before that, I serve as his subject.

64
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:10,493
I would like you to refrain from speaking like that around me.

65
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,548
The Princess is right.

66
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:15,157
Calm down.

67
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,027
Is your new home ready to live in?

68
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,462
Sorry for dragging you to war as soon as you got married.

69
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,402
Do not say that.

70
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,868
If you call, we come, even during the night.

71
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,168
- Right, darling? - Do not darling me.

72
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,398
I carved it myself.

73
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:02,997
Anyway, this means that we are on the same side.

74
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:04,467
Same side?

75
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:06,368
We are on the same side.

76
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,078
And we are married.

77
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:13,247
The Goguryeo you dream of, Ga Jin.

78
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,678
The country you wish to make.

79
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:18,688
I will live there too.

80
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,888
I am...

81
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,727
in this world to be your sword.

82
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,002
It will be worth a lot.

83
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:37,473
It is much fatter than the one before.

84
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:39,512
- Yes, it is. - Untie it quickly.

85
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,808
We should hurry.

86
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:43,777
You hold tight.

87
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,078
- Let us get going. - Come on and...

88
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:51,493
It got caught in someone's trap,

89
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,892
- and we were letting it go. - Yes.

90
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:55,223
- That is true. - We should go.

91
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:57,432
Take it to your mother.

92
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:58,963
- Come along. - Go on.

93
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:00,998
- Are there any herbs here? - No.

94
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:02,797
Oh, dear.

95
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,898
What is this?

96
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,037
This is a trap that we dug.

97
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:09,772
Darn it.

98
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,843
Help me get out of this pit.

99
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:13,713
Help me out first.

100
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:14,743
Me first!

101
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:16,907
- Hey! - Push me up!

102
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:44,413
What are you doing?

103
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,407
We could have the meat to eat.

104
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,182
Do you not hear me?

105
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,252
What do you want to nag about that you came all the way here?

106
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:52,913
The beast is already dead.

107
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:55,582
Eating its meat would do us no harm.

108
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:57,287
Not eating it will do no harm either.

109
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:58,692
Not again.

110
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,487
Does everything I say sound like I am nagging?

111
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,027
Dal.

112
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:08,758
You fool.

113
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,667
Do not leave while I am still talking.

114
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:27,578
Goodness.

115
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,078
What a good son you are.

116
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:33,963
Morning and night, for four years,

117
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:36,157
you have been bowing at a mound of soil.

118
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,688
You are a mirage.

119
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,628
- What? - You are...

120
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,967
a fake I created in my mind.

121
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,378
My real mother is...

122
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,093
Why do you not finish the sentence?

123
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,717
What about your mother?

124
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,372
Why do you keep carving that thing...

125
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,597
when you will not even sell it?

126
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,338
It puts my mind at ease.

127
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:26,268
Because it reminds you of your wife when you hold that?

128
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,578
Mother.

129
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,347
Tell the truth to just me.

130
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:34,423
You have not seen the Princess in years.

131
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:37,688
You would love to go to the Capital.

132
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:40,388
- I do not. - I bet you do.

133
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:42,888
Dal.

134
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:44,758
I said no!

135
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:49,758
Who were you talking to?

136
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:53,498
Oh, come on. My gosh.

137
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:56,367
I told you never to come here.

138
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:58,367
You did say that, last fall.

139
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:01,338
But I need to see check on you each season to see you are alive.

140
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:04,847
To at least get your bones back if a tiger gets you.

141
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:07,617
Dal.

142
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,222
- Do not be like this. - Let go.

143
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,917
Will you pack up and move somewhere else?

144
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,593
Do you think I came back to meditate?

145
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:16,688
I know.

146
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:19,857
That is why the Princess cannot visit.

147
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:21,432
For fear that...

148
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:23,828
you will act out and go somewhere we cannot find you.

149
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,498
That is why...

150
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:28,938
she told me to check on you.

151
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:34,477
The Princess' sword is always wet with blood.

152
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:38,048
This year alone, she has been in five wars.

153
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:41,083
Because she cares more than anyone about her country.

154
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,548
You idiot.

155
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:45,048
It is because of you.

156
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:47,223
If she is in the palace,

157
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,063
she cannot stop thinking of you,

158
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:51,162
so she volunteers to go and fight.

159
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,757
To make up for your absence.

160
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:55,158
That is just what she would do.

161
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,928
Dal.

162
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:00,897
Come to the Capital.

163
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:04,038
See the Princess...

164
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,737
and catch up with her.

165
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:16,418
Hey!

166
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,963
Will you just let him go?

167
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,727
He is your oldest friend.

168
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,668
It bothers you too, right?

169
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:39,467
That the Princess goes to war and gets drenched in blood.

170
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,208
She has a King.

171
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:45,382
They are siblings, so they must get along well.

172
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:48,517
Do you think 10 brothers make up for a husband?

173
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,217
Mother.

174
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:56,088
What?

175
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:58,892
Do you want me gone?

176
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:00,458
Because I nag?

177
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,227
Ga Jin and I.

178
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,397
We must not meet.

179
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,767
Whether it is my death...

180
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:15,178
or a mishap that happens to Ga Jin,

181
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:21,048
our end will be bloodshed.

182
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:28,788
To stop that from happening,

183
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,428
I am living in hiding when it hurts more than death.

184
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:36,857
What if...

185
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:39,698
you live as a hermit all your life...

186
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,272
and then die?

187
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,237
Would that be a pretty sight?

188
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:48,007
You are the greatest in Goguryeo.

189
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:51,078
You are the greatest fool ever.

190
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:21,208
What is this?

191
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,338
Since I am no longer a military officer,

192
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:26,308
I went to the library to kill time.

193
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:27,778
And?

194
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:32,048
I remembered something our late father said.

195
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:37,058
Wol Gwang said this to me one day.

196
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:41,058
That my time is coming to an end.

197
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,933
He said the Crown Prince...

198
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:47,127
and Princess will reign over Goguryeo.

199
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,367
I thought about it, and he is right.

200
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:54,007
Why would you say that?

201
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:56,938
You are still strong.

202
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:58,908
Princess.

203
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,152
Yes, Father.

204
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,247
When the Crown Prince becomes King,

205
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:07,318
support him with your utmost effort and passion.

206
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,418
I will do that.

207
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,987
I was never good to you, and I always...

208
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,198
give you more responsibilities.

209
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:17,867
I am sorry.

210
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,397
So...

211
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:23,272
you want me to learn how to reign...

212
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:25,107
from the books you chose for me?

213
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,237
You do not lack learning,

214
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,578
but they will help you rule.

215
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:33,778
Why not?

216
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,147
I will read them.

217
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,757
But I require help other than books.

218
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,963
My commanders are said to be brave,

219
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:50,658
but they are like tigers without teeth.

220
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:53,967
They served since my father's time, so they would be old.

221
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:55,637
Right.

222
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,213
You did fight well,

223
00:12:58,213 --> 00:12:59,908
but you are a woman.

224
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:04,107
I want to make your husband the Superior Commander.

225
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,048
Your Majesty.

226
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,552
He has been away for long.

227
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,517
It is time he returned.

228
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:15,922
Go to him and persuade him.

229
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:17,928
No one, not even me can make him...

230
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,963
take up his sword again.

231
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:22,097
Oh, dear.

232
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:27,068
Were you and him not a match made in heaven?

233
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:30,938
Because of me,

234
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,278
he suffered for many years.

235
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:38,747
I will not make him fight again.

236
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,313
Go Geon fled to Silla,

237
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,377
and instead of suffering, he lives in luxury.

238
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,353
Starting with Silla, I will behead Go Geon,

239
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:47,387
and then unify the three nations!

240
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:49,818
The perfect man to assist me...

241
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:52,357
is your husband.

242
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:55,428
Only General On can help.

243
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:58,428
I will support you in your great endeavor.

244
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:00,068
However,

245
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:03,938
do not involve General On Dal.

246
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,007
What?

247
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,617
(Seorabeol, Silla)

248
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:26,528
Why are you doing this?

249
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,458
You have been in Seorabeol for four years now.

250
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:32,902
I get that in the first year,

251
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:35,068
everything was unfamiliar and you were confused.

252
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:38,237
But even now, you waste time with drink.

253
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:41,313
You were commanded to come to court today.

254
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,107
What is the point in going when there is nothing to do?

255
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:47,847
The King thinks highly of you.

256
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:50,247
I know that.

257
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,428
Why do you look at me like that?

258
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:03,798
You knew that...

259
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,068
my true human nature...

260
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,397
is to drink and play.

261
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,438
You and your father are good with money,

262
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:20,847
and you are raking in great profits.

263
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,823
I should help with spending it.

264
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,017
General.

265
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,987
Do not forget how Gochuga died.

266
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,727
He died bitterly before he was able to achieve...

267
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:34,188
his dream of...

268
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:45,367
Do not...

269
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:50,708
mention my father.

270
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,347
That night,

271
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:57,247
I should have killed On Dal, the Princess, and then myself.

272
00:15:58,052 --> 00:16:00,588
Because you got in my way,

273
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,558
I am now a drunkard.

274
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:07,688
General.

275
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:12,997
Leave.

276
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,338
I said leave!

277
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,339

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

278
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,798
Is General Go Geon not yet here?

279
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:44,198
The thing is,

280
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,802
he suddenly fell ill.

281
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:49,872
Oh, dear. What happened?

282
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:52,967
I doubt he fell ill. Is he not just hungover?

283
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:57,137
No. Of course not.

284
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:04,847
I heard that heroes like drink and women.

285
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:09,157
He truly lives up to his name of the Gyeru Tribe's heir.

286
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:12,588
Lord Hae.

287
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:14,562
Yes, Your Majesty.

288
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:17,998
I expect a lot from General Go.

289
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,397
Tell him that before my patience wears out,

290
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:24,968
I would like to discuss politics with him.

291
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:28,607
I will uphold your command.

292
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:49,862
He just fell asleep.

293
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,933
I went in to see the King today...

294
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,328
and got well and truly insulted.

295
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,243
Because of that good-for-nothing fool!

296
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,943
Father. You might wake him.

297
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:02,243
Who cares if a drunkard wakes up...

298
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:03,683
or falls down?

299
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,548
We can talk in your room.

300
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,252
Because he lives a wasteful life,

301
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:10,877
the both of us could be insulted too.

302
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:13,322
Father. Come with me.

303
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:16,463
Why is Gochuga's son such a slob?

304
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,558
Father.

305
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,562
So what if he looks fine on the outside?

306
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:22,933
He is the worst waste of space in the world!

307
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,927
- Father, please. - Darn him!

308
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:43,778
Rumors inside and outside the palace are concerning.

309
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:46,318
That the reason the King stripped you of military command...

310
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:50,092
is because he is wary of your prowess and accomplishments.

311
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:51,832
The rumors are groundless.

312
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,187
But not utterly unfounded.

313
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,857
How do you think a young king...

314
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:01,838
managed to secure his place so quickly and firmly?

315
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:04,873
It is because you shed sweat and blood to help him.

316
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:05,943
Uncle.

317
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:08,042
Lord Yeon has a point.

318
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,738
If you do nothing,

319
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:13,078
you could be excluded from government.

320
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:16,153
Then I will go back to my embroidery...

321
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:18,223
and stay in Magnolia Hall.

322
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,417
- Princess. - Princess.

323
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,857
You misunderstand the King.

324
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:33,328
He commanded me to get General On.

325
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:37,772
General On?

326
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:39,867
To unify the three kingdoms,

327
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,278
he says he needs General On.

328
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:45,808
If His Majesty wished to limit my power,

329
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:49,818
he would not place such heavy responsibility on General On.

330
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,647
In that case, are you going to visit General On?

331
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:01,362
Hey. Promise you will not tell her.

332
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:02,728
I promise.

333
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,528
I am sorry.

334
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,502
Show me around your house some other time.

335
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:13,042
That is too bad. We prepared a feast for the Princess.

336
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:17,407
It is okay. We will eat all the food ourselves.

337
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:22,423
Are you still upset with me?

338
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:23,578
No.

339
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,393
I have my husband now.

340
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,362
You should hurry back to the palace...

341
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:31,062
and take care of state affairs or whatever.

342
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,062
You do not mean that.

343
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:34,328
What are you talking about?

344
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:37,758
- Actually, a few days ago... - Hey!

345
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,367
You promised not to tell her.

346
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,772
Jin was pestering me,

347
00:20:43,772 --> 00:20:46,707
so I went to check on Dal.

348
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,078
He seemed to be doing okay,

349
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,978
but he kicked me out before I could ask him about much.

350
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:00,288
That is a relief.

351
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:03,058
What do you mean?

352
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:06,028
All he does all day is carve a wooden flute.

353
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,633
Can you guess why?

354
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,163
Obviously,

355
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:11,633
it is to stop thinking about you.

356
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:14,568
That is why he carves wood all day like a fool.

357
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,238
Stop.

358
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:18,743
I know that. So you can stop, Jin.

359
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:21,238
It has already been four years.

360
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,983
Do you not miss him?

361
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,407
Do you not want to know how he is doing?

362
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,413
Do you not even feel sorry for him?

363
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:27,847
What is with you?

364
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,218
I miss him.

365
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:35,488
I miss him like crazy.

366
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:56,008
I am leaving so that I do not have to lose you.

367
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,447
You must become the person you desire to be.

368
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:01,207
Whether it is becoming the sister of the future King...

369
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:03,818
or becoming the Queen yourself.

370
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,058
I made your bed.

371
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:13,957
You must be tired. You should go to bed now.

372
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,228
Nanny.

373
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:17,498
Yes, Princess.

374
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:19,728
I miss him.

375
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,437
I should not see him,

376
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:28,437
but I miss him so much.

377
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:32,048
Then you should see him.

378
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:37,548
Is it really okay if I do that?

379
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:39,887
What if I go to see him...

380
00:22:40,453 --> 00:22:42,022
but he kicks me out?

381
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:43,718
What are you afraid of?

382
00:22:45,562 --> 00:22:48,361
Even when your father forbade you to go out,

383
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:50,728
you ran out without hesitation.

384
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:55,167
You even lied to all the ministers that you were married.

385
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:58,607
Whenever you set your mind on something,

386
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,838
you took action immediately.

387
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,778
You were never afraid of anything.

388
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:27,728
Dal.

389
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:31,338
You are here again.

390
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:36,778
Where did you hide the general's sword?

391
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,978
Why do you need to know that?

392
00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:42,578
I want to sell it for some taffy.

393
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:44,278
Forget it.

394
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,117
My goodness.

395
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:53,433
I have never seen the moon this beautiful during the day.

396
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,602
During the day or at night, it makes no difference.

397
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,572
You should come here and see it.

398
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:00,673
It is such a bright, full moon.

399
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,937
Leave me alone. I am not interested.

400
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,312
Your name means the "moon".

401
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,738
Why do you not want to see the moon?

402
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:15,048
By any chance, does the milky-white, demure moon...

403
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:17,548
remind you of someone?

404
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:21,288
You told me to kick her out when I brought the injured girl here.

405
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:23,758
That was ages ago.

406
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:27,193
Do you not know that I can see right through you?

407
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:30,332
You want to run to the palace right at this moment.

408
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:32,032
You want to hold her in your arms...

409
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:33,968
and shower her with your affection.

410
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:36,637
Stop! Please!

411
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:40,443
Please go away. Stop tormenting me!

412
00:24:40,443 --> 00:24:41,877
Leave!

413
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:44,707
You are not even my real mother.

414
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:06,968
Mother.

415
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:12,968
Where did you go?

416
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:16,838
This is not funny. Come out this instant.

417
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,078
Mother.

418
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:20,677
Gosh.

419
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,347
Mother!

420
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,157
Mother.

421
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:36,758
Your son is right here.

422
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:40,728
I am right here. Where did you go?

423
00:25:44,913 --> 00:25:47,068
You can torment me all you want.

424
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:51,508
You can do whatever you want.

425
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:57,048
Do not leave me, Mother.

426
00:26:21,943 --> 00:26:23,137
General.

427
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:26,647
I am entering the palace.

428
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:28,917
Why, all of a sudden?

429
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:34,447
The King of Silla is sending an envoy to Goguryeo.

430
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:37,457
I did hear that.

431
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,758
I have had enough fun to last me a lifetime.

432
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,397
It is time for me to work.

433
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:47,328
- General. - You and I are outsiders.

434
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,838
It is only because the Silla palace...

435
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:52,808
is packed with insiders...

436
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,078
that I have been lying low so far.

437
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:02,377
General Go.

438
00:27:03,383 --> 00:27:04,452
Your Majesty.

439
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:07,417
If I send you to Goguryeo as my envoy,

440
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:09,657
you will be beheaded...

441
00:27:09,923 --> 00:27:11,657
as soon as you set foot in their palace.

442
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:15,633
You may be right.

443
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,963
Are you not afraid?

444
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:18,597
I have already died once.

445
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:20,328
Why would I be afraid?

446
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,568
If I become beheaded,

447
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,867
it will give you justification to start a war.

448
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:36,018
I heard that you were indulging in alcohol and meat.

449
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:38,322
Perhaps you have been waiting for this day.

450
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:41,052
Still, if you send General Go as your envoy...

451
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:42,788
I volunteered to go.

452
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:47,127
Whether I get to deliver Silla's great cause...

453
00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:50,228
or get killed even before I open my mouth,

454
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,697
I am ready for either.

455
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:57,697
You must not go.

456
00:27:58,002 --> 00:27:59,508
Even if you go to Goguryeo,

457
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:01,838
it will not go according to your plan.

458
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:03,508
My plan?

459
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:05,978
Do you know my plan?

460
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:07,607
Of course.

461
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:09,748
Your plan is to kill the Princess...

462
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,617
and face the end yourself.

463
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:17,758
I am not going there to die.

464
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:19,758
I do not believe you.

465
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:22,433
In these turbulent times,

466
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,197
you drifted all the way here to Silla.

467
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:28,568
But I am with Mo Yong on this matter.

468
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,968
Do not go there, General Go.

469
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,143
The King gladly gave his permission,

470
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:38,012
and my determination will not falter.

471
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:40,112
I do not want to hear another word.

472
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:41,207
General Go.

473
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:42,417
In that case,

474
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,548
I will follow you.

475
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:45,947
Mo Yong!

476
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,058
You said you were not going there to die.

477
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:51,417
We will go there together...

478
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,758
and return together, safe and sound.

479
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:57,957
If I say no,

480
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:01,127
will you stick a needle in me again?

481
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,068
My goodness.

482
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:51,767
Goodness.

483
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:55,798
Darn it.

484
00:29:56,203 --> 00:29:58,168
What? "Darn it"?

485
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:01,582
Weed out the vegetable garden over there on the hill.

486
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:05,147
Water, vegetable garden, laundry, and bush stems. I got it.

487
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,348
What is your name?

488
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,522
Yeom Ga Jin.

489
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,918
My goodness, what a pretty name.

490
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,058
I am good at playing the pipe.

491
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:55,497
Hey. That...

492
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,047
Mother.

493
00:31:18,993 --> 00:31:20,987
Please forgive me for taking this long...

494
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:23,357
to visit you.

495
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:25,687
But I am glad...

496
00:31:26,963 --> 00:31:29,327
that Dal is by your side.

497
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:34,297
I am not even close to repaying you...

498
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:38,267
for the kindness you had shown me.

499
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,908
Please forgive your ungrateful daughter-in-law.

500
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:18,807
Please leave.

501
00:32:24,353 --> 00:32:26,288
This place is too modest...

502
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:28,587
for a princess.

503
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:32,688
Dal.

504
00:32:37,432 --> 00:32:38,998
I am hungry.

505
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:53,848
The sun goes down pretty early. Please leave right after...

506
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:00,017
I wanted to put this on again.

507
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:03,087
Can I take this with me?

508
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:12,998
Let us eat.

509
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:30,117
This is delicious.

510
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,087
You can season vegetables well like Mother.

511
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:36,517
You should eat too.

512
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:27,868
I will leave now.

513
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:33,548
It is nice to see you again.

514
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:51,097
Can you make me one promise?

515
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:56,767
I know I do not deserve it.

516
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:00,238
But I miss you.

517
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:03,938
So promise me that...

518
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,647
you will be here the next time...

519
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:10,118
I come back to see you.

520
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:13,748
Just promise me that.

521
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,727
Is that also too much to ask?

522
00:35:20,763 --> 00:35:22,097
I am...

523
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:25,827
a man of Goguryeo.

524
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:29,897
I must comply with...

525
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:32,568
the Princess' request.

526
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:42,147
Okay.

527
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:50,488
Then, you just made me a promise.

528
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:53,287
Yes.

529
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:09,077
Please...

530
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:12,608
do not get hurt.

531
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:16,948
Your life is precious.

532
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:23,087
You too, Your Highness.

533
00:37:47,942 --> 00:37:49,337
Ga Jin.

534
00:37:58,393 --> 00:37:59,847
Ga Jin!

535
00:38:08,462 --> 00:38:09,697
Ga Jin.

536
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,998
Ga Jin!

537
00:38:21,113 --> 00:38:23,777
I came back because I thought a princess deserves the truth.

538
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:25,447
I cannot...

539
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:27,777
keep my promise.

540
00:38:29,753 --> 00:38:31,078
I will...

541
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,488
leave here and move deeper into the mountain.

542
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:38,218
If I stay here,

543
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:40,657
Pung Gae...

544
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,828
and you will keep coming to see me.

545
00:38:46,903 --> 00:38:49,197
I will go to a place where no one can find me.

546
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,907
I really missed you.

547
00:38:57,383 --> 00:39:01,478
But I should not have been greedy.

548
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:07,118
Ga Jin.

549
00:39:09,192 --> 00:39:10,888
Now that I have left my sword behind,

550
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:14,228
I am happy.

551
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,098
I do not smell blood anymore.

552
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,067
Because you let me go,

553
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:23,138
I could live.

554
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:29,277
Can I...

555
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:32,378
just live with you?

556
00:39:34,653 --> 00:39:37,078
We could hide in a mountain where no one can find us.

557
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:40,718
We can live together there. Just the two of us.

558
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:44,488
What about Goguryeo?

559
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,828
The King is still young.

560
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:52,328
Can you just leave him at the palace?

561
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:55,998
I know.

562
00:39:58,243 --> 00:39:59,608
It is okay.

563
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:13,287
Deer.

564
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:16,858
Yes.

565
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:19,287
That is me.

566
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:21,828
Your deer.

567
00:40:21,832 --> 00:40:23,927
Whichever mountain you hide yourself in,

568
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:28,098
I am going to find you.

569
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:29,767
You will fail...

570
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,807
because I will make sure no one finds me.

571
00:40:33,873 --> 00:40:35,138
No.

572
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:39,547
I know I can find you.

573
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,468
- Lady Gongson. - Yes.

574
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:13,008
I usually prefer to follow my father.

575
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:16,218
But today, I could not.

576
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:18,988
Father did not like sweet stuff.

577
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:21,517
But why do I like it so much?

578
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:25,427
The Princess...

579
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,358
took care of it since you were little, Your Majesty.

580
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:32,332
Her Highness wanted to take care of you...

581
00:41:32,332 --> 00:41:34,527
by making snacks using good-quality honey.

582
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:45,547
The Princess is only concerned about the empire and you.

583
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:49,118
Please do not misunderstand her.

584
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:54,317
Won! No!

585
00:41:56,592 --> 00:41:58,017
Do not drink it.

586
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:01,088
You have not drunk a drop of it, right?

587
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,728
There is poison in your medicine.

588
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:05,667
You brought me sweets.

589
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:09,037
I came here to thank you.

590
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:13,008
You believed that my medicine was poisoned.

591
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:16,078
You must have been flustered.

592
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:20,677
Even so, I am still grateful.

593
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:26,988
Did you say the representatives of Silla are coming tomorrow?

594
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:29,017
Yes, Your Majesty.

595
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:33,733
His Majesty has not arrived.

596
00:42:33,733 --> 00:42:37,228
- What are they doing? - Who do you think you are?

597
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:39,297
How dare you!

598
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:42,098
Are you not the traitor Go Geon?

599
00:42:43,302 --> 00:42:46,913
You are no less than an animal. How dare you show yourself?

600
00:42:46,913 --> 00:42:48,978
Have you lost your mind?

601
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:53,013
Is that brat Hae Ji Weol's stepdaughter?

602
00:42:53,013 --> 00:42:54,907
I, Go Geon, the envoy of Silla,

603
00:42:57,623 --> 00:43:01,047
have come to Goguryeo to have an audience with the King.

604
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,458
I am deeply moved...

605
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:14,598
to see you on the throne, Your Majesty.

606
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:17,238
I heard...

607
00:43:17,302 --> 00:43:20,413
King Pyeongwon held a great funeral for my father.

608
00:43:20,413 --> 00:43:23,407
- How dare he? - I am grateful...

609
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:27,108
from the bottom of my heart.

610
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:28,978
Who does he think he is?

611
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,647
King Jinheung of Silla has sent his message.

612
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:38,488
Stop there.

613
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,842
- Go Geon. - Yes, Your Majesty.

614
00:43:57,842 --> 00:43:59,478
Are you here...

615
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:02,478
to die in your own land?

616
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:06,552
I am here to send the message from the King...

617
00:44:06,552 --> 00:44:08,958
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

618
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:14,488
I remember that night.

619
00:44:14,692 --> 00:44:16,098
Your Majesty!

620
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:19,297
Master Go!

621
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:21,067
I see that you are still alive.

622
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,138
The sin you and your father have done...

623
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:30,342
- You have become faster. - How dare you!

624
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:33,952
I am delighted to have found that you have trained well.

625
00:44:33,952 --> 00:44:35,378
Go Geon!

626
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,088
- Yes. - You have betrayed your family...

627
00:44:41,822 --> 00:44:44,062
and your father to come back as an envoy.

628
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:46,258
A lowly servant such as myself...

629
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,533
is suitable for the peace between the two countries.

630
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,657
How dare he?

631
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,297
Give him the letter.

632
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:07,298
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] KBS E36 'River Where the Moon Rises'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

633
00:45:23,562 --> 00:45:25,297
Gosh, Your Highness.

634
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:31,037
Where did you go without telling us?

635
00:45:31,403 --> 00:45:33,013
I need to take a break, Nanny.

636
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:36,378
The Palace has been turned upside down while you were away.

637
00:45:37,543 --> 00:45:39,108
Do not be surprised.

638
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,748
An envoy came from Silla, and he is...

639
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,718
An envoy from Silla?

640
00:45:50,893 --> 00:45:53,858
I thought they would lock us up in a damp jail,

641
00:45:55,363 --> 00:45:56,828
but this is...

642
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:59,373
much more than I deserve.

643
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,567
You deserve more than this.

644
00:46:02,172 --> 00:46:04,273
We will be beheaded nonetheless.

645
00:46:04,273 --> 00:46:05,468
Why?

646
00:46:06,812 --> 00:46:08,767
Are you regretting it now?

647
00:46:09,942 --> 00:46:11,907
Are you regretting...

648
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:13,947
that you should have remained in Silla?

649
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:20,748
It would be my greatest honor...

650
00:46:21,523 --> 00:46:23,488
to die on the same day and at the same time as you.

651
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:40,937
You should not kill them.

652
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,207
I should not kill them?

653
00:46:44,342 --> 00:46:45,907
The King of Silla...

654
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:48,112
has sent General Go Geon as his envoy.

655
00:46:48,112 --> 00:46:49,977
Why do you think he did so?

656
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,723
He wants to shed blood by offending you.

657
00:46:54,723 --> 00:46:56,518
Then he has succeeded.

658
00:46:56,923 --> 00:46:59,763
I must behead him because he has offended me!

659
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:01,358
If you kill an envoy,

660
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:04,397
you are basically offering a reason to start a war.

661
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:07,332
Are you saying we should keep Go Geon alive...

662
00:47:07,332 --> 00:47:09,302
to avoid a war against Silla?

663
00:47:09,302 --> 00:47:13,013
I am only saying we should not fall for the obvious trap they have set.

664
00:47:13,013 --> 00:47:16,138
Have you seen the message Go Geon has brought?

665
00:47:16,183 --> 00:47:18,638
It is quite a spectacle!

666
00:47:20,152 --> 00:47:23,717
Silla wants to ally with our empire.

667
00:47:23,822 --> 00:47:25,888
They want to join forces and destroy Baekje.

668
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,118
And they want to divide their lands among us.

669
00:47:28,523 --> 00:47:30,523
An ally with Silla?

670
00:47:30,523 --> 00:47:32,328
That is ridiculous.

671
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,993
Of course!

672
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:37,132
They have sent Go Geon on purpose...

673
00:47:37,132 --> 00:47:39,568
to insult Goguryeo and the King!

674
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:45,372
It is a trick the king of Silla is trying to pull...

675
00:47:45,372 --> 00:47:48,038
as I am a young king.

676
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:52,078
Do you still expect me to keep him alive?

677
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:55,548
- Yes, Your Majesty. - My gosh.

678
00:47:55,683 --> 00:47:58,947
Despite all that, he is still an envoy.

679
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:02,687
If we do not send him back safely,

680
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,457
there will be war in our lands.

681
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:09,528
We need to avoid such tragedies.

682
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:12,768
Lord Sa.

683
00:48:18,443 --> 00:48:20,907
I would have killed him if he were an ordinary envoy,

684
00:48:21,513 --> 00:48:23,638
but he is Go Geon.

685
00:48:24,842 --> 00:48:26,147
Your Highness.

686
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:27,783
You cannot dishonor the King...

687
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:29,747
because you are afraid of Silla's king.

688
00:48:30,122 --> 00:48:32,588
It is a provocation against Goguryeo!

689
00:48:35,322 --> 00:48:36,923
Are you bearing a grudge against the King...

690
00:48:36,923 --> 00:48:38,957
for losing your position?

691
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:44,132
You are going against everything the King is suggesting,

692
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:45,667
Your Highness!

693
00:48:50,773 --> 00:48:52,538
Those gathered in the Hall of Convenience are...

694
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:56,338
weighing the pros and cons of letting you live, General Go.

695
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:01,977
It is not a matter to discuss for long.

696
00:49:03,352 --> 00:49:05,922
They will eventually give an order to behead me.

697
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:08,018
You still came knowing that?

698
00:49:11,662 --> 00:49:12,828
Yes.

699
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:16,028
Even if I die,

700
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:19,568
I thought I would have to see the Capital before I die.

701
00:49:20,703 --> 00:49:22,598
Gochuga...

702
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:26,673
was confident and dignified until his last moment.

703
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,773
But his son...

704
00:49:28,773 --> 00:49:31,013
ran away to Silla, betraying his family.

705
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,312
And he is back as an envoy?

706
00:49:32,312 --> 00:49:34,707
Did you just ask me where I belong?

707
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:42,717
Did you see that?

708
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:44,088
Pardon?

709
00:49:50,102 --> 00:49:51,957
My father...

710
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:56,237
gave all his heart...

711
00:49:58,943 --> 00:50:00,838
to this woman.

712
00:50:05,213 --> 00:50:07,848
In the end, he was betrayed by her...

713
00:50:09,582 --> 00:50:11,477
and was killed that night.

714
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:17,987
And now, she is blaming me.

715
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:22,727
How cunning...

716
00:50:24,003 --> 00:50:26,167
can a human be?

717
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:27,467
General Go.

718
00:50:38,612 --> 00:50:39,878
Queen Jin!

719
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:46,048
- Queen Jin! - I do not want to hear it.

720
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:48,288
But you must.

721
00:50:49,193 --> 00:50:51,657
I know you have come to see General Go...

722
00:50:52,392 --> 00:50:54,427
to spare yourself from death.

723
00:51:12,882 --> 00:51:14,507
I will announce my decision.

724
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:16,977
Go Geon may be an envoy of Silla,

725
00:51:17,622 --> 00:51:20,487
but the sins he committed as a royal blood of Goguryeo are great.

726
00:51:21,223 --> 00:51:23,963
The king of Silla has aimed to use this fact with this petty trick.

727
00:51:23,963 --> 00:51:26,427
Therefore, I will not treat his envoy with diplomatic respect.

728
00:51:26,433 --> 00:51:27,628
Your Majesty.

729
00:51:28,392 --> 00:51:29,997
Do not interrupt me.

730
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:39,838
Hence, I sentence Go Geon and those who came with him to death.

731
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:41,907
Your Majesty.

732
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:56,417
We are discussing matters of state.

733
00:51:56,993 --> 00:51:59,227
If you have something to say, please do so in private.

734
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:01,828
I have something to tell you regarding matters of state.

735
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:03,727
I implore you.

736
00:52:03,933 --> 00:52:06,967
Please listen to what I say as I am the Queen of this empire.

737
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:15,338
- What is it? - I know that you are...

738
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,177
deeply concerned about the decision you will have to make soon.

739
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:21,848
Therefore, I thought about it to give you help,

740
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:24,578
and I thought of King Pyeongwon.

741
00:52:28,453 --> 00:52:31,588
In such cases,

742
00:52:31,662 --> 00:52:34,828
King Pyeongwon would have sent back the envoy from Silla.

743
00:52:37,402 --> 00:52:38,697
What?

744
00:52:40,102 --> 00:52:44,538
Also, you would laugh over their petty trick.

745
00:52:45,273 --> 00:52:48,237
He would have shown his generosity as King.

746
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:50,812
- Queen Jin. - Anyway,

747
00:52:50,812 --> 00:52:54,177
please show us the generosity King Pyeongwon has shown us.

748
00:52:54,652 --> 00:52:56,278
Queen Jin.

749
00:52:57,683 --> 00:53:00,947
I agree with Queen Jin.

750
00:53:01,423 --> 00:53:05,187
Please make a decision that would be best for Goguryeo.

751
00:53:18,003 --> 00:53:22,068
Since it is not a hasty decision to make, let us decide tomorrow.

752
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,737
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

753
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:41,427
I was deeply impressed by your loving mind.

754
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:44,628
Who knew you would keep General Go alive?

755
00:53:46,372 --> 00:53:49,538
You must have wanted to atone before Gochuga.

756
00:53:52,203 --> 00:53:56,538
Then did you not forget your first love...

757
00:53:56,882 --> 00:53:59,608
and begged to spare General Go?

758
00:53:59,852 --> 00:54:01,778
That is wild speculation.

759
00:54:02,723 --> 00:54:06,687
I only made that request for Goguryeo.

760
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:08,187
Also,

761
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:11,657
I have a husband who is dear to me.

762
00:54:14,193 --> 00:54:15,628
I see.

763
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:18,058
Are you talking about the man...

764
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:22,098
who refused to live with you and has renounced this world?

765
00:54:22,642 --> 00:54:23,737
Yes.

766
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:27,207
When the King's reign settles,

767
00:54:27,342 --> 00:54:29,737
I will go live with him.

768
00:54:30,412 --> 00:54:32,513
I hope you will give your help...

769
00:54:32,513 --> 00:54:36,118
so that that day may come sooner.

770
00:54:36,183 --> 00:54:39,278
Sure, I will.

771
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:53,227
Use me as your spy.

772
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:57,003
Your spy?

773
00:54:57,003 --> 00:54:59,768
If I make it back safely with General Go,

774
00:55:00,612 --> 00:55:03,737
I will tell you of every affair in Silla.

775
00:55:04,713 --> 00:55:07,007
You can use that information...

776
00:55:07,152 --> 00:55:09,417
to open a new path for the Prince.

777
00:55:10,082 --> 00:55:11,947
How would I trust you?

778
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,588
Four years ago,

779
00:55:16,023 --> 00:55:18,588
I brought General Go to Silla on that night.

780
00:55:19,162 --> 00:55:22,257
What mattered to me the most were his life and his security.

781
00:55:22,263 --> 00:55:23,927
You must...

782
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:26,997
feel the same way about the Prince.

783
00:55:27,372 --> 00:55:29,568
So, if I let General Go live,

784
00:55:31,102 --> 00:55:33,007
you will become my spy.

785
00:55:33,312 --> 00:55:34,608
Right.

786
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:40,177
I thought you were shrewd,

787
00:55:40,983 --> 00:55:43,747
but you are taken captive by young love.

788
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:49,088
How could you say such a thing?

789
00:55:49,362 --> 00:55:52,058
This is not something you should involve yourself in!

790
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,388
I am the Queen of the former King.

791
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:56,697
If I can help with the matters of state,

792
00:55:56,862 --> 00:55:58,632
there is no reason I should stay quiet.

793
00:55:58,632 --> 00:56:01,028
That is the problem!

794
00:56:05,273 --> 00:56:06,967
There is...

795
00:56:07,243 --> 00:56:10,207
a dirty rumor going around about you.

796
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:13,983
About you and the dead Gochuga!

797
00:56:13,983 --> 00:56:15,152
Father!

798
00:56:15,152 --> 00:56:19,122
And you are trying to keep his son alive!

799
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:22,487
You are trying to keep a failing light alive!

800
00:56:25,622 --> 00:56:27,187
This is...

801
00:56:27,862 --> 00:56:29,902
all for Geon Mu.

802
00:56:29,902 --> 00:56:33,068
How is any of this for Prince Geon Mu?

803
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:38,543
If Go Geon causes trouble to Goguryeo by serving Silla,

804
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:41,213
then not only the Prince...

805
00:56:41,213 --> 00:56:44,713
but also you will be in deep trouble.

806
00:56:44,713 --> 00:56:46,582
I have thought about it too.

807
00:56:46,582 --> 00:56:50,453
Are you saying you are willing to risk it all for your thoughts?

808
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:51,778
Father!

809
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:54,992
You have become the leader of the Five Tribe council...

810
00:56:54,993 --> 00:56:56,818
after Gochuga has passed.

811
00:56:57,693 --> 00:57:00,028
Are you now trying to control me as well?

812
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:04,628
You should learn to voice your opinion at the Five Tribe council.

813
00:57:05,302 --> 00:57:07,598
I am the Queen of Hwayang Hall.

814
00:57:23,183 --> 00:57:25,917
It has been four years, Master Go.

815
00:57:32,322 --> 00:57:33,993
Please excuse us.

816
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:36,128
I need to speak with Master Go separately.

817
00:57:37,703 --> 00:57:39,098
Did you not hear her?

818
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:57,247
I am here to tell you the words of the King.

819
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:03,917
We will reject the alliance with Silla.

820
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,727
The Crown Prince has become quite clever.

821
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:09,727
Or...

822
00:58:10,763 --> 00:58:12,602
did you give him your advice?

823
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:15,768
He is not the Crown Prince. He is now our King.

824
00:58:16,842 --> 00:58:18,838
And the rejection of the alliance...

825
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:21,207
is the decision the King has made.

826
00:58:21,612 --> 00:58:22,768
I see.

827
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,848
Why are you here?

828
00:58:29,412 --> 00:58:31,118
Are you here to die?

829
00:58:31,322 --> 00:58:33,118
To see you, Your Highness.

830
00:58:37,193 --> 00:58:40,028
I thought it would be more meaningful...

831
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:43,927
to see you one last time...

832
00:58:44,362 --> 00:58:45,897
than to live a meaningless life in Silla.

833
00:58:46,173 --> 00:58:47,768
That is why I came.

834
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:51,538
Are you not...

835
00:58:52,243 --> 00:58:54,407
glad to see me at all?

836
00:58:57,642 --> 00:58:59,848
Your plan will never go your way...

837
00:59:00,953 --> 00:59:02,378
as the King...

838
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:05,447
plans to send back the envoys.

839
00:59:08,023 --> 00:59:09,987
I want to ask you one more thing.

840
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:12,358
That night...

841
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:17,457
Was it your sword?

842
00:59:19,673 --> 00:59:22,068
That stabbed my father?

843
00:59:33,082 --> 00:59:34,308
That is right.

844
00:59:37,052 --> 00:59:38,647
Just like how your father...

845
00:59:40,392 --> 00:59:42,618
shot an arrow at my mother.

846
00:59:47,463 --> 00:59:49,088
It should end with that night.

847
00:59:49,632 --> 00:59:53,328
The resentment and ill fates should end with us.

848
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:55,667
Princess, the ill fates...

849
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:58,737
could have ended long ago.

850
00:59:58,773 --> 01:00:01,507
If the two families came together through a royal wedding,

851
01:00:03,743 --> 01:00:06,382
you and I would have changed this empire.

852
01:00:06,382 --> 01:00:07,808
Not at all.

853
01:00:09,253 --> 01:00:11,048
It would have become the world...

854
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,548
of the Gyeru Tribe that Gochuga dreamed of.

855
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:19,518
Go back to Silla.

856
01:00:19,662 --> 01:00:21,487
And forget all of your memories from here.

857
01:00:22,862 --> 01:00:25,058
There is a woman who only loves you.

858
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:26,467
So what?

859
01:00:28,072 --> 01:00:30,667
What about the man who only loved you, Your Highness?

860
01:00:32,372 --> 01:00:34,338
Did you reject me...

861
01:00:35,612 --> 01:00:37,943
so you would be with someone like him?

862
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:39,338
Master Go!

863
01:00:40,552 --> 01:00:43,548
I am here to die. I want to die...

864
01:00:44,352 --> 01:00:46,388
to end our ill fate.

865
01:01:15,382 --> 01:01:16,548
Here.

866
01:01:18,582 --> 01:01:19,888
Come on.

867
01:01:25,193 --> 01:01:26,487
Gosh.

868
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:02,388
Ga Jin and I are married.

869
01:02:02,533 --> 01:02:04,328
I am her husband, and she is my wife.

870
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:09,197
Whichever mountain you hide yourself in,

871
01:02:11,402 --> 01:02:13,237
I am going to find you.

872
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:42,871
(River Where the Moon Rises)

873
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:46,237
Raise an army and chase after Go Geon now!

874
01:02:46,243 --> 01:02:48,943
If you feel falsely accused, show me your loyalty.

875
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:51,312
- Just kill me. - Where is On Dal?

876
01:02:51,312 --> 01:02:54,382
- You saw him in his hiding place. - What did you speak of?

877
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:55,707
Master?

878
01:02:57,253 --> 01:02:59,322
- Princess! - I need to see the King!

879
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:00,693
Do you really want to become the King?

880
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:03,562
If that is what you want to be, then I would fight for you.

881
01:03:03,562 --> 01:03:05,062
So that you can take the throne.

882
01:03:05,062 --> 01:03:06,993
Can you recover Adan Fortress?

883
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:10,033
If you believe the Princess' innocence and let her go,

884
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:11,832
I will gladly fight for the empire.

885
01:03:11,832 --> 01:03:15,003
I know you will lose in that fight, so how can I let you go?

886
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:17,298
It is also a fight to win back my father's legacy.
