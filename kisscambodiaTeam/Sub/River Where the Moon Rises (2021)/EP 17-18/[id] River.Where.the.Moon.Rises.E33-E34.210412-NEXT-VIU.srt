1
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:07,403
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,400
(Characters, incidents, and dates do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:11,634
A revolt?

4
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:14,544
Juam Fortress rose up?

5
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:17,244
(Previously)

6
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,270
I will continue to lead our troops.

7
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:21,913
You hurry back to Pyeongyang Castle.

8
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:24,509
We do not know what Go Won Pyo and his son may be up to.

9
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:26,214
And you are the only person who can stop them.

10
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:27,619
Your Majesty...

11
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:31,150
From now, I am going to punish the traitor for his crimes.

12
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,224
What do you mean, he is in custody?

13
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:35,559
Inform the Gwanno and Sono Tribes immediately.

14
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:37,659
Tell them to be armed...

15
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:39,993
and go straight to the palace.

16
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:41,133
It is over, Master Go.

17
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:43,360
Only my father's plan is over.

18
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,173
My plan has not even begun.

19
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:47,500
Give up, Master Go.

20
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:01,519
Come at me if you want to die!

21
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:05,490
A breach of prison?

22
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:08,094
It is not my duty to get him and his father out of prison.

23
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,460
When things change,

24
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:12,359
the promises can be altered too.

25
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:16,859
I will go if you tell me to go...

26
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,070
and stop if you want me to stop.

27
00:01:24,574 --> 00:01:27,440
(Episode 17)

28
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,484
- Hey! - Let me out!

29
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:31,984
Let me out of here!

30
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,454
- Let me go! - Why am I in here?

31
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:36,653
- Be quiet! - Let me go!

32
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:38,619
Go Won Pyo, his son Go Geon,

33
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:42,119
and the Gyeru Tribe soldiers are all locked up.

34
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:45,430
The Gyeru should serve as a pillar of our empire,

35
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:47,029
and yet they committed treason?

36
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,630
They must all be beheaded.

37
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:54,469
The Go family is of royal blood.

38
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:57,139
It is easy to behead them,

39
00:01:57,774 --> 00:02:00,979
but then we cannot avoid harming our reputation.

40
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:03,009
But Your Majesty.

41
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:05,314
Any news from the Sono Tribe?

42
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:08,219
Lord Hae Ji Weol and his daughter have disappeared.

43
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:11,719
I have men searching places where they could be hiding.

44
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:22,260
The Go family may be of royal blood,

45
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,033
but the crime of treason carries much more weight.

46
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:27,140
That is so.

47
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:30,539
Lord Jin is right.

48
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:37,980
Show your strict determination, Your Majesty.

49
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:51,089
You ended your convalescence and returned early.

50
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:53,260
Do not say...

51
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:55,563
anything else.

52
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:58,129
You deceived my father and me,

53
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:00,604
and now you are full of yourself.

54
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,700
Then...

55
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:06,339
Shall I lock you up next to Go Won Pyo?

56
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:08,409
What...

57
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:18,824
Is your condition any better?

58
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:19,920
Yes.

59
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:25,230
Thanks to your concern, I have fully recovered.

60
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,330
The skies have helped you. That is a relief.

61
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:34,339
The prince asked for you so much.

62
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:36,300
I apologize.

63
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:40,069
Have you decided how to deal with Go Won Pyo and his son?

64
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,950
Tomorrow at daybreak,

65
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,080
they will be beheaded.

66
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:06,473
- Are we there yet? - Yes.

67
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:08,843
Hello. You are so cute.

68
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:11,610
Weol, come along.

69
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:13,473
- Okay. - There are many pretty things.

70
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:15,943
Let us come back later and see them.

71
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:17,380
- I am here. - Okay.

72
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,620
I missed it again.

73
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:23,179
How should I aim?

74
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:27,589
Dal?

75
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:31,989
- Yes? - Did you and Pyeonggang fight?

76
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:34,503
Not at all.

77
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,669
I thought you argued about Master Go.

78
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:40,370
He said he would be loyal to us and yet he committed treason.

79
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:42,570
How dare he?

80
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,469
You should have killed him on sight.

81
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,339
I heard you killed over 100 men in battle.

82
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:52,450
How did that feel? It must have felt gratifying.

83
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:58,919
Do you want to know how it feels...

84
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:02,719
to kill someone?

85
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,000
Empty chest, full stomach.

86
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:12,529
What are you doing?

87
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:17,774
When aiming with a bow,

88
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,414
Empty your heart, strengthen your stomach,

89
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:21,979
and aim.

90
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:24,279
What are you doing?

91
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:25,650
Let me go.

92
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:28,719
The neck or the heart.

93
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:32,250
That is an instant kill.

94
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:34,419
Are you crazy?

95
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:35,890
General!

96
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:10,263
You should have told us if you were coming.

97
00:06:10,264 --> 00:06:12,993
Then we would have sent a palanquin or a cart.

98
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,703
The walk must have been dreadful.

99
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:16,833
I am not fit for a palanquin.

100
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,933
You are Goguryeo's princess' mother-in-law...

101
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,900
and the general's mother.

102
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:26,344
Last time, Dal went to suppress the traitors...

103
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,013
and returned with a great victory.

104
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,654
- Yes. - That is right.

105
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,409
- He suppressed people? - Yes.

106
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,650
- I see. - Move aside.

107
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:44,960
I see you are using the cane I made you.

108
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:47,433
It is nice and thin, just right for me.

109
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:50,364
You are not sick, then?

110
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:53,169
Would I have come all the way here if I was sick?

111
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:55,799
So,

112
00:06:56,944 --> 00:07:02,013
I can tell from your voice that you are doing very well.

113
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,839
Just a bit.

114
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:09,823
That is true. You look like you belong in the Capital.

115
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:11,950
Weol, it must be hard on you.

116
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:16,493
You used to be the size of a pea,

117
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:18,294
and now you are all grown up.

118
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:20,234
Take your hands off me.

119
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:23,164
How dare you grab a grown woman's cheeks?

120
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,370
You are grown?

121
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:28,404
- Dal! - My gosh.

122
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,870
- How are you? - Dal is here.

123
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:36,010
Mother.

124
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:38,109
Dal?

125
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:42,183
Mother.

126
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:45,320
Let me see my son. Give me a hug.

127
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:46,820
Mother.

128
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,489
My goodness... My dear son...

129
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:53,289
Mother.

130
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:56,099
Yes.

131
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,299
Yes. It is your mother.

132
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:04,109
I came here to see you.

133
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:06,710
I missed you too.

134
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:10,409
I know that. That is why I am here.

135
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:14,450
Are you crying?

136
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:16,679
I am not.

137
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,450
People would think someone died.

138
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:21,693
Stop crying.

139
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,359
I am not crying.

140
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:27,664
Why would a great general of Goguryeo...

141
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:30,969
cry in public and embarrass himself?

142
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,804
- You dear thing. - Mother.

143
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,870
I know. Mom is here.

144
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:42,183
Yes.

145
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,544
I missed you so much.

146
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:46,409
Yes, I know you did.

147
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,924
Nice and flat, right?

148
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:53,554
Yes. There are no rocks either.

149
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:54,659
Right.

150
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:56,590
Mother.

151
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:03,833
How long has it been?

152
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,874
Are you all right?

153
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,970
Yes.

154
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:26,090
It is nice and warm.

155
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:30,059
I apologize, Mother. I should have sent for you sooner.

156
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:32,693
I cannot believe I am in the palace.

157
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:35,100
It is almost like a dream.

158
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,529
This is where we live, Mother.

159
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,770
It is spacious and grand, right?

160
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:44,140
It does seem so. Every corner smells lovely too.

161
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:48,083
You came a long way. Rest well while you are here.

162
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,740
I should not rest.

163
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:55,819
So, I heard there was a huge uproar in the palace.

164
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:02,220
It is all over. General On did very well.

165
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:06,260
Are you talking about the suppression?

166
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,230
Where did you hear about that?

167
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:12,304
Did Hong Mae blabber?

168
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,733
Or was it Pil Gu?

169
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:16,304
Why are you so angry?

170
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:17,569
I am not.

171
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:18,909
Dal.

172
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:26,583
Mother. How about moving into the Capital?

173
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,683
We will find you a place to stay.

174
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:29,880
No, thank you.

175
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:32,525
It may be a hut that is about collapse,

176
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:34,425
but I have a home of my own.

177
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,824
We would feel reassured if you lived closer.

178
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:39,090
I appreciate your thoughts.

179
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:42,329
Still, give it some serious thought.

180
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:44,929
Do not push her.

181
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,169
She said no.

182
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:51,340
Princess.

183
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:56,179
I see you made a long trip, madam.

184
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,484
She is my nanny and is like family to me.

185
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,880
Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much.

186
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,155
I am just a court lady.

187
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:06,620
Politeness is not needed.

188
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,829
Princess. The King requested to see Lady Sa.

189
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:13,929
My father?

190
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:18,834
I wanted to know about the woman who raised General On so well,

191
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,199
so I asked to see you.

192
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,305
Thank you, Your Majesty.

193
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,245
When I was in deep trouble,

194
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:26,209
she took very good care of me.

195
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:30,114
She also scolded me as any mother-in-law would.

196
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:31,209
My child.

197
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:34,279
Your Highness, back then...

198
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:38,789
I really scolded her just a little.

199
00:11:41,464 --> 00:11:43,694
The princess who fears nothing...

200
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,059
met her match in her mother-in-law.

201
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,564
I am impressed with what you did...

202
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:52,130
even when you cannot see.

203
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:56,740
Goguryeo women should treat you as an example and learn.

204
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:58,569
Therefore,

205
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:03,709
I would like to give her jewelry and uncut skins and cloth.

206
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:06,179
That would be a great honor.

207
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:11,689
What you offer is beyond what I deserve.

208
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,150
Instead of any reward...

209
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:18,890
I would like to ask for a simple request.

210
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:20,260
A request?

211
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:23,860
Tell me whatever that may be.

212
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:29,000
My son On Dal.

213
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:35,779
Allow him to return home with me this very day.

214
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,020
Mother.

215
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,720
He grew up with nature,

216
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,720
with the bare soil as his bed and the sky as his blanket.

217
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:50,890
I heard he served his country well.

218
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,760
Please let him return to nature...

219
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,559
and live a free life.

220
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:10,840
When did I say I wished to go home?

221
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:14,454
My wife is here and so are my friends.

222
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:16,049
I live well and eat well here.

223
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:18,155
Much better than you worry about.

224
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:19,724
Dal, stop it.

225
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,620
Mother is the one who should stop.

226
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:26,434
I wondered what brought you all the way to the Capital.

227
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:28,035
You came here to talk nonsense.

228
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:29,760
I know you too well.

229
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:32,334
You may be high up and live well,

230
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,199
but that does not make you happy.

231
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:37,199
My life is not as great as some other people's,

232
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:40,844
but Dal, I am trying to help you breathe.

233
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,079
As your mother.

234
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:43,214
I have had enough.

235
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:44,309
Dal.

236
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:52,449
I have no intention of returning to the mountainside.

237
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:54,620
Stop talking nonsense.

238
00:13:57,495 --> 00:13:58,590
Dal.

239
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:11,939
Mother.

240
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,240
Hey.

241
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:16,984
Must you leave like this?

242
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:18,350
Where will you go?

243
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,679
I do not know. Anywhere but here will do.

244
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,684
Jin, stay and talk it out.

245
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:24,949
I do not want to.

246
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,789
I am sick of it all.

247
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:30,659
Bye, Dal.

248
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,035
I came to vent,

249
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,240
but what was that about? Why did she say bye?

250
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:43,844
What happened?

251
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,275
I asked what that was about.

252
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,344
She said she is sick of everything.

253
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,209
Of you, me, and Ga Jin. Of everybody.

254
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:52,614
She left forever, and we are not to look for her.

255
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:54,084
So you just let her go?

256
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:55,454
What else could I do?

257
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:56,949
She insisted on leaving.

258
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,250
Hey.

259
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:08,251
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] KBS E33 'River Where the Moon Rises'</font>

260
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,539
The Chief wishes to see you.

261
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:18,270
I have no business with you.

262
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,370
Come quietly.

263
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:23,309
Do not make us spill blood in broad daylight.

264
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:53,740
Drink it all.

265
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,840
It is a good cough remedy.

266
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:58,110
I know well of my disease.

267
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:07,425
I wished to hear Dal's voice one last time.

268
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,120
That is why I came here.

269
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:12,189
Mother.

270
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:14,900
What on earth happened to Dal?

271
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:17,760
He no longer has the voice I knew.

272
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:21,299
He also lets off a crueler aura.

273
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:25,240
Many bad things happened.

274
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:28,214
It is all my fault.

275
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:29,614
It is no one's fault.

276
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,110
That is how the world and life are.

277
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:34,925
I apologize, Mother.

278
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,480
Even if I were to beg him to come with me,

279
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:40,120
he will not listen.

280
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:42,425
Because he is a fool...

281
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:44,860
who cares only for the princess.

282
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:03,309
There is something I promised General On Hyeop.

283
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,310
That even if the skies fall apart,

284
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:10,249
I would protect Dal.

285
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:15,090
If I am unable to keep that promise,

286
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,989
I would like you to do so in my place.

287
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,469
Yes, Mother.

288
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:40,550
My child.

289
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:45,550
You are so beautiful.

290
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:03,870
Tonight.

291
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:07,140
We will assassinate the King.

292
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:14,780
There is still a chance.

293
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:16,679
Grab your sword.

294
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:18,419
I am sick of everything.

295
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:21,419
I will return to the land of the Gokturks.

296
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:24,489
Ga Jin betrayed me,

297
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,429
and Tae Mo is dead,

298
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:29,729
so I decided to make you my heir.

299
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,874
Will you let me down when I raised you?

300
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,040
I say this...

301
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:38,739
because I respect what you did for me.

302
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:43,040
Even if you get into the palace, you will fail.

303
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,449
Ga Jin is waiting for you.

304
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:50,219
Is she?

305
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:54,820
Yet you tried to leave her side.

306
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:00,390
Wait here.

307
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,435
When the fate of the skies is determined,

308
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,229
you will change your mind.

309
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:58,219
You left and look at you now.

310
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:01,295
What are you doing here?

311
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:03,725
- The King and Ga Jin are in danger. - What?

312
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:06,259
Cheonjubang's chief will attack the palace tonight.

313
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,735
Hurry, untie me.

314
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:09,830
Okay.

315
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:13,475
I was a coward.

316
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:16,300
I knew the chief was gathering killers,

317
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:18,909
but I did not tell Ga Jin.

318
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:20,515
I hated her a lot recently.

319
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,080
You can stay a coward.

320
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:24,909
But do not tell anyone else.

321
00:20:25,715 --> 00:20:27,979
Go to the Sunno Tribe and tell Lord Sa.

322
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:30,780
Tell him to gather his men and come to the palace.

323
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:33,650
- What about you? - I must alert Ga Jin.

324
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,060
Let us hurry.

325
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:50,604
Cheonjubang?

326
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:53,169
I told Tara Jin to bring the Sunno Tribe soldiers.

327
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:55,814
I also told sentries by the gates to strengthen security.

328
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:57,739
He does not have many killers left.

329
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:00,979
They will be wiped out before they even pass the gates.

330
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:03,219
But he still set out to fight?

331
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:06,449
He is even willing to die. He will listen to no one.

332
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:11,320
What is going on?

333
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:15,034
No need to get up so early. Please rest some more.

334
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:16,563
No, I have to go.

335
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:18,570
I think the sun has already set.

336
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:21,100
Not now, Mother.

337
00:22:05,114 --> 00:22:06,209
Who goes there?

338
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:21,699
General.

339
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:24,870
Open this now.

340
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:33,540
You have come.

341
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:38,850
This is the friend I spoke of earlier.

342
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:40,509
She is also my lover.

343
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:46,620
You have suffered much.

344
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:50,024
So you dragged in outsiders now?

345
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,830
Does the color of the rope that saves us matter?

346
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:59,870
I know you are a spy for Silla.

347
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:03,873
I also know that my foolish son...

348
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:05,810
got rid of a troop commander in order to protect you.

349
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,280
Please forgive me, General.

350
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:16,224
As soon as this revolt is over,

351
00:23:16,225 --> 00:23:17,679
I shall cut off your head...

352
00:23:18,725 --> 00:23:20,719
and send it to the king of Silla.

353
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:23,120
Father.

354
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:26,229
You need to take care of this revolt first.

355
00:23:27,094 --> 00:23:29,499
The Cheonjubang soldiers have infiltrated the castle.

356
00:23:58,235 --> 00:23:59,734
What are you doing? Move!

357
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:00,830
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

358
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:03,759
I will go to the King's palace.

359
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:06,100
Escort him.

360
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,199
I must go alone.

361
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:11,570
If the King's chambers are empty, he will be in the Hall of Convenience.

362
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:14,640
We need to hurry before we lose him.

363
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:19,014
It is dangerous here.

364
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,514
Fall back to the outside of the castle.

365
00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:22,184
Once the revolt is over, we shall meet.

366
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:23,650
I will go with you.

367
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:28,560
No.

368
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:31,090
Let us go.

369
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:32,459
Yes, sir.

370
00:24:48,814 --> 00:24:50,110
Sit here.

371
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:55,479
Mother, you wait here.

372
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:56,949
By herself?

373
00:24:57,654 --> 00:24:59,353
We do not know what is going on outside,

374
00:24:59,354 --> 00:25:00,820
so it is rather safer here.

375
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:04,159
Do not go anywhere else.

376
00:25:04,394 --> 00:25:05,929
Just stay right here.

377
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:07,333
Dal.

378
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:08,530
It will be all right.

379
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,259
I will be back to get you soon.

380
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:14,100
Ga Jin, we should go.

381
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:18,709
My child.

382
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:22,880
Please,

383
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:26,284
be careful.

384
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:27,610
Do not worry.

385
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:30,080
All right. Go.

386
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:13,189
He will have gone to the Hall of Convenience.

387
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:22,969
Stop.

388
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,060
Gochuga.

389
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:52,400
Take the prince and leave us.

390
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:54,630
Go.

391
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:57,040
Mother.

392
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:19,729
I cannot let a mere assassin slay you.

393
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:24,060
I will get rid of you myself.

394
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:33,110
Gochuga.

395
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:34,909
Why...

396
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:37,880
did you?

397
00:27:40,455 --> 00:27:42,179
Why did you betray me?

398
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:45,620
I was deceived by the Princess.

399
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:47,620
So instead of trusting my promise,

400
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:52,360
you put your faith in the Princess' ploy.

401
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:55,130
I needed to protect the prince.

402
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:58,570
As a mother, I had no other choice.

403
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:00,603
The prince?

404
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:02,739
Yes.

405
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:05,340
He is all you think of.

406
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:13,880
Please kill me.

407
00:28:14,384 --> 00:28:17,449
If I were to die in your hands, I will accept my fate gladly.

408
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:20,519
Please leave the prince alone.

409
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:22,959
Please let him live.

410
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:29,259
Kill me.

411
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:33,130
Kill me...

412
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:36,199
and please forgive us.

413
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:38,140
Forgive us.

414
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:42,140
Please, forgive us.

415
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,009
Shut your mouth!

416
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:55,259
Do not think of seeking salvation through death.

417
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:59,360
I have no intention of forgiving you, ever.

418
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:27,653
Take the Crown Prince and escape first.

419
00:29:27,654 --> 00:29:28,994
- Father. - Now!

420
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:30,090
Yes, sir.

421
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,530
I have waited for this moment.

422
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:41,173
I shall end your life with my own hands.

423
00:29:41,174 --> 00:29:42,370
Come.

424
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:44,999
Your head will be the first to fly.

425
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:13,699
My son.

426
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:17,400
My son is here right now.

427
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,870
To witness your end.

428
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:28,749
Father.

429
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:45,800
Ga Jin.

430
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:56,280
Father.

431
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:01,550
Won.

432
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:06,249
Empty your heart,

433
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:08,019
and strengthen your stomach.

434
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,390
I did as you taught me.

435
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:12,590
I am very proud of you.

436
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:14,093
You did well.

437
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:16,934
How could assassins enter the palace so easily?

438
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:18,504
What is going on?

439
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:20,304
We do not yet know the details.

440
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,004
First, let us get out of here.

441
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,199
Let us go.

442
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:44,664
Your Majesty.

443
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,728
I see you are still alive.

444
00:31:47,729 --> 00:31:49,594
General Go.

445
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,569
You rat!

446
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:53,004
Father.

447
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:00,375
Are you the one...

448
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,920
behind Cheonjubang?

449
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,990
It looks like the chief failed.

450
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,645
Master Go. How dare you...

451
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,854
Surrender quietly.

452
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,284
You will be treated with courtesy.

453
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:23,464
Leave him to me, Your Majesty.

454
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:30,005
Escort him.

455
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,675
Father.

456
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,784
The entire royal family is here.

457
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,260
It would have been a hassle chasing each of you down.

458
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,925
How fortunate.

459
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:57,159
Go Won Pyo, how could you...

460
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:58,464
Father.

461
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:02,365
Why are you even surprised?

462
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,140
I am here to get back my Goguryeo from you.

463
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,464
Shut it!

464
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,944
Escort His Majesty to the Hwayang Hall.

465
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,580
Pyeonggang.

466
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,744
Protect the Queen and the Prince as well.

467
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,784
That is your duty.

468
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,615
Your Majesty, I ask you to go with Won.

469
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,119
I will catch up.

470
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,385
Princess.

471
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,284
It is no use.

472
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,094
It will only change who gets slain first.

473
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,165
What are you waiting for? Won!

474
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:42,339
- Let us go. - Yes, sir.

475
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:43,735
Princess.

476
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,570
Drop your sword, and I will kill you painlessly.

477
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,904
Shut it.

478
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,610
You are the one who shall die in pain.

479
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,705
Like mother, like daughter.

480
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,589
I will not forgive you...

481
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:41,925
even after I die.

482
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,025
You will never...

483
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,795
be able to take over Goguryeo.

484
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,064
Are you here for revenge,

485
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,004
Queen Yeon?

486
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:57,574
Go Won Pyo.

487
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,775
You may never...

488
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:04,045
take over Goguryeo.

489
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,345
Your sword must have become strong...

490
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,715
by sucking all the blood on the battlefield.

491
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,715
Today,

492
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,760
it shall be drenched with your blood.

493
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,055
Sure.

494
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,595
Move!

495
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,124
General, you must hurry to the garden.

496
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,095
Gochuga has...

497
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,064
What happened?

498
00:37:59,169 --> 00:38:00,905
We can take care of things here.

499
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,514
Father.

500
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,525
Father.

501
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,894
Father. Open your eyes.

502
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,165
Father. Are you okay?

503
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:02,665
- Geon. - Yes?

504
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,134
Yes, Father. It is me, Geon.

505
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,204
My death does not mean...

506
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,704
that the fight is over.

507
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,475
Do not stop.

508
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,045
Continue to fight.

509
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:23,715
I need you to be there, Father.

510
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:25,624
I need you to witness it.

511
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:28,254
You promised to see me take over Goguryeo.

512
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,725
I will be watching.

513
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,764
With my eyes wide open.

514
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,295
Father.

515
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,405
Do not do this to me, Father.

516
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:51,574
Are you...

517
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,514
hurt?

518
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,084
No.

519
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:00,755
I am perfectly fine, Father.

520
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,594
Good.

521
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,925
Stay with me.

522
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,834
Father.

523
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,604
Father!

524
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,675
Father...

525
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:22,944
Father...

526
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,545
Father...

527
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,974
- This way! - Yes, sir!

528
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:25,844
Dal.

529
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,074
How is His Majesty?

530
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:33,684
He is safe.

531
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,655
Go Geon. I lost that little rat...

532
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,755
while getting rid of his underlings.

533
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,194
It is okay. Everything is over.

534
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:47,364
The Sunno Tribe and the Jeollo Tribe have joined us.

535
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:55,204
My love.

536
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,934
You are beautiful.

537
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,675
Dal!

538
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,889
Are you okay?

539
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:09,285
You came.

540
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,925
Pung Gae.

541
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,525
We have to go.

542
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:20,125
Let us go see Mother.

543
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,834
Yes, we must.

544
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,395
Is that you, Dal?

545
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,964
My child, is that you?

546
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:46,885
Who is it?

547
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:00,395
Who are you?

548
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,405
Did the Princess pass by here?

549
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,175
Hey!

550
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,885
I asked if the Princess and On Dal passed by here.

551
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,155
It seems so.

552
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,324
They did not go that way.

553
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:33,364
Let go.

554
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,999
I said they went the other way!

555
00:44:34,999 --> 00:44:36,635
Let go of me!

556
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:39,805
No one passed by here!

557
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,875
Let go of me.

00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,999
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

560
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:08,599
What of the traitors?

561
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:10,339
We are sweeping the remnants.

562
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:12,064
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

563
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,239
Escort His Majesty to his chambers!

564
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,009
- Escort His Majesty! - Your Majesty!

565
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:16,410
Where are the Princess and General On?

566
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,149
- They headed to Magnolia Hall. - Why did they?

567
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,204
Apparently, General On's mother is there.

568
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,749
Escort Father to his chambers.

569
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:25,550
- Escort His Majesty now! - Escort His Majesty!

570
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,844
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

571
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:09,129
General Go, you cannot go out there.

572
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:10,625
Move.

573
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,364
The soldiers of the Sunno and Jeollo Tribes have arrived.

574
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,670
They already hold a dominant position, what can you do now?

575
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,234
The Princess...

576
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,765
and On Dal...

577
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,074
I must kill them.

578
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,574
General Go!

579
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,114
I must kill them...

580
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:39,954
I must...

581
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,795
Father...

582
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,594
My father died...

583
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,305
before my eyes.

584
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,375
Even if my body is torn to pieces,

585
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,084
I will destroy the two of them.

586
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,184
Tonight is not the time.

587
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,785
You should come to Silla with me.

588
00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:20,594
Let us go there and come up with a plan.

589
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:23,995
I will support you with my life.

590
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,234
So, please...

591
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:29,474
Please do not turn down my request.

592
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:32,505
Mo Yong.

593
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,344
Go back to your country.

594
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,645
My grave...

595
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,454
is here.

596
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,724
You are the only one...

597
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,224
whom I truly love.

598
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,864
I know that.

599
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,564
You are also...

600
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:05,375
the one I truly love.

601
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,245
So I will not...

602
00:48:08,379 --> 00:48:10,614
let you go.

603
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,604
Mother.

604
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:44,644
I am here.

605
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,045
Get up.

606
00:49:01,499 --> 00:49:02,735
Mother.

607
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,414
Mom.

608
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:19,785
Mom.

609
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,215
Please open your eyes.

610
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:45,574
Mom... Mom! Darn it!

611
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,614
Hold his funeral with courtesy.

612
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,289
Your Majesty, he is a traitor!

613
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:40,654
He was the Gochuga of our empire...

614
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:43,795
and a brave general.

615
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,995
He was also my friend...

616
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,634
who overcame life-or-death crises with me.

617
00:51:54,769 --> 00:51:58,735
Let him go in peace.

618
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,205
Your Majesty!

619
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:09,584
We have not figured out the whereabouts of General Go.

620
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,090
Your Majesty!

621
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,225
The soldiers of Silla have occupied the Adan Fortress!

622
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,795
Adan Fortress?

623
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,775
Do not go.

624
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,505
Please, do not go.

625
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,945
I am taking my mother.

626
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,215
I am taking her to a sunny gravesite so she can rest in peace.

627
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,455
I know you will not come back.

628
00:52:49,259 --> 00:52:51,695
- I will. - That is a lie.

629
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,995
I know you are leaving for good.

630
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,674
You are going to abandon me.

631
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,844
- Ga Jin. - I am sorry for everything.

632
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,910
So please do not go, Dal.

633
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:10,745
I am the one who is sorry.

634
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:16,114
For thinking that we were meant to be together.

635
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,324
I was wrong.

636
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,725
You had your own path,

637
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,124
and I should have known my place.

638
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,394
Yet, I tried to ignore it.

639
00:53:34,569 --> 00:53:37,074
You know how foolish I am.

640
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:39,545
You said you will be my sword.

641
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,374
You said you will stay by my side forever.

642
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,114
You are the only person I will protect with my life.

643
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,584
That is the reason I hold a sword.

644
00:53:57,329 --> 00:53:59,495
All of that is over now.

645
00:53:59,729 --> 00:54:03,134
That is not true. It is not over yet.

646
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:08,005
You and I must lead Goguryeo from now.

647
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,074
There are only sunny days waiting for us.

648
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:14,844
I cannot let you go like this.

649
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,715
Then will you come with me?

650
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,354
We can hunt rabbits and pick herbs...

651
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,584
like we used to.

652
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,485
Can you live like that?

653
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,765
Okay, I will come with you.

654
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,505
The moment we started being with each other,

655
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,275
we lost our loved ones.

656
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:52,114
Your mother, my father,

657
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,884
and this time my mother.

658
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,725
Sometime in the future,

659
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,995
I might lose you too, or I might break down.

660
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,775
Dal...

661
00:55:23,749 --> 00:55:26,344
I am leaving so that I do not have to lose you.

662
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,485
Please do not leave me.

663
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:33,955
You must become the person you desire to be.

664
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:38,795
Whether it is becoming the sister of the future King...

665
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,765
or becoming the Queen yourself.

666
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:50,674
I will return to being the fool of Ghost Village.

667
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:53,745
No, do not do that.

668
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,884
Dal...

669
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,195
Dal!

670
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:48,894
Dal!

671
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,255
I will protect you from now on.

672
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:44,914
And this means...

673
00:57:44,989 --> 00:57:47,584
that we are a couple that shares the same fate.

674
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:13,844
Could it be my karma?

675
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,185
Did the greed and jealousy,

676
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,884
which I conceived in the past,

677
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:24,255
put my empire in danger...

678
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,124
and engulf my children...

679
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,594
in misfortune?

680
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,874
Do not regret nor blame yourself.

681
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,450
Your reign...

682
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,275
was coming to an end nonetheless.

683
00:58:43,049 --> 00:58:45,180
You need to help...

684
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,914
the Crown Prince and the Princess shape a new Goguryeo.

685
00:58:48,819 --> 00:58:52,785
That is the duty you have left.

686
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,124
Please forgive...

687
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,664
my wrongdoing, General Son.

688
00:59:24,759 --> 00:59:29,725
(4 years later, Nangbyeok Fortress, Goguryeo)

689
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,400
Move.

690
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,400
His Majesty told us not to let anybody in.

691
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,334
Do you not know who I am?

692
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:15,210
I am the sister of the King.

693
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,604
But...

694
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,074
Stop what you are doing!

695
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,755
Let go of me!

696
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:50,404
I have already heard the news of victory.

697
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,749
The soldiers of Baekje were terrified and withdrew.

698
01:00:53,749 --> 01:00:55,545
You promised to send reinforcements.

699
01:00:56,279 --> 01:00:57,819
Why did you not?

700
01:00:57,819 --> 01:01:00,485
There were things that needed to be handled in the Capital.

701
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,390
I trusted you to take care of them, and it is a relief that you won.

702
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,624
We lost half of our soldiers!

703
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:09,854
If you had sent reinforcements,

704
01:01:10,259 --> 01:01:12,424
their lives would not have been sacrificed.

705
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,210
Are you reproaching the King?

706
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,305
(An act of expressing disapproval)

707
01:01:29,779 --> 01:01:31,644
I am only concerned about you.

708
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:36,114
I am concerned about the mistake my brother has made.

709
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:08,614
(River Where the Moon Rises)

710
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,219
Am I the King...

711
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:12,190
or your brother, Princess?

712
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,989
General Go, if you go to Goguryeo as an envoy of Silla,

713
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:16,660
you will be beheaded.

714
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,100
I, Go Geon, the envoy of Silla,

715
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,100
have come to Goguryeo to have an audience with the King.

716
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,394
Go Geon!

717
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:24,995
I am seeing the ghost of Mother.

718
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,670
Dal, let us go to the Capital.

719
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,670
You should go and see the Princess.

720
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,539
I know it is shameless of me, but I missed you.

721
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:34,844
Ga Jin and I are not meant to be together.

722
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,245
Whether I die or something bad happens to her,

723
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:39,850
the end of us will always be a bloodbath.

724
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:42,785
You will be an excuse for the King to raise an army.

725
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,889
Please do not get injured.

726
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,755
Your life is precious.

727
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:50,495
You too, Your Highness.
