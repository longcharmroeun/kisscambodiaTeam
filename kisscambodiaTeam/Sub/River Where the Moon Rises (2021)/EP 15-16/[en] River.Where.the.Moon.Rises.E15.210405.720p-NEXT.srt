1
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:07,257
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal
in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,322
(Characters, incidents, and dates
do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:12,896
(Episode 15)

4
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,562
You found it?

5
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:16,832
I told you not to be afraid.

6
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:20,106
It is the grace of the skies.
The skies must have helped.

7
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:21,762
No, they did not do anything.

8
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:24,131
It is because you called the Princess
out of Magnolia Hall.

9
00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:25,732
That is not true.

10
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:29,271
You and I did this together.

11
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:37,751
Wait.

12
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,721
This is not my handwriting.

13
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:46,151
Are you here to exchange love letters?

14
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:58,971
That looks like my letter though.

15
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:03,072
What do you think
you are doing, Princess?

16
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,511
What about you two?

17
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:09,382
What is this discreet meeting
at this time of night?

18
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:12,811
What do you mean? Watch what you say.

19
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,586
The Princess must have gotten us wrong.

20
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:16,322
Stop right there, Go Won Pyo.

21
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:27,031
Princess, are you out of your mind?

22
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:29,302
You cannot speak down to him.

23
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:30,531
Why?

24
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:33,502
Are you upset that I called out...

25
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,072
your lover's name?

26
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:47,352
We met when you were
selecting the Princess' groom.

27
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:50,752
This is the first time
we meet in private.

28
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:56,162
Your father was a legendary swordsman.

29
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,996
He did not hide behind a woman...

30
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:01,067
to draw his sword whenever he pleased.

31
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,237
Do not dare mention my father
with your corrupt lips.

32
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:04,431
Do not fall for it.

33
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:07,041
He is taunting you.

34
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:16,412
You cannot prove
anything with a fake letter.

35
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:19,782
At times, something fake
reveals the truth.

36
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:23,722
Someone was given the
order to steal the letter.

37
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:24,921
Your nanny?

38
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,067
If it were your command,

39
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,891
she would willingly jump into
a fire with a handful of straw.

40
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:34,636
Who would believe her?

41
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:36,402
There is another witness.

42
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:40,301
Eight years ago,

43
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,641
someone witnessed
your discreet meetings.

44
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,882
You must see but not look,

45
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:57,657
and hear but not listen...

46
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:59,722
for your family to be at peace.

47
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:03,932
I regretted keeping
silent ever since then.

48
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:07,132
If I had told my mother a day sooner,

49
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:11,337
I could have prevented the disaster
that befell us and the Sunno Tribe.

50
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:13,477
I do not know what you saw...

51
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:14,572
Shut your mouth.

52
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:19,111
You are Queen, the mother of a prince.

53
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,752
But with your corrupt deeds,
you brought shame on us.

54
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,951
I cannot even bear
to speak of it myself.

55
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:30,352
Curse me all you want.

56
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:34,662
Or do you want me to bite my tongue
and take my life right now?

57
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,192
You do not know the sorrow
of a woman scorned.

58
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:42,701
If the King had just
looked at me even once,

59
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,407
if he cared for me
just one-hundredth of...

60
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:48,041
the time he pined for your dead mother,

61
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:52,277
then I would have lived differently.

62
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:53,372
But...

63
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:56,682
you two killed my mother.

64
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,382
Including the innocent Sunno people.

65
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:01,287
You should save your breath.

66
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,551
Instead of bringing up the past,

67
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:07,322
tell us what it is you want.

68
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,502
Leave the palace.

69
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:19,632
As soon as possible.

70
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,672
Make up whatever excuse,

71
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,112
but you must leave the palace.

72
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:28,841
Silently.

73
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,151
So no one suspects anything.

74
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:33,951
I am the Queen.

75
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,827
I will not be chased out like this.

76
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:38,651
You brought this upon yourself.

77
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:44,661
For the sake of your son,
Prince Geon Mu,

78
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:47,232
I am giving you a chance
to leave with dignity.

79
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:50,161
Do not cause a scene.

80
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,616
If you wish me gone as well,

81
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:04,911
do not dare ask.

82
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:09,521
I have no intention of leaving quietly.

83
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:14,091
You must hand over something else.

84
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:25,971
Princess.

85
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:30,942
I am a foolish woman,
and I did something terrible.

86
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:33,542
I know why you did it.

87
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:37,511
You wanted to protect
the royal household.

88
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:39,351
Perhaps...

89
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:41,982
Go Won Pyo threatened you...

90
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:44,322
by naming me or the Crown Prince.

91
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:46,591
So I will not blame you.

92
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:49,692
Princess.

93
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:51,932
Just remember two things.

94
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:57,002
Father can never find out
what the Queen did.

95
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:58,802
And...

96
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,641
if you deceive me again,

97
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,711
I will not be forgiving,
even if it is you.

98
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,351
I will see you in the morning.

99
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:36,042
Do you regret it?

100
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,511
Regret?

101
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,277
Using Lady Gongson...

102
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:42,011
to set a trap for Go Won Pyo.

103
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:43,711
No.

104
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:46,982
If I think about the corruption
they perpetrated,

105
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,752
I could have them quartered
and still feel no better.

106
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,192
I do not have regrets.

107
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:57,292
You told me that the letter was real.

108
00:06:58,436 --> 00:06:59,531
That was...

109
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,101
because you cannot lie.

110
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:03,461
I do not mind.

111
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,901
Use me as much as you need to.

112
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:12,771
But do not do that to anyone else.

113
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:14,711
Do not hurt them...

114
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:18,612
or yourself.

115
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,221
Everywhere I step is thin ice.

116
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,521
I do not know who is a friend,

117
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,192
or who is a foe.

118
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:55,322
I was taken, and when I woke up,

119
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:57,922
Lord Kim Cha Seung was there.

120
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,521
Lord Kim?

121
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:02,562
Did he question you
about the missing girls?

122
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:04,792
Yes.

123
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,236
He was furious
because of his great loss.

124
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:10,201
How dare he?

125
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:12,306
For something that trivial,

126
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:15,471
he abducted the Sono Tribe heiress?

127
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:18,411
I will not let him get away with this!

128
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:20,572
You must.

129
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,442
He let me go because I
promised to cover his losses.

130
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,982
- But this is...
- The mind of a merchant...

131
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:28,052
is the same.

132
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,992
I will sort this out. Do not worry.

133
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:37,292
I am glad you are back safely.

134
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,091
Get some rest.

135
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:56,912
General.

136
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:03,422
Do not...

137
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,851
leave my sight ever again.

138
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:10,961
Even if you come to hate my guts,

139
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:12,432
do not ever leave.

140
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:15,701
I will not leave.

141
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:20,402
Also, do not try to deceive me...

142
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:23,042
with a lie like that.

143
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:27,841
You were taken because
of your fake reports.

144
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:32,782
If it were for that,

145
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,121
how could I have come back alive?

146
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:37,951
It was not that.

147
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,192
Okay.

148
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:46,392
Look after yourself.

149
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:52,302
To convalesce?

150
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:56,001
Why must you convalesce
and pray to Buddha?

151
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:59,111
I did not inform you for
fear of causing concern.

152
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:04,912
I have been feeling unwell for a while.

153
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:08,026
I had been suffering
morning and evening.

154
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:09,121
Oh, dear.

155
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:11,652
Then you must consult my physician.

156
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:14,422
Medicines do nothing but the same.

157
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:18,837
I heard that mineral water from
a spring near Hobeob Temple...

158
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,762
cures internal illnesses.

159
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:23,902
I would also like to pray.

160
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,871
So I would like to leave the palace
to convalesce for a while.

161
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,542
Please grant your permission.

162
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,711
I would allow it if it is
to cure an illness.

163
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,442
The prince is young.

164
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:38,957
Would he be able to handle the trip?

165
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:41,381
The prince should remain in the palace.

166
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:45,221
We do not know how
long the Queen will be gone.

167
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:48,621
We cannot let the prince leave with her.

168
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:54,461
I will take just a few maids...

169
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:57,262
and travel quietly.

170
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,631
I am sorry, Queen.

171
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:02,802
I have not been to
your chambers lately...

172
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,611
and had no idea you were ailing.

173
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,412
This is my fault.

174
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:11,386
I thank you for your concern.

175
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:14,581
Since you have decided to leave,
you should leave today.

176
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:17,751
This very day?

177
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:19,621
The sooner you leave,

178
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:22,221
the sooner you can recuperate.

179
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:36,871
Father.

180
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:42,312
Why did you ask to see me so early?

181
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:44,317
Do you rarely come home...

182
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,256
because I have fallen from grace?

183
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,881
A friend was in trouble
so I went to check.

184
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:51,396
Is it a friend I know?

185
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:52,491
No.

186
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:54,822
You need not know of this friend.

187
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:03,866
- This is...
- The Gyeru Tribe's military...

188
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:05,006
(The authority to manage the troops)

189
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,307
is yours to control.

190
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,172
(The authority to manage the troops)

191
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:09,601
Before I give it to you,

192
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:13,111
I need to hear what your plan is.

193
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:25,652
What on earth is happening?

194
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:28,491
You look fine on the outside.

195
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,392
Why are you sick?

196
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,392
Please...

197
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,337
look after the prince for me.

198
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:38,572
Do not worry about anything else,

199
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:42,402
and focus on healing
your body and spirit.

200
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:45,611
As your father,
all I have to say is that...

201
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:49,642
you must return stronger than before.

202
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,052
Mother!

203
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:54,451
Mother!

204
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,522
Where are you going, Mother?

205
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,461
I am going to a large temple far away.

206
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:07,262
I will pray for you to be strong...

207
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,001
at all times.

208
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,302
I wish to pray too.

209
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:14,971
For Father and your health.

210
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:19,942
I will be away only for a few nights.

211
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,782
Be a man and guard the palace.

212
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:24,652
Can you promise?

213
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:28,322
No! I will go with you!

214
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:30,522
Do not be so weak.

215
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:32,697
Until my return,

216
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,461
you must study and train.
Do you understand?

217
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:37,692
Mother.

218
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,001
I will take good care of the prince.

219
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,831
Do not worry.

220
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:44,902
Mother!

221
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,902
Do not go, Mother!

222
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:50,101
Mother!

223
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:52,711
Mother.

224
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:56,312
Mother! Do not go, Mother.

225
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,751
Mother.

226
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,451
Mother.

227
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,721
Did you see this?

228
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:11,731
Sunno Tribe's Sa Un Am...

229
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:15,262
seems to want to challenge
the exclusive rights to salt.

230
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:21,201
He should know that he is
challenging the wrong people.

231
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,072
Is there...

232
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:29,312
another issue on your mind?

233
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:31,782
We should deal with them one by one.

234
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:42,721
Oh, Lord Hae!

235
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:44,591
Gochuga.

236
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:46,792
It has been a long time.

237
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:48,932
I managed to stay alive,

238
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,906
hence we meet again.

239
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:53,937
You made a long, arduous trip.

240
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:58,512
It was incredibly and stupidly far.

241
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:03,142
But only Lord Sa came out to welcome me.

242
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:07,721
The Five Tribe council seems
to care less about manners now.

243
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:12,756
Take a seat, General Yeon.

244
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:14,961
Yes, let us all sit down.

245
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,221
Goodness.

246
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:20,961
I noticed on the way in...

247
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,001
that the palace seems to be busy.

248
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:26,876
The Queen left to
a temple to convalesce.

249
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:28,241
Oh, dear.

250
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:32,341
She seems to be void
of care and emotion,

251
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:34,241
how did she get sick?

252
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:48,461
The Capital Defense Army is very grand.

253
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,532
Are you returning from
escorting the Queen to the gate?

254
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:54,501
Those who did not
receive a title from the King...

255
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,536
cannot be armed in the Capital.

256
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,032
The Gyeru Tribe is an exception,
so do not concern yourself.

257
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:03,402
Put down your weapons.

258
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,812
You are a mere assassin
who was granted a position.

259
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,512
Do not cross the line.

260
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,481
I told you to put down your weapons.

261
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,581
You are nothing but a Gokturk.

262
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,182
Right.

263
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:19,351
Your brother who scaled walls with you.

264
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:24,562
I heard he was slaughtered in battle.

265
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:26,861
How dare you?

266
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:32,831
Stop!

267
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:55,062
Sheathe your sword.

268
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,131
Do as I say.

269
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,322
Take him away.

270
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:32,032
Are you out of your minds?

271
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:34,661
In the middle of town,
the Capital Defense Army...

272
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:36,601
fought like ruffians?

273
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:38,877
Not at a time like this.

274
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:40,931
The Gyeru fools broke the law.

275
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,647
So you drew your swords?

276
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,111
Pung Gae defended me...

277
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,512
I apologize!

278
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:49,282
I will be very, very careful so that...

279
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,252
this never happens again.

280
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:59,522
Your Highness,
the King has called a meeting.

281
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:01,222
Okay.

282
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:05,992
You may raise your head.

283
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,331
Even if I sound harsh,
it cannot be helped.

284
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:13,472
We are now in the Capital,

285
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:17,302
so we cannot act like
how we did in Ghost Valley.

286
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:20,212
They are fast learners.

287
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,081
I am the slowest and worst.

288
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:26,881
Princess.

289
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:40,391
Ga Jin has a lot on her mind.

290
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:41,831
You know that, right?

291
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,702
With that tiny head of hers,

292
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:47,947
she worries about
everything and anything.

293
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:49,101
It must be...

294
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,312
hard on you too.

295
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:52,772
What?

296
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:59,252
I will try to comfort her,

297
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:02,351
but I am not that good with words.

298
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:16,361
Next, a letter from the Sunno Tribe
that the exclusive rights to salt...

299
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,472
should be returned to the King.

300
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:21,776
Is that truly what you think, Lord Sa?

301
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,677
All members of the Five Tribe council...

302
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:25,941
have accumulated great wealth.

303
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:29,016
I believe there will be no harm
in your taking back...

304
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,586
the exclusive rights.

305
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,181
I think highly of your thoughts,

306
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:36,256
but that is for the Five Tribe
council to decide.

307
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:37,651
That is correct.

308
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:40,452
It should not take much discussion.

309
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,992
We could reach a decision right now.

310
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,462
Lord Jin.

311
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:48,101
Lord Jin.

312
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,361
Yes?

313
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,072
It is a good idea.

314
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:59,772
Of the five members of the council,

315
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:03,641
those who agree that the King should
have the exclusive rights to salt,

316
00:20:03,846 --> 00:20:05,252
step forward.

317
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,441
Gochuga.

318
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:34,016
You are standing with those in favor.

319
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:35,282
I too...

320
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:39,111
am in favor of returning the
exclusive rights to sell salt...

321
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,452
to the crown.

322
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,831
I, Pyeonggang,

323
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:56,361
have something to tell the King
on behalf of the people.

324
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:03,242
The fees levied...

325
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:05,072
are but a small sum to those here.

326
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:08,512
But to the people, they are the
products of blood, sweat, and tears.

327
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:11,786
In order to build Jangan Castle,
it is unavoidable...

328
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:15,482
Why is it the people who
must bear the cost of that?

329
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:19,792
The nobles of the capital and
the leaders in the countryside.

330
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:23,121
If we levy the taxes on them,
we can certainly cover the cost.

331
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:26,762
The duty of building our country
does not lie on the people alone.

332
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,002
Enjoying all of the benefits...

333
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:32,472
and yet avoiding all responsibilities.

334
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:34,871
You should know that is
a shameful way to behave.

335
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:40,111
Princess.

336
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:46,411
I will be the first to pay.

337
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:48,252
I will pay in jewels and silver...

338
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:50,921
to support the construction
of Jangan Castle... No.

339
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:55,262
I am willing to give
everything for Goguryeo.

340
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:02,532
I support you a hundred times over.

341
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:05,732
If the Queen Mother had been alive...

342
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,377
I am sure she would
have said the same thing.

343
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:11,671
I too will follow the Princess.

344
00:22:11,816 --> 00:22:15,111
Deciding the taxation in this country...

345
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:19,782
is not something that can
be easily done in a day or two.

346
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:22,351
- It is very...
- Gochuga.

347
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:24,282
What do you think?

348
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,207
This new taxation policy
the Princess has provided...

349
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:45,217
is very solid and well thought out.

350
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:46,647
We should implement it quickly...

351
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:48,641
to ease the suffering of the people.

352
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:51,782
An ill wind will blow.

353
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:54,312
He is not someone to fold that easily.

354
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:58,121
Go Won Pyo will be sharpening his blade.

355
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,191
You are overly concerned.

356
00:23:00,657 --> 00:23:02,197
The Princess is here,

357
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:03,927
and you have a heroic
son-in-law to protect you.

358
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:06,032
He could never point his blade at you.

359
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,762
I shall pick them off, one by one.

360
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:14,131
Those who defy you...

361
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,472
and those who leech off
Goguryeo as its leaders.

362
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,441
I will pick each one off turn by turn.

363
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,522
Were you at the king's palace?

364
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:13,361
Yes.

365
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:17,601
I heard you got rid of
the taxes on the people...

366
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:19,831
for the construction of Jangan Castle.

367
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:22,572
Yes, I went to confer with
my father about that issue.

368
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:25,212
I bet the people will be
really happy about that,

369
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:27,542
though I am sure the
nobles will be displeased.

370
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:31,242
I am saying you did well,
though it was a difficult task.

371
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,012
Thank you.

372
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:39,252
Ga Jin.

373
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:43,727
I heard of a skilled fortune-teller...

374
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,331
and requested an impregnation ceremony.

375
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:48,506
I heard a talented fortune-teller
has set up shop in the city.

376
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:50,331
Shall I ask for you?

377
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:55,101
She knew all along.

378
00:24:56,947 --> 00:24:58,202
Knew what?

379
00:24:58,717 --> 00:24:59,812
Who did?

380
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:01,411
Jangbaek herb store.

381
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:03,042
What?

382
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:04,881
What a fool.

383
00:25:06,187 --> 00:25:07,851
How could I have forgotten?

384
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:10,681
What is it? You can
leave the hard tasks to me.

385
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:14,322
It is all right. I can ask Jin.

386
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,062
Earlier...

387
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,262
I think he was a little hurt.

388
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,431
We overcame numerous
near-death experiences together.

389
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:29,002
What about Lady Gongson?

390
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:31,306
What is it you want to say?

391
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:32,742
Do not try so hard.

392
00:25:33,947 --> 00:25:36,641
Do not worry too much
and do not work so hard.

393
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:38,581
Just do things one at a time.

394
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:41,552
Just do what you can take,
one at a time.

395
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:43,782
Do you think I am having fun?

396
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:45,891
It is hard for me too.

397
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:48,467
It is all painful and chaotic,
but I cannot help it.

398
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,191
"It was unavoidable."

399
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,232
"I had to do so."

400
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:55,732
People always say that...

401
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,702
but there is nothing in this world
that is unavoidable.

402
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:09,312
I will go get some fresh air.

403
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:11,381
Dal.

404
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:01,462
I do see the stars faintly,

405
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:06,972
but the moon is so large that
a dragon could come from it.

406
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:09,002
A dragon?

407
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:13,042
So, is the moon white or red?

408
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,641
I do not know.

409
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:18,212
It does look whitish.

410
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:22,581
I must be the insane one.

411
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:26,421
I am here trying to read the moon
with a child the size of a twig.

412
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:29,621
What is wrong with being small?

413
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:33,431
All right, I will serve you properly.

414
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:36,802
Come over here.
Pluck out some of my gray hairs.

415
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:39,702
My goodness.

416
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:44,072
Do not worry about Dal.

417
00:27:44,677 --> 00:27:46,717
He has been made a general,

418
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:50,441
and he has the most
beautiful Princess as his wife.

419
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:53,151
What is it that concerns you?

420
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,252
When you get old...

421
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:59,752
you start to get many worries
as much as you get wrinkles.

422
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:08,032
What is it that worries you?

423
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:12,532
Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.

424
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,371
What is it that they are fighting over?

425
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:17,246
What?

426
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:20,411
We are all of the same blood,
living on the same land.

427
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:22,217
The three kings could
just get together and say...

428
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:25,016
"Let us stop fighting and
be one country from now on."

429
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:26,381
That is all they have to do.

430
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:29,322
My goodness.

431
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:32,957
Everyone in the world, listen.

432
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:36,427
Zhuge Liang has been reincarnated.

433
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:39,161
Everyone, come watch and listen.

434
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:42,802
Otherwise, I will never...

435
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:47,032
be able to return to my hometown.

436
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,772
Weol...

437
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,641
Do you wish to return to your hometown?

438
00:28:57,086 --> 00:28:58,312
Yes.

439
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,151
I see.

440
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:04,651
I am sure that day will come.

441
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:08,766
Dal and the Princess...

442
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:11,691
will work hard to make a world
where that is possible.

443
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,437
You must be catching a cold.

444
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:17,702
Let us hurry inside.

445
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,436
All right.

446
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:22,907
Shall I brew a warm cup of
scorched rice water for you?

447
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:24,502
That sounds nice.

448
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:35,181
The city is filled with praise for you
and your husband, Your Highness.

449
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:37,552
That is nonsense.

450
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:41,351
Whenever I faced an obstacle,
you were always of great help.

451
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:43,967
I should be the one
who is grateful to you...

452
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,992
since you trusted me,
despite my insignificance.

453
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:49,802
I called you here to
express my gratitude to you...

454
00:29:50,036 --> 00:29:52,002
and because I have something
urgent to discuss with you.

455
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,802
Something urgent?

456
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:18,805
Do you remember?

457
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,916
When you were brought here
to the Hall of Convenience,

458
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,051
you confidently gulped down
a bowl of medicine...

459
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:28,286
to prove it was not poison.

460
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:33,486
While thinking about the favors
you have done for me so far,

461
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:36,725
I became curious.

462
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,769
Back then, you obeyed
Go Won Pyo's orders.

463
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,236
At other times, you did me favors.

464
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:44,995
Whose side...

465
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,565
are you really on?

466
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,005
Why do you even have to ask?

467
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,336
I am, of course, on your side.

468
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,451
Back then,
I gave in to Gochuga's threat.

469
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:57,715
You had no choice.
Is that what you mean?

470
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,645
I do know that. But what about this?

471
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,986
You knew who Du Jung Seo was all along.

472
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,196
Your Highness.

473
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,825
- If I had other intentions, why...
- Quiet.

474
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,295
You are the one who brought
Du Jung Seo into the palace.

475
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,836
You did not arrange it
because you did not know.

476
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,875
You brought him in knowing who he was.

477
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,676
- Your Highness.
- Hae Mo Yong.

478
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:34,215
You cannot deceive me forever.

479
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,456
Tell me who you really are.

480
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:43,056
For the great cause
of the three empires,

481
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,361
I want you to return to Goguryeo.

482
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,666
And...

483
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:50,036
kill...

484
00:31:50,971 --> 00:31:52,265
Princess Pyeonggang.

485
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,786
I told her to.

486
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,416
What happened is simple.

487
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,991
I wanted her to win your trust.

488
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:18,296
So I found her weakness
and forced her into it.

489
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,465
It must have been a tall order.
You did well.

490
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,905
But neither of us knew about
the chief of Cheonjubang.

491
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,636
Master Go.

492
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,250
What else would you like to know?
I can tell you anything.

493
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,815
Do you believe you know
everything about Lady Hae?

494
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,086
I know more about her than you do.

495
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,826
She is the woman I love,
and there are no secrets between us.

496
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,426
Hey.

497
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,296
What do you think you are doing?

498
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:04,176
I rushed over because someone
heard voices coming from here.

499
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,945
It was you.

500
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,245
My Princess, what shall I do?

501
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,646
What do you mean?

502
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,956
These two displayed affections
in the sacred Hall of Convenience.

503
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:20,725
As the Head of Capital Defense,
shall I slash both of them?

504
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,255
You are out of line.

505
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,600
Do you dare to slay the
Head of Bodyguards?

506
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,896
Then let us fight with our ranks aside.

507
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:32,565
We will see who is the better swordsman.

508
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,606
Wait, Dal.

509
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,546
Lady Hae.

510
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,676
I do admire your talent,

511
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,785
but I should have known
better than to trust you.

512
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:52,185
This will be the last time I summon you.

513
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,285
My apologies.

514
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:59,831
Master Go, you may also
stop serving my father.

515
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:03,171
You do not have to pretend
to be loyal any longer.

516
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:05,896
His Majesty would not have
trusted me if I had only pretended.

517
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,576
I did have a sense of loyalty to him...

518
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,076
for a short while.

519
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:17,116
As I did to you.

520
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,155
Leave.

521
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:28,256
Enough of your rudeness.

522
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,326
I will be looking forward to our fight.

523
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:34,595
Sure.

524
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:36,996
Just you wait.

525
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:40,136
Let us go.

526
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,655
Something is going on.

527
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:01,155
- What?
- Not only Master Go...

528
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:05,196
but also Go Won Pyo
may be involved in a plot.

529
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:07,101
I am sure of it.

530
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:08,566
Ga Jin.

531
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:11,795
Something does not feel right.

532
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:13,766
What is it?

533
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,105
Yeom Ga Jin.

534
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,010
Even if you do not
agonize day and night...

535
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,449
Goguryeo will not fall.

536
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,115
How can you be so relaxed?

537
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:37,126
You do not...

538
00:35:39,401 --> 00:35:41,626
covet the throne, do you?

539
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,880
When you were little, you told me...

540
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,781
that even a woman could become the king.

541
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:54,006
No.

542
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:57,975
Never say such an
impertinent thing again.

543
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,316
That is a relief.

544
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,925
Is something wrong?

545
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:10,031
You should have stayed out of it.

546
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:13,196
- Should I have remained quiet?
- Yes.

547
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:16,496
Now that you have shown your hand
to the Princess, what shall you do?

548
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:19,140
You will lose His Majesty's trust
that you worked so hard for.

549
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,735
Still...

550
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,880
I think I won your heart.
So it was all worth it.

551
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,006
This is not the time for jokes.

552
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:30,246
I am the one...

553
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,115
who got Du Jung Seo out of prison.

554
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,161
How...

555
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,886
There is no turning back...

556
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,456
or hiding any longer.

557
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:46,795
Soon...

558
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,965
This palace will belong
to the great Family Go.

559
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,615
See this.

560
00:37:24,401 --> 00:37:26,471
Is this...

561
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:28,510
what you want?

562
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,436
Or is it General Go's scheme?

563
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:35,605
What is the difference?

564
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,520
It is for the Gyeru Tribe all the same.

565
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,946
Still...

566
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,415
Commander.

567
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,686
Yes?

568
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,655
You would even risk
your life for our family.

569
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,896
I am well aware of it.

570
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,826
Much obliged.

571
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:59,665
Soon when the Gyeru Tribe
takes control of Goguryeo...

572
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,905
you will be taking
even more responsibility.

573
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:08,905
You can trust me, my lord.

574
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:21,485
General Go.

575
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:24,095
What is it?

576
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,095
Have you been getting close to
Lady Hae from the herb store lately?

577
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,165
Why do you ask?

578
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:31,971
I have an informant who tells me...

579
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,605
small things that happen in the capital.

580
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,936
According to him,
Lady Hae disappeared for a few days.

581
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:39,010
She did?

582
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,411
Rumor has it that...

583
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:42,915
she was taken to Silla and
barely escaped with her life.

584
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:47,521
I am doing a little
digging to make sure...

585
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:49,716
she does not become a nuisance to you.

586
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,516
I will have to ask around as well.

587
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:57,695
- I appreciate it.
- My pleasure.

588
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,435
- Commander.
- Yes.

589
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,835
This mission is of the
utmost importance.

590
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:22,185
The Gyeru Tribe is
being closely watched.

591
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:25,486
With their exclusive rights to salt
taken away and taxes raised,

592
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:28,431
they must be very unhappy.

593
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:31,996
They may even put their
grievance into action.

594
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,966
Watching Go Won Pyo's home
is not enough.

595
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,435
Watch his private soldiers as well.

596
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:43,205
Are you saying...

597
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,181
he may rise in revolt?

598
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:50,016
Even if he does not, his son may.

599
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:55,815
Keep a close eye.

600
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:57,616
Yes.

601
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,795
(Hwangju Fortress)

602
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,340
Look who it is. Is it not the Commander.

603
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,911
It has been a long time, my lord.

604
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:23,016
It must have been a long journey.
Please come in.

605
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,055
That was close.

606
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:33,285
This time, you try.

607
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,925
Stop being so sad.

608
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,401
You should keep your chin up,
especially in situations like this.

609
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:40,925
Stop crying!

610
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,305
I did not know there was a nice
archery field like this here.

611
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,705
Archery is fun. Why are you sniffling?

612
00:40:57,681 --> 00:41:00,716
Your Highness, would you
like to make a bet with me?

613
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,545
A bet?

614
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:06,386
If I manage to split your arrow
within three tries,

615
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:08,726
you will never cry again.

616
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,031
You are going to hit
my arrow using your own?

617
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:13,371
How is that even possible?

618
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,366
If I lose, I will stand
on my head all day long.

619
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:19,535
- Fine!
- That is absurd.

620
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,055
What was that? You are so bad at it.

621
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,856
That was a practice shot.

622
00:41:58,011 --> 00:41:59,205
What?

623
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:04,545
Wow! That is amazing.

624
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,085
How did he do this?

625
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,490
How did you train in archery?

626
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,161
I did not train at all.

627
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:16,090
I only learned by watching over
other's shoulders.

628
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,356
Really?

629
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:20,301
Won! Hurry over!

630
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,866
Okay.

631
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:24,736
Thanks to you,
Geon Mu is feeling much better.

632
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,466
Thank you, Dal.

633
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,006
"Dal"?

634
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:34,075
That is no problem! We are all family,

635
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,545
Won!

636
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,820
He is not the type to give in so easily.

637
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,256
Go Won Pyo must be waiting for revenge.

638
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,396
I am here, but you did not even notice.

639
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,565
- Did you just get here?
- Yes.

640
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:06,305
What is wrong?

641
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,606
I went to the residence
of the Sunno Tribe.

642
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,016
I wanted to make up with Jin,

643
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:14,621
but I could not even see her.

644
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:16,655
Do not be so impatient.

645
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,085
You told me that she
is your special friend.

646
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:24,695
Okay.

647
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,136
It must be heavy.

648
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:46,346
I should quit my post
if I feel it is heavy.

649
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,415
What is it?

650
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,160
Instead of being the head
of capital defense today,

651
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:54,486
let us just hang out.

652
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,531
- What?
- Follow me.

653
00:43:56,531 --> 00:43:58,555
What? Wait!

654
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:01,896
Hey.

655
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:06,439
Lady Gongson will be worried
if she finds Magnolia Hall empty.

656
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,411
Come on! Do not be scared.

657
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:10,810
I want to have snacks
and buy some accessories.

658
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,840
But the ones in the
marketplace are of low quality.

659
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,710
You must own something
much better than them.

660
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,651
There is not one you bought for me.

661
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:18,121
Why are you yelling?

662
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:19,276
Follow me.

663
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,315
Come take a look!

664
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:24,356
Please come take a look!

665
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:26,315
Welcome.

666
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:38,065
Come by some arrowroot!

667
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,470
- Wow, is this arrowroot?
- Yes.

668
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,771
Where did you get this? It is so big.

669
00:44:41,771 --> 00:44:42,771
From deep in the mountain.

670
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:45,636
- Look, this is arrowroot!
- It is a bellflower!

671
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,876
- It is?
- Hurry and follow me!

672
00:45:06,501 --> 00:45:07,966
Wait a minute.

673
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,165
It is a rare herb,
so it is rather pricey.

674
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:45,100
Thank Lady Hae for me.

675
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,295
Sure.

676
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,335
Please make sure to keep us
updated on the King.

677
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:55,705
- How is this one?
- It is pretty.

678
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,781
- How about this one?
- That one is pretty too.

679
00:45:59,781 --> 00:46:01,850
What was that?
Do you find everything pretty?

680
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,220
You should pick one for me.

681
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,886
Let me see. What will suit you?

682
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,756
How about this one?

683
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,506
Ga Jin.

684
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:47,325
Sorry.

685
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,065
Let us just pick one.

686
00:46:57,911 --> 00:46:59,435
You have survived.

687
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,621
Now I get it.

688
00:47:08,621 --> 00:47:12,955
You are on the same side as
Go Geon of the Gyeru Tribe.

689
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,391
You two are forming a scheme, I see.

690
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:17,696
You are the one who
went back on your promise.

691
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:20,466
You attacked the King
without discussing with me.

692
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,966
And you even tried to
harm Crown Prince Won.

693
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:24,966
So what?

694
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:28,906
There must be a reason why you saved me.

695
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,706
I will let you go.

696
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,476
And I will also give you
a chance to take your revenge.

697
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:38,075
Gather your followers...

698
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:39,976
and assassinate the King.

699
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,591
You want me to plot conspiracy?

700
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,315
Do not worry.

701
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,020
The Gyeru Tribe will
take care of the rest...

702
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,756
once you assassinate the King.

703
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,760
I will punish the King,

704
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,496
and you will justify your conduct
of dominating the kingdom?

705
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,065
I will support you with all the
weapons and funds you need.

706
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:02,006
What about afterward?

707
00:48:03,411 --> 00:48:05,381
If I become useless,

708
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:08,446
you are bound to kill me.

709
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:12,375
I am sure there is
nothing for you to lose.

710
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,385
Hey. If it were not for me,

711
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,256
you would have died...

712
00:48:22,161 --> 00:48:24,055
without ever getting your revenge.

713
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:29,666
So what will you do?

714
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:39,335
This will spread all over your body.

715
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:43,006
10 days later,
it will mess up your blood flow.

716
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:46,476
If you do not wish to
die by vomiting blood,

717
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,790
you will have to get
an antidote from me.

718
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,085
Without your petty game,

719
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,355
I will not run anyway.

720
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,825
Then show me.

721
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,026
I do not wish...

722
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,156
to fight with you.

723
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:44,006
Tara Jin, did you think you
will live after betraying us?

724
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:47,645
Stop it.

725
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,565
What does this mean again?

726
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,075
Did you forget already?

727
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,936
- What does this mean?
- I know what it means.

728
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,206
It is a token that says that
we are on the same side.

729
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,946
You are smart.

730
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,746
We are on the same side,

731
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,986
and we are married.

732
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,325
The Goguryeo you dream of,

733
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,926
the empire you want to build,

734
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,895
I will live there too.

735
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:43,595
So make your dream come true.

736
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,335
I...

737
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,835
only came here to become your sword.

738
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:12,355
Ga Jin is the King's
daughter, after all.

739
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:15,571
What matters to her is
her father and Goguryeo.

740
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:18,200
But you are not even from Goguryeo,

741
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,166
and you lost your only brother.

742
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:22,871
That is all because of Ga Jin.

743
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:26,381
I fought with her as her friend.

744
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,081
You are only being used.

745
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:29,881
That is not true.

746
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:31,421
I am the one...

747
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,486
who raised and taught the pair of you.

748
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,585
Are you saying you value
your friendship more than my grace?

749
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:45,726
You and I do not belong to Goguryeo.

750
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:51,496
Remember the spirit of Cheonjubang.

751
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:57,111
(Hwangju Fortress)

752
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:59,581
I am already very angry.

753
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:01,351
How could he make the governors...

754
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,980
pay more tax to win the people's favor?

755
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,351
The Princess and the King...

756
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:08,391
are both fools!

757
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:12,085
That is why Gochuga put you
on an important task.

758
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:16,331
Starting with Hwangju Fortress,

759
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,901
if governors of each region
oppose the proposal,

760
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,331
the Gyeru Tribe will
take care of the rest.

761
00:52:21,331 --> 00:52:23,625
Go back and tell this to Gochuga.

762
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:29,236
I, Yang Chaek, will gladly
disobey the King's order!

763
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:34,105
Gochuga will highly praise...

764
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,881
your bravery.

765
00:52:36,881 --> 00:52:38,676
I hope so.

766
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:44,690
(Hwangju Fortress)

767
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,391
If Hwangju Fortress rises in revolt,

768
00:52:46,391 --> 00:52:48,355
the nearby governors will join in too.

769
00:52:49,091 --> 00:52:50,756
As soon as he does,

770
00:52:51,361 --> 00:52:54,125
the soldiers of the
capital will be dispatched.

771
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:55,970
How will you take care of that?

772
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,341
I talked with General Nam,

773
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,966
and he already discussed it with
the officers under his command.

774
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:01,506
Well done.

775
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,105
If you pull this off,

776
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:13,545
I will place you on the throne.

777
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,561
Father.

778
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:24,595
I will step back and
support you from behind.

779
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:29,026
My Goguryeo...

780
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,996
will become a great nation
that has never existed before.

781
00:53:33,141 --> 00:53:35,670
I will bring Silla and
Baekje to their knees,

782
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,480
and I will rule over...

783
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,575
the areas which Gwanggaeto
the Great governed and beyond...

784
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:43,345
under the flag of Goguryeo.

785
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,645
I must live a healthy and long life...

786
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:53,115
to see your Goguryeo.

787
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:20,916
What did you just say?

788
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:24,861
You and your brother
wanted to go back...

789
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,855
to your country when you
were done being assassins.

790
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,926
To the plains where the Gokturks are.

791
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,395
So...

792
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,295
are you telling me I can go?

793
00:54:34,631 --> 00:54:36,696
It is not for me to decide.

794
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,635
You should have done
however you wanted to,

795
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:43,540
but I naturally thought
you would stay by my side...

796
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,575
and help me.

797
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:48,406
I only thought about myself.

798
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:50,280
Ga Jin.

799
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,416
You must have had
a hard time after San left.

800
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:55,186
I have been too inattentive,
and I am sorry.

801
00:54:57,891 --> 00:55:01,426
About the chief though...

802
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,456
Are you not worried about him
at all when he ran away like that?

803
00:55:05,831 --> 00:55:08,595
I am sure he will show up one day.

804
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,595
I am waiting.

805
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,196
You are?

806
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,105
I should have killed him then.

807
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:18,335
I will make sure not
to lose him next time.

808
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:27,585
Why did she want to see
you so early in the morning?

809
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,446
Was it about the fight we
had with the Gyeru Tribe?

810
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:35,156
Why are you looking at me like that?

811
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,125
Pung Gae.

812
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:09,385
You are a great shot.
Who did you learn archery from?

813
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:11,295
Master Go.

814
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,125
I know my sister has
past affairs with him,

815
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:18,996
but please do not hate him so much, Dal.

816
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,535
We should have a match
among the three of us next time.

817
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,906
Why do you not try again?

818
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:32,050
Master Go deceived both you and Won.

819
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,416
Are you saying he was
abetted by Go Won Pyo?

820
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:39,486
He could have been,
but he could have acted on his own.

821
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:41,260
Those evil jerks.

822
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,186
I presume the Gyeru Tribe...

823
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:46,355
is scheming something.

824
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:48,526
Scheming something?

825
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,270
There is a spy...

826
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:52,795
planted by Gochuga who
is living in your chambers.

827
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:56,006
Are you talking about Head Eunuch?
I know about him.

828
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:57,681
Father.

829
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,805
I was in a fuddled state when I
was drunk on alcohol and drugs,

830
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,006
but now I can see clearly.

831
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:07,246
I know he is Go Won Pyo's servant.

832
00:57:07,351 --> 00:57:11,260
But why are you keeping him next to you?

833
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,720
I am guessing he will
be useful to use as bait...

834
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,186
to catch Go Won Pyo.

835
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,311
Your Majesty, Governor Yang
of Hwangju Fortress...

836
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:35,276
raised a revolt with his soldiers.

837
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,716
What did you say?

838
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:50,256
(Yang Chaek,
the governor of Hwangju Fortress)

839
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:02,335
- I will go, Your Majesty.
- Dal.

840
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:04,240
It is not a matter for you to meddle in.

841
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,510
We have a separate troop
to subdue the traitors.

842
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,946
That is the only way...

843
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,446
the Princess will be at ease.

844
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,121
Dal, it does not have to be you.

845
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:16,016
Then who would else come forward?

846
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:18,686
I will go.

847
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:21,486
Trust me.

848
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,956
Please let me go.

849
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,976
Gochuga, are you out of your mind?

850
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,209
How could you plan a conspiracy?

851
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,115
It is not a conspiracy but a corollary.

852
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,851
I am only straightening
out the things...

853
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:50,290
the King and the Princess did wrong.

854
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:53,891
Hwangju Fortress has
less than 2,000 soldiers.

855
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:57,496
The most they can come up
with is a mere 3,000.

856
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,730
By the time the King's troop reaches...

857
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:01,800
The King's troop is on our side.

858
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,571
- What?
- The commander who is in charge...

859
00:59:04,571 --> 00:59:07,635
of suppressing the revolts
is General Nam.

860
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:09,865
He promised that he will
not fight against them...

861
00:59:10,911 --> 00:59:13,135
even if the King gave him an order.

862
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,176
Including General Nam,

863
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,285
the commanders under his lead
decided to follow my order.

864
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,790
Well done! Then I will be at ease.

865
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:32,601
Then what is your next plan?

866
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:35,901
If the other regions start to revolt,

867
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:38,895
I will honor their wishes
and raise an army.

868
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,966
I will invade the King's chamber
and bring him down.

869
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:50,921
- Lord Gochuga.
- We are in the middle of something.

870
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,280
Stay outside.

871
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,446
The King's son-in-law is leading
the troop to Hwangju Fortress.

872
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:57,956
What?

873
00:59:58,421 --> 01:00:00,085
On Dal is leading the troop?

874
01:01:18,671 --> 01:01:20,295
This is karma.

875
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:23,365
This is ill-fated karma.

876
01:02:23,331 --> 01:02:24,795
(River Where the Moon Rises)

877
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:25,940
I, Princess Pyeonggang,

878
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,560
will be so bold as to accept
the role of Head of Bodyguards.

879
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:31,080
I will become like Go Won Pyo...

880
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,530
if I can only take him down.

881
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
I am fighting for you, so you can...

882
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,110
Are you saying you became my sword?

883
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:39,380
You said you did all that for me,
but you went against my will.

884
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,820
- Face the reality!
- He is dead.

885
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,350
If you want to save the Prince,
then be on the winning side.

886
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,520
The winning side?

887
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,160
I cannot just stand by and
watch my lady become evil...

888
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,860
like Go Won Pyo.

889
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,050
Your Majesty.

890
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,970
I will enter the palace
as his subject in daylight,

891
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:59,170
but I will become the King by nightfall.

892
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:00,730
I am sorry, Dal.
