1
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:07,303
(This is based on the Tale of On Dal
in Chronicles of the Three States.)

2
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:09,399
(Characters, incidents, and dates
do not match historical facts.)

3
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:11,809
Is this...

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,178
Gochuga's will?

5
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:16,079
What does it matter?

6
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:18,209
It is for the Gyeru Tribe.

7
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:19,448
I, Yang Chaek,

8
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:22,218
will gladly disobey the King's order!

9
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:24,018
If you pull this off,

10
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,524
I will place you on the throne.

11
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:27,889
My Goguryeo...

12
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:31,763
will become a great nation
that has never existed before.

13
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,128
I must live a healthy and long life...

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,698
to see your Goguryeo.

15
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,844
Your Majesty, Governor Yang
of Hwangju Fortress...

16
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:42,598
raised a revolt with his soldiers.

17
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:45,939
I will go, Your Majesty.

18
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:50,409
The King's son-in-law is leading
the troop to Hwangju Fortress.

19
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:54,979
(Episode 16)

20
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,058
Commander.

21
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:02,418
Yes?

22
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:06,188
This mission is of
the utmost importance.

23
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,828
We must go.

24
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:21,578
What are you doing?

25
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:29,979
Once we are done at Hwangju Fortress,

26
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:33,089
kill Go Sang Cheol quietly.

27
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:01,123
Why would you... Why...

28
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:04,989
"A tongue that lost control
is the root of all evil."

29
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,658
That is General Go's message.

30
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:28,278
What do you mean Commander Go is dead?

31
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:31,109
I apologize. It is my fault.

32
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,778
I realized the Princess
had bribed him...

33
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:35,649
and was looking into it.

34
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,288
- He was bribed?
- Yes.

35
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:42,459
He would not do such a thing.

36
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:44,829
Did you corner him
with just a suspicion?

37
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,959
I meant to question him on our return.

38
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,098
He caught on and tried to run away.

39
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:51,598
He even fought our own men.

40
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:04,408
I apologize, Father.

41
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,623
If the Princess bribed
Commander Go as well,

42
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,818
that will affect our plan.

43
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,688
Rest assured.

44
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,688
I checked on the King and the Princess,

45
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,628
and fortunately, nothing got out.

46
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:28,839
One wrong step and we
will fall from a steep cliff.

47
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:31,968
There cannot be a single mistake.

48
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:33,369
I will remember that.

49
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,318
I took care of Commander Go
to avoid the worst.

50
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:47,258
But for a while, we must lie low.

51
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,959
For our mission and...

52
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:52,288
to keep you safe,

53
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,728
I must hold back even if I miss you.

54
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:59,228
If one prospers, the other will too,

55
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:02,169
and if crushed,
we will be buried together.

56
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:07,179
That is our future, General Go.

57
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,318
If it is by your side,

58
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,548
I would not even mind
if it is in a hole in the ground.

59
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:29,728
This came from Jangbaek herb store.

60
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:32,269
Nanny.

61
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,468
Yes?

62
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:35,968
Do not be so uneasy.

63
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,439
This is Magnolia Hall.

64
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:40,538
It is where you raised me.

65
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:43,408
I will...

66
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:46,449
do as you say.

67
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,699
I know you do not trust me,

68
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:06,699
but for one last time,
I will show you my loyalty.

69
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,038
I have located Du Jung Seo.

70
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:13,879
Princess, I will come in.

71
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,379
Do you have news from Hwangju Fortress?

72
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,189
It is not about that.

73
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:28,689
I got a report from a soldier
who is watching the Gyeru Tribe.

74
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:33,959
Commander Go Sang Cheol
was brought back lifeless.

75
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,933
Go Sang Cheol is dead?

76
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,773
He left a few days ago
on urgent business.

77
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:42,468
His destination was Hwangju Fortress.

78
00:06:33,864 --> 00:06:35,823
I apologize for the past.

79
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:38,129
My lord's command comes first.

80
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:41,133
All her loyal subjects left for battle.

81
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,829
The Princess will come alone.

82
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:45,199
I will cut her down as soon as she does.

83
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,428
You will do what?

84
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:52,839
You will lose your lives before
you can even draw your swords.

85
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:55,678
Lie in wait,

86
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,749
then attack at once when
I spray the sleeping powder.

87
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,118
You have only one opportunity.

88
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:44,889
Lady Sa.

89
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,298
Lady Sa!

90
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,573
What did you dream of...

91
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:57,608
that you moaned so much?

92
00:07:57,674 --> 00:07:59,009
It was nothing.

93
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:00,978
Go back to sleep.

94
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:02,579
Go to sleep.

95
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:09,618
What is wrong with you?

96
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:13,819
I will get some water.

97
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:16,819
Oh, dear.

98
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:24,199
Lady Sa.

99
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,839
Lady Sa. Drink this.

100
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:37,138
Do you feel better?

101
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:51,728
Show yourself.

102
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,434
Do you think she caught on?

103
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:59,768
The Princess is not
destined to die tonight.

104
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,299
You can leave.

105
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:38,608
General.

106
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:41,809
The Princess is here.

107
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:05,628
I know Go Won Pyo is behind this revolt.

108
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,199
Or was it Go Geon?

109
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,569
I know already, so answer me.

110
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:17,008
The Gyeru Tribe was behind it.

111
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:22,919
Confess.

112
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,094
We will reduce the sentence
as best we can.

113
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,919
Do you call a beheading...

114
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:30,189
instead of a quartering
a reduced sentence?

115
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,589
I will die anyway.

116
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,329
My remaining family...

117
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,633
has a better chance of survival
with Gochuga than the King.

118
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,398
- You fool.
- Stop.

119
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:41,873
I will sort this out.

120
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:44,539
Return to Pyeongyang Castle.

121
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:46,114
Sort what out?

122
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:49,378
Bring the governor's family immediately.

123
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,579
I will see how many lives
it takes to make you talk.

124
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,218
Yes, Your Highness.

125
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,834
Dal. Were you hurt?

126
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,498
You mean to just scare him, right?

127
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:12,569
You said that...

128
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,744
to make him talk, right?

129
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:16,839
No.

130
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,069
If he refuses to speak,

131
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:20,978
I might draw blood.

132
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:23,944
How can you do that?

133
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:25,809
Do not speak so innocently.

134
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,279
Go Won Pyo and his son
are prancing about like mad.

135
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:32,388
They could bring down
the whole royal household.

136
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:35,718
Whatever it takes,
I must prove their wrongdoing.

137
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,329
They are a traitor's family.

138
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,829
Even if they are lucky
to avoid a beheading,

139
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:43,234
they will become slaves.

140
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,403
You can stop that, as the princess.

141
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,268
I cannot do that
because I am the princess.

142
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:50,539
The laws are set in stone,

143
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,539
and what is right and wrong is clear.

144
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,909
How can I let them off?

145
00:11:57,753 --> 00:11:59,053
I do not know about laws,

146
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,324
but I want to save the
innocent family members.

147
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:03,049
Making the governor confess...

148
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:05,388
and punishing Go Won Pyo and his son.

149
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,618
That is our only option right now.

150
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:25,138
I fought the traitors like crazy...

151
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:28,478
and was reminded of my childhood.

152
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:33,508
The Gyeru Tribe that
slaughtered my tribe.

153
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,049
Go Won Pyo's men.

154
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:42,659
But...

155
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:48,228
last night, I was Go Won Pyo.

156
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:54,939
I slashed, stabbed,
and cut down people to no end.

157
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:00,069
Do not do that.

158
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:03,679
I will do all the killing.

159
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:07,748
You keep your distance.
A princess can do that.

160
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,449
Before I was a princess,

161
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:15,819
I was a killer.

162
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,689
I went to unfamiliar places...

163
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:22,159
and killed people I did not know.

164
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:25,128
When I got home,

165
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,138
I had bad dreams every night.

166
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:32,539
Those dreadful memories are in here.

167
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,939
They plague me even now.

168
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:38,378
All this was brought on...

169
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,179
by Go Won Pyo.

170
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:44,893
The lives you took here,

171
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:46,618
and you and me too.

172
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,488
We are like this because of his greed.

173
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:54,799
So what?

174
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,133
You have no choice yet again?

175
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,228
That is right.

176
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:03,799
If it is to take down Go Won Pyo,

177
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:07,779
I will become like him.

178
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:16,648
My wife,

179
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,949
my woman...

180
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,689
wants to become evil, like Go Won Pyo.

181
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:36,738
I cannot let that happen.

182
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:43,238
Dal.

183
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:49,348
Dal!

184
00:14:54,023 --> 00:15:01,403
- General!
- General!

185
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:02,829
General!

186
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,628
- General!
- General! No!

187
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:14,539
- General!
- General!

188
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,008
Giddy-up!

189
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,419
A revolt?

190
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:27,663
Juam Fortress rose up?

191
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:31,628
Muwon Fortress nearby
is also acting suspiciously.

192
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,398
I guess Yang Chaek is not...

193
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,929
the only governor who
participated in the plot.

194
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:42,339
Your Majesty.

195
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:46,468
A signal fire was lit at
Jangryeong Fortress.

196
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:50,008
What? Jangryeong Fortress too?

197
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,049
Hwangju Fortress was suppressed...

198
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:56,348
- and Yang Chaek...
- He lit the fire.

199
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,888
He did his duty.

200
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:07,494
I did not expect the Princess
would send On Dal to suppress them.

201
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:09,263
If things all went to plan,

202
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:11,529
it would be an ordinary revolt
and not a grand one.

203
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,373
By now, Juam, Muwon,

204
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,039
and Jangryeong Fortress too...

205
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,569
will have risen up.

206
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,839
Now, it is all about time.

207
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,913
I will arm our men in secret.

208
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:26,648
The Sono and Gwanno Tribes
will join you.

209
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,653
Nothing must go wrong.

210
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:32,748
Yes, Father.
I was waiting for your command.

211
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,299
Not yet?

212
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:47,329
It is taking a while.

213
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,339
Ga Jin would be angry.

214
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:53,138
Why did he kill the governor
without permission?

215
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,539
Dal messed up this time.

216
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,209
Dal is in charge.

217
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:00,209
Is he higher than the Princess?

218
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,354
Who do you think got him the title?

219
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,549
Did Dal join the fight to get promoted?

220
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,319
He fought against
his will for his country.

221
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:10,424
He volunteered because
he is the only person...

222
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:11,559
the Princess can trust.

223
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,128
Good for you.

224
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:17,658
What is wrong with her lately?

225
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,799
The King sent me here
with full military authority.

226
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:24,943
I am not here as the Princess
and your wife.

227
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,009
I am here in the King's place.

228
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:29,378
Poachers use something called...

229
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,348
a toothed noose.

230
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:34,519
Pins are set into a rope like teeth.

231
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:38,388
Deer cannot break free
once they are caught.

232
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,858
The more they struggle,

233
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:43,819
the deeper the pins dig in.

234
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,668
If you find a deer caught in one,
you must kill it.

235
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,069
Even if you cut it loose,

236
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:58,744
it can only limp until it becomes
a wolf or wildcat's prey.

237
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,608
Yang Chaek is not a deer.

238
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:03,678
He is a traitor who was
bought by Go Won Pyo.

239
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:04,948
And you...

240
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,283
disobeyed the King to kill him.

241
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:10,283
Just so you do not have to kill...

242
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:11,618
You became my sword?

243
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:13,589
You say it is for me,

244
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:15,894
but you go against me in public?

245
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,958
I did not do it with glee.

246
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,858
I feel disgusted.

247
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,503
I can still smell the blood.

248
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,168
Face reality!

249
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:28,969
Do you even know how precarious
Pyeongyang Castle is?

250
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:31,269
Stop talking about politics!

251
00:18:32,874 --> 00:18:35,279
This is between us two.

252
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:39,309
What shall I do?

253
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,049
Tell me.

254
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:45,489
What must I do to appease you?

255
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:49,418
Please tell me, Ga Jin.

256
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:51,858
Dal.

257
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:53,928
You cannot do anything like this.

258
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:55,999
Return to the capital.

259
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:57,999
Leave things here to me.

260
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,868
We have a messenger
from Pyeongyang Castle.

261
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:13,654
Juam and Muwon Fortresses too?

262
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,253
Yes. He commanded you
to quell those revolts too.

263
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,848
Regroup and arm the men.
We leave tonight.

264
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:21,053
Before the traitors can join forces.

265
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:22,494
We must crush them separately.

266
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,219
Right. We will be prepared.

267
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:25,628
Come along.

268
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,069
What about General On?

269
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:34,368
He will return to the capital.

270
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:36,173
I agree.

271
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,769
He needs to rest.

272
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,469
He is very tired.

273
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:45,279
I will continue to lead our troops.

274
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,519
You hurry back to Pyeongyang Castle.

275
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:50,479
We are already finished discussing that.

276
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:51,918
I know I was wrong.

277
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,348
I am sorry.

278
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:55,989
I messed everything up
by killing the governor.

279
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,628
So you should hurry back to the capital.

280
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,529
We do not know what Go Won Pyo
and his son may be up to.

281
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,329
And you are the only person
who can stop them.

282
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:11,198
I am not asking you as your husband.

283
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:14,408
It is a suggestion I make...

284
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,279
as a general of Goguryeo
to protect the royal family.

285
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,279
It is not about us...

286
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:25,648
but the entire empire.

287
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:45,198
I, General Go Geon, am ready
to receive a royal command.

288
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:46,668
You may stand up.

289
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:52,269
Since the invasion of the Northern Zhou,

290
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:55,408
it has become even more
important to protect the borders.

291
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:56,739
Therefore,

292
00:21:57,644 --> 00:22:01,079
I would like to appoint you
to an important post.

293
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:04,454
Are you sending me to the border?

294
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:06,888
A group of rebels...

295
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:09,458
is disturbing the empire.

296
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,789
In situations like this,

297
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,259
it becomes crucial to prepare
against foreign enemies.

298
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,628
Who will be...

299
00:22:17,664 --> 00:22:19,229
in charge of guarding the palace?

300
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,823
Princess Pyeonggang at your service.

301
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,822
I am honored to be appointed
the Head of Bodyguards.

302
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:43,118
(Head of Bodyguards:
Commander of the king's bodyguards)

303
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:45,858
Welcome.

304
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:52,499
Put your status as
a princess aside for now.

305
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:54,634
As the Head of Bodyguards,

306
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:57,539
keep the palace and
the royal family safe.

307
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,569
As you wish, Your Majesty.

308
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:20,059
What are you afraid of?

309
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,358
I am not afraid. I am surprised.

310
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:25,628
Throughout the empire,

311
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:29,368
there is no place that Go Won Pyo's
evil influence has not reached.

312
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:31,908
General On Dal will successfully
suppress the rebellion.

313
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:34,339
Do not worry, Your Majesty. Also,

314
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:37,908
I will keep the palace
under close guard.

315
00:23:38,013 --> 00:23:39,809
Once the bodyguards are reorganized,

316
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,224
the level of surveillance on
the Gyeru Tribe will be increased.

317
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:45,918
(Surveillance: Keeping a close watch)

318
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:47,648
I need rest.

319
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,688
Is there anything else that
you would like me to do?

320
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:54,789
No. You may leave now.

321
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:56,499
Yes, Your Majesty.

322
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:14,708
Is anyone there?

323
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:16,579
Your Majesty.

324
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:32,898
Look who it is.

325
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:42,438
What is that?

326
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:50,178
General Go.

327
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,059
Some say that a second
feels like three years.

328
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:02,858
But for me, it felt like ten.

329
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:04,698
I missed you.

330
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:06,829
You need not tell me...

331
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:10,668
what I already know.

332
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:34,529
Head Eunuch told me that...

333
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,029
the King asked for medicine.

334
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,198
Yes.

335
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:42,799
He kept away for a while,

336
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:45,069
but he suddenly asked for it today.

337
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:47,809
He must be terribly anxious.

338
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:50,279
Of course.

339
00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:53,009
The royal family is in dire danger.

340
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:56,249
I prepared the medicine
much stronger than usual.

341
00:25:56,283 --> 00:25:57,519
For the next few days,

342
00:25:58,353 --> 00:26:00,418
he will not be able to think straight.

343
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:02,989
I heard that you are being
sent to a fortress up north.

344
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,489
Before that,

345
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:12,569
I will put my plan into action.

346
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:20,009
As the Head of Bodyguards,
the Princess will fight back.

347
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:23,539
But with On Dal away
and the King intoxicated,

348
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:25,408
she will not be able to do much.

349
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:28,049
Still,

350
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:30,549
never let your guard down.

351
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:35,458
In a few days,

352
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:39,059
Goguryeo will see a new king.

353
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,428
He will rise up in revolt soon.

354
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:47,428
You cannot hide a nail in a sack.

355
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:50,469
When he feels that he
cannot wait any longer,

356
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:54,773
he will take action
without waiting for a cause.

357
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:57,214
The Gyeru Tribe's private armies
alone are extremely strong.

358
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:59,848
With the Gwanno Tribe
and the Sono Tribe's help,

359
00:27:00,414 --> 00:27:02,348
they will be hard to beat.

360
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:06,924
Uncle, have you sent a message
to the Jeollo Tribe yet?

361
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:08,388
I have.

362
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,059
But they are too far away.

363
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:14,664
Even if they rush here as soon
as they get the message,

364
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:16,658
it will take at least 10 days.

365
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:19,868
Ten days.

366
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:23,368
Until the Jeollo Tribe's
armies arrive...

367
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:27,269
and General On comes back
after suppressing the rebellion,

368
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,813
we will have to stall for time.

369
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:32,708
Do you think the rebellion
will be suppressed soon?

370
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:35,378
We have no choice but to believe so.

371
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:38,049
We must trust General On...

372
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:39,989
and wait.

373
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:14,019
- Charge!
- Charge!

374
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:55,858
Get them!

375
00:28:57,763 --> 00:28:59,168
Get them!

376
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:09,074
Lady Sa.

377
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,674
Lady Sa.

378
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,619
Lady Sa! You are coughing up blood.

379
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,583
Stop making a fuss. Bring me some water.

380
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,663
Should I go down to Ghost Valley
and get some medicinal herbs?

381
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,494
I do not need medicine.

382
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:35,093
- Weol.
- Yes?

383
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,163
As soon as you wake up tomorrow,

384
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,939
pack up.

385
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,549
"Pack"? Where are we going?

386
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:47,943
If you know where we are going,
you will not come with me?

387
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:52,243
I will be okay.

388
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:11,163
Vicious rumors have reached
even the people at remote temples.

389
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:15,234
They were worried that
our empire might be divided.

390
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:18,443
Do not worry about the imperial palace.

391
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:21,273
Go back to the temple.

392
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:24,389
How could I not worry?

393
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:26,049
If there is a bloodbath at the palace,

394
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,353
no one will protect my son.

395
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:31,958
Please promise me...

396
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:35,754
that you will do whatever
it takes to keep my son safe.

397
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,723
Before you give me your word,

398
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,593
I will not return.

399
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,343
When you were kicked out of the palace,

400
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:04,384
do you know why I did not
challenge the Princess?

401
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:09,593
It is because the King's days
are numbered.

402
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,333
When the new world has come,

403
00:32:15,338 --> 00:32:18,634
you can take your time to
come back to the palace.

404
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,984
Then, my son will be safe. Right?

405
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,354
Are you not ill anymore?

406
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:18,963
Our empire is in confusion.
I had to do something.

407
00:33:19,428 --> 00:33:22,164
Go Won Pyo will not
let Prince Geon Mu live.

408
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:26,674
That will be the case
for Go Geon as well.

409
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:29,538
They must know that the
Prince will be a problem later.

410
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,574
Why would they show mercy on the Prince?

411
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,944
I do not follow you.

412
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:39,914
They are stepbrothers,
but they are very close.

413
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:44,854
Crown Prince Won can pass down
the crown to Prince Geon Mu.

414
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,724
If you want to save the Prince... No.

415
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:54,334
If you want to see him
ascend to the throne,

416
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,034
choose the winning side.

417
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:00,034
The winning side?

418
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,873
Then,

419
00:34:04,348 --> 00:34:07,018
are you saying the Gyeru Tribe
is fighting a losing battle?

420
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:10,143
Yes. They will lose.

421
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:17,024
Lord Hae of the Sono Tribe
has already sided with our family.

422
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:21,323
I am sure you know...

423
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,993
he is the best person to
calculate gains and losses.

424
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,534
Your petty trick will not work on me.

425
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,203
My trick may be petty or grand.

426
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,743
Think carefully about it.

427
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,654
General On.

428
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,594
Dal.

429
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,633
It is dead.

430
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,544
What?

431
00:35:15,648 --> 00:35:19,614
I did not kill it, but this guy just...

432
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:24,053
No. Did I kill it?

433
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:29,354
Pung Gae. Did I kill it?

434
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,623
What are you talking about?
No, you did not.

435
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:24,714
It is chilly at night.
I am afraid you might catch a cold.

436
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,013
Nanny.

437
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:30,753
I cannot see the moon.

438
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:36,193
The moon is always in the sky.

439
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,924
It is just hiding behind the cloud.

440
00:36:39,939 --> 00:36:43,433
Will it come back out?

441
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:47,373
It will, right?

442
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,154
A silver mine?

443
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:12,869
Let me get this straight.
You have found a silver mine...

444
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:15,393
from the territory you have gotten back?

445
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,604
Yes, that is right.

446
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,803
Given how widely it spreads,

447
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:23,844
the scale of the mine...

448
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,284
What did the Princess say about that?

449
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:34,619
Upon the discovery of silver mines,
it is required by law...

450
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,183
that they are returned to the empire.

451
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,588
I have not told her yet.

452
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:41,858
Our empire is on
the edge of a precipice.

453
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:44,369
I cannot tell who will come out
as victors of this fight.

454
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:46,028
(A situation that could
bring a disaster at any minute)

455
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:47,797
To be honest,

456
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,139
keeping our tribe safe
is our first priority.

457
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:51,939
That is true.

458
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,133
That is why...

459
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,373
I asked to meet you quietly.

460
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,643
You are the most experienced
in matters such as these.

461
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:04,918
If you want to dig
silver out of the mine,

462
00:38:04,918 --> 00:38:07,619
you must think about mining,
transportation, and refinery.

463
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,253
It will cost a fortune
to take care of this.

464
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:13,054
That is why...

465
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,194
What do you think about...

466
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:20,263
keeping this between us and
proceeding with this business?

467
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:27,773
Lord Hae!

468
00:38:28,078 --> 00:38:30,204
You are here too, Lord Sa.

469
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,448
Excuse me. I have things
to take care of.

470
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:36,944
- Bye.
- Wait.

471
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,214
Goodness.

472
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:44,489
It looks like you and
Lord Sa of the Sunno Tribe were...

473
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,423
having an important conversation
this early in the morning.

474
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:50,893
Important? No. We were just
talking about the weather.

475
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:56,804
Is this something...

476
00:38:57,509 --> 00:39:01,908
Gochuga and I should not be aware of?

477
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:04,304
How could you ask me
something like that?

478
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,479
I am not some subordinate
of the Gyeru Tribe.

479
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:09,543
Must I tell him everything 
when I am exchanging pleasantries?

480
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:13,184
I have my pride! Unbelievable.

481
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:15,484
"Pride"?

482
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,023
My Queen!

483
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,893
What did you find out, Father?

484
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,423
You were right.

485
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:31,204
Seeing how flustered Lord Hae was,

486
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,474
I am sure he is siding with the King.

487
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:40,444
We are in a predicament.

488
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,844
If we support the Gyeru Tribe,

489
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,859
our entire family might
face a deadly disaster.

490
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:51,558
(A disaster that could
wipe out an entire family)

491
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,423
What should we do?

492
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,393
You said the uprising
will happen soon, correct?

493
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:01,834
Whether it is the royal family
or the Gyeru Tribe,

494
00:40:03,438 --> 00:40:05,503
we must choose one.

495
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:36,334
I hear the King wanted to see you.

496
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:41,533
I bet he is not in his right mind
as he must be high on drugs.

497
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,043
Why did he want to see you?

498
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,844
I guess he wants to die
faster than we thought.

499
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:01,224
We will carry it out tonight.

500
00:41:03,198 --> 00:41:06,023
I will enter the palace
as a subject in daylight,

501
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,434
but I will become
its owner by nightfall.

502
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:13,734
Yes, Father.

503
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,484
Gochuga of the Gyeru Tribe
is here, Your Majesty.

504
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,253
Really? Is that what happened?

505
00:41:34,398 --> 00:41:37,498
Oh, look. It is Gochuga.

506
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:38,999
Did you call for him?

507
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,269
Did you want to show him
the state I am in?

508
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:43,709
You told him to come see you,
Your Majesty.

509
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,003
I did?

510
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:49,234
That is strange.

511
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:52,273
Anyway, since you are here,
please take a seat.

512
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:59,283
Why did I tell Gochuga to come see me?

513
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:03,653
There must be a reason I called him.

514
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,653
If it is not something urgent,
you can take your time to tell me.

515
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:07,928
Why do you not take a rest,
Your Majesty?

516
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:10,568
Oh, I remember now!

517
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:14,234
There is a rat roaming
around the palace,

518
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:17,503
and I want you to catch it.

519
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,589
I caught the rat who told Gochuga...

520
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,054
that you were looking for some medicine.

521
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:52,133
You have been living off the money
Gochuga has been paying, right?

522
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:56,974
I am falsely accused.
That is not true, Your Majesty...

523
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,883
You must go back to your chambers,
Royal Consort Hyeon.

524
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,554
From now, I am going to
punish the traitor for his crimes.

525
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:27,673
What do you mean?

526
00:43:28,379 --> 00:43:30,777
Are you saying Father is
in custody at the palace?

527
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:33,444
Yes, General. Head Eunuch
was beheaded on the spot.

528
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,854
General Go, what shall we do?

529
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:52,493
Inform the Gwanno and
Sono Tribes immediately.

530
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:54,964
Tell them to be armed...

531
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:57,934
and go straight to the palace.

532
00:43:58,509 --> 00:43:59,834
Yes, General!

533
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:07,243
Mo Yong!

534
00:44:10,178 --> 00:44:12,383
Did the soldiers of our tribe
depart already?

535
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,354
I dispatched them just now.

536
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:17,623
But it seems Gochuga...

537
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:20,753
fell into a trap.

538
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:26,763
It is okay as long as
General Go is safe.

539
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,934
He will lead the revolt to success.

540
00:44:36,538 --> 00:44:37,704
Wait.

541
00:44:39,648 --> 00:44:41,944
- Are you from the Sono Tribe?
- Yes, General.

542
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:44,684
- What about the Gwanno Tribe?
- I have not seen them yet.

543
00:44:46,749 --> 00:44:49,314
- Let us go.
- Let us go!

544
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,533
You led armed soldiers
to the palace at this hour.

545
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:12,349
You could be punished for revolt.

546
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:13,844
This is not a revolt.

547
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,913
You are being harsh, Your Highness.

548
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,184
How can a son just sit back and watch...

549
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:26,153
when his father is being
detained within the palace?

550
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:29,694
He is having a conversation
with the King.

551
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:32,523
He will return home when it is over,

552
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,364
so take your soldiers away.

553
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:42,834
Since we are here anyway,

554
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:45,844
we will escort him home.

555
00:45:47,379 --> 00:45:49,273
I told you to go away.

556
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,253
I will wait.

557
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:04,023
So General Go must be here
with his private army.

558
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:08,893
He is a filial son, you see.

559
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:12,204
You will only need to say a word.

560
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:14,903
If you tell them to give up their arms,

561
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:17,403
you will be able to spare many lives.

562
00:46:20,749 --> 00:46:22,373
You should...

563
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:25,684
spare their lives yourself.

564
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:31,684
Do you covet the throne that much?

565
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,198
Enough to shed blood?

566
00:46:34,198 --> 00:46:35,824
You have been...

567
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,723
on the throne for too long.

568
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:43,933
If you give up the throne,

569
00:46:44,939 --> 00:46:47,338
the internal strife will subside.

570
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:51,143
(A dispute or conflict among
the members of a group)

571
00:46:52,808 --> 00:46:54,544
I feel sorry for you.

572
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:01,354
Whose side...

573
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:04,483
do you think the Gwanno Tribe will take?

574
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:14,067
- Are you from the Gwanno Tribe?
- Yes, General.

575
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:16,264
- I see that you made it.
- Yes, General.

576
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:17,604
Get moving!

577
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:31,683
Royal Consort Jin is
from the Gwanno Tribe.

578
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,544
Did you think they would stand
against the royal household...

579
00:47:34,058 --> 00:47:36,254
just because they are
afraid of the Gyeru Tribe?

580
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:43,524
Your Majesty,
the Gwanno Tribe has joined us.

581
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:46,524
Lord Sa.

582
00:47:47,568 --> 00:47:50,064
The Gyeru Tribe is in terminal decline,

583
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:53,264
but I guess Gochuga is the
only one who cannot see that.

584
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,304
Go Won Pyo.

585
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:00,814
Either you and your son will die alone,

586
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:03,314
or your entire tribe will be massacred.

587
00:48:07,149 --> 00:48:09,153
You should make your decision.

588
00:48:16,729 --> 00:48:19,123
Dismiss your private army
and surrender immediately.

589
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,494
That was Gochuga's order!

590
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:29,274
He is lying! Do not be shaken!

591
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:37,713
- It is over, Master Go.
- No, it is not.

592
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:40,784
Only my father's plan is over.

593
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,614
My plan has not even begun.

594
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,193
Take up arms!

595
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:57,804
Give up, Master Go.

596
00:48:57,838 --> 00:48:59,834
You will have to kill me
for this to be over.

597
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,933
I do not wish to do that.

598
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,604
Fine. Then I will finish this.

599
00:49:53,888 --> 00:49:56,893
Come at me if you want to die!

600
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,193
I will slice...

601
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:06,433
even the last piece of your flesh...

602
00:50:07,578 --> 00:50:10,004
and the last piece of your bone.

603
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,969
You should leave with Father.

604
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:38,709
What do you mean? What about you?

605
00:50:38,709 --> 00:50:40,538
There is someone I need to save.

606
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,433
Are you talking about General Go Geon?

607
00:50:42,479 --> 00:50:44,749
He is as good as dead.

608
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:46,604
What are you planning to do?

609
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:48,378
Please leave with him.

610
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,949
I do not even know
where we are fleeing to.

611
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,218
How can I just follow him?

612
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,854
I am only trying to pay you
back for taking me in.

613
00:50:55,858 --> 00:50:57,653
Please trust me.

614
00:50:58,328 --> 00:50:59,453
Hurry!

615
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:02,794
Mo Yong!

616
00:51:05,828 --> 00:51:07,064
Let us go.

617
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:19,749
(Jangbaek)

618
00:51:19,749 --> 00:51:21,213
Find him!

619
00:51:21,919 --> 00:51:24,344
- Find Hae Ji Weol!
- Find him!

620
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:29,554
- Find Hae Ji Weol!
- Look everywhere!

621
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:33,383
Find Hae Ji Weol!

622
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:34,824
Find him!

623
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:43,068
- Keep quiet!
- Get me out of here!

624
00:51:43,068 --> 00:51:45,669
- Quiet down!
- Get me out of here!

625
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:49,274
- Shut it!
- Let me go!

626
00:51:50,479 --> 00:51:53,744
- Let me go!
- Get me out of here!

627
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:55,519
Let me go!

628
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,643
Quiet down! Be quiet!

629
00:52:08,098 --> 00:52:09,393
Is this...

630
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:14,733
Is this mess...

631
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,834
what you really wanted?

632
00:52:21,979 --> 00:52:25,173
You should have told us to fight
even if it meant death!

633
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:28,744
Even if the two of us die,

634
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:35,254
the Gyeru Tribe has to live on.

635
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:39,683
Father. You are the Gyeru Tribe itself.

636
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:42,754
Do you not get it?

637
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:04,344
I will not fail like you did.

638
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:14,754
You brought me into this world,

639
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:17,393
but I will decide...

640
00:53:18,399 --> 00:53:20,294
how I die.

641
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:56,893
If you do not wish to
die by vomiting blood,

642
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:59,564
you will have to get
an antidote from me.

643
00:54:04,509 --> 00:54:06,378
(Silla, Seorabeol)

644
00:54:06,378 --> 00:54:09,913
The internal disturbance in Goguryeo
is getting more interesting.

645
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,249
When things are chaotic on the inside,

646
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,284
it gives us a good opportunity
to attack them.

647
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:18,689
This is a golden opportunity
to take back Adan Fortress.

648
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:19,953
Yes, Your Majesty.

649
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:23,193
The troops are already waiting
for your command, Your Majesty.

650
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:25,328
Dispatch the troops to
Adan Fortress immediately...

651
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,269
and drive out the Goguryeo people.

652
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:29,264
I will convey your order, Your Majesty.

653
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:32,163
Is he waiting outside?

654
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:35,534
Bring him in!

655
00:54:50,689 --> 00:54:52,254
That is not necessary.

656
00:54:56,028 --> 00:55:00,223
Are you Hae Ji Weol of the
Sono Tribe from Goguryeo?

657
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:03,933
That is right, Your Majesty.

658
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:17,344
Welcome to Silla.

659
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,249
I hear you are good at
calculating gains and losses.

660
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,014
You should use
your ability for Silla's gain.

661
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:26,254
You are too kind, Your Majesty.

662
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,264
I promise...

663
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:38,564
that you will be able to
come to Silla in glory...

664
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,034
when Goguryeo falls.

665
00:56:03,399 --> 00:56:05,723
I am here to meet your chief.

666
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:16,834
A breach of prison?

667
00:56:17,108 --> 00:56:20,344
You usually have good judgment,
but you are being foolish.

668
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,774
As I promised with Go Geon,

669
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:25,287
I only need to kill the King.

670
00:56:25,288 --> 00:56:27,858
It is not my duty to get him
and his father out of prison.

671
00:56:27,858 --> 00:56:29,584
When things change,

672
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:32,324
the promises can be altered too.

673
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:35,528
I need killers to bring to the prison.

674
00:56:35,528 --> 00:56:37,499
Do you dare to give me an order?

675
00:56:37,499 --> 00:56:39,564
It is not an order. It is a solution.

676
00:56:39,899 --> 00:56:42,994
It is the only solution
that can save your life.

677
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:47,804
You need to take the
antidote in two days.

678
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:49,804
Otherwise,

679
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:52,973
you will die...

680
00:56:53,108 --> 00:56:55,348
by bleeding from every
orifice in your body.

681
00:56:55,348 --> 00:56:58,749
I can torture you until
you hand over the antidote.

682
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,784
I would love to see you try.

683
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:03,653
Let us see if I confess first...

684
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:06,383
or if you die before that.

685
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:46,123
Do not do that.

686
00:57:48,338 --> 00:57:50,233
I reek of blood.

687
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:00,943
Ga Jin.

688
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:04,943
Am I...

689
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:08,284
a complete fool?

690
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:11,284
Who told you that?

691
00:58:15,298 --> 00:58:16,623
I did.

692
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,064
Saying that makes you a complete fool.

693
00:58:26,939 --> 00:58:30,034
It is okay as long
as you do not think...

694
00:58:34,209 --> 00:58:35,943
I am a fool.

695
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:50,653
The water was...

696
00:58:53,068 --> 00:58:55,094
so sweet and refreshing.

697
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:58,903
The water from the well we dug together.

698
00:59:11,419 --> 00:59:13,643
It was as clear as morning dew.

699
00:59:17,088 --> 00:59:18,953
Do you think it still is?

700
00:59:23,598 --> 00:59:25,264
Of course.

701
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:46,883
This does not taste like
the water from the well.

702
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:53,054
Because it is stained with blood.

703
01:00:01,638 --> 01:00:03,294
I am sorry, Dal.

704
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:11,473
I am sorry for everything.

705
01:00:23,189 --> 01:00:24,983
Do not be sorry.

706
01:00:28,528 --> 01:00:30,693
I will go if you tell me to go...

707
01:00:36,669 --> 01:00:38,403
and stop if you want me to stop.

708
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:26,114
(River Where the Moon Rises)

709
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,689
Why did you...

710
01:01:27,689 --> 01:01:29,058
Why?

711
01:01:29,058 --> 01:01:30,719
Why did you betray me?

712
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:32,558
She said she is completely sick of us.

713
01:01:32,558 --> 01:01:35,058
She is sick of all of us,
including Ga Jin.

714
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,597
I have chosen you as
the next chief of Cheonjubang.

715
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:39,723
Are you going to betray my kindness?

716
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:42,169
I know that you are a spy from Silla.

717
01:01:42,169 --> 01:01:44,038
As soon as this is over,

718
01:01:44,038 --> 01:01:47,138
I will behead you and send
your head to the King of Silla.

719
01:01:47,138 --> 01:01:49,578
I hear you killed
more than 100 traitors.

720
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:50,909
How did it feel?

721
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:53,808
You want to know
what it is like to kill a man?

722
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:56,479
Have you decided on what to do
with Go Won Pyo and his son?

723
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,388
I have decided to execute them...

724
01:01:58,388 --> 01:02:00,584
first thing tomorrow.

725
01:02:00,588 --> 01:02:03,888
My goodness. My son.

726
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:06,328
Please allow my son, Dal,

727
01:02:06,328 --> 01:02:09,729
to go back to our village with me.

728
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:12,798
I do not wish to go back
to the village at all,

729
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:14,499
so do not be ridiculous.

730
01:02:14,499 --> 01:02:16,798
I am only trying to help you breathe...

731
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:18,133
because I am your mother.

732
01:02:20,108 --> 01:02:22,834
Son, is that you?

733
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:25,844
Your Majesty!

734
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:32,014
I see that you are still alive.
