It's getting late. I have to go.

Wait a minute.

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,180
It's so cute.

7
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,980
Haven't you been waiting all night?

8
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,260
All night?

9
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Didn't you?

10
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,220
No.

I... I wasn't waiting for anything.

13

Really?

14
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,020
Pure and naive.

Are you sure you're okay, Ding?

20
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm fine.

21
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,180
Then stay safe.

22
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
Give me Liang Chen's address.

23
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,400
What's wrong? Is her house on fire?

Yes, it's on fire. I'm in a rush
to put out the fire.

I'm going to put out the fire too.

Wait, let me change
into a suit and tie first.

27

Just give me the address.

28
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,170
I don't need you to put out the fire.

who betrays his friend.

you should be the second male lead

90
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,300

more than a third male lead?

Of course.

Despite my skill level, I still
team up with her every day.

setting yourself on fire?

This is the local specialty
that I brought for you.

118
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,020
A box of lemons.

119
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,420
Thank you.

120
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,480
Did you have fun?

121
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,260
Don't remind me. Just thinking about it
makes me depressed.

122
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,760
If I knew I could see Herman,

123
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,420
I wouldn't have taken a vacation
even if I was tired to death.

124
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,480
It's nothing. We only did a live broadcast

125
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,520
and had a meal together.

126
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,240
I'll introduce him to you
if there's a chance.

127

129
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,860
So so, I guess.

130
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Good.

131
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,160
Now I'm not so depressed.

132
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,820
I'll just let him live in
my imagination forever.

133
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,860
He looks like Liu Mao Yan.

134
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,020
That's not handsome to you?

135
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,600
And you actually can keep up with him

136
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,260
and it worked out so well.

137
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,140
I'm so envious.

138
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,260

Go on.

152
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,380
Defend him, defend him. Grab the ball.

They can't make it without me.

154
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,920
You're very good.

155
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,380
Why don't you join the game?

156
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,500
What are you doing?

157
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,360
Just dance a few more times.

158
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,220
I'm still not familiar with it.

Don't take too long.

Bye-bye.

Is your hand feeling better?

163
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,260
It's still pretty bad.

164
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,410
I can't move it.

165
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,720
When will your hand recover?

166
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,640
When can we

167
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,099
go on a mission again?

168
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,540
No rush.

169
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,920
Even though we can't go on missions,

170
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,819
we can still listen to music,

171
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,079
go to art exhibitions,

172
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,620
and enjoy the finer things in life.

173
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,180
That will do too.

174
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,080

Didn't you say you couldn't
move your hand?

177
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,200
My hand hurts.

178
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,840
Feels like it's getting worse.

179
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,560
It's your hand that's injured,
not your leg.

180
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,180
What are you squatting for?

181
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,980
Every part of the body is connected.

182
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,860
I almost gave myself away.

183
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,300
That rascal must have done it on purpose.

184
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,020
Then again, this charade is getting stale.

185
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,900
What else should I come up with?

186
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,880
Why is the water so cold today?

187
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,100
I'm freezing.

188
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,580
Why is the water ice cold?

189
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,260
Be glad you're still alive.

190
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,560
[What are you doing?]

191
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,880
I'm watching a video.

192
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,380
Liu Mao Yan is quite handsome.

193
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,100
Why?

194
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,470
[Supreme Master]

195
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,040
Hello.

196
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,140
[Are you upset?]

197
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,640
You replied to me so late

198
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,960
and praised others for being handsome.

199
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,420
How can I not be upset?

200
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,780
[My junior is such a jealous person.]

201
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,120
Then what do you want?

202
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,380
A crawfish meal will do nicely.

203
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,360
Isn't it supposed to be your treat?

204
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,500
You still remember?

205
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,240
[Yes, of course.]

206
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,260
All right, it's my treat.

207
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,460
[How about tomorrow? ]

208
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,480
Tomorrow?

209
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,360
[Can't make it?]

210
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,940
How about today?

211
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,900
Today?

212
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,960
Right, I'm downstairs at your house.

213
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,260
Downstairs at my house?

214
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,140
He's downstairs at my house.

215
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,660
[I'm just kidding.]

216
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,220
You're just kidding me?

217
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,100
About today, tomorrow or being downstairs?

218
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,700
See you tomorrow.

219
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,140
See you tomorrow.

220
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,080
Here you go!

221
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,280
Good, put it here.

222
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,220
-Have some dumplings.
-And dumplings too?

223
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,600
Great!

224
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,880
What a spread.

225
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,760
Here, taste it.

226
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,760
Okay.

227
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,720
-I'll put this here.
-Quite nice.

228
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,460
-Not bad. Good flavour.
-Come and eat with us.

229
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,340
Bao Bei hasn't eaten yet.

230
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,040
Jing,

231
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,840
-did you buy all this?
-Yes. Just now.

232
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,640
-Here, have a tea egg.
-Thanks.

233
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,940
Your grandpa knows that I like tea eggs.

234
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,600
He's better than you at cutting fruit.

235
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,600
Right, it looks decent.

236
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,900
I learned it from Grandma.

237
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,500
He's becoming so caring.

238
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,460
Good improvement.

239
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,100
I'll enjoy the blessing of
my grandson from now on.

240
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,340
Chef Lu!

241
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,900
It's really good.

242
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,820
[I just remembered that]

243
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,660
[it's winter now.
There's no more crayfish.]

244
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,900
[I knew that.]

245
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,460
But I want to see you.

246
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,540
[The first snow is the perfect time
to take a walk with a lover.]

247
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,240
[They say you meet the guy of your dreams
during the first snow.]

248
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,540
[So where are you?]

249
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,140
[The first snow is here. It's the season
for confessions.]

250
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,420
A woman's idea of romance
is so ridiculous.

251
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,380
What can be better than
having hot pot on a snowy day?

252
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,920
[Having hot pot on a snowy day]

253
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
[is the least one can do
to honour winter time.]

254
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,400
[I'm having a hot pot party
at my house today.]

255
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,040
[No one is allowed to be absent.]

256
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,140
[Reply if you received this message.]

257
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,120
Shan Shan.

258
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,000
Shan Shan,

259
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,100
the snowman is here.

260
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,340
Where is it?

261
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,420
It's all melted.

262
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,580
I'll make another one for you.

263
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,360
You're serious?

264
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,620
I'll be right back.

265
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,180
Shan Shan, the snowman is here again.

266
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,620
Are you a fool?

267
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,220
You actually took me seriously
and made another one?

268
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,640
Are you cold?

269
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,520
No.

270
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,880
Not cold?

271
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,620
My foot.

272
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,180
Your ears are frozen red.

273
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,320
[Having hot pot on a snowy day]

274
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
[is the least one can do

275
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,920

276
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,480

[Reply if you received this message.]

283
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
Senior.

284
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,400
Here.

285
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,840
It's additive free.

286
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,780
Drink more. It'll replenish
your nutrients.

287
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,460
Thank you.

288
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,400
Let's go.

289
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,580
Do you know how to put on ice skates?

290
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,780
I'll help you later

291
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,180
so you won't get your hands hurt.

292
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,540
I've put them on.

293
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,880
All done.

294
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,060
Be careful.

295
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,380
You should sit down.

296
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,100
Can you skate?

297
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,700
I can't.

298
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,500
The why do you come here?

299
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,040
Today is a working day.

300
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,420
There are less people on the rink.

301
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,940
You can be more relaxed.

302
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,120
Besides, it doesn't matter
if I know how to skate or not.

303
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,500
What matters is you do.

304
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,940
What if I don't know either?

305
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,740
Then,

306
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,220
let's stumble together.

307
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,780
Why don't I give you
a demonstration first?

308
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,420
Slightly bend your knee
and lean forward.

309
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,540
And slide your left foot out,
followed by the right.

310
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,020
Watch me.

311
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,920
Come over. I'll catch you.

312
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,820
Don't be afraid.

313
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,340
Senior, catch me!

314
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,180
Be careful!

315
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,540
Do you want to skate together?

316
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,260
I don't dare to.

317
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,260
Then let me show you once more.

318
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,380
Come over.

319
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,500
Senior,

320
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,260
you have to catch me then.

321
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,940
You lied to me. You obviously can skate.

322
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,740
It's not funny.

323
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,040
[Okay. Congratulations to Madam Ma]

324
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,070
[on winning the title]

325
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,590
[of Snarky King of our
first Silver Tongue Cup.]

326
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,110
[Next, let's give a big
round of applause to]

327
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,940
[Madam Ma!]

328
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,860
Why don't we eat first?

329
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,330
I think we should use clear soup.

330
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,239
Can you show

331
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,330
some respect to the hot pot?

332
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
Didn't you invite Liang Chen over?

333
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,630
She doesn't eat spicy food.

334
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,150
Orange hasn't even replied
to me on WeChat.

335
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,900
I'm not sure if she will come.

336
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,250
Fine, clear soup.

337
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,540
Then there are the others.

338
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,020
All of them stood me up.

339
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,730
Typical case of romance over friendship.

340
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,320
It's only a snow day.

341
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,760
What's with all the display of affection?

342
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,860
One might think it is snowing rose petals.

343
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,280
Can't they be more considerate

344
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,220
of us single guys?

345
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,780
All right, three.

346
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,820
We're having hot pot.

347
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,220
What about him?

348
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,400
He'll have dog food.

349
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,860
[A beautiful, slim, and generous me.]

350
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,420
[I should also thank my father.]

351
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,700
[Without my father,]

352
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,880
my mother alone

353
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,880
as you know,

354
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,420
could not have birthed me.

355
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,860
I learned

356
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,580
pretty quickly, didn't I?

357
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,700
Very quick. Awesome.

358
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,620
It's because of you.
You're a good teacher.

359
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,560
I think you're trying to make up
for your terrible acting

360
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,060
with sweet talk.

361
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,080
Is it sweet?

362
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,660
Senior, are you upset?

363
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,580
Enjoy yourself.

364
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,380
I want to play with you.

365
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,540
Didn't you have enough fun toying with me?

366
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,900
You can toy with me too.

367
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,900
Come on.

368
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,180
Come on. I'll show you
something really fun.

369
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,560
Senior,

370
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,420
are you free tomorrow?

371
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,340
I have work tomorrow.

372
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,480
How about the day after tomorrow?

373
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,280
Work.

374
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,740
Why?

375
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,100
I'm wondering

376
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,100
how long will it be until we meet again?

377
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,060
Aren't we together right now?

378
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,720
But I'm already thinking

379
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,220
about when we'll meet next.

380
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,080
I think they're here.

381
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,140
I'll open the door.

382
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,100
Stop waiting.

383
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,420
They are not coming.

384
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,980
Eat something.

385
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,860
Just eat.

386
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,480
Here.

387
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,980
Forget it. I'm not eating either.

388
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,940
It's fine.

389
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,200
Ding,

390
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,020
I have nothing to do later anyway.

391
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,580
I'll do the dishes with you.

392
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,520
Here we are.

393
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,800
Liang Chen.

394
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,980
Where are your manners?

395
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,180
Liang Chen.

396
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,520
Call me senior.

397
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Liang Chen.

398
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,620
Call me senior.

399
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,620
Chen Chen.

400
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,060
Then just call me Liang Chen.
