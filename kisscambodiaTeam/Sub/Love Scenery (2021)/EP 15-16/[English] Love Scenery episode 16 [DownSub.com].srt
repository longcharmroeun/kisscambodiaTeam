We're here.

Liang Chen.

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,960
Where are your manners?

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,080
Liang Chen.

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,400
It's 'senior'.

9
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,360
Liang Chen.

10
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,520
It's 'senior'.

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,520
Chen Chen.

12
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,890
Just call me Liang Chen.

13
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,680
Liang Chen.

14
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,980
Yeah?

15
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,420
Nothing.

16
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,880
I just wanted to call you.

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,000
Have you caught a cold?

18
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,520
It's nothing.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
No. At this rate,

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
you'll get sick.

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,520
Let's get you checked
at the hospital, come on.

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,030
That's not necessary.

23
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,440
It's crowded in the hospital.

24
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,540
You're even shy to be treated?

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm worried that you'd be recognised.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,320
Grandpa and Grandma are out.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,520
Just take a seat.

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,800
Do I need to change into slip-ons?

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,200
Nah, you're good.

30
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,360
Here, have some hot water.

31
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,180
Thank you.

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,320
Do you have any medicine at home?

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,520
I'll get you some.

34
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,230
There isn't any.

35
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,079
Perhaps, some ginger tea
would do me good.

36
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,060
Is there ginger?
I'll make you some ginger tea.

37
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
Coming!

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
Well, aren't you late?

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,480
Here to drink dish detergent water?

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,160
Shut up.

41
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,960
Do you have any ginger?

42
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,160
Why do you need ginger?

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,960
You...

44
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,200
You have a dog now?

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
It belongs to the little brother
who's my immediate neighbour.

46
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,080
Liang Chen?

47
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,760
Oh, Jia Yun?

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,880
Didn't you receive my message on WeChat?

49
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,279
Let me order you some food.

50
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,430
It's okay. I came to get some ginger

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,200
to make ginger tea.

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,400
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,320
No.

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,760
It's a...

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,200
A friend of mine isn't feeling well.

56
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,440
Sure.

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,200
Gosh, could things get
more awkward than this?

58
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
Come on, let's go.

59
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,659
Off we go!

60

Let's go home.

Come on, let's go.

62
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
Let me do it.

63
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,590
It's okay. I can manage.

64
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,240
Let me do it.

65
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
I won't want you to cut your finger.

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
Thank you, Jia Yun.

67
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Are you seeing that guy?

68
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,800
No.

69
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,520
He's just my junior.

70
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,760
Liang Chen made this?

71
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
I made this.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Aren't you unwell?

73
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,240
Drink up.

74
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
Although you're rude,

75
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,790
thanks, anyway.

76
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,960
I'd thank you for

77
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
not troubling Liang Chen.

78
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,960
You won't get the chance to thank me.

79
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,280
I made a bottle of it.

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
This should last you the night.

81
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Be careful.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,880
He'd be just fine after
drinking the ginger tea.

83
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,080
Let's go.

84
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,360
Why am I dizzy suddenly?

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
Are you okay?

86
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
I'm fine, senior.

87
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,760
Just be about your business.

88
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,240
Are you sure?

89
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
Rest well, then.

90
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,360
Let's go.

91
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Gosh, you're coughing.

92
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,920
Jia Yun, you go ahead.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,240
I'll stay to care for him.

94
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Okay.

95
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,480
I'll go then.

96
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,810
Pass that to me. I'll hold it.

97
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,000
Has it turned cold?
Here, add some more.

it's almost noon and you're still asleep?

113
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,240
We have a recording in the afternoon.

114
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,940
Get up already!

115
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,100
You hugged a scarf to sleep?

116
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,520
Quit being nosy.

117
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,520
What's with your voice?

118
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,000
I think my voice isn't warmed up yet.

119
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720

-Happy birthday.

to wish me sincerely?

[Alright. Please be quick.]

140
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,640
Bye-bye.

141
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,360
It's you.

142
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,720
Sorry.

143
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,400
It's okay, senior.

144
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,560
You come here too?

145
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,680
I ordered takeaway for my roommate.

146
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,060
Enjoy your meal, senior.

147
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm off.

148
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,880
Was she informed that Lu Jing's here,

149
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
and made a trip here on purpose?

150
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,080
Lu Jing,

151
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,520
you went out at the wrong timing.

152
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,680
You went out,

153
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,280
and Qi Qi came.

154
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,280
You missed each other.

155
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,060
I bumped into her at the door.

156
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,120
And?

157
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Nothing.

158
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,110
What?

159
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,640
Qi Qi is such a decent girl.

160
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
She's ready for you, but you reject it.

161
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,320
Instead, you're into online dating.

162
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,760
How do you know if it's a guy or girl

163
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,400
on the other side?

164
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,040
That's why you're still single.

165
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,960
Hey, what do you mean?

166
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,720
What made you think you can
openly embarrass me like that?

167
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,640
Quit quarrelling.

168
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,840
Did you guys know

169
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,300
Gu Fei Ming and Qi Qi are
growing closer recently?

170
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,720
Isn't he the one who's

171
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,680
cosying up to Qi Qi?

172
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm serious.

173
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,040
Gu Fei Ming's been ill
for the past few days.

174
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,680
Qi Qi's been taking care
of him in the hospital.

175
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
Ill?

176
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,400
How?

177
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,120
Why would Qi Qi take care of him?

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,240
This is why you guys are still single.

179
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Lu Jing,

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,440
you better explain yourself!

181
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,360
What made you think we
deserve to be single?

182
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
Calm down already.
Sit down.

183
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,080
Listen to me.

184
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
That chubby guy

185
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
told me,

186
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,600
Gu Fei Ming took a cold bath

187
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,000
in the bedroom to catch a cold.

188
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,200
Gu Fei Ming is a real man.

189
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,720
Admirable.

190
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,040
Boy,

191
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,880
your girlfriend is here to see you again.

192
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,280
Thermometer, please.

193
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,680
Your fever's gone.

194
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
You can check-out today.

195
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,560
But, nurse,

196
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,600
I still feel very weak.

197
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,560
Boy,

198
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,600
how could you be weak
with such a strong grip?

199
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,400
Eat up.

200
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
It's mixed rice for today?

201
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,080
I've been having rice with
topped dishes for the past few days.

202
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,520
You got me mixed rice today.

203
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,280
Yummy.

204
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,520
You're allowed to
check-out of the hospital today.

205
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,480
Does that mean that we can
play the game together?

206
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,720
[Lu Jing,]

207
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,080
[I hate you.]

208
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,520
Is your throat okay?

209
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,950
It's a little dry.

210
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,390
It's okay.

211
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,190
What a coincidence.

212
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,540
[Why is he here?]

213
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,310
[Could it be he's here just for me?]

214
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,960
[Junior, oh junior.]

215
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,520
[You're a clingy one.]

216
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,440
Senior.

217
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,280
How did you know I'm here?

218
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,430
Senior, don't you know already?

219
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,320
I'm

220
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,720
waiting for you.

221
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,480
Quit joking!

222
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
Ms Liang Chen,

223
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,120
here for a work meeting?

224
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,200
Lu Jing,

225
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
you're finally here.

226
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,000
That programme is driving me up the wall.

227
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,560
Well, I'm here
to solve your problem.

228
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,200
Senior,

229
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,800
bye.

230
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,760
Ms Liang Chen,

231
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,000
this way, please.

232
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,240
Let's go.

233
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,680
Ms Liang Chen, please give me a minute

234
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,920
while I prepare the info.

235
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,360
Ms Liang,

236
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,880
did you think

237
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,600
that junior came intentionally for you?

238
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,120
Did I say that?

239
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,840
Well, it felt like that.

240
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,320
Then, why were you playing with your hair

241
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
and blushing?

242
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,480
Well, you heard it.

243
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,880
He came to tend to the programme

244
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,040
instead of you.

245
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
I know.

246
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,130
You look like you have plenty of time.

247
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,010
Get me coffee.

248
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Okay.

249
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,000
Gosh, what have I done?

250
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,560
I blushed

251
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,360
and played with my hair.

252
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,920
He must think that I'm crazy.

253
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,160
My gosh.

254
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,000
What have I done?
This is embarrassing!

255
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,490
We'll talk later.

256
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,280
Jia Yun.

257
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,120
I apologise.

258
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,120
You must have waited for long.

259
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,520
It's okay. I just arrived.

260
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,840
It was bumper-to-bumper.

261
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,000
Time's ticking.

262
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Let's get down to
discussing the play script.

263
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,240
Okay.

264
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,880
Where are you taking me?

265
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,120
I'm looking for an empty meeting room.

266
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,690
Here.

267
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,440
This meeting room is yours.

268
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,680
I have things to attend to.
I'm off.

269
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,960
-Okay.
-I'll be back later.

270
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,880
The first segment looks okay.

271
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,880
We'll speak more on the
details on the actual stage.

272
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,320
But, it's this segment that

273
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,560
the presenter plays a crucial role.

274
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
The interaction with the audience could be

275
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,640
a little more interesting
at the live stage.

276
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,600
What do you think?

277
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,540
Sure.

278
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,240
[Senior, why are you looking at me]

279
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
[instead of the script?]

280
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Okay.

281
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
Let's move on to the second segment.

282
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,440
Remove these two questions
for the Q&A segment.

283
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,160
They are not related to the theme.

284
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,480
I suggest adding some

285
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,600
question that are work-related.

286
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,200
Such as, questions related to our movie,

287
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,840
mentioning the original intentions
of filming this movie.

288
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,520
What do you think?

289
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,920
[Looks like I'm more interesting to
look at compared to the script.]

290
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,850
You okay?

291
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,660
Yeah.
I just find that question exceptional.

292
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,240
Okay.

293
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,880
For the scenes,

294
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,720
we should discuss

295
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,880
if we should use

296
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,200
themes that promote
traditional Chinese culture.

297
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
Liang Chen,

298
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,120
what do you think?

299
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

300
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,760
You've been coughing.

301
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,240
Are you unwell?

302
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,150
Why don't we record the mock-up tomorrow?

303
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,160
It's okay.

304
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,080
It should be fine.

305
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,840
Liang Chen's voice sounds so good.

306
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,280
It's alright.

307
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,240
She sounds a little tired.

308
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,840
Are you okay?

309
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,230
Why don't you rest?

310
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm fine.

311
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,440
Let's continue.

312
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,320
Okay.

313
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,400
Liang Chen, are you alright?

314
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,200
Something is wrong with my throat.

315
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,840
Why don't you see the doctor?

316
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,520
I think you should.

317
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,840
Leave this to me.

318
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,480
I'll give Liu Yi Qing a call.

319
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,370

Hello. What happened?

323
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,040
I must be too tired.

324
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
My voice is affected.

325
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,480
Have you gone to the hospital?

326

Don't worry.

330
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,010
It's nothing serious.

will be out soon.

00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,030
[I'm worried sick.]

381
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,750
I rang the doctor.

382
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,280
You need to take the surgery.

383
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,080
You're a singer.

384
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,760
You'd be using your voice regularly.

385
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,840
So, there is a higher risk
for the polyp to turn

386
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,320
cancerous compared to non-singers.

387
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,170
We can't risk it.

388
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,680
My voice might not

389
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,320
sound the same after surgery.

390
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,880
That's not certain.

391
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,560
Don't scare yourself.

392
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,350
Liang Chen, even if
your voice has changed,

393
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,960
that doesn't mean
you can't continue singing.

394
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,760
The voices of some seniors have changed.

395
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,040
But, they have 32 concerts in a year.

396
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,000
Those are rare examples.

397
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,040
Well, don't entertain negative thoughts.

398
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,320
Just

399
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,160
rest well.

400
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,080
Call me, if anything.

401
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,600
See you.

402
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,360
[Would vocal cord polyps removal surgery
change one's voice?]

403
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,840
[Vocal cord polyps removal surgery itself]

404
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,680
[damages the vocal cord.]

405
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,120
[Your voice would most likely
not be the same after surgery.]

406
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,560
[The disadvantages to traditional
vocal cord polyps surgery are huge.]

407
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,680
[So, it requires careful consideration.]

408
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,449
It's no big deal.

409
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,199
At worst, I won't be able to sing.

410
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,429
I can still write songs.

411
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,280
I'm talented.

412
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,600
I can dance too.

413
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,320
I can be a dancer.

414
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Hello.

415
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,520
[Hello, miss.]

416
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,920
[We're pleased to inform you]

417
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,680
[that you've won first prize
with our company.]

418
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,080
[It's a cash prize RMB300,000.]

419
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,720
[Kindly provide]

420
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,520
[your ID and bank card number.]

421
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,480
Hey, miss.

422
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,360
You have such a sweet voice.

423
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,400
There are so many jobs.
Why must you scam people?

424
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,240
My throat doesn't hurt anymore.

425
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,400
It's no longer husky.

426
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,470
Have I recovered?

427
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,390
[Hello, Ms Liang.]

428
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,080
[This is a gentle reminder from
Hospital Sheng Ming An]

429
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,840
[to make an appointment for
your surgery in advance.]

430
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,720
[Hope everything's well with you.]

431
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,040
[Get well soon.]

432
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,420
[Granny of Recognition]
[Liang Chen]

433
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,440
Hello, Mum.

434
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,280
Would you and Dad

435
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,800
come to see my farewell concert?

436
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,680
Stop shouting. Be gentler.

437
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,560
Okay.

438
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,550
What was that, Darling?

439
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,680
[I missed it.]

440
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,600
Oh, would you and Dad

441
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,520
come to my farewell concert?

442
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,040
[Can you stop shouting?]

443
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,600
[I'm on the phone with our daughter.]

444
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,520
Hello.

445
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,360
Your dad and I are having

446
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,040
Thai massage.

447
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,200
[It's really professional, you know?]

448
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,880
You should come when you're free.

449
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,280
Shut up!

450
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,560
Your were saying?

451
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,120
Nothing. Have fun.

452
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,360
[Sun Bin Yu]

453
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,600
Hey, Taro.

454
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,350
Would you come

455
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,920
to my farewell concert?

456
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,760
Well, people may not

457
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,440
be able to listen to
my beautiful voice again.

458
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,240
[Have the aliens invaded the earth]

459
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,680
[and abducted you?]

460
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,200
No.

461
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,120
Would you come?

462
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,500
[No.]

463
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,600
[I'm tired.]

464
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,640
Okay.

465
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,160
Hello.

466
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,080
Wow, you answered so quickly.

467
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,960
I've been waiting for your update.

468
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,040
Would you come to my concert?

469
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,440
Sure.

470
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,350
[Don't you want to know why?]

471
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,360
Be on your way, then.

472
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,860
Okay.

473
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,160
Have you left home yet?

474
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,320
Yes.
