[Episode 11]

4
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,039
My stomach is aching.

5
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,479
Why are you having a
stomach ache all of sudden?

6
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Are you okay?

7
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,640
I have to go to the hospital.
Take it from here, buddy.

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,640
Gu Fei Ming! Gu Fei Ming! You...

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,160
Mr Luo, may I take his place?

10
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,320
Hurry up and get ready then, you guys.

11
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,200
We're going up there in a minute.

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,720
You'll give her the flower on stage

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,960
while I'll give her the
souvenir, is that okay?

14
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,960
What the hell is this?

15
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
About that...

16
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,550
Maybe they didn't know Liang Chen

17
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,720
would come today.

18
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
Just pretend it's a bouquet

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,000
of fiery red roses.

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,520
The volume sounds fine on my end.

21
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,960
Liang Chen, that was a great performance.

22
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Thank you.

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
You are?

24
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,280
I'm...

25
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,480
Kid, what are you doing?

26
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,240
Give her the doll!

27
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,280
What is this?

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,480
This is actually a bouquet of roses.

29
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,640
The roses are not ready yet.

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,520
We're using this doll for now.

31
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,400
[His voice.]

32
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,640
[It can't be.]

33
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,120
Liang Chen.

34
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
Lu Jing, it's time for
us to leave the stage.

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Come on.

36
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,320
I thought all celebrities
put on airs and act aloof.

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,560
I didn't expect Liang Chen
to be so friendly.

38
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,760
Lu Jing, are you okay?

39
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
Why are you blushing?

40
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,920
It's too warm in here.

41
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,159
Warm? How?

42
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,720
Lu Jing, where are you going?

43
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,520
It's still a little cold
in this gymnasium.

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,680
And you're wearing so little.

45
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,280
Drink some warm water.

46
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Ms Liang,

47
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,000
what are you thinking about?

48
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Nothing.

49
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,960
The boy who gave you flowers
just now is so handsome.

50
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,360
He looks a bit like Liu Mao Yan.

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
That's right.

52
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you remember we saw him
on a plane once before?

53
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,760
You actually remember that?

54
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,560
Don't tell me you have a crush on him.

55
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,440
A crush?

56
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,440
What are you talking about?
I don't have a crush on him.

57
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,720
Look at your lousy acting skills.

58
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,840
You are feeling guilty, aren't you?

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,440
Let me tell you, he's just a student.

60
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,240
Have a heart.

61
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,320
What's wrong with dating a student?

62
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Students are

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
pure in thought,

64
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,760
passionate,

65
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,160
and full of vigour.

66
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,960
And most of all,

67
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,120
they are nice and obedient.

68
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,640
I'm speechless.

69
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
He was just giving you flowers,

70
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,400
and you're already imagining things.

71
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,960
How come you don't look so inspired

72
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,560
when you're composing songs?

73
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,760
But honestly,

74
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,720
there are benefits to
dating a younger guy too.

75
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,280
Don't underestimate younger guys.

76
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,240
They will take care of you forever.

77
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,159
Knock it off.

78
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,240
I'm going to check on the rehearsal.

79
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,000
Look at you being shy.

80
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,720
[Calm down. Maybe he didn't hear us.]

81
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
[Don't panic.]

82
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,440
[Ms Liang, wait up!]

83
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,000
Liu Mao Yan!

84
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,000
Ke Ke, we'd better go now.

85
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,360
We have a lot of work to do today.

86
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,320
Lu Jing,

87
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,880
Mr Luo asked for you.

88
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,880
I got it.

89
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,880
Okay.

90
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Lu...

91
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Liang Chen,

92
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,870
are you okay?

93
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,480
[Oh my god, this is so embarrassing.]

94
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,640
Ms Liang, are you okay?

95
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,080
Are you okay? That must be painful.

96
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm fine, I'm fine.

97
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm perfectly fine.

98
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,760
The floor is too slippery.

99
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,000
We should report this to
the university right away.

100
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,480
We can't have this.

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,040
We can't have the junior students
slip and fall down too.

102
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,520
After all, they are the
future of our country.

103
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Liang Chen,

104
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
do you feel any pain?

105
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
No.

106
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
Not at all. See?

107
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,920
I can still move my legs.

108
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,520
I can still turn around.

109
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,800
Ms Liang!

110
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,800
Liu, open the car door!

111
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,720
I haven't gotten into the car yet!

112
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Ms Liang!

113
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,520
[Students are]

114
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,080
[pure in thought,]

115
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,720
[passionate,]

116
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,000
[and full of vigour.]

117
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,440
[And most of all,]

118
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,200
[they are nice and obedient.]

119
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,400
You're going to perform tomorrow.

120
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,120
You should get some rest tonight.

121
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,680
Can I choose not to attend
the homecoming now?

122
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,880
What do you think?

123
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
It's frustrating.

124
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,480
You have to face it
even though it's frustrating.

125
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,280
Giving flowers only takes a few seconds.

126
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
It'll be over in the blink of an eye.

127
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,480
That's easy for you to say.

128
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
What about my pride?

129
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,080
You are going to be strangers again

130
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,000
when it's over tomorrow, anyway.

131
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,320
You won't see each other again.

132
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,760
What else could happen?

133
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
I...

134
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
You won't understand.

135
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Forget it.

136
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,600
Forget it, forget it.

137
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
[Thank you.]

138
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,040
He's so good looking.

139
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
What are you doing?

140
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Nothing.

141
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,760
You're here.

142
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,920
[How can you stoop so low?]

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,560
[What should I do tonight?]

144
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,120
[We can work this out.]

145
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,560
[No.]

146
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,200
[Nothing you say today can make me agree.]

147
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,400
[You're avoiding Qi Qi]

148
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,160
[because you don't want her to find out]

149
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,880
[your real gaming ability, aren't you?]

150
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,360
[It's none of your business.]

151
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,160
[Do you know I'm the number one
player on the local server?]

152
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,720
[You're bragging now?]

153
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,280
[Yes, you're a great player.]

154
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,520
[So what?]

155
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,800
[I know, it's nothing.]

156
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
[I was going to offer playing
on your behalf.]

157
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,400
[But since you're so reluctant,]

158
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
[forget it.]

159
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,400
[What?]

160
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,880
[Are you saying you will play in my stead]

161
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
[using my ID?]

162
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
[Lu Jing.]

163
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,480
[Mr Lu.]

164
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,400
[Please, help me.]

165
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,040
[Well...]

166
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
[What about giving flowers on stage?]

167
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
[You may do it.]

168
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
[You may do it.]

169
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,240
You have to do your best later.

170
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,720
Don't embarrass me.

171
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,240
The stronger you seem, the better.

172
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,160
It'd be best if you can
help me win Qi Qi's admiration.

173
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,400
Are you sure?

174
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,640
I have given you the
opportunity to give flowers.

175
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,240
You must do your best.

176
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
Don't mess with me.

177
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
Sure, I promise I'll do my best.

178
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,360
Hurry up, Qi Qi is online now.

179
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,560
Gu Fei Ming, you're so awesome.

180
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,960
It's nothing.

181
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,200
Two more down.

182
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,120
You're such a good shot.

183
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,040
No, no.

184
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,360
You hit the target every
time without missing.

185
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,880
Why didn't you tell me you
were so awesome?

186
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,280
Oh my god, Gu Fei Ming,

187
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,160

190
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,640

you need to tone it down.

191

I seemed, the better?

192

You're dwelling on what happened today?

242
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,920

Yes, why?

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,400
Someone teased me today,

246
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,920
saying that I looked like him.

247

Go away.

255
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,800
Saying you looked like
Liu Mao Yan was a tease?

256
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,760
Of course there was more than that.

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,040

370
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,760
hair stylists you can find.

371
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
For real.

372
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,320
So handsome.

373
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,920
You're indeed the Takeshi Kaneshiro
of Nanze University.

374
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,480
The hairstyle I chose is perfect for Jing.

375
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,520
Are you guys done?

376
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Lu Jing,

377
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,560
are you going to get married

378
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,160
or give flowers?

379
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,800
I think Liang Chen will definitely
fall in love with him at first sight.

380
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
They will fall into the river of love,

381
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
never to escape.

382
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,000
They will have a beautiful love story.

383
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,160
Nonsense.

384
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,440
Love takes time.

385
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,960
I told you we should be sensible fans.

386
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,280
There must be no mistakes
with the script and process.

387
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,600
-Got it.
-Got it, sir.

388
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Good.

389
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,880
Ms Liang, what are you doing out here?

390
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,480
Liang Chen! Liang Chen!

391
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,720
Stop looking, Ms Liang.

392
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,720
I've asked around.

393
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,720
That boy hasn't come yet.

394
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,920
Wait, who told you to ask?

395
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,920
Aren't you dying to see that boy?

396
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,680
I...

397
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,160
Liang Chen, I love you!

398
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Alright, Ms Liang.

399
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,800
Let's go back to your dressing room
and touch up that face.

400
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,200
You still have to go out there and
take pictures with students later.

401
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,880
Give me some advice.

402
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,320
Which one looks better?

403
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,000
Wear the red one. It's joyous.

404
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,360
I think the white one is better.

405
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,680
White looks clean.

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Zhou Zhou, which one is better?

407
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,440
If you ask me,

408
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,000
stop worrying about this.

409
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,120
Liang Chen has seen many
handsome men.

410
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,960
You think you can get her attention

411
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,760
just by dressing yourself up?

412
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,320
Naive.

413
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,160
Something could happen
between you and Liang Chen.

414
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,480
You can do it, feisty boy.

415
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,600
[Which one looks better?]

416
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
[Why?]

417
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,800
[I have to attend an
important event today.]

418
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,679
[I need your advice
on which one looks better.]

419
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,679
[How would I know which
one looks better on you?]

420
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,600
[I look the best when I wear nothing.]

421
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,320
Wear nothing then!

422
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,040
[Go with the white sweater.]

423
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Bye.

424
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,680
He smells so nice.

425
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,720
It's just giving flowers.

426
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,000
Is that necessary?

427
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,600
Thank you, Liang Chen.

428
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
Next.

429
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Three, two, one.

430
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,600
-Thank you, Liang Chen.
-Thank you.

431
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Next.

432
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,960
Are you here to take a picture with me?

433
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,520
Please take a picture
of me and Liang Chen.

434
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Thank you.

435
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,800
Three, two, one.

436
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Thank you.

437
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,760
Thank you, Liang Chen.

438
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Next.

439
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,520
Liang Chen, I really like you.

440
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,640
Me too.

441
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,720
Three, two, one.

442
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,200
Thank you, Liang Chen.

443
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Next.

444
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,400
Thank you, Liang Chen.

445
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
Thank you.

446
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Thank you.

447
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
[Does it look like you?]

448
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,200
Liang Chen, are you okay?

449
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
[What?]

450
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,560
[I mean the box doll in the photo.]

451
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,840
[Does it look like you?]

452
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,560
The hell it looks like me!

453
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,840
Dear guests,

454
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,280
dear leaders of the university,

455
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,680
dear students and alumni,

456
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,160
good evening!

457
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,240
Lu Jing,

458
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,400
what are you holding in your hand?

459
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,080
A toy.

460
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Are you going to give it to Liang Chen?

461
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,080
[What? It's for me?]

462
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,200
It's just for the photo.

463
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
This box doll

464
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
looks a lot like someone I know.

465
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,080
Lu Jing,

466
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,960
you're wearing so little. Aren't you cold?

467
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
No.

468
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,680
After all,

469
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm full of vigour.

470
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
Ms Liang, we should go and get ready.
