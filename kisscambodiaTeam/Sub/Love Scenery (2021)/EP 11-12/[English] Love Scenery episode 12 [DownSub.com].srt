[70th anniversary of Nanze University]

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
What are you holding
in your hands, Lu Jing?

6
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,400
It's a toy.

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,759
Is it for Liang Chen?

8
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,360
[What? For me?]

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,560
I wish to take a photo with her
while holding this.

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,040
The box

11
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
looks a lot like someone I know.

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,080
Lu Jing, you're not wearing enough.
Don't you feel cold?

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,320
No.

14
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,800
After all,

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,160
I'm healthy and strong.

16
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,280
Joy dances in the song of youth.

17
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,160
This beautiful voice once filled

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
the halls of Nanze University.

19
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
It's been six years.

20
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
That beautiful voice

21
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,920
has once again come back to us.

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,000
Coming next, please welcome Liang Chen
performing her song,

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,079
"When I was 18".

24
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Ms Liang.

25
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,840
That was a great performance.

26
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,880
This is for you.

27
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,840
Thanks.

28
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
Ms Liang, here you go.

29
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,000
Thanks.

30
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,400
Your...Your hands are hot.

31
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,160
That's because

32
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,640
my blood is boiling with passion.

33
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Such beautiful origami flowers.

34
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,040
I wonder who that thoughtful person is.

35
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,720
Maybe someone who knows
you're allergic to pollen.

36
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
How was my performance?

37
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,680
Incredible.

38
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,200
The audience wouldn't stop clapping.

39
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,640
And you looked really cute

40
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,840
in that dress.

41
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,850
I'm glad.

42
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480
But why did you drop the bouquet

43
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
when it was presented to you?

44
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,090
I...I need to go to the restroom.

45
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,920
What's wrong?
You keep going to the restroom.

46
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,920
Ms Liang.

47
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,520
Ms Liang.

48
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,160
Yes?

49
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,360
The temperature drops dramatically
at night. Don't catch a cold.

50
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,000
Thank you.

51
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,360
I'll get going then.

52
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,120
Did you bring a scarf when you leave home?

53
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,480
Lu Jing, the song Liang Chen
sang just now was nice.

54
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Have you heard it before?

55
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,960
I have.

56
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,560
I regret I didn't find myself a boyfriend
when I was in the university.

57
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,280
Those two look good together.

58
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,710
Let's go.

59
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,160
Lu Jing.

60
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,520
Can you teach me

61
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,160
how to make the roses

62
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,840
you gave Liang Chen?

63
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,080
Lu Jing.

64
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,160
What were you saying?

65
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,120
I said,
can you teach me how to make the roses

66
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,360
you gave Liang Chen?

67
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Sure.

68
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,440
I'll send you the tutorial video.

69
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
Given how smart you are,
you'll understand immediately.

70
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,640
Lu Jing.

71
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,160
Stop the car.

72
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,280
What's wrong?

73
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
Shan Shan.

74
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,320
Why are you here alone?

75
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,920
What should we do, Ms Liang?

76
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,600
Take her home first.

77
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,160
Shan Shan, where do you live?

78
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,800
The Greenland Residential Area.

79
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,440
This is me.

80
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,440
Thanks.

81
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,750
No problem.

82
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,160
Liang Chen.

83
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,520
Are you joining or not?

84
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
The show is going to start soon.

85
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,800
Hurry up.

86
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Answer the call, Shan Shan.

87
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,440
Please welcome Liang Chen and Ma Shan Shan

88
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,600
with their song,
"The First Dance in Winter".

89
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,880
[Hi, the number you have dialled]

90
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
[is unreachable.]

91
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,360
[Please try again later.]

92
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,080
[Shan Shan.]

93
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,640
[Do our dreams]

94
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
[mean nothing to you?]

95
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,270
She looks totally different
on television.

96
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,170
Let's go.

97
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Which one of you secretly

98
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
asked for resources anonymously
on the university's forum?

99
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,840
I got you.

100
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,920
You didn't even hide your IP address.

101
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,720
What resources? Show me.

102
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,040
Well...

103
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,480
I was just helping someone out.

104
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,520
Baby Da Yan wants Liu Mao Yan's
memes and pictures?

105
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,510
That isn't me.

106
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Not me for sure.

107
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,240
Which lame guy shared this?

108
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,160
Jing.

109
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,800
Why did you ask for a man's picture?

110
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,300
I...

111
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,480
Can't I enjoy seeing a handsome man?

112
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,440
Look at me then.

113
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
Move.

114
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,800
Aren't I handsome?

115
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,560
Beautiful Soul charity stream
on Wednesday.

116
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,920
It's streaming next week?

117
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,840
But what have I been doing?

118
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,160
[Do you want a go tonight?]

119
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,560
[I still can't play.]

120
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,320
[Looks like you're severely wounded.]

121
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,320
[Let's play together again
after you've recovered.]

122
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,880
He's using his meme?

123
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,010
Could he have learnt who I am?

124
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,560
Whatever.

125
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,360
I need to save myself.

126
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,440
Yeah.

127
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Secondary account registration successful.

128
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,750
Playing alone is not that hard.

129
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,060
After learning from Lu Jing for so long,

130
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,200
I can do it if I try.

131
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,700
What a coincidence, Ding.

132
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,240
Don't you think so?

133
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,880
I actually ran into Zhu Guang
who is picking you up.

134
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,280
If you need it,

135
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,160
I can pick you up at the airport.

136
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,000
I'd feel bad about that.

137
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,560
You won't charge me, will you?

138
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,560
Sun,

139
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,680
I don't think there's anyone
who is capable of making you pay.

140
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,000
Hey, how could you be so honest?

141
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,080
It's not that I'm stingy.

142
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm just poor.

143
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,760
You're not stingy.

144
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,280
You helped me set off fireworks before.

145
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,920
He helped me set off fireworks before.

146
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Because of what you've just said,

147
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,200
I'll share with you two

148
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,000
the local specialities I brought home.

149
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,800
What a coincidence, Lu Jing.

150
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,600
-You're back.
-Just a while ago.

151
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,320
Do you miss me?

152
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,920
Let's hang out together
if you're free tonight.

153
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,240
I'm not free. I need to study.

154
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,500
What a poser, you little kid.

155
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,780
Bye.

156
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,960
Childish.

157
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Come.

158
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,640
Come. Have a seat.

159
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,560
Was that boy your friend?

160
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,200
He's my neighbour.

161
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,040
An expert in computer science.

162
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,840
By the way,

163
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,720
he is Liang Chen's coach

164
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,800
on Beautiful Soul.

165
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,640
But he'd be surprised to know
who his student is.

166
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,440
Jia Yun.

167
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,080
Don't you have a job today?

168
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,480
My job has been cancelled.

169
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm here to get the clothes
I left at your place.

170
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
You're playing Beautiful Soul
with someone?

171
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,120
Carry on.

172
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,160
Why are you spacing out?

173
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,960
Nothing.

174
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,280
Let me show you.

175
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,240
This is the treasure of my home town.

176
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,920
I had to exchange it
with my bewitching face.

177
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,960
I heard that it's a very nourishing

178
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,640
organic food.

179
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,630
Forget it. Save it for yourself.

180
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,280
How ignorant.

181
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,920
What does that boy do?

182
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,200
You mean Lu Jing?

183
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,040
He's a university student.

184
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,120
Why? Did he catch your attention?

185
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,760
The world sure is running on pretty faces.

186
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,700
He's a university student.

187
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,240
Is there a problem?

188
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,280
No.

189
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,680
He is back, right?

190
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,920
Let's have a welcome party for you.

191
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,080
What do you want to eat?

192
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Will you bring me whatever food I want?

193
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,640
Of course.

194
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,200
I want to eat the braised fish

195
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,920
and the beef stew with potatoes you make.

196
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,080
Okay.

197
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,240
Let's invite our friends.

198
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,200
Sure.

199
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,120
You, me, Orange, He,

200
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,160
and

201
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,120
Ma Shan Shan.

202
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,640
Okay. No problem.

203
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,080
I'll keep it.

204
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,440
Are you sure you don't want some?

205
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,880
Yes.

206
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,840
Looks like Lu Jing is offline.

207
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,320
My cleverness can't save
my uncoordinated hands.

208
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,600
What might he be doing?

209
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,920
He's good-looking, smart,

210
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,840
and his hands work perfectly.

211
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,000
Maybe

212
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,040
I should continue to team up with him.

213
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,050
It's for my job.

214
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,760
I'm too bad a player.

215
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,080
It's not because of him.

216
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,760
It's not that I want to
play the game with him.

217
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
I'm doing this for my job.

218
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,080
How dedicated I am.

219
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,360
He got mad because I didn't
go online for a few days?

220
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,960
That is impossible.

221
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,240
How can such a good-looking boy

222
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,120
get angry?

223
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,960
[Are you there, master?]

224
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,400
What is it? I was taking a bath.

225
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,720
[I need you to guide me.]

226
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,560
Is your hand fine now?

227
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,760
[Yes.]

228
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,920
Two minutes.

229
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,920
Robots.

230
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,200
Maybe you should get out first.
I'll collect the equipment.

231
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,960
Quiet.

232
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,080
How can you get distracted

233
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,360
when you're facing strong enemies?

234
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,480
There aren't any robots around.

235
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,360
My shooting skills still depend on luck.

236
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
What can I do?

237
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,040
It's okay. I have an idea.

238
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,300
What is it?

239
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,720
I'll teach you slowly, step by step.

240
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,320
You'll get the hang of it.

241
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,120
Why do I feel like

242
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,790
someone is spying on us.

243
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,680
I feel that too.

244
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,160
What are you two doing here?

245
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,880
You're back?

246
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,920
What did you expect?

247
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,640
I'm busy. I need to go now.

248
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
Glad to see you. Bye.

249
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,690
You...

250
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,770
You two...

251
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,600
Grandma.

252
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,520
-Open the door.
-Coming.

253
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,120
Don't open the door, Grandma.
That's a salesman.

254
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,240
A salesman?

255
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,370
We must call the management.

256
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,000
How can they let a salesperson enter?

257
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,320
Ignore him.
I think he'll leave in a while.

258
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,120
Lu Jing, don't try to hide.

259
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,480
I know you're home.

260
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,680
You dare to flirt with a woman

261
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,080
but dare not open the door?

262
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,240
Open the door.

263
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,480
I know you're home.

264
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,720
Jing.

265
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,360
He sounds like Sun, our neighbour.

266
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,720
What did he say? You were flirting what?

267
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,400
Don't mind that, Grandma.

268
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,320
I guess...

269
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,280
I guess he's rehearsing for his new drama.

270
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,960
Rehearsing?

271
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,720
Grandma Lu.

272
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,960
-Hi, Grandma Lu.
-Hi.

273
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,400
-Hi, Grandpa Lu.
-Hi, Sun.

274
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,120
-Have a drink.
-Why didn't you let me know you're coming?

275
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,880
See you later.

276
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,640
Okay. Have tea in my room.

277
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,030
What do you want?

278
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,000
What's going on between you two?

279
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,520
What do you mean?

280
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,720
Yeah,

281
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,960
carry on with your show.

282
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,680
Do you think you can beat me with that?

283
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,880
I'm just guiding her in the game.

284
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,440
Guiding her?

285
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,000
Is this how you guide her?

286
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,950
How should I do it otherwise?

287
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,800
You said you'll teach her step by step.

288
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,960
That's not you, Lu Jing.

289
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,570
What's my style then?

290
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,350
When I started,

291
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,990
you abandoned me
when I wasn't paying attention

292
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,560
because my bad skills
were holding you back.

293
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,760
Did you forget that?

294
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,800
Yes, I did.

295
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,200
You...

296
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,720
Look at you.

297
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,040
You gave up your sense of shame

298
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,920
just to flirt with a girl?

299
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,520
You're being different

300
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,160
because she's a girl, aren't you?

301
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,320
Come to your senses, Lu Jing.

302
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,480
She's even

303
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,520
a much worse player than I was.

304
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,120
But what did you tell her?

305
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,240
You'll teach her slowly step by step.

306
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,400
Is that so?

307
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,040
Are you done?

308
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,160
If you are, I need to study.

309
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,150
You... How heartless you are now.

310
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,880
So, you've grown up enough

311
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,630
to know how to flirt now?

312
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,600
Do you hear that?

313
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,670
They're quarrelling,

314
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,920
hammer and tongs.

315
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,080
What's the problem?

316
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,040
It's only normal for boys to fight.

317
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,630
It'd be strange if they don't.

318
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,560
What's wrong with

319
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,630
youngsters nowadays?

320
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,440
They get mad with each other so easily.

321
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,480
In the past,

322
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,860
Jing often visited Sun's house.

323
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,190
I heard them talking about a girl.

324
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,190
You mean,

325
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,560
both of them fell in love
with the same girl?

326
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,920
How could Sun do this?

327
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,920
He's too old to fight with
a young man over a girl.

328
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,160
No way. I have to back our grandson up.

329
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,320
Let them handle it themselves.

330
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
But...

331
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,440
Come on.

332
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,120
Wait a minute.

333
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,040
Don't tell me you found out who she is.

334
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,720
Yet you have the nerve to flirt with her?

335
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,760
Such a footsie player.

336
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,760
Footsie player?

337
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,410
What does that mean?

338
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,240
That means you're really flirty.

339
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,040
Who did you learn that from?

340
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,960
That punk, Director He, of course.

341
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,840
Wait, don't change the topic.

342
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,600
What were you two doing just now?

343
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,080
Nothing.

344
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,360
Do you think I'm blind?

345
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,440
By the way,

346
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,960
don't tell her I've learnt who she is.

347
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,680
I don't think she'd be happy
to be found out now.

348
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:14,980
Okay.

349
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,200
Our conversation ends here.
I need to study.

350
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,280
Bye.

351
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,480
What's with that look?

352
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,900
Can't you tell?

353
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,880
This is a curious look.

354
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,280
What's going on between you and my buddy?

355
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,200
What do you mean?

356
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,960
Exactly the same reply.

357
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
You want to brush me off?

358
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,000
Not a chance.

359
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,480
I just got online

360
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,440
when I heard you being lovey-dovey.

361
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,440
Stop pretending.

362
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,040
It's true.

363
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,780
He doesn't even know who I am.

364
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,440
Aren't you awesome.

365
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,440
How did you know him?

366
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,370
We're neighbours.

367
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,080
His parents are staying abroad.

368
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
He'll visit his grandparents' place
during the weekends.

369
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,000
What is his hobby?

370
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,080
Doing exercise.

371
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,880
Why do you care about him?

372
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,840
I do not.

373
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,880
I was just asking.

374
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,400
Why do I have a feeling

375
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,560
that you're not just asking?

376
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Your secret is revealing.

377
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,280
[Liang Chen]

378
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Hello, Shan Shan.

379
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,480
Are you... at home?

380
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,560
Yes. What is it?

381
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,880
I think I accidentally left
my earphone in your car.

382
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,010
Yeah. I actually planned
to take it to you when I'm free.

383
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,980
Can I go and take it now?

384
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,810
Sure. Just come.

385
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:47,920
Okay.

386
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,960
My friend is coming. You may leave.

387
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Who is coming? Which Shan Shan is that?

388
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,470
Ma Shan Shan, my university mate.

389
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,080
What a coincidence.

390
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,310
I haven't told you this.

391
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,390
I worked with her

392
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,880
in the previous film.

393
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,640
Awesome.

394
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
It's true.

395
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,000
What are you doing?

396
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,000
That's awesome.

397
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,240
Leave them alone. You don't like skewers.

398
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,120
Don't waste them.

399
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,360
Then bring them home.

400
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Swallow them down. Get out.

401
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,480
-I'll leave after I finish them.
-Hurry up.

402
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,640
Not so fast, Orange.

403
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,680
-Move it.
-It is a weekend.

404
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,200
It's difficult to get a car.

405
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,250
See. No one is taking my order.

406
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,640
Mr Hou will be here in one minute.

407
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,320
Okay. I'll hold it for you.
Put on your shoes.

408
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,400
I...I'm leaving then.

409
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,280
Bye.

410
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,430
By the way,

411
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,400
come and have dinner at my house tomorrow.

412
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,040
I invited some friends

413
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
to welcome me back.

414
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,680
Enough. Stop wasting time.

415
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,760
Hurry up.

416
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,290
Leave already. Bye.

417
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,440
Don't come empty-handed tomorrow night.

418
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,320
Fine.

419
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,410
What a coincidence, Ms Ma.

420
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,180
Shan Shan, come on in.

421
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,400
Yeah, get in.

422
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,290
Hi.

423
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,820
Miss...

424
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,960
Ms Ma, did you catch
your foot in the door?

425
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,800
Come and have a seat.
