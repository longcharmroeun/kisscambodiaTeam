Did you guys see that shining tree?

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I think

12
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,970
Gu Fei Ming still likes Qi Qi.

13
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,160
Then it's over.

14
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,300
Lu Jing will definitely
see it after class.

15
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,360
No wonder Lu Jing got angry.

16
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,500
They must be fighting because of this.

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,720
What is Lu Jing going to do?

18
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,120
What do you mean?

19
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,920
Lu Jing,

20
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,970
you didn't see anything
on your way back here?

21
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,820
What?

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,040
The one that Gu Fei Ming gave Qi Qi...

23
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,300
I saw it.

24
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,579
Well,

25
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,890
don't be too sad.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,520
Why would I be sad?

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
He speaks with a forked tongue

28
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,240
and forces a smile.

29
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,600
Forget it, I'm a hopeless student.

30
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,100
You go take a look.

31
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,240
Jia Yun, I heard it from Zhu Guang that

32
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,950
you guys have to
close down the production

33
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,290
as there were many reporters
on the set today.

34
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm really sorry about it.

35
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,770
It's alright. I can handle it.

36
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm more worried about you.

37
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,740
It's so suffocating.

38
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,260
You guys have no idea.

39
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,100
Everyone is staring at me on my way here.

40
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,220
My heart can't handle this.

41
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,340
With your outfit,

42
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,580
it would be strange if
no one stared at you.

43
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,630
Really?

44
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,380
Taro, I'm sorry.

45
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,940
Eat more.

46
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,300
It's fine.

47

It's all too sudden

55
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,380

56
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,500
this would hurt so many people.

57
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,740
I find you are particularly worried.

58

Aren't you afraid that Orange
will get angry if she knows it?

Meng Lan Zhi, this person,

83
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,920
really doesn't give up.

84
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,380
The trend on the Internet
has also changed.

It points on you and Ding Jia Yun.

86
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,620
Why do I think Liang Chen and Ding Jia Yun

87
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,860
really are having
romantic relationship?

88
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,660
Look at this photo.

89

Are they really having relationship?

90
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,520
They really do make a glamorous couple.

91

Why don't they just

92

[Seems like they are going to
announce their relationship.]

I'm sorry, sir.

112
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,060
Someone has booked the club today.

113
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,860
Reporter? Inside, please.

114
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,540
Do you know what the
reporters are here for?

115
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,340
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,300
This is the privacy of the guest.
I can't tell you that.

117
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,620
Please leave.

118
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,500
Liang Chen, take a sit.

119
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,980
The pastries here taste good.

120
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,260
I'll get some for you.

121
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,450
Jia Yun, let's talk about the

122
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,170
process of the press conference first.

123
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,540
All right.

124
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,220
You haven't discussed it with me before

125
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,340
so I'm not too sure

126
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,140
what exactly I should say on the stage.

127
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,020
Liang Chen, the truth is

128
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,060
there's a better way
to solve this problem

129
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,180
rather than clarifying our relationship.

130
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,860
What is it?

131
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,500
It is to disclose to the media that

132
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,100
we really are having relationship.

133
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,100
Then the scandal will
meet a swift death

134
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,540
and there will be no more rumours.

135
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,940
It won't do.

136
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,140
Why not?

137
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,700
I can't be the reason that

138
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,820
drag you into this.

139
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,940
But I'm not afraid.

140
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,260
I think this is the best
way to quell heresy.

141
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,080
But I can't do this!

142
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,420
Liang Chen,

143
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
why don't you understand me?

144
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,740
Understand what?

145
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,880
Lu Jing.

146
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,420
Boss.

147
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,940
The press conference is about to begin.

148
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,740
Lu Jing, what are you doing?

149
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,120
Lu Jing!

150
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,580
Lu Jing, what are you doing?

151
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,100
Why are you avoiding me?

152
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,100
I've been thinking a lot recently.

153
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,830
I'm a singer,

154
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,350
a public figure.

155
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,480
That's why my every move

156
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,820
will be criticized by others.

157
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,490
But you are different from me.

158
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,860
You are just a student.

159
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,300
You should be enjoying

160
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,300
a carefree campus life.

161
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,140
I'm not supposed to mess up your life.

162
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,070
So

163
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,860
I think we...

Senior!

200
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,900
In my four years in university,

201
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,780
I received the national first-class
scholarship every year.

202
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,540
I am rewarded as
Triple-A student every year.

203
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,620
I even got champion in ACM Asia.

204
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,700
I can play violin.

205
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,380
I can play basketball.

206
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,740
I'm also the champion of marathon
for university students.

207
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,300
In the future, I'll continue to
work hard in computer science

Hello, friends from the media.

226
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,420
Firstly, thank you for

227
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,420
your attention to me and Liang Chen.

228
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,860
Then I'll answer

00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,460
your most interested question,

230
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,100
the relationship between
me and Liang Chen.

231
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,420
Liang Chen is my good friend.

232
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,970
Friend?

233
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,180
Liang Chen's friend.

234
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,140
We met each other at work.

235
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,350
To be frank, I deeply admire her.

236
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,020
Because she has been working hard.

237
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,260
She has been pursuing what she wants.

238
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,100
I saw her stumbling along the way

239
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,220
but she never gives up.

240
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,420

for having such a good friend.

243
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,820
I won't allow anyone to denigrate her.

00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,140

245
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,180
You mean someone has
intentionally against Liang Chen?

Do you mean Meng Lan Zhi?

It's possible.

249

Aren't you afraid of getting
slammed by the door?

257
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,580
I'm not afraid.

258
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,900
I'm just afraid that today is a dream.

No, he...

267
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,340
What's wrong with him?

268
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,460
What?

269
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,260

Why is he so happy?

I know, right?

272
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,220
I can feel his happiness
is almost overflowing.

273
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
He's so scary.

274
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,180
Gu Fei Ming and Qi Qi
are already like that.

How could he be happy?

In my opinion,

277
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,980
he's probably pretending to be relaxed.

are you serious?

299
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,340
Are you suffering from anything?

300
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,520
That's why you intentionally...

301
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,420
Right.

302
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,740
There are plenty
more fish in the sea.

303
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,340
Don't be single-minded.

304
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,340
You're still young.

305
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,660
Do not give up on yourself

306
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,700

307
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,340
What are you talking about?

308
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Get some sleep.

309
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,060

310
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,940
Boss, I don't understand.

things for Ms Liang.

things difficult for her.

You like her so much.

At least now we're still friends.

317
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,140
If she rejects me,

318
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,540
we can't even be friends.

319
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,740
Boss, if you don't tell her,

320

she'll never know that you like her.

00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,540
No matter what the result is,

322
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,740
you should give yourself an answer.

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,180
Keep going, stick to it!

Say it, what mistake have you made?

332
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,320
I'm speaking the truth.

333
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,100
We have an appointment with
Director Ma today, right?

334
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,980
Why?

335
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,950

Okay, then we'll talk next time.

339
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,700

with me if there's any problem.

Nothing.

344

I just want to say sorry.

345

348
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,940
As a senior,

I kindly remind you that

350
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,060
no matter which sector you're in,

351
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,740
you should take every step steadily.

352
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,300
You'll eventually get
yourself into trouble

353
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,340
if you played tricks.

354
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,980
Thanks for your advice, Ms Liang.

355
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,980
Unfortunately, I don't understand it.

356
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,420
Go back and listen more to nursery
rhymes if you don't understand.

357
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,980
Right, I forgot to tell you.

358

What else did netizens say?

369
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,960
After the official announcement of the
program team, some doubted Liang Chen,

370
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,140
saying that she has
the same style with Lisa,

371
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,100
and she'd lose in the first round.

372
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,100
Right.

373
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,980
The popularity of

374
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,780
Liang Chen's songs is
higher than Meng Lan Zhi's

375
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,420
but her style is not
as flexible as Meng Lan Zhi's.

376
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,500
So I think Meng Lan Zhi has

377
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,460
more advantage in this program.

378
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,980
I'm afraid Liang Chen would be
screwed in this competition.

379
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,740
You're the one who's screwed.

380
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,620
You guys don't know her.

381
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,100
Only you know.

382
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,580
Ms Liang,

383
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
the netizens doubted you
about joining the contest.

384
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,540
How could you be so calm?

385
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,820
Doubt what?

386
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,260
They doubted me, saying that
I'm no match for Meng Lan Zhi?

387
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,820
That's pretty much what they mean.

388
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,380
No matter what people said,

389
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,220
they won't affect my performance.

390
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,900
Forget it, the coat I'm wearing
still looks the best,

391
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,620
right?

392
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,620
Hello.

393
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,420
Senior.

394
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,110
What are you doing?

395
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,980
I'm ready to go out to work.

396
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,660
Are you free after that?

397
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,740
Why?

398
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,820
[I want...]

399
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,790
I'll go to Sun Bin Yu's house

400
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,390
to have dinner after working.

401
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,260
Okay, I'll go too.

402
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,380
See you there.

403
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,540
-Lu Jing.
-What do you want to eat later?

404
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,660
Eat Spicy Hot Pot.

405
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,220
Okay, still that one.

406
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,580
Hello, seniors.

407
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,980
Lu Jing, where are you going?

408
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,380
I'm going to the next class.

409
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,100
I'll leave you then.

410
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,940
We are going on a date.

411
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,860
You definitely have no time for dating

412
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,540
since you're studying so hard.

413
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,340
Have fun on your date

414
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,290
but don't forget to study as well.

415
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,780
Only then can you have a future.

416
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,370
You...

417
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,860
All right.

418
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,020
Let's go. We have class.

419
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,350
Did you guys see it?

420
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,270
He is apparently heartbroken

421
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,160
but still pretends to be strong.

422
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,540
This is his last stand.

423
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,140
Lu Jing, you poor thing.

424
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,540
It's not right.

425
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,310
Didn't he say that he has a girlfriend?

426
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
What do you know?

427
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,180
Lu Jing is hurt.

428
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,460
That's why he got a girlfriend
to be the replacement.

429
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,300
Right, you're right.

430
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,540
This won't do.

431
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,740
We can't stand still

432
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,260
and watch Lu Jing get bullied.

433
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,780
We have to find a way

434
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,060
and help him earn his dignity back.

435
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,520
Liang Chen.

436
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,380
Director Ma, is there anything else?

437
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,180
I just want to remind you that

438
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,740
the remaining seven singers

439
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,780
are all distinct.

440
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,740
You have to be very careful
at choosing your song.

441
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,980
I understand, thank you.

442
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,280
Do you have any idea?

443
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,260
I'm choosing between
ballad and rock-and-roll.

444
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,660
I know a music producer.

445
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,350
He happens to have a song.

446
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,780
Do you want to give it a try?

447
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,740
Okay, thank you, Director Ma.

448
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,780
Coming.

449
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,210
Why are you here?

450
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
My care for a single man,

451
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
here to give you warmth.

452
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,820
Lu Jing, why are you so polite today?

453
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,100
We've known each other for so long.

454
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,580
Why are you being so polite?

455
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,580
I heard that you've invited

456
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,260
Liang Chen over for dinner tonight.

457
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,340
Liang Chen even told you this?

458
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,260
I have something to ask her.

459
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
We'll just have dinner

460
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,489
at a small restaurant nearby.

461
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,570
It's not convenient for her to go out

462
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,610
since gossip hasn't died down.

463
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,739
You are such a fussy man.

464
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,860
Are you asking me to cook for her?

465
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,420
I can't cook.

466
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,900
So you are the only one
I can count on.

467
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,219
I... You...

468
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,060
Thank you.

469
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,050
Lu Jing, you're out of line!

470
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,670
How is it?

471
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,310
I think this song is not right.

472
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,520
Which part do you think is not right?

473
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,460
All of it.

474
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,620
Orange,

475
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,820
are you doing it on purpose
because of me?

476
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,860
You're imagining it.

477
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,260
You guys know each other?

478
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,100
-No.
-Yes.

479
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,820
Director, I don't think
this song suits me.

480
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,420
I want to be more careful
on the song selection.

481
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,660
I'm afraid I can't accept your kindness.

482
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,670
It's fine,

483
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,900
as long as you can
confirm the song promptly.

484
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,340
It takes time to do an arrangement.

485
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,170
Okay, thank you.

486
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,260
Then I'll leave first.

487
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,390
Okay.

488
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,080
You're not satisfied with the song?

489
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,380
Hello, Jia Yun.

490
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
Hello, Liang Chen.

491
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,940
I saw the official announcement.

492
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,260
Congratulations.

493
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,860
Thank you.

494
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,700
I'll treat you to dinner
after the contest.

495
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,820
Also to thank you

496
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,340
for helping me to clarify
in the press conference last time.

497
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,580
I'm calling

498
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,490
to ask

499
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,460
if you are free on the night of the 24th?

500
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,980
24th?

501
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,980
Birthday.

502
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,300
It's your birthday?

503
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,340
Of course I'll go.

504
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,820
Okay, I'll wait for you.

505
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,780
Your apron looks nice.

506
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,350
You are full of crap.

507
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,700
Ms Ma,

508
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,900
would you like to come to
my house for dinner tonight?

509
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,550
I'll make you a loving dinner.

510
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,490
Wash them clean.

511
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,140
They need to be eaten.

512
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,940
The reception is good.

513
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,300
Didn't she look at her phone?

514
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,430
What are you laughing at?

515
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,540
You're sending WeChat
message to a girl, right?

516
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,700
It doesn't feel like
she wants to talk to you.

517
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,340
Nonsense.

518
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,220
Ms Ma is too busy.

519
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,910
She has no time to
look at her phone, okay?

520
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,010
Do you think everyone is free like you?

521
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,930
Looking at the phone
and waiting to reply every day.

522
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,380
Then you just wait for her reply.

523
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,460
I guess it will take half a month.

524
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,580
You...

525
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,060
Go back and bring me some vinegar.

526
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,960
You talk too much as a freeloader.

527
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,920
Go!

528
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,740
Why didn't she reply me?

529
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,060
Coming.

530
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,260
He's pretty fast.

531
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,930
It's you.

532
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,680
Taro,

533
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,410
I think this apron

534
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,870
fits you well,

535
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,470
like it was made for you.

536
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,660
You look really nice.

537
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,420
Orange, have you been

538
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,620
hanging out with Lu Jing lately?

539
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,990
He is a bad influence.

540
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,420
Lu Jing bought this for me.

541
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,940
Don't you think he's crazy?

542
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,090
Just buy me the groceries,

543
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:33,740
why buy this apron?

544
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,940
Is he here already?

545
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,960
Lu Jing?

546
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,020
Lu Jing?

547
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,140
Why do I sense something fishy?

548
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,650
Lu Jing?

549
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,370
Lu Jing didn't come?

550
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,300
Orange,

551
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,210
don't you have a good
relationship with Ms Ma?

552
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,100
Why don't you
invite her over for dinner tonight?

553
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,660
Look, it's rare that I cook.

554
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,920
Okay.

555
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,840
You call her.

556
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,550
Orange,

557
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,460
what's the matter with Ms Ma?

558
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,580
Tell me since you guys

559
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,580
were classmates.

560
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,810
Has she always been like this?

561
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,140
Aren't you close with her?

562
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,860
Ask her yourself.

563
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,020
Right, it's Jia Yun's
birthday in two days.

564
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,800
What do you think I should give him?

565
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,220
We've known him for so long.

566
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,940
Just give him anything.

567
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,860
Orange, I'm begging you.

568
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,430
Just tell me more about Ms Ma.

569
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,820
Please.

570
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,380
Just give him anything?

571
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,060
Then what will you give him?

572
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:48,910
Lu Jing.

573
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,390
You're here.

574
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,090
Why did you come early?

575
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,820
I know you were coming so I rush here.

576
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,420
I'm still here, okay?

577
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,780
What's wrong with you both?

578
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,530
Taro,

579
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,260
have you finished cooking?

580
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,820
Liang Chen is starving.

581
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,740
Go, quickly!

582
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,020
Hurry up and cook.

583
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,700
This is my house,
I'm not a chef, you...

584
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,860
What were you guys
talking about just now?
