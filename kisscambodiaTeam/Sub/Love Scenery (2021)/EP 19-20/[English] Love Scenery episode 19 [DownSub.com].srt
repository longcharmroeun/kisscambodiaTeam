because I heard

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,160

The truth is,

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,280
I've hit a roadblock
in my song-writing journey.

I can get this opportunity.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,360

49

188
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,280
Liang Chen,

189
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
I may not have the right to say this,

190
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,360
but as your friend,

191
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,520
I must remind you.

192
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,520
What if I hadn't got here in time

193
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,520
and those photos went out?

194
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,360
You may not care

195
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,000
about the news right now.

196
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,720
But that boy, can he handle it?

197
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,680
I've never thought about this.

198
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
In that case,

199
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,760
you should think it over from now on.

200
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,160
Just now Jia Yun was looking for you,

201
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,280
did he find you?

202
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,960
He sent me home.

203
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,160
Why do you seem upset?

204
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,400
No. I'm just exhausted.

205
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,240
I'll cook something for you.

206
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,760
Hello.

207
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,640
[Are you home?]

208
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,800
Yes, I am.

209
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,960
[I'm sorry.]

210
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,760
[I almost got you into trouble today.]

211
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
It's me who should apologise.

212
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,560
I was insensitive.

213
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,800
[Rest early.]

214
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,800
[Bye.]

215
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,360
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of Liang Chen.

216
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,440
No one needs to do anything
on behalf of Liang Chen and me.

217
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,440
Do you mean

218
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,480
by causing her trouble?

219
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,600
Thank you for asking.

220
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
For the trouble I caused,

221
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,120
I will fix it myself.

222
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Ke Ke, when you open the door,

223
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,520
check who that is.

224
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,200
Qing, what are you doing here?

225
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,800
So much has happened today,
I came to see you.

226
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,760
Qing, please sit.

227
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,120
I didn't expect Meng Lan Zhi

228
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,400
would ride the wave again.

229
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,120
Don't worry. I'm fine.

230
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,040
Yeah.

231
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,760
Meng Lan Zhi won't make any impact on you,

232
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,600
but not others.

233
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,320
Qing, just get to the point.

234
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,880
You've been very close
with a boy recently.

235
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,560
Not me. I know nothing.

236
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
Do you really think that I'm insensitive

237
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,720
and won't notice anything?

238
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,920
I'm quite close with him,

239
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,800
but I should also have

240
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,560
my own normal social life.

241
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,320
He's still a student, isn't he?

242
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
Do you have any idea what he will face

243
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,600
if the media exposes him?

244
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,720
Pressure from public opinion aside,

245
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
the attention he gets

246
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,240
will be enough to turn
his life upside down.

247
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,200
The memory card in the reporter's camera
has been taken away.

248
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,000
This problem has been solved,
but can you make sure

249
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,640
the same thing won't happen again?

250
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,600
I'm not saying that you can't date,

251
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,480
but you have to calm yourself down now

252
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,360
and think about
the consequences and impacts

253
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,920
caused by your relationship with him.

254
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,440
Don't hurt other people

255
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
and yourself.

256
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,200
Got it.

257
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,960
It's been a while.

258
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,840
You're here.

259
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,400
I'll have the same three dishes.

260
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,320
Thanks, mister.

261
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
It's been a while
since you last came here.

262
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,800
Exactly, exactly.

263
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,480
Is that Sun Bin Yu?

264
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,520
I think so.

265
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,520
Let's take a photo.

266
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
Look. That's him.

267
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
We found him! He's here!

268
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Come here, come here!

269
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,920
Hurry up! Hurry up!

270
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,080
Hurry up. Hurry.

271
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,000
What are you doing?

272
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,120
Go back!

273
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
What the hell is this?

274
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,920
What's the matter?

275
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,560
There's a rumour online
saying that you lead a promiscuous life

276
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,960
and are having illicit relationships
with several men.

277
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,240
She's out, she's out.

278
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Come, come.

279
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,520
Who are you?

280
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,840
Do you know Liang Chen?

281
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,080
I don't know who Liang Chen is.

282
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,360
I don't know who Liang Chen is.

283
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,520
I'm just getting groceries.

284
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,280
Just tell us something.

285
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,320
Hello, Taro.

286
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,640
Orange, help me!

287
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,520
What's wrong?

288
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,960
Some culprit spread rumours online,

289
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,960
saying that you always
come to my neighbourhood.

290
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
They even revealed my address.

291
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,320
I only went to get breakfast,

292
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,640
they secretly photographed me.

293
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
Now I'm stuck outside like a dog.

294
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
If I had known this,

295
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,120
I would've dressed up.

296
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,560
I'm a mess right now.

297
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,360
Someone revealed your address
on the internet?

298
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,840
No. They revealed my neighbourhood.

299
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm not sure how they got my address,

300
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,920
[but they found us so soon.]

301
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,720
Taro, I'm sorry.

302
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,760
I got you into this.

303
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,640
[What are you talking about?]

304
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,280
I'm an actor, after all.

305
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,360
[It's given my popularity
quite the boost.]

306
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,840
Speaking of which, Orange.

307
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,520
This is all very strange.

308
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,520
Someone must've planned this.

309
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,200
You'd better watch out.

310
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,040
Where are you now?

311
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,840
I can ask Ke Ke to pick you up.

312
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,880
Forget it, forget it.

313
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,320
If... If you come here,

314
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,520
that means our relationship is real.

315
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,120
I'll figure something out.

316
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,240
Bye.

317
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,160
Alright.

318
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,440
Are you kidding me?

319
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I look so ugly in this!

320
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,560
You even turned me into a meme?

321
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,480
Do you think I never surf the internet?

322
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,240
Report. I'll report everything!

323
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,760
Darn it!

324
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
Maybe I should explain it to Ms Ma.

325
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,000
She must never think

326
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,520
that there's something
between Liang Chen and me.

327
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,160
[Hello,]

328
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,520
[the number you're calling]

329
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
[is currently switched off.]

330
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
She switched her phone off again?

331
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,800
Maybe I should go to her house.

332
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,400
[Liang Chen went to a drama actor's house
late at night.]

333
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,720
[Is she seeing him?]

334
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,800
[Are Ding Jia Yun and Liang Chen
just friends?]

335
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,480
[Is Liang Chen having
illicit relationships]

336
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,680
[with several men?]

337
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,640
Hey,

338
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,760
defamation is a criminal offence,

339
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,440
please mind your language.

340
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,120
-There you are.
-What is going on now?

341
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,000
I've drafted a legal letter and statement.

342
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,720
If the statement can't suppress
those scandals,

343
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,040
we will issue the legal letter.

344
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,160
Okay.

345
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,080
Liang Chen,

346
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,040
these news are obviously trying
to slander you.

347
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,040
Did you offend someone?

348
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,200
Isn't that obvious?

349
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,200
Besides Meng Lan Zhi,

350
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,640
who else could do that?

351
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,520
Why would she do this?

352
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,680
I think she's determined
to join The Journey of Music Lovers.

353
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,080
Just ignore her.

354
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,800
Are other people being affected?

355
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,040
I've contacted

356
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,560
those guys in the scandals.

357
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
All of them have been harassed
to some degree.

358
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,400
Remember to treat them to a meal.

359
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,280
Who else has been harassed besides Taro?

360
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,280
Jia Yun,

361
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,200
and the male staff
who's been working closely with you.

362
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,400
Nowadays, the media would do anything

363
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,320
just to get the headlines.

364
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
They couldn't wait

365
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
to find every single man

366
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,840
who's related to you in any way.

367
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,040
You may not care

368
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,680
about the news right now.

369
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,720
But that boy,

370
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,360
can he handle it?

371
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,840
Nice! Nice!

372
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,760
What are you looking at?

373
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,120
I won't be playing. I'm taking a break.

374
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
He Ye.

375
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,280
Come.

376
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,640
[Hello,]

377
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,160
[the number you're calling]

378
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,960
[is unavailable at the moment.]

379
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,720
[Please try again later.]

380
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,400
[Where are you now?]

381
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,160
Ladies!

382
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,360
I'm coming!

383
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,960
This is so awkward.

384
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,640
Last year,

385
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,480
I wanted to be as slim as lightning

386
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,280
and blind your eyes.

387
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,560
But now, I'm as fat as a wall,

388
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,000
and I'm blocking your view.

389
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,880
Who's there?

390
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,760
Ms Ma!

391
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,600
What do you want?

392
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,720
I... I...

393
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,400
It's all Liang Chen's fault.

394
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,880
I was chased around by my fans

395
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,480
and blocked by reporters.

396
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,240
Now I have nowhere to go!

397
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
Look, I even lost my shoe.

398
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm pathetic.

399
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,120
You have animal slippers too!

400
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,560
They fit me just fine.

401
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,960
Ms Ma,

402
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,680
I knew you'd help me.

403
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,360
From now on, all the house chores
including sweeping and cooking

404
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,280
will be on me.

405
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,480
You won't regret it.

406
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,320
What happened to Liang Chen?

407
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,320
Tell me everything and get out of here.

408
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,880
Liang Chen, catch me!

409
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,880
Watch out.

410
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,600
[I can't ruin his life.]

411
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,760
[Why didn't she answer my call?]

412
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,360
Drink some soy milk for nutrition.

413
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,280
Life is bitter. Have some candy.

414
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,840
Come here, come here.

415
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,360
Look.

416
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,960
I thought Lu Jing has been acting strange.

417
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,120
They must've had a fight.

418
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,840
But looking at them,
it seems they've made up.

419
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,120
And now they're showing affection.

420
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,200
Why is this drama so complicated?

421
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,920
What's wrong?

422
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,560
What else?

423
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,880
I had a fight with Qi Qi again.

424
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,880
It's annoying.

425
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,320
What do you think the girls are thinking?

426
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,680
Why would they ignore someone
all of a sudden?

427
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,600
I know, right?

428
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,960
What are they thinking?

429
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,120
We were walking on the street,

430
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,920
but Qi Qi said it was too windy
and she was cold.

431
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,360
But I looked around,
and it was not windy at all.

432
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,240
Then she was upset.

433
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,400
A few days ago,

434
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,560
as soon as she saw me, she asked me

435
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,360
if I noticed anything different about her.

436
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,520
How would I know?

437
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,960
So I asked her,

438
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,720
did you gain weight?

439
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,520
Then she blocked me.

440
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,640
She never talks to me up until now.

441
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
You've had a hard time.

442
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,520
I know, right?

443
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,320
You know me well.

444
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,280
We're both men, after all.

445
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,600
No, no. We are different.

446
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,000
Why is that?

447
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,670
Forget it. You won't get it anyway.

448
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,600
You're right.

449
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,560
We're different.

450
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,880
I have a girlfriend,

451
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,670
but you're single.

452
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,760
How are we the same?

453
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,800
Ouch!

454
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Ouch...

455
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,320
Why are you leaving already?

456
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,560
What's going on?

457
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,280
Are you mad because I said you're single?

458
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,400
Come back, come back.

459
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,160
I'll share my experience with you.

460
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,040
They've just made up,
and they're fighting again.

461
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,400
Judging from Lu Jing's expression,

462
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,080
he must be really mad.

463
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,160
Love is hard. It is so hard.

464
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,080
Qi Qi.

465
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,040
Excuse me.

466
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,280
Excuse me, excuse me.

467
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,680
Qi Qi, who would be so sweet?

468
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,400
Could it be Gu Fei Ming?

469
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,600
I... I have no idea.

470
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Why would no boy

471
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,160
be so sweet to me?

472
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,640
This tree is very tall.

473
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,320
It must've taken him some time.

474
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,840
Chubby,

475
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
where's Gu Fei Ming?

476
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,000
Gu Fei Ming is in the school hospital.

477
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,840
Wasn't he just discharged
from the hospital?

478
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,240
Why is he in the hospital again?

479
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,120
He fell down
when he was putting this stuff up.

480
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,880
Qi Qi!

481
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,520
Be gentle. Please, be gentle.

482
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,680
Have you not eaten?

483
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,320
Doctor, harder!

484
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,760
What happened? Are you hurt?

485
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,080
It's nothing.

486
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,960
I just sprained my ankle.

487
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,440
Don't cry, Qi Qi.

488
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,880
I always sprain my ankle.

489
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,160
It's nothing. I'm serious.

490
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,080
Really?

491
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,960
Really.

492
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,440
Doctor, please be gentle!

493
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,840
My arm is also dislocated.

494
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,560
Gu Fei Ming, have you lost your mind?

495
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,600
It's done. Are you hurt anywhere else?

496
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,040
Over here.

497
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,800
You're fine.

498
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,240
Will I lose my memory?

499
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,000
Don't worry. You won't lose your memory,

500
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,560
but you might have dementia.

501
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,240
Alright, young lady.

502
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,400
We'll leave your boyfriend to you.

503
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,400
We're leaving.

504
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,960
Are you hurt anywhere?

505
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,720
Qi Qi, have you forgiven me?

506
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,440
Silly,

507
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,400
why are you so stupid?

508
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,520
Shan Shan, why did you come here?

509
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,080
Surprise visit.

510
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Come on in.

511
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,800
It's been a while
since you last tried my cooking.

512
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,400
It's time to show you my improvement.

513
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,160
Are you sure?

514
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,720
Don't hurt yourself.

515
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,280
Then you'll have to send me
to the hospital.

516
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,920
Don't worry about it.

517
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,960
I saw the news on the internet.

518
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,720
Don't get the wrong idea,

519
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,040
there's nothing between Sun Bin Yu and me.

520
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,080
They made it up.

521
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,160
Don't believe it.

522
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,080
I... I know.

523
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,520
I know you two well.

524
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,560
I'm just here to see you. Are you alright?

525
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,280
I...

526
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
I'm fine.

527
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,680
Those were groundless rumours.

528
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,720
I won't take it to heart.

529
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,640
That's great.

530
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,760
Stop it.

531
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,480
They're barely edible now.

532
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,480
[Regarding the recent
malicious misrepresentation]

533
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,120
[of Liang Chenâ€™s private life
and other false statements,]
