00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,240
Lu Jing.

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,380
You're here.

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,220
You're early.

9
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,860
I rushed back
knowing that you would be here.

10
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,580
Don't forget about me.

11
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,860
What's going on with you two?

12
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Taro.

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,220
Are you done cooking?

14
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,979
Liang Chen has been starving all day.

15
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,080
Go on.

16
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
Get cooking.

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,820
This is my house. I'm not your chef.

18
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,900
What were you two talking about?

19
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
Jia Yun's birthday is in two days.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,140
Taro and I were discussing
what to give him.

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,140
When is his birthday?

22
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,660
It's on the 24th of December.

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,780
That's Christmas Eve.

24
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,660
What a coincidence.

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,980
Christmas Eve? I forgot about that.

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
It'll be the first festival

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
we celebrate as a couple.

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,760
But I shouldn't skip
Jia Yun's birthday celebration.

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,060
I've promised him.

30
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,500
It's okay. Let me choose the present.

31
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,180
Don't you mind?

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,700
We should buy him a present.

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,920
Here.

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,060
Look at this.

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,580
How about this?

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,420
That's not suitable.

37
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Let's browse some more.

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
How about a necktie?

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,340
I'm sure he has many ties.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,280
How about cufflinks?

41
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,880
Not good.

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,740
What should we get him?

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,140
How about this?

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,940
A little tortoise.
It has good connotations.

45
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,020
It symbolises health and prosperity.

46
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,340
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,240
It's quite nice. Look, it's so cute.

48
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,120
Scrap that.

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,180
How about this?

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,820
I think it's fine.

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,740
What are you doing?

52
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,860
What is going on?

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,140
Can't you tell?

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,380
Any hints?

55
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,180
Is it obvious enough?

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,140
My goodness.

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,540
Am I seeing things?

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,380
You two are holding hands!

59
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,660
You're not seeing things.
It's exactly what you think it is.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,740
Don't you have any questions for us?

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,060
What should I ask?

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,300
You could ask how happy we are.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,600
Taro.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,100
Go and be happy outside.

65
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,880
What should we do?

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,780
Do you want to watch a movie?

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,760
Sure, it's been a while
since I've watched a movie.

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,180
I happen to have a cap in my car.

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,420
Let's go watch a movie.

70
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,280
<i>Give it to me!</i>

71
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,600
-<i>No way.</i>
-<i>Give it to me!</i>

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,020
<i>No way!</i>

73
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,580
I'm a little nervous with all these people
around us.

74
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,920
You're so cute.

75
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,020
What?

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,200
Nothing.

77
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,220
The movie has started. Pay attention.

78
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,020
<i>Why don't I dance for you?</i>

79
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
<i>Do you like it?</i>

80
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
<i>Yes.</i>

81
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,980
<i>Stop crying, okay?</i>

82
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,540
<i>Okay, I'll stop crying.</i>

83
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,980
Is it funny?

84
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,180
Liu Mao Yan is so cute.

85
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,340
I'm cute too.

86
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,300
Who's complimenting you?

87
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,860
Didn't you say that
I look like Liu Mao Yan?

88
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,580
When you compliment him,
you compliment me.

89
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,860
I'm not complimenting you.

90
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,340
Hello.

91
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,200
<i>Shan Shan.</i>

92
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,540
<i>Can you please persuade Liang Chen</i>

93
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,460
<i>to choose my song?</i>

94
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,260
Ms Ma.

95
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,740
What happened to Liang Chen?

96
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,500
Ms Ma, see what I brought?

97
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,780
Ms Ma, stop ordering takeout.

98
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,660
It's bad for your health.

99
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,500
Here, try the home-cooked meal
I made for you.

100
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,420
It looks much more appetising
than takeout.

101
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,720
Not only am I angel in person,

102
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,660
I'm also a devil in the kitchen.

103
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,140
Look, the colour is so nice.

104
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,740
Enjoy the food.

105
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,260
You said you wanted
to talk about Liang Chen.

106
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,620
What happened to her?

107
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,680
Eat up.

108
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,340
I'll tell you while you eat.

109
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,080
It's a long story.

110
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,460
Then make it short.

111
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,620
Liang Chen is in love.

112
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,700
The love birds are so in love.

113
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,840
I can't take it anymore.

114
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,520
I skipped dinner
because I was so mad at them.

115
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,140
Then, I came to your place.

116
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,780
Is it Jia Yun?

117
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,620
Jia Yun is not Liang Chen's type.

118
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,240
You know Liang Chen so well, Ms Ma.

119
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,620
It must be because you were her classmate.

120
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,900
Ms Ma, actually...

121
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,940
I've been single for a long time.

122
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,980
Ms Ma.

123
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,160
Be honest to me.

124
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,980
What do you think of my appearance?

125
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,960
-You're quite...
-Quite good looking, right?

126
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,300
What are you trying to say?

127
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,180
Look, Ms Ma.

128
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,180
I'm quite good looking.

129
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,360
I can cook.

130
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,600
I have a successful career.

131
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,400
More importantly,

132
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,520
I'm single.

133
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,380
I'm a rare gift.

134
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,460
Ms Ma.

135
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,220
Don't you have

136
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,100
any special feelings for me?

137
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,020
Are you done?

138
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,360
If you're done, please leave.

139
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,240
I...

140
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,440
Please.

141
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,900
Eat more.

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,540
If you think that the dishes...

143
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,780
Liu Mao Yan is quite handsome.

144
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,840
I met him once at an event.

145
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,180
He held my skirt and helped me
step down the stage.

146
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,180
I didn't know he was such
a good actor, too.

147
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,280
Do you think...

148
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,140
Are you unhappy?

149
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,220
You didn't enjoy the movie?

150
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,420
I'm not happy.

151
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,780
You complimented another man's looks.

152
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,580
You're good looking too.

153
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,180
He held your skirt and helped
you step down the stage.

154
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,060
But

155
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,780
it's your hand I'm holding right now.

156
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,580
Are you happier now?

157
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm happier now.

158
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,180
But I'm still a little sore.

159
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,780
Every other couple will be spending time
together on Christmas Eve,

160
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,740
but I'll be celebrating alone.

161
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,220
It'll be so lonely.

162
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,940
On that day,

163
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,300
I'll leave the party early.

164
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,920
Don't force yourself.

165
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,360
It's your friend's birthday party.

166
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,580
How can you leave early?

167
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
Fine.

168
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,980
I'll pick you up.

169
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,900
Let me know when you're done.

170
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,140
You don't have to change your schedule
because of me.

171
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,460
No matter how late it will be,
I don't mind waiting for you.

172
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,620
Sleep early. Good night.

173
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,600
Jia Yun.

174
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
Happy birthday.

175
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,880
Thank you.

176
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,200
Here's my present for you.

177
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,080
Do you like it?

178
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,400
I like it.

179
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,180
I'm glad that you came.

180
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,280
You don't have to bring a present.

181
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,100
Where are Taro and the gang?

182
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,340
Take a seat.

183
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,640
Sure.

184
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,540
Are you hungry? Let's eat first.

185
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,440
Taro and the others are not here yet.

186
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,780
We shouldn't start without them.

187
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,140
Let's eat while waiting for them.

188
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,680
Waiter.

189
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,580
Are you going on a date?

190
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,500
Of course I have to be with my girlfriend
on Christmas Eve.

191
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,100
Are you serious?

192
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,780
He Ye and Liu'er went out
early in the morning.

193
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,100
God knows when those two fools
got girlfriends.

194
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,320
Now, even you're heading out.

195
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,780
This is why you don't have a girlfriend.

196
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,440
Lu Jing.

197
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,420
You're heartless.

198
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,240
Do you know that
in order to give you a surprise,

199
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,500
I almost got into a fight
with the Student Council?

200
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,540
Surprise?

201
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,660
What surprise?

202
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,200
It's...

203
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,620
Just wait for it.

204
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,700
Fine, go meet with your girlfriend.

205
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,060
Where did he get a girlfriend?

206
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
I don't get it.

207
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,260
Why do all of them have girlfriends?

208
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,300
Am I not handsome?

209
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,240
<i>Sun Bin Yu</i>

210
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,030
What's up?

211
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,140
<i>What else?</i>

212
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,319
It's Christmas Eve.

213
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,720
Of course I have to

214
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,740
discuss something meaningful with you.

215
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,420
For example, how did
you win Liang Chen's heart?

216
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,840
<i>Do you have any techniques</i>

217
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,900
you can share with me?

218
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,540
Lu Jing!

219
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
<i>Have a heart, will you?</i>

220
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,340
I'm sincerely asking for guidance here.

221
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,840
Aren't you at Ding Jia Yun's
birthday party?

222
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,720
Why are you so free?

223
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,100
I didn't go to the party.

224
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,380
Don't you know that the party
was cancelled at the last minute?

225
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,820
We're almost done eating,
but Taro is not even here yet.

226
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,140
He's not punctual at all.

227
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,140
Let's have some cake.

228
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,460
I don't think they will come.

229
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,780
Please enjoy.

230
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,560
Thank you.

231
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,100
Let me cut the cake for you.

232
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,660
What's wrong? Is it not tasty?

233
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,020
No, it's because

234
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,240
I'm on diet.

235
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,740
That's why I can't eat too much.

236
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,340
It's okay. The cake is custom ordered.

237
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,220
It's low sugar. It's not fattening.

238
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,460
Luckily you came today.

239
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,660
Otherwise,

240
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,100
I'll have to celebrate alone.

241
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,860
The view here is not bad.

242
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,580
It's quite beautiful.

243
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,580
It reminds me of a phrase.

244
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,860
Be it the moon or its reflection,
it's far beyond reach.

245
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,820
<i>The person in front of me
is the person I desire.</i>

246
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,980
Liang Chen.

247
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,420
I have something to tell you.

248
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,340
Actually, I've known you for a long time.

249
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,180
It's longer than you think.

250
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,340
I've been observing you in secret.

251
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,540
When I saw you working hard
to pursue a career in music,

252
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,700
I had a strong urge to approach you.

253
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,460
But I was worried that
if I go too close to you,

254
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,700
I may lose you.

255
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,860
I want to tell you something that
I've been keeping inside my heart.

256
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,300
Liang Chen, I love you.

257
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,860
Jia Yun.

258
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,620
I'm grateful for your love.

259
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,380
However,

260
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,340
I'm already in love with someone else.

261
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,100
I respect your choice.

Look down there.

268

The company is huge.

Yes. In the future...

Let me introduce someone to you.

272
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,180
She's the singer we've just signed.
Her name is Liang Chen.

273
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,080
He's Jia Yun.

274
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,260
Hello, Jia Yun.

275
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,980
Please take care of her.

276
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,960
You're too polite.

277
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

278
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,660
Congratulations.
You've finally moved into a new place.

279
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,860
Ding, let me introduce someone to you.

280
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,820
This is my friend, Liang Chen.

281
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,720
Hello.

282
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,340
Orange, let me introduce someone to you.

283
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,320
This is my good pal, Ding Jia Yun.

284
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,220
We know each other.

285
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,320
Hello.

286
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,100
We're friends.
You don't have to be so polite.

287
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,500
What a coincidence.

288
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,540
Take a seat.

289
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,060
-Do you want any drinks?
-Let me help you.

290

<i>We didn't break up back then,
but now we've broken up.</i>

291

Liang Chen.

292
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,500
Although

293
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,780
we couldn't have dinner together,

294
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,940
I want to be the first person
to give you an apple.

295
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,660
So, despite the cold weather,

296
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,940
you came to pick me up ahead of time

297
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,460
because of this?

298
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,340
Thank you.

299
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,520
Where do you want to go?

300
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,380
I just want to take a stroll

301
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,180
together with you.

302
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,160

I can sing my favourite song
just like him.

311

Come with me.

How can I help you?

314
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,460
My girlfriend would like to sing a song.

315
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,700
Can we borrow your guitar?

316
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,800
Sure.

look like Liang Chen?

00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,780
I gave it a mechanical heart.

Your singing

352
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,580
is awful,

353
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,940

He's literally tone-deaf.

367

His singing is awful.

368
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,580
I think it's quite nice.

369
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,840
It's nice.

370
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,179
Ms Liang.

371
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,730
You haven't even chosen the first song
for the competition.

372
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,000
Listening to this kind of voice

373
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,730
will affect your judgment.

374
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,770
Pull yourself together.

375
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,020
Don't worry, I've found the song.

376
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,580
<i>"The Journey of Music Lovers"
participant's info: Unti</i>

377
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,699
The youngest contestant
in the competition is Unti.

378
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,280
She's one of the trainees
selected by the show.

379
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,139
She has her own fan base,
and she's good at singing and dancing.

380
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,920
Tong Shi Qin and Li Sha
need no introduction.

381
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,100
They're the evergreen singers
of the industry.

382
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,080
Yes, during the rehearsal,

383
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,780
they didn't perform at their best levels.

384
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,380
You're up against some fierce competition.

385
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,100
They're really good at singing.

386
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,740
You have to perform at your best level.

387
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,320
Liang Chen.

388
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,260
I've just listened to your improvised
version of "Unstoppable".

389
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,900
Although it's risky,

390
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,500
rock and roll

391
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,060
is what we lack at the moment.

392
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,740
It's quite fresh.

393
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,780
It's worth a try.

394
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,160
Sure.

395
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,100
You should communicate with the producer
with regards to improvisation.

396
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,740
I'll tell him to work with you.

397
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,040
Thank you, Director Ma.

398
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,000
Thank you, Director Ma.

399
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,720
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for your help.

400
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,740
Ms Liang.

401
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,180
The crew has announced
your choice of song.

402
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,820
The reviews on the internet
are making me so angry.

403
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,600
Let me see.

404
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,220
Chen Chen, see for yourself.

405
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,620
I'm looking at it.

406
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,340
The rock and roll version of Unstoppable.

407
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,420
Liang Chen, please take it seriously.

408
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,860
Liang Chen is such a girl-next-door.

409
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,140
No one thinks highly of me.

410
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,240
Your fans are calling you
a girl-next-door.

411
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,120
You're competing

412
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,920
in a show full of talented singers,

413
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,900
and changing your style
to rock and roll?

414
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,820
Oh no.

415
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,320
My liver hurts.

416
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,540
That's enough. Drop the act.

417
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,980
Think on the bright side.

418
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,940
The reviews can't get any worse.

419
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,700
If I perform as usual,

420
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,540
they'll be pleasantly surprised.

421
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,580
You're so optimistic.

422
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,500
But honestly,

423
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,940
Ms Liang, why did you choose this song?

424
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,420
You've sung this song so many times.

425
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,020
And it never worked out for you.

426
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,140
Now,

427
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,220
I just want to sing
what I want to sing.

428
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,920
Look at this, it's so funny.

429
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,800
Who did it?

430
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,900
Yeah. It's brilliant.

431
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,960
<i>Congratulations on escaping 23 years
of singlehood, Lu Jing.</i>

432
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,600
There he is.

433
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,060
What are you looking at?
Why are you so laughing so happily?

434
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,760
Ms Liang.

435
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,820
Nanze University is indeed
full of talented students.

436
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,920
I wonder who did this.

437
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,640
<i>To celebrate his departure
from singledom,</i>

438
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,860
<i>a fourth year student has
put up a huge banner.</i>

439
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,180
<i>I almost died laughing.</i>

440
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,500
<i>It's my idea.</i>

441
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,900
<i>I put up the banner.</i>

442
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,360
<i>Hello, my name is He Ye.</i>

443
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,940
<i>I typed the words on the banner.</i>

444
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,380
<i>It says "Congratulations on escaping
singlehood, Lu Jing".</i>

445
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,580
<i>That's so funny.</i>

446
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
<i>It's true.</i>

447
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,020
<i>Lu Jing is popular in the school.</i>

448
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,540
<i>Here is his photo.</i>

449
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,320
Everyone is expressing jealousy
for the girlfriend

450
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,860
in the comment section.

451
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,980
Hold on, this guy...

452
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,100
He's your junior!

453
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,100
Ms Liang.

454
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,260
Please don't tell me

455
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,540
his girlfriend

456
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,860
is you?

457
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,820
Hello, Taro.

458
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,000
Hello, Orange.

459
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,500
I saw the banner.

460
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,240
What's going on?

461
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,200
You've made quite a splash.

462
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Should I celebrate your union

463
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,500
with some fireworks?

464
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,740
I just saw it.

465
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,360
Can't youngsters

466
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,100
be a little more discreet
about their relationships?

467
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm busy. That's all for now.

468
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,940
<i>Are you trying to brush me off?</i>

469
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,700
<i>I'm not done talking.</i>

470
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,900
What else do you want to say? Hurry up.

471
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,360
I'm a little hard up lately.

472
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,820
Can I have a million yuan?

473
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,200
Bye.

474
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,180
<i>Don't do that. I'm just kidding.</i>

475
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,480
As the matchmaker who brought
you two together,

476
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,740
is a meal too much to ask for?

477
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,320
Sure, I'll buy you a meal, okay?

478
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,920
-Bye.
-<i>Wait.</i>

479
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,460
When are you going to buy me the meal?

480
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,100
You can't just pay lip service.

481
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,500
I'll buy you a meal tonight, okay?

482
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,080
Bye.

483
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,520
Ms Qing.

484
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,660
There's something I need to tell you.

485
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,200
Say it.

486
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,940
I'm in a relationship.

487
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,940
Is it the young man on the banner?

488
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,840
Your junior?

489
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,480
That's so cool.

490
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,620
As expected of you, Ms Liang.

491
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,060
Ms Qing, will I get into trouble

492
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,780
due to the trending post?

493
00:40:54,704 --> 00:41:10,704
