Lu Jing.

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,380
You're here.

8
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,220
You're early.

9
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,860
I rushed back
knowing that you would be here.

10
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,580
Don't forget about me.

11
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,860
What's going on with you two?

12
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,600
Taro.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,220
Are you done cooking?

14
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,979
Liang Chen has been starving all day.

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,080
Go on.

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,160
Get cooking.

17
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,820
This is my house. I'm not your chef.

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,900
What were you two talking about?

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,120
Jia Yun's birthday is in two days.

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,140
Taro and I were discussing
what to give him.

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,140
When is his birthday?

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,660
It's on the 24th of December.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,780
That's Christmas Eve.

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,660
What a coincidence.

25
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,980
Christmas Eve? I forgot about that.

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
It'll be the first festival

27
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
we celebrate as a couple.

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,760
But I shouldn't skip
Jia Yun's birthday celebration.

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,060
I've promised him.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,500
It's okay. Let me choose the present.

31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,180
Don't you mind?

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,700
We should buy him a present.

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,920
Here.

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,060
Look at this.

35
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,580
How about this?

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,420
That's not suitable.

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,320
Let's browse some more.

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,320
How about a necktie?

39
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,340
I'm sure he has many ties.

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,280
How about cufflinks?

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,880
Not good.

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,740
What should we get him?

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,140
How about this?

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,940
A little tortoise.
It has good connotations.

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,020
It symbolises health and prosperity.

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,340
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,240
It's quite nice. Look, it's so cute.

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,120
Scrap that.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,180
How about this?

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,820
I think it's fine.

51
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,740
What are you doing?

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,860
What is going on?

53
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,140
Can't you tell?

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,380
Any hints?

55
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,180
Is it obvious enough?

56
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,140
My goodness.

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,540
Am I seeing things?

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,380
You two are holding hands!

59
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,660
You're not seeing things.
It's exactly what you think it is.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,740
Don't you have any questions for us?

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,060
What should I ask?

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,300
You could ask how happy we are.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Taro.

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,100
Go and be happy outside.

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,880
What should we do?

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,780
Do you want to watch a movie?

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Sure, it's been a while
since I've watched a movie.

68
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,180
I happen to have a cap in my car.

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,420
Let's go watch a movie.

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280

[No way!]

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,580
I'm a little nervous with all these people
around us.

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,920
You're so cute.

75
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,020
What?

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Nothing.

77
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,220
The movie has started. Pay attention.

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,020
[Why don't I dance for you?]

79
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
[Do you like it?]

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,600
[Yes.]

81
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,980
[Stop crying, okay?]

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,540
[Okay, I'll stop crying.]

83
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,980
Is it funny?

84
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,180
Liu Mao Yan is so cute.

85
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,340
I'm cute too.

86
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,300
Who's complimenting you?

87
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,860
Didn't you say that
I look like Liu Mao Yan?

88
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,580
When you compliment him,
you compliment me.

89
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,860
I'm not complimenting you.

90
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,340
Hello.

91
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,200
[Shan Shan.]

92
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,540
[Can you please persuade Liang Chen]

93
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,460
[to choose my song?]

94
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,260
Ms Ma.

95
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,740
What happened to Liang Chen?

96
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,500
Ms Ma, see what I brought?

97
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,780
Ms Ma, stop ordering takeout.

98
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,660
It's bad for your health.

99
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,500
Here, try the home-cooked meal
I made for you.

100
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,420
It looks much more appetising
than takeout.

101
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
Not only am I angel in person,

102
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,660
I'm also a devil in the kitchen.

103
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,140
Look, the colour is so nice.

104
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,740
Enjoy the food.

105
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,260
You said you wanted
to talk about Liang Chen.

106
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,620
What happened to her?

107
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,680
Eat up.

108
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,340
I'll tell you while you eat.

109
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,080
It's a long story.

110
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,460
Then make it short.

111
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,620
Liang Chen is in love.

112
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,700
The love birds are so in love.

113
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,840
I can't take it anymore.

114
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,520
I skipped dinner
because I was so mad at them.

115
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,140
Then, I came to your place.

116
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,780
Is it Jia Yun?

117
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,620
Jia Yun is not Liang Chen's type.

118
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,240
You know Liang Chen so well, Ms Ma.

119
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,620
It must be because you were her classmate.

120
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,900
Ms Ma, actually...

121
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,940
I've been single for a long time.

122
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,980
Ms Ma.

123
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,160
Be honest to me.

124
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,980
What do you think of my appearance?

125
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,960
-You're quite...
-Quite good looking, right?

126
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,300
What are you trying to say?

127
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,180
Look, Ms Ma.

128
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,180
I'm quite good looking.

129
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,360
I can cook.

130
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,600
I have a successful career.

131
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,400
More importantly,

132
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm single.

133
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,380
I'm a rare gift.

134
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,460
Ms Ma.

135
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,220
Don't you have

136
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,100
any special feelings for me?

137
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,020
Are you done?

138
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,360
If you're done, please leave.

139
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
I...

140
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,440
Please.

141
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,900
Eat more.

142
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,540
If you think that the dishes...

143
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,780
Liu Mao Yan is quite handsome.

144
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,840
I met him once at an event.

145
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,180
He held my skirt and helped me
step down the stage.

146
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,180
I didn't know he was such
a good actor, too.

147
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,280
Do you think...

148
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,140
Are you unhappy?

149
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,220
You didn't enjoy the movie?

150
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,420
I'm not happy.

151
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,780
You complimented another man's looks.

152
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,580
You're good looking too.

153
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,180
He held your skirt and helped
you step down the stage.

154
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,060
But

155
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,780
it's your hand I'm holding right now.

156
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,580
Are you happier now?

157
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,700
I'm happier now.

158
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,180
But I'm still a little sore.

159
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,780
Every other couple will be spending time
together on Christmas Eve,

160
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,740
but I'll be celebrating alone.

161
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,220
It'll be so lonely.

162
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,940
On that day,

163
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,300
I'll leave the party early.

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,920
Don't force yourself.

165
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
It's your friend's birthday party.

166
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,580
How can you leave early?

167
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,480
Fine.

168
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,980
I'll pick you up.

169
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,900
Let me know when you're done.

170
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,140
You don't have to change your schedule
because of me.

171
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,460
No matter how late it will be,
I don't mind waiting for you.

172
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,620
Sleep early. Good night.

173
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,600
Jia Yun.

174
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Happy birthday.

175
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,880
Thank you.

176
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,200
Here's my present for you.

177
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,080
Do you like it?

178
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,400
I like it.

179
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,180
I'm glad that you came.

180
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,280
You don't have to bring a present.

181
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,100
Where are Taro and the gang?

182
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,340
Take a seat.

183
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,640
Sure.

184
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,540
Are you hungry? Let's eat first.

185
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,440
Taro and the others are not here yet.

186
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,780
We shouldn't start without them.

187
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,140
Let's eat while waiting for them.

188
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,680
Waiter.

189
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,580
Are you going on a date?

190
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,500
Of course I have to be with my girlfriend
on Christmas Eve.

191
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,100
Are you serious?

192
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,780
He Ye and Liu'er went out
early in the morning.

193
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,100
God knows when those two fools
got girlfriends.

194
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,320
Now, even you're heading out.

195
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,780
This is why you don't have a girlfriend.

196
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,440
Lu Jing.

197
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,420
You're heartless.

198
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,240
Do you know that
in order to give you a surprise,

199
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,500
I almost got into a fight
with the Student Council?

200
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,540
Surprise?

201
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,660
What surprise?

202
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,200
It's...

203
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,620
Just wait for it.

204
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,700
Fine, go meet with your girlfriend.

205
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,060
Where did he get a girlfriend?

206
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,640
I don't get it.

207
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,260
Why do all of them have girlfriends?

208
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,300
Am I not handsome?

209
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,240
[Sun Bin Yu]

210
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,030
What's up?

211
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,140
[What else?]

212
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,319
It's Christmas Eve.

213
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,720
Of course I have to

214
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,740
discuss something meaningful with you.

215
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,420
For example, how did
you win Liang Chen's heart?

216
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,840
[Do you have any techniques]

217
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,900
you can share with me?

218
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,540
Lu Jing!

219
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
[Have a heart, will you?]

220
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,340
I'm sincerely asking for guidance here.

221
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,840
Aren't you at Ding Jia Yun's
birthday party?

222
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,720
Why are you so free?

223
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,100
I didn't go to the party.

224
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,380
Don't you know that the party
was cancelled at the last minute?

225
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,820
We're almost done eating,
but Taro is not even here yet.

226
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,140
He's not punctual at all.

227
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,140
Let's have some cake.

228
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,460
I don't think they will come.

229
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,780
Please enjoy.

230
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,560
Thank you.

231
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,100
Let me cut the cake for you.

232
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,660
What's wrong? Is it not tasty?

233
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,020
No, it's because

234
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,240
I'm on diet.

235
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,740
That's why I can't eat too much.

236
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,340
It's okay. The cake is custom ordered.

237
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,220
It's low sugar. It's not fattening.

238
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,460
Luckily you came today.

239
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,660
Otherwise,

240
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,100
I'll have to celebrate alone.

241
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,860
The view here is not bad.

242
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,580
It's quite beautiful.

243
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,580
It reminds me of a phrase.

244
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,860
Be it the moon or its reflection,
it's far beyond reach.

245
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,820
[The person in front of me
is the person I desire.]

246
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,980
Liang Chen.

247
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,420
I have something to tell you.

248
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,340
Actually, I've known you for a long time.

249
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,180
It's longer than you think.

250
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,340
I've been observing you in secret.

251
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,540
When I saw you working hard
to pursue a career in music,

252
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,700
I had a strong urge to approach you.

253
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,460
But I was worried that
if I go too close to you,

254
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,700
I may lose you.

255
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,860
I want to tell you something that
I've been keeping inside my heart.

256
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,300
Liang Chen, I love you.

257
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,860
Jia Yun.

258
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,620
I'm grateful for your love.

259
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,380
However,

260
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,340
I'm already in love with someone else.

261
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,100
I respect your choice.

262
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,480
You're here.

263
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,740
I'm here to pick you up.

264
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,920
Let's go.

265
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,600
Let's go.

266
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,620
Look down there.

267
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,600
The company is huge.

268
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,540
Yes. In the future...

269
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,160
Jia Yun.

270
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,640
Let me introduce someone to you.

271
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,180
She's the singer we've just signed.
Her name is Liang Chen.

272
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,080
He's Jia Yun.

273
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,260
Hello, Jia Yun.

274
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,980
Please take care of her.

275
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,960
You're too polite.

276
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

277
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,660
Congratulations.
You've finally moved into a new place.

278
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,860
Ding, let me introduce someone to you.

279
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,820
This is my friend, Liang Chen.

280
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,720
Hello.

281
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,340
Orange, let me introduce someone to you.

282
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,320
This is my good pal, Ding Jia Yun.

283
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,220
We know each other.

284
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,320
Hello.

285
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,100
We're friends.
You don't have to be so polite.

286
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,500
What a coincidence.

287
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,540
Take a seat.

288
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,060
-Do you want any drinks?
-Let me help you.

289
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,020
[We didn't break up back then,
but now we've broken up.]

290
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,560
Liang Chen.

291
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,500
Although

292
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,780
we couldn't have dinner together,

293
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,940
I want to be the first person
to give you an apple.

294
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,660
So, despite the cold weather,

295
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,940
you came to pick me up ahead of time

296
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,460
because of this?

297
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,340
Thank you.

298
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,520
Where do you want to go?

299
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,380
I just want to take a stroll

300
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,180
together with you.

301
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,160
Sure.

302
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,400

I wish

309
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,180
I can sing my favourite song
just like him.

310
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,520
Come with me.

311
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,880
Hello.

312
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,920
How can I help you?

313
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,460
My girlfriend would like to sing a song.

314
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,700
Can we borrow your guitar?

315
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,800
Sure.

316
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,920
Thank you.

Her singing was so beautiful!

335
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,780
Don't you think her voice is familiar?

336
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,880
Is it?

337
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,240
Liang Chen! Doesn't she
look like Liang Chen?

338
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,120
Are you serious?

339
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,460
Liang Chen!

Look, Thousand Years Box Spirit
is singing.

347
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,960
Is it nice?

348
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,740
How do you make it sing?

349
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,780
I gave it a mechanical heart.

350
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,740
Your singing

351
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,580
is awful,

352
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,940
but I really like the present.

353
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,520
Thank you.

354
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,620
Can you thank me in a different way?

355
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,760

364
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,200
Ms Liang, whose singing is that?

365
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,060
He's literally tone-deaf.

366
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,220
His singing is awful.

367
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,580
I think it's quite nice.

368
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,840
It's nice.

369
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,179
Ms Liang.

370
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,730
You haven't even chosen the first song
for the competition.

371
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,000
Listening to this kind of voice

372
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,730
will affect your judgment.

373
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,770
Pull yourself together.

374
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,020
Don't worry, I've found the song.

375
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,580
["The Journey of Music Lovers"
participant's info: Unti]

376
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,699
The youngest contestant
in the competition is Unti.

377
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,280
She's one of the trainees
selected by the show.

378
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,139
She has her own fan base,
and she's good at singing and dancing.

379
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,920
Tong Shi Qin and Li Sha
need no introduction.

380
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,100
They're the evergreen singers
of the industry.

381
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,080
Yes, during the rehearsal,

382
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,780
they didn't perform at their best levels.

383
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,380
You're up against some fierce competition.

384
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,100
They're really good at singing.

385
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,740
You have to perform at your best level.

386
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,320
Liang Chen.

387
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,260
I've just listened to your improvised
version of "Unstoppable".

388
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,900
Although it's risky,

389
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,500
rock and roll

390
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,060
is what we lack at the moment.

391
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,740
It's quite fresh.

392
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,780
It's worth a try.

393
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,160
Sure.

394
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,100
You should communicate with the producer
with regards to improvisation.

395
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,740
I'll tell him to work with you.

396
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,040
Thank you, Director Ma.

397
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,000
Thank you, Director Ma.

398
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,720
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for your help.

399
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,740
Ms Liang.

400
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,180
The crew has announced
your choice of song.

401
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,820
The reviews on the internet
are making me so angry.

402
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,600
Let me see.

403
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,220
Chen Chen, see for yourself.

404
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,620
I'm looking at it.

405
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,340
The rock and roll version of Unstoppable.

406
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,420
Liang Chen, please take it seriously.

407
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,860
Liang Chen is such a girl-next-door.

408
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,140
No one thinks highly of me.

409
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,240
Your fans are calling you
a girl-next-door.

410
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,120
You're competing

411
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,920
in a show full of talented singers,

412
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,900
and changing your style
to rock and roll?

413
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,820
Oh no.

414
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,320
My liver hurts.

415
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,540
That's enough. Drop the act.

416
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,980
Think on the bright side.

417
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,940
The reviews can't get any worse.

418
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,700
If I perform as usual,

419
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,540
they'll be pleasantly surprised.

420
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,580
You're so optimistic.

421
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,500
But honestly,

422
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,940
Ms Liang, why did you choose this song?

423
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,420
You've sung this song so many times.

424
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,020
And it never worked out for you.

425
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,140
Now,

426
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,220
I just want to sing
what I want to sing.

427
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,920
Look at this, it's so funny.

428
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,800
Who did it?

429
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,900
Yeah. It's brilliant.

430
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,960
[Congratulations on escaping 23 years
of singlehood, Lu Jing.]

431
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,600
There he is.

432
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,060
What are you looking at?
Why are you so laughing so happily?

433
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,760
Ms Liang.

434
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,820
Nanze University is indeed
full of talented students.

435
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,920
I wonder who did this.

436
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,640
[To celebrate his departure
from singledom,]

437
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,860
[a fourth year student has
put up a huge banner.]

438
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,180
[I almost died laughing.]

439
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,500
[It's my idea.]

440
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,900
[I put up the banner.]

441
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,360
[Hello, my name is He Ye.]

442
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,940
[I typed the words on the banner.]

443
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,380
[It says "Congratulations on escaping
singlehood, Lu Jing".]

444
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,580
[That's so funny.]

445
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
[It's true.]

446
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,020
[Lu Jing is popular in the school.]

447
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,540
[Here is his photo.]

448
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,320
Everyone is expressing jealousy
for the girlfriend

449
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,860
in the comment section.

450
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,980
Hold on, this guy...

451
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,100
He's your junior!

452
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,100
Ms Liang.

453
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,260
Please don't tell me

454
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,540
his girlfriend

455
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,860
is you?

456
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,820
Hello, Taro.

457
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,000
Hello, Orange.

458
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,500
I saw the banner.

459
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,240
What's going on?

460
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,200
You've made quite a splash.

461
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Should I celebrate your union

462
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,500
with some fireworks?

463
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,740
I just saw it.

464
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,360
Can't youngsters

465
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,100
be a little more discreet
about their relationships?

466
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,780
I'm busy. That's all for now.

467
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,940
[Are you trying to brush me off?]

468
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,700
[I'm not done talking.]

469
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,900
What else do you want to say? Hurry up.

470
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,360
I'm a little hard up lately.

471
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,820
Can I have a million yuan?

472
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,200
Bye.

473
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,180
[Don't do that. I'm just kidding.]

474
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,480
As the matchmaker who brought
you two together,

475
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,740
is a meal too much to ask for?

476
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,320
Sure, I'll buy you a meal, okay?

477
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,920
-Bye.
-[Wait.]

478
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,460
When are you going to buy me the meal?

479
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,100
You can't just pay lip service.

480
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,500
I'll buy you a meal tonight, okay?

481
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,080
Bye.

482
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,520
Ms Qing.

483
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,660
There's something I need to tell you.

484
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,200
Say it.

485
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,940
I'm in a relationship.

486
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,940
Is it the young man on the banner?

487
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,840
Your junior?

488
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,480
That's so cool.

489
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,620
As expected of you, Ms Liang.

490
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,060
Ms Qing, will I get into trouble

491
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,780
due to the trending post?
