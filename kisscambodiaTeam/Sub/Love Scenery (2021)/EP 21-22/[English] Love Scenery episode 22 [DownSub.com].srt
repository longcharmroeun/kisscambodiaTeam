5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,039
Ms Qing.

6
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,160
I need to tell you something.

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,640
Go ahead.

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm in a relationship.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,360
With that young guy on the banner?

10
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,320
Your junior.

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,960
Impressive.

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200
You're indeed amazing, Ms Liang.

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Ms Qing.

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,640
Would this trending topic

15
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
be a problem?

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,720
Show me.

17
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,310
Absurd Campus Anecdote.

18
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,750
For now,

19
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,180
you two should be fine.

20
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,020
But I must remind you.

21
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
What is it?

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
When are you going to
officially introduce him to us?

23
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,079
You gave me a real scare.

24
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Thanks.

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,800
Jing.

26
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,400
Please forgive us.

27
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,320
We only wanted to

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,720
uphold your dignity
in front of Gu Fei Ming.

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,760
Look at that fellow.

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,640
It was like a carnival
when he's in a relationship.

31
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,240
But you?

32
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,600
That's right.

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,720
If we hadn't put you on that banner,

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
you'd have lost out.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,840
Jing.

36
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,960
This time it's no doubt our fault.

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,079
But just think about it.

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,360
Gu Fei Ming is always showing off
in front of you.

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,200
We really can't stand it.

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,070
Hence,

41
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,480
please consider our good intentions.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,520
Forgive us, will you?

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,680
Forgive you?

44
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,560
Unless my girlfriend agrees.

45
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,120
What girlfriend?

46
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,210
You...you're lying to us too?

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,320
Stop it, you guys.
He's still hurt.

48
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,750
Hello?

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
Did you see what happened on the Internet?

50
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,990
Your room-mates are really cute.

51
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,380
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,350
This must have troubled you.

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm fine.

54
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,480
The trending topic
has nothing to do with me.

55
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,160
Oh, right.

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,800
After Sun Bin Yu knew about us,

57
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,160
he insisted that we treat him to dinner.

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,120
When?

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
[Tonight.]

60
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,880
I'll head there now.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,200
Are you done with this nonsense?

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
Yes, yes. We are so done.

63
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,920
Jing, don't be mad anymore.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,240
It doesn't look good on you.

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,960
Your girlfriend won't like it.

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,159
Do you think I'm all about my looks?

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,960
Obviously.

68
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,460
No, no. You're not.

69
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,659
Fine.
I'm letting you off this time.

70
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Jing, you're really like an angel.

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,000
No, not like an angel.

72
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,590
You are an angel.

73
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,830
Jing, you need to head out now.

74
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,400
Don't keep your girlfriend waiting.

75
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
Go now. Quick.

76
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,400
Oh, it's you.

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
Come in.

78
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,910
What's with that tone

79
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,340
and the long face?

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
Orange.

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,040
I'm getting a feeling that you dislike me.

82
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,920
What is it?

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
You regret inviting me over?

84
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,080
Stop overreacting.

85
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,190
Look at that mess.

86
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,950
It doesn't look like
you're having people over.

87
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,830
Lu Jing is not here yet.

88
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,909
Lu Jing?

89
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,030
Friendship takes the backseat now.

90
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,530
Fine.
I'll forgive you this time.

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,720
Since he's not here yet,

92
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,830
let's kill time

93
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,590
with something fun.

94
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,960
What do you suggest?

95
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,430
Let's go down memory lane.

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,560
Take out your classmate records
from university

97
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,880
and graduation photos.

98
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,880
We can look through them.

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
This is what you are here for?

100
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,160
Alright.
I admit I came today

101
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,400
because I wanted to

102
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,040
know a little more about Ms Ma.

103
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,640
Orange, we're close friends, right?

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,300
Don't you want to help

105
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,580
your best friend?

106
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,280
Orange.

107
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,010
Please, Orange.

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,520
Last Christmas eve,

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,040
I waited in front of her house
the whole night.

110
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,360
She didn't come out to see me at all.

111
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,360
I should at least know the reason.

112
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,159
In that case,

113
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,870
we'll just look at the photos.

114
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,750
Strictly no questions, alright?

115
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,240
What's wrong with you?

116
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,630
You invited me over for take-out?

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,540
Yes.

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,990
Forget it.
I'm not eating with you two.

119
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
I'm going home.

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,480
What happened to him?

121
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,520
He wanted to ask about Shan Shan

122
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
and got mad after looking at the photos.

123
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,770
What photos got him so mad?

124
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,560
That kid is just a wannabe.

125
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,960
Maybe he has aged badly.

126
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,280
187 centimetres?

127
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,310
Impossible.

128
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,000
That's even taller
than what I usually write.

129
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,040
You thick face.

130
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,860
Face? That face...

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,350
Fine, fine. He wins.

132
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,120
Wait a minute.

133
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,540
Ms Ma is not superficial.

134
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,470
She definitely likes a talented

135
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,360
and sophisticated man like me.

136
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,070
If that's the case,

137
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,140
I think I won.

138
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,880
Sir, you really don't want
to order some grilled meat?

139
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,400
Don't you see these?

140
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,520
I can't finish them all.

141
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm not ordering food.

142
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
Ms Liang.

143
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,360
At your age now,
you should take the advice given.

144
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,150
Why insist on doing a rock song?

145
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,140
Are you trying to turn this

146
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,900
into your farewell show?

147
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,730
Well.

148
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,100
You've worked so hard to get on stage.

149
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,710
You should appreciate the opportunity.

150
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,990
Focus on your singing.

151
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,480
[Are you nervous?]

152
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,360
[No. Why should I?]

153
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,960
[But I am.]

154
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,160
[It's just a small matter.]

155
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,200
[You've surely been around
to be as cool as a cucumber.]

156
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,680
[Truly my idol.]

157
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm feeling nervous.

158
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,880
This is the first time I see Orange
do a rock song.

159
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,850
Relax.
It's just a small matter.

160
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,920
It's about time to draw lots.

161
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,790
Hope it goes well

162
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,000
so you can perform later.

163
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,740
Don't be the first to go.

164
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,720
What's so bad about going first?

165
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
You tend to get more nervous.

166
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,920
Even if you've done your best,

167
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
you might not

168
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,400
leave a strong impression.

169
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,750
But if you go later,

170
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,350
you'll have time to observe other singers

171
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,800
and give audience
the strongest possible impression.

172
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,160
That's true.

173
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,520
[Challengers, please come to the studio.]

174
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,680
Don't be nervous.

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
Break a leg, Ms Liang.

176
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,000
[Hello, everybody.]

177
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,480
Welcome to the fourth season of

178
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,160
The Journey of Music Lovers.

179
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,600
Welcome, everyone.

180
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
Thank you for your great energy.

181
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,400
Let me tell you.

182
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,960
The format this season is different.

183
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,560
We have two challengers today

184
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,000
so the competition is very fierce.

185
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,840
This first challenger

186
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,560
to come on stage

187
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,720
is an incredible singer.

188
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,720
She's the queen of reinvention.

189
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,760
Five times best female singer

190
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,440
of Top Chinese Music.

191
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,160
Ladies and gentlemen,
Meng Lan Zhi.

192
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,720
Welcome, Lan Zhi.

193
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,580
Alright.
The second challenger to join us

194
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,640
is also equally phenomenal.

195
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,400
Not long ago, she won

196
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,400
the Best Female Artiste
and Artiste of the Year

197
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,960
in the Golden Cicada Awards.

198
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,920
I'm sure

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,440
you already know who she is.

200
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,760
Ladies and gentlemen.
Liang Chen is here.

201
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Welcome, Liang Chen.

202
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,720
-Liang Chen.
-Liang Chen.

203
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,510
Orange takes off to the sky!

204
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,270
We are with you all the way!

205
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,640
Why are you shouting?

206
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,040
You think she can hear you?

207
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
Where did your chill go?

208
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,910
Sit down. Sit down.

209
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,800
Quick.

210
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,440
[We now invite the challengers
to pick an envelope]

211
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,200
[to decide who will go first.]

212
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,840
[But, according to our program rules,]

213
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
[current contenders
have finished drawing lots.]

214
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,800
[We're now left with number one
and number seven.]

215
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,680
[You can now pick an envelope.]

216
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,840
You're hurting me. Let go.

217
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,830
She's just picking lots.
Why are you so anxious?

218
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,880
It will be a disadvantage

219
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,970
if Liang Chen goes first.

220
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,310
Now we ask both challengers

221
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,440
to announce the number they picked.

222
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,760
Wait.

223
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,800
Ms Liang.

224
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,000
Can we change envelopes?

225
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,080
My heart is about to burst.

226
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't even hold
the microphone steadily.

227
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
Change the order?

228
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,400
This has never happened in our show.

229
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,280
Let's check if the Director Team agrees.

230
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,400
Alright.
The Director Team agrees.

231
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,680
Now we have to check with

232
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,040
Liang Chen.
Do you agree to change?

233
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,340
Yes, why not.

234
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,880
Whether going first

235
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,200
or last,

236
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
it's all the same to me.

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,960
Thanks, Ms Liang.

238
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320
Alright.
We invite the challengers

239
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,360
to announce their number.

240
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,880
I ended up with number one

241
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,400
though I was supposed to go last...

242
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,630
But never mind.

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
The world is always unpredictable.

244
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,560
In the next segment,

245
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,020
let's look forward

246
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,300
to the amazing performances
from the two challengers.

247
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,000
That was nerve-wracking.

248
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,240
My Orange has luck on her side.

249
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,640
Your Orange?

250
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
She's mine.

251
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,680
Fine. Whatever.

252
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,440
Unbelievable.

253
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,280
What a narrow mind for a grown man.

254
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,180
Green monster.

255
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,430
Shameful.

256
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,830
♫ From amidst the crowd ♫

257
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,950

Oh, no.

287
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,920
I think she's pretty good.

Move it. Quick.

292
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,720
Stage Design Team, look again.

293
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,720
Is your backdrop secure?

294
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,520
Make no mistake.

295
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,320
Check the lighting.

296
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,240
Yes, show me the lights.

297
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,000
Alright, I got it.

298
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Calm your mind.

299
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
You have put in 200 percent for this.

300
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
Don't let the nerve beat you.

301
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,870
Good luck. I have faith in you.

302
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,840
Good luck, Ms Liang.

303
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,720
Ms Liang.

304
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,080
[Good luck.]

305
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,840
Guo, are we done for today?

306
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,390
Yes, the director has called it a wrap.

307
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,120
[Next up is Liang Chen.]

308
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,830
[I trust many of you share our sentiment.]

309
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,600
[Liang Chen and rock music.]

310
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,720
[Say what? But today, Liang Chen is...]

311
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,840
Orange has really got big guts.

312
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
She's really going to do a rock song?

313
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,520
Has she no fear of failure?

314
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,560
Taro.

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,020
[Orange has my heart. Always with you]

371
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,880
Orange takes off to the sky!

372
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,640
We are with you all the way!

373
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,040
-Liang Chen!
-Liang Chen!

374
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,480
Ms Liang.

375
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,280
That was nerve-racking.

376
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,040
I was way more tensed
than my first time on stage.

377
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,000
Ms Liang, that performance was awesome.

378
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,400
The audience was stunned.

379
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,420
Stop it.

380
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,740
Alright. Let's sit.

381
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,880
But I must say.
That guitar solo was really something.

382
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,210
You're so cool.

383
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,600
Ms Qing, can I have my phone?

384
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,520
Here you go.

385
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,640
You can't part with it for too long.

386
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,800
[Hello?]

387
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,080
Hello? Lu Jing.

388
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,280
How did I do just now?

389
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,600
[Perfect all the way.]

390
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,520
Really?

391
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,250
I was? Alright.

392
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,460
The most nerve-racking moment has come.

393
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,160
Tonight,

394
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,480
between Liang Chen and Meng Lan Zhi,

395
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,600
who will stay and who will go?

396
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,480
Please look at the screen.

397
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,640
-Liang Chen.
-Lan Zhi.

398
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,680
-She won.
-She won!

399
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,600
Liang Chen won.

400
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,800
-She won.
-She won.

401
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,360
She won!

402
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
Congratulations, Liang Chen.

403
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,240
Sadly, tonight,

404
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,440
the singer we have to bid farewell

405
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,440
is Meng Lan Zhi.

406
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,670
You put up a good fight.

407
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,390
You performed well tonight.

408
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,280
I know you're better than me

409
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,240
but I will beat you one day.

410
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:08,890
Keep up the fight.

411
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,040
Life is full of ups and downs.

412
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,880
But there will be no success

413
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,320
without failure.

414
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,000
I'll continue to work hard.

415
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,440
I hope you'll continue to support me.

416
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,200
Will you?

417
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,520
We will.

418
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,760
Thank you, everyone.

419
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,880
I love you.

420
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,120
Let's thank Meng Lan Zhi again

421
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,560
for the great performance today.

422
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,890
Please give a big hand to Meng Lan Zhi.

423
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
-Keep fighting, Lan Zhi.
-Keep fighting.

424
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,320
All the best.

425
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,920
All the best.

426
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,560
We want to congratulate Liang Chen

427
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,720
for advancing to the next round.

428
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,160
The Journey of Music Lovers welcomes you.

429
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,800
Thank you.

430
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,640
-Liang Chen.
-Liang Chen.

431
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
A big hand to Liang Chen.

432
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:16,080
-Liang Chen.
-Liang Chen.

433
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,960
Amazing.

434
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,120
Epic.

435
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,840
I knew she can do it.

436
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,640
She didn't let us down.

437
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,920
Do you think we should

438
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,280
throw her a celebration party?

439
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,080
Of course. It's on me.

440
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Good.

441
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,760
It's on you.

442
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,360
Ms Liang.

443
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,240
You're on the top trending topic now.

444
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,200
Everything is about you
and The Journey.

445
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,320
The most underestimated rock singer
in history.

446
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,160
Liang Chen's massive music makeover.
She is unstoppable.

447
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,560
Liang Chen rocks.
Liang Chen is so cool.

448
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,440
I want to see it.

449
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,440
Liang Chen.

450
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,000
Director Ma.

451
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,480
Your performance was spectacular.

452
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,240
The response was incredible.

453
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,910
I can't wait

454
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,670
to see your next performance.

455
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,560
Thanks, Director Ma.
I'll continue to work hard.

456
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,590
Good luck.

457
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,350
Director Ma.
I am really curious though.

458
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,430
Why did you agree to let me

459
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,950
do a rock song?

460
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,760
Everyone was against it at that time.

461
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,610
Actually, I saw a video

462
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
of you doing a rock song in university.

463
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,630
How did you get that video?

464
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,960
My niece sent it to me.

465
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,920
Ma Shan Shan.
You should know her.

466
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,610
I see.

467
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,250
Get yourself ready for the next show.

468
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,400
See you next week.

469
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,440
Oh, right.

470
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,960
About Shan Shan,

471
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,120
I need a favour from you.

472
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,400
Please go ahead.

473
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,910
All these years,

474
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,980
Shan Shan's temperament has changed.

475
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,170
You were her classmate.

476
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,490
If possible,

477
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,010
please talk to her.

478
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,740
Don't worry. I will.

479
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,400
Good morning.
Time for breakfast.

480
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,800
Can I come in?

481
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,600
Yes, please.

482
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,440
What brings you here out of the blue?

483
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,600
I want to personally
invite you for dinner.

484
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,920
Taro's place. Let's go.

485
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Can I not go?

486
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,040
You can't say no.

487
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,160
It's my celebration party.

488
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,520
How can you miss it?

489
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,400
Finish your breakfast.

490
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,560
We need to go after this.

491
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,400
Alright.

492
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,810
Eat with me.

493
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,810
I've eaten.

494
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,360
Typical female celebrity.

495
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,990
Ms Ma, you are here.

496
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,320
Come in.

497
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,840
Come.

498
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
Have some peanuts.

499
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,880
Ms Ma.

500
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,310
Orange juice, coke, lemon tea.

501
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,990
Chips, cookies, pistachios.

502
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,230
What do you want?

503
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,160
It feels like spring outing in here.

504
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,640
I'm just worried Ms Ma will be bored.

505
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,040
Stop talking.

506
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
Let's watch television.

507
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,480
Look.
What a constructive suggestion.

508
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,800
Ms Ma, what do you want to watch?

509
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,710
Movie?

510
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,480
Drama, romantic, art film

511
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,160
or...

512
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,520
Rerun of yesterday's competition.

513
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,660
Look.
What a constructive suggestion.

514
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,960
You managed to invite Ms Ma over.

515
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,360
I'll let you off today.

516
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Ms Ma.

517
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,840
Please make yourself comfortable.

518
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,320
I'll make you something nice to eat.

519
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,720
[Ding, where are you?]

520
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,880
[Why aren't you here yet?]

521
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,560
[Are you planning to let me
do all the cooking?]

522
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,160
You're here.

523
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,720
Jia Yun.

524
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Your show was a success yesterday.

525
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,200
Congratulations.

526
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,480
Thanks.

527
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,480
Come in.

528
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,760
Long time no see, Jia Yun.

529
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,310
It's so rare to see you these days.

530
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,200
You are...

531
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,100
I'm...

532
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,150
He's my boyfriend, Lu Jing.

533
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,199
Hello, Ms Ma.

534
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,239
I'm Lu Jing.

535
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,389
Hello.

536
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:23,870
Chef Ding, you're finally here.

537
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,590
The kitchen is waiting for you.

538
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,270
Come, come.

539
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,679
Very professional.

540
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,010
Taro, do you have a colander?

541
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,440
You know how to wash vegetables?

542
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,360
If you're not doing anything,

543
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,080
can you not stand in the way?

544
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,520
What? It's my kitchen.

545
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,680
Why can't I stay here?

546
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,800
Shan Shan.

547
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,520
Thanks for showing Director Ma
my old video.

548
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,600
It happened by chance.

549
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,600
Do you want to come watch
my performance live?

550
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,710
No worries.
I'll reserve the tickets.

551
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,870
Just come when you can.

552
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,720
Taro, I need sesame for the braised fish.

553
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,880
Go buy me some.

554
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,400
Sesame in braised fish?

555
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,960
You can take over.
I'll go instead.

556
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,840
No, no.
Alright, fine.

557
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
I'll go.

558
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,720
Wash those vegetables properly.

559
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,440
What's wrong?
Are you going out?

560
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,640
It's all for the perfection

561
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,680
of Chef Ding's culinary masterpiece.

562
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,200
Don't start eating before I'm back.

563
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,850
Just go.

564
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,120
It's you I'm talking to.

565
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,720
Ms Ma is nothing like you.

566
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,440
I'm going now, Ms Ma.

567
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,720
See you later.

568
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,200
If you cook in future,

569
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,120
don't use parsley.

570
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,040
She doesn't like it.

571
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,560
Don't make the food too spicy.

572
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,600
It's not good for her throat.

573
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,480
Thanks.

574
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,200
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of her.

575
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,000
Good.

576
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,040
Coming.

577
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,120
Hello, grandma.

578
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,000
Hello, Sun. Come in.

579
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,760
Hello, grandpa.

580
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,440
It's you.

581
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,480
You're reading?

582
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,000
Grandma, do you have white sesame?

583
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,920
I need to borrow some.

584
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
Yes, I have.
Wait here. I'll get it for you.

585
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,640
Great.

586
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,560
Sun.

587
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,280
Is Jing at your place again?

588
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,400
Yes, he is.

589
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,560
He always troubles you.

590
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,320
No, it's fine.

591
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,000
I happen to be free today

592
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,030
so I invited some friends over.

593
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,090
-Is that so?
-Here you go, Sun.

594
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,360
-Thanks, grandma.
-You're welcome.

595
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,240
Oh, right.

596
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,000
Your granddaughter-in-law is at my place.

597
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,600
What? What did you say?

598
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,130
Granddaughter-in-law.

599
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,200
The wife of your grandson.

600
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,320
She's at my place for dinner.

601
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,540
Really?

602
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,160
You're not kidding me?

603
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,160
No, I'm not.

604
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,080
Didn't Lu Jing tell you?

605
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,150
He told us he has a girlfriend

606
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,080
but we thought he was joking.

607
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,920
What?

608
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,920
It's for real this time.

609
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,200
That boy...

610
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,030
He finally came to his senses.

611
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,040
I've been worried about him for so long.

612
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,520
Everybody already has a girlfriend.

613
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,680
But that boy

614
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
is just a nerd.

615
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,360
All he does is studying and reading.

616
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,160
This is good news.

617
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,840
He has a girlfriend now.

618
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,680
Yes, yes.

619
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,560
I need to get back to my friends now.

620
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,840
Alright, go on.

621
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,600
Alright. Bye, grandpa.

622
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,400
-Bye, grandma.
-Bye.

623
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,280
-Bye.
-Alright, bye.

624
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,680
Old man, our grandson has a girlfriend.

625
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,840
Did you hear that?

626
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,400
What's the use of hearing about it?

627
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,880
Go change.
We'll go have a look.

628
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,200
Right. Let's go.
