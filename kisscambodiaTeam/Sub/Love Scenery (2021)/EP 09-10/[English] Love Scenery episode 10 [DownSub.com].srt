00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,840
Where is she?

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,440
She went offline.

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,479
Let it go, sir.

8
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,479
You have to forgive her, of course.

9
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
Get lost.

10
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
[Hello, Lu Jing.]

11
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,680
[Are you still online?]

12
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
[Hello?]

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
[Lu Jing.]

14
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,240
He's there.

15
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
But why isn't he talking?

16
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,680
Are you there, Lu Jing?

17
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,760

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,840
Hi, I've entered.

26
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,160
I finally get to set off the fireworks!

27
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,120
Awesome! Cool!

28
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
Junior?

29
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,160
I graduated from Nanze University too.

30
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,640
[Are you from the 2013 batch?]

31
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,200
How did you know that?

32
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,800
[Because the university showed]

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,880
[a shockingly low passing score
that year.]

Lu Jing.

40
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,680
Lu Jing.

41
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,960
Are you stupefied?

42
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
[Can you hear me, Lu Jing?]

43
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,000
[Are you there?]

44
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,520
I am.

45
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
What happened just now?

46
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Nothing.

47
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,360
I got disconnected.

48
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,240
[Looks like he isn't mad.]

49
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,159
Then,

50
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,640
let's go online?

51
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Okay.

52

What's wrong with you?

53
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,280
Lu Jing.

54
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,120
Who said that he wouldn't
guide her anymore yesterday?

55
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,720
Are you alright, Lu Jing?

56
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,360
Put it on.

57
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,800
You don't want this helmet anymore?

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,680
It's not really useful on me.

59
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,760
You put it on.

60
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Okay.

61
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,800
Do you still want the backpack?

62
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,480
Yes, of course. Give it to me.

63
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
I'll use it now.

64
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,360
Watch out. There are grenades...

65
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,800
[Are you alright?]

66
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,400
Why did you blow yourself up

67
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,360
like I did?

68
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Let's go again.

69
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,280
Look.

70
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,600
Why aren't you opening the boxes?

71
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
Okay.

72
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
Don't you want the bullets?

73
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,400
I do.

74
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,920
The secret hole has been sealed.

75
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,720
Has the system recovered?

76
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,760
I...

77
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,960
Lu Jing, what's wrong?

78
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,440
Lu Jing.

79
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,680
Lu Jing!

80
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,960
Sorry, I spaced out.

81
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,040
What is it?

82
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,840
I have something else to do.
I'm getting offline.

83
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,080
Let's play again next time.

84
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,070
[Hold on.]

85
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
What is it?

86
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Well...

87
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,480
Who did you

88
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,840
team up with last night?

89
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
A friend of mine.

90
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,360
I couldn't reject him.

91
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,620
I'm sorry I stood you up.

92
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,840
It's okay.

93
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm leaving, then.

94
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,560
Okay.

95
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,840
Bye.

96
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,880
Stop smiling. Time to eat.

97
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,880
Ms Liang, get changed.

98
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,040
We need to go now.

99
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,640
Coming.

100
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,320
You got poisoned?

101
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,560
I think

102
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,200
that I'm blind.

103
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Don't you think you're also deaf?

104
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,920
Little Deaf and Blind.

105
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,760
I told you.

106
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,680
Follow me and you'll find the exit.

107
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,310
Bad players like you

108
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,440
are usually lucky.

109
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,560
Get down here.

110
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
No, it's too high.

111
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,760
Get down or I'll shoot.

112
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,640
Check for me. I can't see it.

113
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,560
Okay.

114
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,470
What was that for?

115
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,920
Why did you do that?

116
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,080
-Tidy yourself up.
-What is it?

117
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
Didn't you say to check on it?

118
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,720
I recorded a video.

119
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,640
Do you want to watch it?

120
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,320
What video is that?

121
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,080
[Help!]

122
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,680
I'm saving your zig-zag runs.

123
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,240
[What have I done to Liang Chen?]

124
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
[I'm done for.]

125
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,360
I think you really are sick, Lu Jing.

126
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,520
Let me take you to the hospital.

127
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,520
When is the anniversary celebration again?

128
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,200
It's on Saturday.

129
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Who will present the bouquet with Qi Qi?

130
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,560
Didn't you reject them?

131
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,160
Tell me. Who did they choose in the end?

132
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,400
Gu Fei Ming.

133
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
Shoot.

134
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,400
What now?

135
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
Gu Fei Ming?

136
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,440
What is it?

137
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,720
Now you regret it?

138
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,510
[Xiao Huan, Lu Jing]

139
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,250
[seems to be really good at the game.]

140
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,160
They're professionals, after all.

141
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,320
Xiao Huan,

142
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,000
do you want to do the task with me?

143
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,840
No.

144
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
The tasks in that game are too difficult.

145
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,350
Okay. I'll do it myself.

146
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,390
[Beautiful Soul]

147
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,440
This won't do.

148
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,120
Get someone to teach you.

149
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,440
I wanted to ask Lu Jing to guide me.

150
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,640
But he's hiding from me.

151
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,520
What about Gu Fei Ming?

152
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,770
He...

153
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,360
Forget it. Not him.

154
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,080
Hurry. Steady.

155
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,000
You can't face him head on.

156
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,920
Go right.

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,800
Someone's on the left.

158
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
-Right.
-Left.

159
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,870
-Right.
-Left.

160
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,520
-Right.
-Shut up.

161
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
-Right.
-Left.

162
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,680
-Right.
-Left.

163
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,930
-Right.
-Left.

164
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,690
-Right.
-I said left.

165
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,370
-Right.
-You're dying. Go left.

166
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,560
Left.

167
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
-Left.
-Right.

168
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,400
-Left.
-Right.

169
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,160
What's wrong with you?

170
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,220
You got pregnant from completing a task?

171
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,840
I... I have 3D sickness.

172
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,030
3D sickness?

173
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,680
3D sickness.

174
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,370
What's wrong, Qi Qi?

175
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,650
Beautiful Soul is driving me crazy.

176
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,080
Its tasks are so difficult.

177
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,200
Yeah.

178
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,320
What's so interesting about those tasks?

179
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,720
Stupid program.

180
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,000
It wasted my youth and money.

181
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
You agree with me?

182
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,800
Do you know how to play the game?

183
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,360
I...

184
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,200
I...

185
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,400
I do.

186
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,400
Can you guide me?

187
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,640
No?

188
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
No problem.

189
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,880
Thanks.

190
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
It feels like a celebration already.

191
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,520
Hold them for me.
I have something to attend to.

192
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,830
Where are you going?

193
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,880
Looking for Gu Fei Ming.

194
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
Excuse me.

195
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,960
Are you here for Gu Fei Ming?

196
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,760
-Yes. Is he in his room?
-Yes.

197
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,640
Wait here.

198
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,320
Stay here. Wait for me.

199
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,040
Gu Fei Ming!

200
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,230
Gu Fei Ming!

201
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,080
Lu Jing is looking for you.

202
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,920
Gu Fei Ming.

203
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,040
Gu Fei Ming.

204
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,200
Lu Jing is looking for you.

205
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
Come out here, Gu Fei Ming!

206
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,760
Lu Jing is here for you.

207
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Gu Fei Ming, come out.

208
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Lu Jing is looking for you.

209
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,200
Who?

210
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Lu Jing.

211
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,040
How do I look?

212
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,160
Like Daniel Wu of Nanze University.

213
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,680
Go, go, go.

214
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,080
Tell me. What is it?

215
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,040
Can we talk somewhere else?

216
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,360
No.

217
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,080
Just settle it here.

218
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,520
Fine. I won't beat around the bush.

219
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,600
I was asked to present flowers

220
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,320
to Liang Chen on the celebration concert.

221
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,560
But I rejected due to personal reasons.

222
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,560
Now I regret it.
So I wanted to discuss with you.

223
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,360
Not a chance.

224
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,710
Who do you think you are?

225
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,960
You rejected when you feel like it,

226
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,920
and now I have to quit
because you changed your mind?

227
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm not that selfish.

228
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,160
That's why I came here to talk.

229
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,720
No way.

230
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,240
I need to ask my girlfriend's opinion.

231
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
But you don't have a girlfriend.

232
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,560
Yeah.
That's why there's no room for discussion.

233
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,360
There's a change in tomorrow's plan.

234
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,840
Meeting at office at 10 a.m.

235
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,550
Fixing the details
of live streaming at two.

236
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
Recording starts at 7.30 p.m.

237
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,600
Ms Qing, are you going to wear me off?

238
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,720
Don't worry. Your hair is still there.

239
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,150
The university's anniversary celebration
is not in the schedule?

240
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
It's on Saturday.

241
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,780
And the rehearsal?

242
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,120
There's no time for that.

243
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,120
We're not joining.

244
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,760
He Ye. Why did you keep this?

245
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,120
It stinks. Smell it.

246
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,360
Why won't you move?

247
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,480
Don't tell me you're broken.

248
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,480
Friendly reminder.

249
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,080
Lu Jing is on his way back.

250
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,840
All the best, guys.

251
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,320
Lu Xiu.

252
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,600
Lu Xiu, wake up.

253
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,760
Wake up, Lu Xiu.

254
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,280
Lu Jing is back.

255
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,960
Don't look.

256
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,560
Don't you know it needs charging?

257
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,240
Cha...charging?

258
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,680
Lu Jing, look at you.

259
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
Did you fail?

260
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,560
When did you buy this?

261
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,760
Why don't I know about it?

262
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,160
Which colour suits my mum best?

263
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,040
Blue. It looks elegant.

264
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,880
But my mum is a young girl at heart.

265
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,840
Orange looks shallow.

266
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,200
It's not for a mature, middle-aged lady.

267
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,040
I'll take this.

268
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,480
Please come with me.

269
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,160
Lu Jing.

270
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,960
Who told me that orange looks shallow?

271
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,720
You're taking advantage
of my adoration for you.

272
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,360
Jing, please tell me.

273
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,000
How are things going on
between you and Box Spirit?

274
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,280
What Box Spirit?

275
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,000
What's going on?

276
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,120
Something fishy?

277
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,360
Are you curious?

278
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,760
Let me tell you the story

279
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
of Lu Jing's cyber love.

280
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,160
It was really intense.

281
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,280
And it started
before we went to Guangzhou.

282
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,440
[Are you joining the rehearsal
tomorrow night?]

283
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,680
[Are you going?]

284
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,050
[Of course I am.]

285
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,290
[I'll be there too.]

286
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,430
Look at that lewd smile.

287
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,920
Did Gu Fei Ming agree to step down?

288
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,400
No.

289
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,760
Why were you smiling then?

290
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,640
Do you think I can't handle Gu Fei Ming?

291
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,680
Ms Liang, time to go.

292
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,080
Come on.

293
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,640
Ms Liang,
you won't stop studying the schedule.

294
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,240
Is something wrong?

295
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,640
Adjust the time of recording
to 7 a.m. tomorrow.

296
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Then we'll have to leave before dawn.

297
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,040
I reckon today's filming
won't end before midnight.

298
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,240
Don't you need to sleep?

299
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,560
Just do as I say.

300
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,760
Thanks.

301
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,800
[Will I see Lu Jing tomorrow?]

302
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,920
Xiao Ming.

303
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,480
Was this the book?

304
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,760
I'll borrow it for you.

305
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
No. I can do that myself.

306
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,320
Tally these up.

307
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,120
Hi. It's RMB55.

308
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,560
What else do you want? I'll buy for you.

309
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,640
Never mind.

310
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,520
I can afford it.

311
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,750
Here you go. You didn't have lunch.

312
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,360
I'm too tired to eat.

313
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,240
No thanks.

314
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,440
That won't do.

315
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,800
At least drink the soup.

316
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,440
Or you can't last till tonight.

317
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,480
You're right.

318
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,640
I don't need the spoon.

319
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,520
Let's do the task later.

320
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,480
Oh, no.

321
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,960
I have a basketball match.

322
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,060
You...

323
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,760
Didn't you say you were free?

324
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,240
Sorry. I forgot.

325
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,800
Or you don't want to guide me?

326
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Nothing like that.

327
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,720
Next time. When I'm free,

328
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,920
I'll guide you.

329
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,440
Let's go.

330
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,000
Hurry.

331
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,520
It must start with high spirits.

332
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
Get everyone in the mood.

333
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,700
[70th anniversary of Nanze University]

334
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,520
-Okay.
-Practise more, okay?

335
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,800
Come on. Turn on the stage lights.

336
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,880
Quick.

337
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,550
Hurry up and lay the carpet.

338
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,280
The two flowers,

339
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,560
place them at the centre of the table.

340
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,750
Where are the three female dancers?

341
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,080
Come up and try. Quick.

342
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,680
Hurry. Find your positions.

343
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,240
It's your turn next.

344
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,600
Get ready.

345
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
You're next after them.

346
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,880
Get ready.

347
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,760
Okay.

348
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,880
Yes. Okay.

349
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,920
What are you doing here, non-staff?

350
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm looking for Qi Qi.

351
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,560
Senior.

352
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,560
Have a seat, senior.

353
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,880
Do you have the clothes
for the celebration ready?

354
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,840
Of course.

355
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,760
This is a chance
to get close to Liang Chen.

356
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,280
I'll cherish it.

357
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,480
Shouldn't I?

358
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,280
Yeah. I don't have the chance for that.

359
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,560
I can only complete tasks
and set off fireworks.

360
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,640
Let's form a team next time, senior.

361
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,440
I heard you're a very good player.

362
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,960
Actually, I'm not as good as Gu Fei Ming.

363
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
Really?

364
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,210
I invited him today.

365
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,490
But he said he had no free time.

366
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,880
I have free time.

367
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,810
I was just busy.

368
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,790
Since we're free after the rehearsal,

369
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,680
let's do it.

370
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,080
Can you make it?

371
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,960
Can you?

372
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,830
S...Sure.

373
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,400
Get your hand off me.

374
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,800
Qi Qi.

375
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,480
Hold this for me.

376
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,240
Let's go to the toilet.

377
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,760
When did they become so close?

378
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
How unscrupulous.

379
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,400
What should I do tonight?

380
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,760
Let's talk it through.

381
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,640
No way.

382
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,280
I won't agree no matter what.

383
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,640
Liu, to Nanze University. Go faster.

384
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,560
Okay.

385
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,960
You were rushing

386
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,120
just so you can join the rehearsal?

387
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,880
Do I look good?

388
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,640
Yes.

389
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,280
It's just a rehearsal.

390
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,240
Aren't you taking it too seriously?

391
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,070
I have to be serious
even during rehearsal.

392
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,400
I can't let the boys...

393
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,720
And the girls think badly of me.

394
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,440
Lu Jing.

395
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,120
Don't forget your promise.

396
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,760
No worries.

397
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,440
It means more to me than you.

398
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,360
Look, Liang Chen is here!

399
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,160
Liang Chen?

400
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,800
Liang Chen is here for the rehearsal?

401
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,920
Where is she?

402
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,640
Liang Chen!

403
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,670
It's her in person.

404
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,240
Make way, please.

405
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,400
Come on in.

406
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,950
Given the university's poor condition,

407
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,340
we only prepared a room for you to rest.

408
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,280
Liang, please make do with it.

409
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,040
This is great. Thank you.

410
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,040
Okay. Get some rest.

411
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,320
Come to me if you need something.

412
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
Okay. Thanks.

413
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,120
No problem.

414
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,200
Let me through.

415
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,080
What are you doing?

416
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,600
Liang Chen is really pretty.

417
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,440
I want to get her autograph.

418
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,560
[I wonder if Lu Jing is here.]

419
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,920
I'm closing the door, guys.

420
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,120
Bye.

421
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,000
Can we take a photo together?

422
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,360
Where's my lipstick?

423
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,320
Hurry.

424
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,190
Didn't you just apply lipstick
before entering the campus?

425
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,440
That was less than ten minutes ago. Why...

426
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,270
Bright red seems too aggressive.

427
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,760
This colour makes me look old.

428
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Is this colour suitable for this season?

429
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,560
No.

430
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,840
You look fine
with that tangerine you've applied.

431
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,480
Like an energetic young girl.

432
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,030
Is that true?

433
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,840
It seems like it.

434
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,159
Okay.

435
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,040
But does it match my clothes?

436
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,760
I'm wearing punk style today.

437
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,880
Look.

438
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,640
Do my shoes match my make-up?

439
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,510
You look extremely beautiful.

440
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,560
You couldn't be prettier.

441
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,360
Really?

442
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,840
Why am I so pretty?

443
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,400
[Where are you?]

444
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,800
Liang Chen.

445
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,960
Come on. Calm down.

446
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,120
Sit down.

447
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Liang Chen.

448
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,640
-She's so pretty.
-She's so skinny.

449
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,280
Enough. Quiet.

450
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,440
Get back to work.

451
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,920
Go now. Get back to work.

452
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,560
-Mr Luo.
-Mr Luo.

453
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,880
Let me introduce.

454
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,750
Liang Chen, the pride
of Nanze University.

455
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,850
I'm sure you guys know her.

456
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,920
They are the masters of ceremony
for the concert.

457
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,360
You may discuss the rundown

458
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,270
of the concert.

459
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,360
Hi.

460
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,320
[Where are you?]

461
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,200
A dancing performance first.

462
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,560
The flow is pretty simple.

463
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,960
Our staff will guide you.

464
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,840
Don't worry.

465
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,020
Thanks.

466
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,920
Ms Liang, you have a message.

467
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
I'm at the small hall.

468
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,000
She's on her phone.

469
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,680
So, celebrities play on their phones too?

470
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,280
She also publishes posts
and watches live stream videos.

471
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,680
As if you've seen that.

472
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,880
Gu Fei Ming, lend me a hand.

473
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,440
Sure.

474
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,360
[Which part of the hall?]

475
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,280
[Are you here?]

476
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,160
[Do you need me to pick you up?]

477
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,360
[No. I'm not yet there.]

478
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,280
[Liar.]

479
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,800
[Okay. I'm at the registration counter
at the entrance.]

480
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,950
Ke Ke.

481
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,560
Thanks. We'll leave now. Bye.

482
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,440
Bye.

483
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,400
Ms Liang, what are you doing?

484
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,840
Liang Chen, you're my idol.

485
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,040
I like you very much.

486
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,240
Thanks. Let's work hard together.

487
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,080
Can I have your autograph?

488
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,520
-Sure.
-Really?

489
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,520
Thanks.

490
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,580
Ms Liang,
Mr Luo wants us on the stage.

491
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,280
Bye.

492
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,100
She's really pretty.

493
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,640
Even prettier than on television.

494
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,200
What a wonderful voice.

495
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,680
She's pretty and she can sing.

496
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,000
She is perfect.

497
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,920
But she's still a bad gamer.

498
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,880
I have stomachache.

499
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,800
Your stomach aches all of a sudden?

500
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,400
Are you alright?

501
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,760
It hurts.

502
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,640
I need to go to the hospital.

503
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,590
I'll leave it to you.

504
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,340
Gu Fei Ming!

505
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,000
You... What is he doing?

506
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,880
Seriously.

507
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,740
Can I take his place, Mr Luo?

508
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,320
Sure.

509
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,350
You go.

510
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,550
You two, get ready.

511
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,540
It's your turn soon.

512
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,000
Go and get ready.

513
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,200
Let's go.

514
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,640
Lu Jing,
is it okay if you give her the flower

515
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,680
and I give her the gift?
