This is not about the competition.

According to the training graph,

102
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,520
I can see that your model is overfitted.

103
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,200
You should reduce
the number of iterations.

104
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,840

In the past year,

You can't go in.

We have tickets and we can't go in?

148
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
No. There's no space left.

149
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,320
My girlfriend is in there.

150
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,960
If I don't go in and keep her company,

151
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,520
she will break up with me.

152
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,400
All right, go in.

153
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,000

154
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,960

155
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,280
Unfortunately, he is not here.

156
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,240
Next, we'll have Liang Chen

157
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,120
draw a new number.

158
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,400
Number 88.

159
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,640
Where is number 88?

160
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
It's me. It's me.

161
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,560
Way to go, Lu Jing.

162
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,160
That was some quick thinking.

163
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,160
Quickly come to the stage.

164
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
How do you feel now?

165
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,000
[Happy Birthday.]

166
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,800
I'm very excited.

167
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm thankful that
number 187 didn't come.

168
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,680
Number 187?

169
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,560
Aren't you number 187?

170
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
You guys have met
before on the airplane.

171
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,560
She was in the business class and
you were in the economy class.

172
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,360
And now, you've missed the chance
to be on stage with her.

173
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,200
Seems like you two aren't fated
to be together.

174
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,600
Alright, I know everyone

175
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,520

It's time for today's
question and answer session.

179

Anyone?

183
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840

184

188
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
do you normally have time
to watch live broadcasts?

189
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
I watch it sometimes.

190
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,960
I watch it too.

191
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,160
Okay, thank you. Please sit down.

192
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,800
Anyone else?

193
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,800
Me, me.

194
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,360
Me, me.

195
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,400
Over here. Me, me.

196
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Okay, the last row.

197
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,920
The one on the left

198
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,640
of the energetic gentleman.

199
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,940
Yes, you.

200
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,060
May I ask

201
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,360
who your favourite broadcaster is?

202
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,820
Hello.

203
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,920
Can you hear me?

204
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,080
[I hear you.]

205
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,880
[His voice is quite nice.]

206
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,480
Excuse me, is this earring yours?

207
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,960
What's wrong?

208
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,040
It's just that he sounds familiar.

209
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
Can you repeat yourself?

210
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

211
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,040
I'd like to know

212
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
who your favourite broadcaster is?

213
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,480
I like

214
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,640
Herman, the broadcaster
of Beautiful Soul.

215
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,510
She likes you! She likes you!

216
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,440
Who do you usually play with?

217
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm sorry, fan.

218
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Next.

219
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,160
I...

220
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,720
She plays with me.

221
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,480
Hello, everyone. I'm Ding Jia Yun.

222
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm Liang Chen's best friend.

223
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
Chen Chen, happy birthday.

224
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,440
Thank you, Jia Yun.

225
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,720
What a surprise.

226
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,680
I never thought you would come.

227
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,480
What a surprise!
I never thought Jia Yun would come.

228
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,680
Jia Yun, just now you said

229
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,360
you play Beautiful Soul
with Liang Chen.

230
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,520
What's that about?

231
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,080
Actually, we play it
together with our friends.

232
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
Liang Chen plays well.

233
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,800
And she always gives us surprises.

234
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,840
No. I'm just a dabbler.

235
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,560
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

236
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,680
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

237
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,000
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

238
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,240
♫ Happy birthday to you! ♫

239
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,840
Let's wish Liang Chen

240
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
a happy birthday!

241
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,760
Happy Birthday!

242
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,160
Lu Jing, what's wrong with you?

243
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
The birthday party isn't over yet.

244
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,560
Where are you going?

245
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
It's pointless. I'm leaving.

246
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,040
All right.

247
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,880
Ke Ke, give me my smartphone.

248
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,960
What are you looking at?

249
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,080
I just remembered

250
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,680
I have something to do.

251
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,040
[Happy birthday.]

252
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,080
[What does it mean?]

253
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
[Did he find out it's me?]

254
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,320
[Sorry, it's my mistake.]

255
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,360
[Lucky me.]

256
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,640
[I thought today is your birthday.]

257
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
[I guess not.]

258
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
[I can't lie to him.]

259
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,600
[But I can't let him know either.]

260
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,800
[I was watching the live broadcast of
Liang Chen's birthday party today.]

261
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,120
[She said she likes you.]

262
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,960
[Well? Are you happy?]

263
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,440
[Really? I like myself too.]

264
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,080
Would it kill you to
express your happiness?

265
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,800
[When will you teach me
how to play hopscotch?]

266
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,080
[I'm free tonight.]

267
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,900
[See you tonight.]

268
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,840
Lu Jing, wait for me.

269
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,960
Luckily, Jia Yun came just in time

270
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,160
to rescue you.

271
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,160
Or else I'm not sure

272
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,520
how I could handle the situation just now.

273
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,320
It was an off-the-cuff rescue.

274
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
You don't mind, do you?

275
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,400
Of course not.

276
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,380
Thank you.

277
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,480
Let's have dinner tonight

278
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,720
to celebrate your birthday.

279
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,360
Tonight?

280
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,760
Everyone is here

281
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,320
and there's no work
arrangement tonight.

282
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,300
I...

283
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,300
All right.

284
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,240
Where are you going again?

285
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,380
The cybercafe.

286
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,240
You haven't eaten yet.

287
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,800
I'm not hungry. Help yourself.

288
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,960
Wait for me!

289
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,400
Thank you.

290
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,480
The birthday party is a success.

291
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Not bad.

292
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,320
Why is the signal so bad here?

293
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,160
Here's your birthday present.

294
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,080
Thank you, Jia Yun.

295
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,700
You're welcome.

296
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,520
It's too much. I can't accept it.

297
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,800
How can you not
accept a birthday present?

298
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,780
Right?

299
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,660
Take it.

300
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,620
Thank you.

301
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,360
Ms Liang, let me take a look.

302
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,720
I didn't see it just now.

303
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,480
It's gorgeous.

304
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,200
Ms Liang, quickly try it on.

305
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,920
Let me put it on for you.

306
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,400
Thank you, Jia Yun.

307
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,380
You're welcome.

308
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,920
[Zero Gravity Cybercafe]

309
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,120
How many hours?

310
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Same as him.

311
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,480
Would you like to apply for a card?
There's a discount for top-ups.

312
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,960
WeChat or Alipay?

313
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,000
Alipay.

314
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,980
Scan here.

315
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,620
Done.

316
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,640
You sit over there.

317
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,400
The power button is on the desktop.

318
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,200
Jing,

319
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,240
you think I didn't know
how to boot up the computer?

320
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,800
Lu Jing,

321
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,560
you've been holding your phone and
acting strange the whole night.

322
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,760
What exactly are you doing?

323
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,960
This is the most tortuous
conversation in the world.

324
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,200
I'm right in front of you,

325
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
yet you're texting me on WeChat.

326
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,440
Do you really have to
do it through the satellite?

327
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,280
The bars are full and
the phone is working.

328
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,520
Did something happen to her?

329
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,780
She?

330
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,960
Who is she?

331
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,160
So you went without food all night

332
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,680
because of Box Spirit?

333
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,060
Sir.

334
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,060
Thank you.

335
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,780
[Where are you?]

336
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,820
[Are you all right?]

337
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,720
This is sugar free. Give it a try.

338
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,060
Okay.

339
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,920
Let's wish Chen Chen a happy birthday.

340
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,900
Okay.

341
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,160
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

342
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,140
Thank you.

343
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,640
I'll study hard

344
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,600
and serve our motherland.

345
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,800
[I'm sorry. I'm in the
middle of something.]

346
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,400
[I might not be able to
go online tonight.]

347
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,080
[I'm sorry. I'm in the
middle of something.]

348
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,680
[I might not be able to
go online tonight.]

349
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,600
Let's watch it again.

350
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,160
I've already cried once.

351
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,840
Then cry again with me.

352
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,680
I want to have another piece.

353
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,520
[Finally, I finished my work.]

354
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,760
[Are you still on tonight?]

355
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,680
Have you been playing
Beautiful Soul recently?

356
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,600
But I'm still terrible at it.

357
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,920
My boss is good at it.

358
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,720
Why don't we team up tonight?

359
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,760
Do you have something on tonight?

360
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,280
Not for the time being.

361
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,560
Then let's play.

362
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,200
Jia Yun,

363
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,000
I might drag you down.

364
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,880
Never mind, I'm here for you.

365
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,120
Shall we watch it again?

366
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,640
Look at my eyes.

367
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
I can't watch any more of it.

368
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,200
[Finally, I finished my work.]

369
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,440
[Are you still on tonight?]

370
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
[Are you busy?]

371
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,800
[Then I'll team up with my friend.]

372
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,160
So she is playing with that man.

373
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,000
What's wrong with you?

374
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,360
Nothing.

375
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,920
Isn't this the Box Spirit
that you brought back last time?

376
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,680
Why didn't you play with her?

377
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,200
I don't feel like playing today.

378
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,480
If I carry her again,

379
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,080
I'll be a dog.

380
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,560
It's late.

381
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,080
I'm going back.

382
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,480
Get some rest.

383
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,780
Okay.

384
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,480
[I saw you online.]

385
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,720
[You saw wrong. I've logged off.]

386
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
I knew it. He's angry.

387
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
Good. That's it.

388
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,680
The boy on the left, be happier.

389
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,200
Smile.

390
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,000
Lu Jing, we're at an award ceremony,

391
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,040
not a funeral.

392
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,360
A big smile, please.

393
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,320
Give me a smile!

394
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,240
Ready and

395
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,520
three, two, one.

396
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,480
Dear Ke Ke,

397
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,240
I want to ask you a serious question.

398
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,200
Okay, go ahead.

399
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,600
Are there any unique items

400
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,400
in Beautiful Soul recently?

401
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,880
The ones that will be seen
as generous gifts?

402
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,600
Are you going to send it to

403
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,320
the guy you reported your schedule to?

404
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,020
Yes.

405
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,680
Ms Liang,

406
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,440
why should you go to such lengths
for an internet friend?

407
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,040
You don't even know

408
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,920
if he's tall or short or slim or fat.

409
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,120
I'm really worried
about your love life.

410
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,600
Didn't you say that

411
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,600
he'd always be two metres tall
in your heart?

412
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,280
What?

413
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,240
It's Herman. You said it yourself.

414
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,600
Herman? Are you lying to me?

415
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,400
It's a lie.

416
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,560
You're actually playing with Herman?

417
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
Why didn't you tell me?

418
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,040
You didn't ask.

419
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,560
I know.

420
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,160
There's this awesome backpack
that was launched recently.

421
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,440
It's very rare

422
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,280
and very suitable as a gift.

423
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,480
Okay, I'll go find it.

424
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,320
What happened to you and Box Spirit?

425
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,720
She found someone else to carry her.

426
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,820
A man?

427
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,360
Maybe he is just a friend.

428
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,560
Is my technique not good enough

429
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,440
or am I not quick enough?

430
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,640
Am I not enough for her?

431
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,520
I get it.

432
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,240
You're jealous.

433
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,720
I didn't know you'd be
this childish when you're jealous.

434
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,760
No, you're imagining it.

435
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,360
Wait for me!

436
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,240
Lu Jing, you...

437
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,240
You're really childish!

438
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,880
Just say it.

439
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,000
Ms Liang, your skill...

440
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,040
You're very persistent.

441
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,350
It's too hard.

442
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,909
Why don't you just buy one?

443
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,429
Buy?

444
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,080
Is it for sale?

445
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,480
Why didn't you say so?

446
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,679
You didn't ask me.

447
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,040
What's with the long face?

448
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,420
Lu Jing.

449
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,830
[Zero Gravity Cybercafe]

450
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,699
I'm not going.

451
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,639
We have nothing to do anyway.

452
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
Come on.

453
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
All you ever think of
is surfing the internet.

454
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,880
Can't you do some reading

455
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,389
and write a few lines of code?

456
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,560
[Will you be online today?]

457
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,960
[No, I'm not in the mood.]

458
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,800
[When will you be online?]

459
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,240
[I want to send you a gift.]

460
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,320
[What gift?]

461
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,880
[You'll find out when you go online.]

462
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,080
[Wait for me.]

463
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,260
[Let's go.]

464
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,880
[What are you doing?]

465
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,920
[Let's go to the cybercafe.]

466
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,960
All you ever think of
is surfing the internet.

467
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,600
Can't you do some reading?

468
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,680
Can't you write some code?

469
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,080
Then I'll go myself.

470
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,320
Lu Jing, can't you be a human?

471
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,000
I thought you were busy.

472
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,260
I wasn't.

473
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
You haven't got this
new equipment yet, right?

474
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,800
This is very hard to get.

475
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
Did you win it yourself?

476
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,140
Wait a minute.

477
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,960
How could you possibly
win it on your own?

478
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,200
Did you buy it from someone else?

479
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,200
Keep it to yourself.

480
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,640
Don't say it out loud. I have my pride.

481
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,160
Let me return your courtesy.

482
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Hold on a second,
I'll give you something nice.

483
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,300
Okay.

484
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,480
You wouldn't trade this helmet with me
all these years,

485
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
and you're giving it to her?

486
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,500
Lu Jing,

487
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,240
some friend you are.

488
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,680
Tell me. How many times
have I asked for it?

489
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,120
Did you ask me for it?

490
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,280
What do you mean?

491
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
I treat you as an
important guest in my life.

492
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,920
But you treat me as
a passer-by in your life.

493
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,520
Ke Ke, I'm here to take my coat.

494
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,640
Give me a second.

495
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,080
Jia Yun,

496
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,680
don't you have work today?

497
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,240
My schedule is cancelled.

498
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm here for my clothes.

499
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,200
I left it here.

500
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,240
You're playing Beautiful Soul
with someone else?

501
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,760
-Carry on.
-Okay.

502
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,760
I'm off.

503
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,640
Goodbye, Jia Yun.

504
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,620
Bye-bye.

505
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,800
I'm back.

506
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,560
What were you going
to give me just now?

507
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,360
Where is he?

508
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,120
Is he disconnected?

509
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,630
[Grenade]

510
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,720
What's wrong with him?

511
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,040
What are you doing?

512
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
I heard something over on her side.

513
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
A man said

514
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,520
he left his coat at
her place last night.

515
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Isn't she using a voice changer?

516
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,280
Are you sure it was a man?

517
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,680
What's going on?

518
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,880
Is he mad again?

519
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,200
Or

520
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,640
is he

521
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,720
disconnected?

522
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,360
Ms Liang, take a seat.

523
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,640
I'll return the laptop first.

524
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,840
I'm still using it.

525
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,320
Why did you shut it down?

526
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,960
I thought you were not using it.

527
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,900
Where is she?

528
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,540
She logged off.

529
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,640
Let it go, my guest.

530
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Of course you have to forgive her.

531
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,800
Buzz off.

532
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,200
[Hello, Lu Jing.]

533
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,120
[Are you still online?]

534
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
[Hello, Lu Jing.]
