00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,600
Ms Liang, what happened?

7
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,920
You changed your clothes so early.

8
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,770
Are you alright?

9
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,039
I'm fine.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
I didn't sleep well.

11
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,780
Has something happened?

12
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,880
Then get up and wash up.

13
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,880
You have a rehearsal with the band,
don't you?

14
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,820
Put on more clothes.

15
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
It got colder last night.

16
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,760
I almost died from the cold
on my way here.

17
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,570
Sure.

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,880
It's so cold.

19

Should we ask him to come in?

[You finally switched on your phone!]

53
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,050
Is Lu Jing with you now?

54
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,200
No. What's the matter?

55
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,840
Just now Lu Jing's grandma came to see me.

56
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,960
She said Lu Jing hasn't gone home

57
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,080
since last night.

58
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,080
[She couldn't reach him by phone.]

59
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,640
[She asked me if I know where he is.]

60
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,970
He didn't go home?

61
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
No.

62
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,159
He's getting on my nerves.

63
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,570
Stay calm. I'll go find him.

64
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,590
[Where are you going to find him?]

65
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,400
I have no idea.

66
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,590
But I'll look around.

67
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,520
I'll hang up now.

68
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,130
Don't hang up first!

69
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,080
What?

70
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,320
Did Lu Jing tell you

71
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,580
about studying abroad?

72
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,560
What happened?

73
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,120
As a matter of fact,
Lu Jing has decided not to study abroad.

74
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,360
He thought
it wasn't necessary to tell you,

75
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,280
he didn't mean to keep it from you.

76
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,040
[Don't be mad at him.]

77
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
Why didn't you answer your phone?

78
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,740
Do you know that
your family is worried sick about you?

79
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,400
My phone died.

80
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,970
Hello, Taro,

81
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,320
I found him.

82
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,000
He's fine. Don't worry.

83
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,340
Are you still mad at me?

84
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,950
Taro told me everything.

85
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,960
I misunderstood you.

86
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,600
I shouldn't give you the cold shoulder.

87
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,100
I've been reflecting on myself
these two days.

88
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,800
I wasn't good enough.

89
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,640
Sorry.

90
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,840
You should've told me earlier.

91
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,240
We can fix it together.

92
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,370
I didn't want to make you upset

93
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,170
because of my studying abroad.

94
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
Why would I be upset?

95
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,720
If I study abroad,

96
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,240
won't you feel upset?

97
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
I'm afraid we'll be apart.

98
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,160
The transportation system
is developed now.

99
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,600
I can go to see you anytime.

100
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't think distance will separate us.

101
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,750
So, you don't have

102
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,430
any faith

103
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
in our relationship?

104
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
Go home and rest early.

105
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,500
He's been running for almost an hour.

106
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,800
He won't die all of a sudden, will he?

107
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I don't think so.

108
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,120
But I'm afraid he won't be able
to get out of bed tomorrow.

109
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
It's all because of Gu Fei Ming.

110
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,120
He's a jerk.

111
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,620
What do you think, guys?

112
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,620
-Get him.
-Get him.

113
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,390
Get him!

114
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,280
Let's go!

115
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,120
Gu Fei Ming!

116
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,370
You still have the mood to put on make up?

117
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,960
Do you know that you're killing Lu Jing?

118
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,080
Say it.

119
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,800
Do you choose Qi Qi or Lu Jing?

120
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,590
What are you talking about?

121
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,600
Be honest. Answer us now!

122
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,480
Of course I choose Qi Qi.

123
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,790
Charge!

124
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,690
What are you doing?

125
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,680
What exactly do you want from me?

126
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,550
I'll choose Lu Jing, alright?

127
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,040
If you had made the right choice earlier,

128
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,400
you'd be fine.

129
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,280
Tell us.

130
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,250
What did you do to Lu Jing?

131
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,690
I have no idea.

132
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,020
He hasn't contacted me for a long time.

133
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,900
Are you not telling us?

134
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,900
Hold on.

135
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,170
Are you Little Box or not?

136
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,610
What's with the Big Box and Little Box?

137
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,040
My gaming skill is bad,

138
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,800
but you shouldn't insult me.

139
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,920
Untie me!

140
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,290
Shan Shan, what are you doing here?

141
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,660
I'd caused you trouble yesterday.

142
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,660
Thank you.

143
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,480
Come on in.

144
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,210
Here, have some water.

145
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,090
Thanks.

146
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,330
How are you? Feeling better?

147
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,320
I'm fine now.

148
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,250
We have to thank Taro for last night.

149
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,670
I will thank him when I have time.

150
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,640
But why did you drink so much?

151
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,690
Don't just talk about me.

152
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,870
What about you?

153
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,000
I heard you guys had an argument.

154
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,890
So this is what happened.

155
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,510
So?

156
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,650
Are you breaking up with him?

157
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,880
I won't break up with him.

158
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,470
I think you might have a little hard time

159
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,839
dating him.

160
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,160
He's younger

161
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,920
and not mature enough.

162
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,040
This kind of incident

163
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,800
where he makes a decision
without discussing with you

164
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,560
might happen again in the future.

165
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,250
Why don't you get

166
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,780
a more mature boyfriend?

167
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,500
Just like Jia Yun.

168
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,240
If you're dating a man

169
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,840
like Jia Yun,

170
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,240
you might not face this issue now.

171
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,400
Before you run into troubles,

172
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,280
he would've solved all of them already.

173
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,040
You'll be living the life of a princess.

174
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,080
Isn't that nice?

175
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
But I think

176
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,340
there's no relationship

177
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,070
which requires effort from only one party.

178
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,720
[If I had a mature boyfriend,]

179
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
[when I am enjoying this comfort,]

180
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
[I'd definitely face
other issues as well.]

181
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,640
[To a man like him,]

182
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880
[love is just a part of his life.]

183
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,480
[His career and future]

184
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,720
[mean the most to him.]

185
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,280
Since I chose him,

186
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,430
I have to accept everything
that comes with him.

187
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,240
All I can do is to be considerate,

188
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,080
understanding,

189
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,000
and survive in this relationship
with a rational mind.

190
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,920
However, if I date

191
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,720
an immature boy,

192
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,120
[I love that when he looks at me,]

193
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,120
[his eyes are full of affection.]

194
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,840
[I love that he's full of vitality]

195
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,480
[and how he crashed into my life,]

196
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,360
[wanting to give me]

197
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,360
all the nice and beautiful stuff.

198
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,680
So you already have the answer.

199
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,660
If he wants to grow,

200
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,000
why can't I do it with him?

201
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,280
How long has it been?

202
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,120
Almost two hours.

203
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm freezing.

204
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,240
No, no. Don't take it.

205
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,000
Just share with me.

206
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Stop taking it from me.

207
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,320
Hold on.

208
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,200
If Gu Fei Ming is not Little Box,

209
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,240
we can call

210
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
the real Little Box.

211
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,120
But we don't know

212
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,660
who Little Box really is.

213
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,900
That's a piece of cake.

214
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,480
It ran out of battery now of all times?

215
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,800
I have a portable charger.

216
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
Plug it in.

217
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,290
Give it to me. I know his password.

218
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,440
This must be the Box Spirit.

219
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,990
Jing, we have no choice.

220
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,240
Please don't be mad at us.

221
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,440
Come on, call the number.

222
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,960
No one is answering.

223
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,280
Did they break up?

224
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,760
Be careful on your way home.

225
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,640
Bye.

226
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,240
Are you Lu Jing's girlfriend?

227
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,920
You are...

228
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,480
We are Lu Jing's room-mates.

229
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,120
I know that both of you are fighting.

230
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
He's been running on the basketball court

231
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,680
for almost two hours.

232
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,120
[If he doesn't stop,]

233
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,000
he might break
the long-distance running record in China.

234
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,960
Won't you come and check on him?

235
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,720
If you don't come, Lu Jing might die.

236
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,360
Exactly.

237
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,160
Where is he?

238
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,640
The basketball court of Nanze University.

239
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,500
Just make a left turn
after you come in from the north gate.

240
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,230
Got it. I'll be right there.

241
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,280
What does that mean?

242
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,520
I think it's done.

243
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,640
Lu Jing,

244
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,320
that's all we can do for you.

245
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,640
Why is she not here yet?

246
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,160
Is she not coming?

247
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,840
How about this?

248
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,600
Let's knock him out and take him back.

249
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,870
Good idea.

250
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,040
You should do it.

251
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,990
Heck no!

252
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,140
She's here!

253
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,560
Are you Lu Jing's classmates?

254
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,920
Holy Moly!

255
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,760
I...I haven't changed
my glasses for too long, have I?

256
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,860
Is...Is she real?

257
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,880
Even the girl Jing's dating
is extraordinary.

258
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,240
Lu Jing!

259
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,640
Come here.

260
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,200
Why are you wearing so little?

261
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,770
Lu Jing,

262
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,780
we called her here.

263
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,390
But it was Liu'er
who called her with your phone.

264
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,320
I just took out your phone,

265
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,290
but I swear
I didn't read your conversation.

266
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,930
It's so cold.

267
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
Why didn't you put on more clothes?

268
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,040
You...

269
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,860
I'm glad that you're fine.

270
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,630
I'll leave now.

271
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,040
Why are you still here?

272
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,160
Go on, go on.

273
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,750
Is there anything that you want to say?

274
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,040
I want to explain something to you.

275
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,110
I didn't change my life
without second thought

276
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,990
because of you.

277
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,870
Not going to study abroad

278
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
is a decision I made
after careful consideration.

279
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,540
What do you mean?

280
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,550
First of all,
my parents are abroad all year round.

281
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,960
My grandparents are old.

282
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,920
I'm the only person they have.

283
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,520
I don't want to leave them.

284
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,350
Besides, the big data research environment
in our country

285
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,590
is mature.

286
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,120
If I stay,

287
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,080
I'll have more opportunities to grow.

288
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,760
Is that true?

289
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,880
The academic environment here

290
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,560
is no worse than that
in foreign countries.

291
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,830
Besides,

292
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,050
my friends are here too.

293
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,170
You met them too.

294
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,140
They're not bright.

295
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,150
If I leave,

296
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,200
I don't know what would become of them.

297
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,760
Anything else?

298
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,280
The food here is delicious too.

299
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,960
Everything is very convenient.

300
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,680
Why must I go abroad?

301
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,160
Why do you have so many reasons?

302
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,680
There's the most important one.

303
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,270
What is it?

304
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,640
You.

305
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,440
Lu Jing, I was mad at you

306
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,720
because I'm your girlfriend,

307
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,370
but I was the last to know

308
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,030
such an important matter

309
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,380
which involves your life planning.

310
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,690
I also don't want to be the person

311
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,200
who disrupts your original life planning.

312
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,560
You're very smart and outstanding.

313
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,600
You should choose what is best for you.

314
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,840
Senior.

315
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,040
From the day we met,

316
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,120
our lives have changed.

317
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,720
Since we are in a relationship,

318
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,680
then we should walk into the future,

319
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,440
hand in hand.

320
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,440
Since you are so confident in our future,

321
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,400
then you have to believe

322
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,840
that our relationship will be able
to stand the test.

323
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,600
Senior,

324
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,480
I was wrong.

325
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,160
I was not mature enough.

326
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,300
Will you forgive me?

327
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,400
I was wrong too.

328
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,360
I should've let you finished your words.

329
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,760
You didn't talk to me
for two days straight.

330
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,540
Don't you do this again.

331
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Whatever you say.

332
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,280
I did a lot of thinking these two days.

333
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,840
When two people are in a relationship,

334
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,800
they have to adjust to each other.

335
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,640
I'll work hard to adjust to you,

336
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,440
so I hope

337
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,000
that you'll also work hard
to adjust to me.

338
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,000
Sometimes,

339
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,670
I have a lot of work to do,

340
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,440
I have to travel
to all sides of the world.

341
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,800
When I'm not at home,
my plants will wither.

342
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,480
Then I'll water your plants.

343
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,440
Besides, during festive season,

344
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,400
that's the time
when I have the most packed schedule.

345
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,360
Chinese New Year, New Year's Eve,

346
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,520
and Valentine's Day,

347
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,360
I might not be able to celebrate with you.

348
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,200
I will watch you on the television.

349
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,080
The most important thing is,

350
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,990
you should know that I'm a public figure.

351
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,050
So I will be taunted by public opinion
all the time.

352
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,000
The people around me

353
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,840
are very likely to be affected.

354
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,080
I'm afraid that you'll be affected.

355
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
These are the things you have to face

356
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,840
if we're together.

357
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,780
I'm not afraid.

358
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,640
In that case,

359
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,480
let's protect this relationship together

360
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,400
and face the hardships together.

361
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,560
We'll face them together.

362
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
You're colder.

363
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,240
Did you guys make up?

364
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,580
Ms Liang! Senior!

365
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,700
Don't leave first.

366
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,420
We can talk things out.

367
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
If Lu Jing has done anything wrong,

368
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,760
I'll beat him up for you.

369
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,500
Ms Liang,

370
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,960
Jing really likes you a lot.

371
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,510
He's a treasure.

372
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,230
If I were a girl,
he'd be the only man I'd marry.

373
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,930
Come, come. Come over here.

374
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,880
Come here.

375
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,840
Senior, look at this face

376
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,840
and this figure.

377
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,640
The most important thing is

378
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,000
he has the most sincere heart.

379
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,950
Oh, God.

380
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,470
He's one in a million.

381
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,200
Senior, stop scolding him.

382
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,400
You can scold me if you want to!

383
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,360
Do you know?

384
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,480
When you were attacked on the Internet,

385
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,440
he stayed up a few nights
just to help you.

386
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,000
It broke my heart!

387
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,480
Are you guys always like this?

388
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,800
-No, no!
-Not at all!

389
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,950
Lu Jing is totally different from us.

390
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,240
He only eats, studies and works out.

391
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,840
He doesn't have any bad habits.

392
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,280
Exactly. He gets first place every year.

393
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,600
He also gets the first place
in all sports.

394
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,280
And, and...

395
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,320
He passed CET-6,

396
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,160
and he got the highest score
in our class.

397
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,320
He'd give up his seat to pregnant woman
on the bus,

398
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,880
help old lady cross the road.

399
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,520
He's an outstanding young man.

400
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,570
Right.

401
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,500
Since you've given Lu Jing
so many compliments,

402
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,730
how about this, Ms Liang?

403
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,730
I'll show you a special trick

404
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,770
that Lu Jing taught me,

405
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,360
fist swallowing trick.

406
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
You were lying to us.

407
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,760
Thank you.

408
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,450
Can...Can I sell this?

409
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,840
I want to wear it.

410
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,760
It's mine! Give it to me!
I want to wear it.

411
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
Come here, come here.

412
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,610
Come here!

413
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,480
I'll leave now.

414
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
Let me send you home.

415
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,740
I cant' bear watching you leave alone.

416
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,440
Let's go.

417
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,030
♫ The chosen path is a one-way street ♫

418
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,190

♫ The glory on my back
reflecting my hopes ♫

424

♫ Oh ♫

425
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,120
♫ Passing through the seas of mediocrity ♫

426

[Sun Bin Yu]

439
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,210
[Is this even possible?]

440
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,220
[Are you crazy?]

441
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,810
[Ma Shan Shan]

442
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,230
Hello, Ms Ma.

443
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,080
Have you had dinner?

444
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,600
Yes... No.

445
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,320
Have you had dinner or not?

446
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,600
No, no.

447
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,880
Are you buying me dinner, Ms Ma?

448
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,280
Sure! No problem!

449
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,080
What do you want to eat?

450
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,240
[I'll make a reservation now.]

451
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,470
Anything is fine.

452
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,200
You choose.

453
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,960
Sure. Wait for me.

454
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,240
I'll pick you up right away.

455
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,000
It tastes great!

456
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,960
It tastes really authentic.

457
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,820
Eat up, Ms Ma.

458
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,120
Here, I'll get it for you.

459
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,360
Sautéed potato, green pepper and eggplant.
Stewed chicken with mushroom.

460
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,170
Eat more, Ms Ma.

461
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,480
You... Why are you dressed up...

462
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,320
What is wrong with it?

463
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,000
I still look handsome as ever, don't I?

464
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,640
Eat up, Ms Ma.

465
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,840
I've taken some for you.

466
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,800
Eat more. We have a lot of food here.

467
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,170
Okay.

468
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,080
It's really authentic!

469
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,600
Try one, Ms Ma.

470
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,210
What...what's wrong?

471
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,430
I don't feel like eating today.

472
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,510
You eat.

473
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,920
I get it now.

474
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,440
Is it because

475
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,160
you don't like the food that I ordered?

476
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,440
It's fine, Ms Ma.

477
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,440
Just tell me.

478
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,090
I'll order some...

479
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,960
No, no. You can eat it.

480
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
If you're done, I'll get the bill.

481
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,440
No!

482
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,690
Have you ever tried dine and dash?

483
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,260
No.

484
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,180
What are you doing?

485
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,600
Hurry!

486
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,240
They're catching up with us!

487
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,590
Are you out of your mind?

488
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
How was that, Ms Ma?

489
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,320
Wasn't that exciting?

490
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,290
Ms Ma, where are you going?

491
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,540
Alright, alright!

492
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,880
I won't mess with you any more.

493
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,440
Stop, stop!

494
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,680
I paid the bill
when I went to the wash room.

495
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,000
A gentleman uses his words
but not his fists.

496
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,650
Force can't solve any problem.

497
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,700
If you lose,
you'll be sent into a hospital.

498
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,840
If you win, you'll be put into a jail.

499
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
It's not worth it.

500
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,480
The view today is great.

501
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,840
Are you hungry, Ms Ma?

502
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,160
You haven't eaten anything this evening.

503
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,400
Let's eat hotpot, Ms Ma.

504
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,320
Ms Ma!
