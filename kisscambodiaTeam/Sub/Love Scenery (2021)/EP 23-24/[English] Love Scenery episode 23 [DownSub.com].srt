00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,400
Our boy

7
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,020
has finally grown up.

8
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,240
I've been so worried about him
all these years.

9
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,680
What guy doesn't have a girlfriend
in university?

10
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,820
My boy is nice,

11
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,880
but he is a complete nerd.

12
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,420
A bookworm who only reads and studies.

13
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,479
But now, it's great.

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
-He's finally found a girlfriend.
-Yes.

15
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,840
I have to go back to my friends.

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,960
No problem, go ahead.

17
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,700
Okay. Bye, Grandpa.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,420
-Bye, Grandma.
-Bye-bye.

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,400
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,800
Dear, our grandson has a girlfriend now.

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,979
Do you hear me?

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,420
What's the use in hearing about it?

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,840
Let's change our clothes and check it out.

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,780
Yes indeed! Let's go.

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,020
Food is here.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,079
Here.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Thanks.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Thanks.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,180
You all have not even
touch your chopsticks yet.

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,180
It's just a joke, guys.

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,380
You're back so soon.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,980
We have yet to eat.

33
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,140
An immediate emergency
calls for an instant remedy.

34
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,460
Okay.

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,940
Ms Ma.

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,380
Quick, taste this.

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,520
I've made a great contribution

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,540
to this particular dish.

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,100
As great as a sesame seed.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,120
Come.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,300
Here you go, Ms Ma.

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,240
-Thanks.
-Thanks, Jia Yun.

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,020
Liang Chen doesn't drink.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,180
You drink on her behalf.

45
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,440
No problem.

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,040
Have some fruit juice.

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,780
Can you take alcoholic drinks?

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,640
You underestimate me.

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,460
Come on, cheers everyone.

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,840
To celebrate Orange's
triumph in the challenge.

51
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,380
Thanks everyone, cheers!

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,980
Let's eat.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,620
Ms Ma.

54
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,340
Try some fish.

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,300
I made this. Try it.

56
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,860
I don't eat fish.

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,820
Well, that's alright.

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,280
Use mine then.

59
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,700
Ms Ma, try the boiled shrimp.

60
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,900
I made this too.

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,740
It's so delicious.

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,480
Okay.

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,260
Ms Ma.

64
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,640
You didn't eat the fish,

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,020
but why is there a
fish bone on your eyelid?

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,020
It's double eyelid sticker.

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,540
My dear,

68
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,640
do you think it's a good idea
to just show up like this?

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
Of course!

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
We have to take the initiative.

71
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,140
If not, we'll have to wait a
long time to get a grandchild.

72
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,540
That's true.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,100
Stop hesitating, let's go.

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,580
Sure, let's go.

75
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,680
I'll open the door.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,480
Grandpa Lu, Grandma Lu.

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,620
What brings you here?

78
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,580
We are here to borrow some rice.

79
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,620
We've finished ours.

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,140
To borrow rice? Both of you?

81
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,120
Grandpa is worried that I might
not be able to carry it.

82
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,260
-He's here to help me.
-Yes, to help.

83
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Are you going to take all of our rice?

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
Of course not.

85
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,960
Just lend us what you can.

86
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,280
Sure, come in.

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,540
This way, Grandpa Lu.

88
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,060
-Coming.
-This way, Grandpa Lu.

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
There are so many of you here.

90
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,260
Everyone is here.

91
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,640
Please sit down, children.

92
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,660
Sit down.

93
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,620
Okay, okay.

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,900
Carry on with your meal.

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,980
We're just here to borrow some rice.

96
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,300
This way, Grandpa Lu.

97
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,700
Grandma, why are you here?

98
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,920
I know you're having a gathering.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,700
So I brought a box of Doubendou
soy milk for you

100
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,700
to replenish your nutrients.

101
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,260
Grandma.

102
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,660
Would you look at this rice?

103
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,280
The rice...

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Judging by your attire,

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,960
it doesn't look like
you're having a meal at home.

106
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,900
Take a good look with my glasses.

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,540
So bright and beautiful.

108
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,940
Yes, indeed.

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,000
How come I never noticed

110
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,400
how attractive our rice is?

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,300
You have a vision problem.

112
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,680
Grandma, why don't we
continue this back home?

113
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Okay, okay.

114
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,220
Kids, enjoy your meal.

115
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,600
If there's not enough food,

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,760
we have braised duck
and pork shoulder at home.

117
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,460
Heaps of them.
You're welcome to it.

118
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
-Don't be shy.
-Let's go, Grandpa.

119
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,500
-You're all welcome to it.
-Let's go.

120
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,680
Okay.

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,260
Have a good day.

122
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,740
We'll talk at home, okay?

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,700
Sure.

124
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,820
We're off, then,

125
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,320
Here, Orange.

126
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,580
Grandma Lu's Doubendou soy milk.

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,540
Enjoy it.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,020
Try it, Ms Ma.

129
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,920
Thanks.

130
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,220
Here, Ding.

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,780
[Should I go over and say hi to them?]

132
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,940
[No hurry, just give them some time.]

133
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,820
[What should I prepare?]

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
[A greeting gift.]

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,340
Are you two done texting each other?

136
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,300
Can't we just have a proper meal?

137
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,860
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,220
I was too loud just now.

139
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,100
Please carry on.

140
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,220
Carry on with your texting.

141
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,460
Here, Ms Ma.

142
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,740
Have a boiled shrimp.

143
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,740
Come, Ding. Cheers.

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,460
Dig in, Liang Chen.

145
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,660
Jing,

146
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,340
don't just keep drinking water.

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,860
Why did you come back just like that?

148
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,780
What else should I do?

149
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,100
You should send my
granddaughter-in-law back home.

150
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,600
Don't worry, Grandma.

151
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,700
Someone will send her back.

152
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,100
My dear grandson,

153
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,740
how can you be such a fool?

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
That was such a good opportunity.

155
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,780
It was the time to show your affection.

156
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,400
You're not like me at all.

157
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,740
Back in the day, when I pursued
your grandma...

158
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,220
Stop bragging about the past.

159
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,960
Tell me, Jing.

160
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
When will we get to meet

161
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,780
our granddaughter-in-law in person?

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,560
This is very important.

163
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,680
When?

164
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
In two days time?

165
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,640
A day?

166
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,780
-A day?
-You are even more impatient.

167
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,160
You can't keep putting it off.

168
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,480
Not with something like this.

169
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
If you keep putting it off,

170
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,680
you'll miss the chance.

171
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,700
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

172
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,400
Anyway, we really like this girl.

173
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,520
She's gorgeous, bright and gentle.
She's perfect.

174
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
She is very bright and beautiful.

175
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,040
-I like her a lot.
-You do?

176
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,220
Just two more days.

177
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,120
Two more days.

178
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,020
You must seize it.

179
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,720
-Sure.
-No procrastinating.

180
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,260
Come, drink your water.

181
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,560
Thanks, Grandma.

182
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,220
You are not drunk, are you, Ding?

183
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,480
I'm still alright.

184
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,100
Good job with the cooking today.

185
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,300
Look at all the dirty dishes.

186
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,560
Don't you move a muscle.

187
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,660
I'll do the dishes.

188
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,140
Sober up and we'll have a chat later.

189
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,520
You...

190
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,220
What are you implying?

191
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,660
Others may not be aware,

192
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,300
but I am.

193
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,940
You may look alright on the surface,

194
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,580
but you haven't let of Orange.

195
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,540
What's not to let go?

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,020
If we're not destined to be together,

197
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,500
what's the point in trying?

198
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,080
You know, destiny

199
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,900
is a fascinating thing.

200
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,780
I believe Ms Ma and I are destined
to be together.

201
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,240
What do you think?

202
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,540
Then why didn't you send her home?

203
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,680
Orange was here.

204
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,100
I had no chance.

205
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,380
Why don't we have a couple more drinks?

206
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,380
Let's drink to destiny.

207
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,140
It's getting late.

208
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,460
I've got to go.

209
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,060
Let me get you a designated driver.

210
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,340
Zhu Guang is downstairs.

211
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,400
I'll make a move first.

212
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,740
Let me see you off, Ding.

213
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,280
Take it easy.

214
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,640
Bye, Ding.

215
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,180
Keep in touch.

216
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,720
How can I help you?

217
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,860
I heard you have a girlfriend now.

218
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,320
How did you get a girlfriend so suddenly?

219
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,140
Is she your coursemate?

220
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,600
Excuse me.

221
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,620
Carry on.

222
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
We've known each other for so long.

223
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,660
Who am I to you, really?

224
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,760
[Lu Jing, it all begins
with Beautiful Soul.]

225
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,740
[Get Orange to join us.]

226
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,420
[Brother, let's have fireworks tonight.]

227
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,940
[Why are you still awake at this hour?]

228
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,120
[I joined the winter camp.]

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,500
[It's boring at night.]

230
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,900
[Please play with me.]

231
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,860
[I beg you, Brother.]

232
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,860
[You are the best.]

233
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,460
[Okay, I will get a couple of friends.]

234
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,840
Anything?

235
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,920
[I miss you.]

236
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,260
We've just met earlier, haven't we?

237
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,540
[I don't want to be apart
from you even for a second.]

238
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
[Do you want to play Beautiful Soul?]

239
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,780
[Taro, and my cousin will be joining too.]

240
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,140
Your cousin?

241
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,500
It's good for you to get
acquainted with him.

242
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,940
We will soon be a family anyway.

243
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,740
Okay, I'll stop joking.

244
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,000
Are you joining?

245
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,840
Okay.

246
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,780
How did you do in the exam?

247
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,620
Superb. I came in first.

248
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,300
If you count from the back.

249
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,760
Yes, indeed.

250
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,720
Here I am.

251
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,000
Brother, who...

252
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,020
Who is she?

253
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,580
Your girlfriend?

254
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,480
It's your sister-in-law.

255
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,300
Sister... in law?

256
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,460
Sister-in-law!

257
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,380
Brother, you're in a relationship.

258
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,460
How are you, kid?

259
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,540
Hi, Sister-in-law.

260
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,780
I need to tell Uncle and Aunt about this.

261
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,140
But Brother,

262
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,580
when will you take Sister-in-law home?

263
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,220
You have to ask her

264
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,460
when she will be willing
to go home with me.

265
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,060
Okay, let's proceed with our mission.

266
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,020
What's wrong with Taro?

267
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,580
The host is now the latecomer.

268
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,140
I'm here!

269
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,020
Well, nature's call.

270
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,060
You are here too, Brother.

271
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Who says I'm your brother?

272
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,560
Okay, everyone is here.

273
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Let's go.

274
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,700
Come over here, Chen Chen.

275
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,400
Stop calling me that.

276
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,180
There's a kid here. It's not appropriate.

277
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,540
I was calling my brother.

278
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,820
Sister-in-law, he is calling me.

279
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,540
Chen Chen, this is for you.

280
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,880
Chen Chen.

281
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,720
Chen Chen.

282
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,460
Liang Chen.

283
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,140
Are you calling me?

284
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,020
Chen Chen? Seriously?

285
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,720
Chen Chen.

286
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,980
Would you like a grenade?

287
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,060
Chen Chen.

288
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
Why are you coming here?

289
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,980
I didn't ask you to come
over, I just wanted to give....

290
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,620
She hit me.

291
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,100
Do you hear me, Lu Jing?

292
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,320
Ha Ha.

293
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,380
The two of you are so much alike.

294
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,260
Always bullying me.

295
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,660
I saw a jeep, Brother.

296
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,630
Coming.

297
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,680
Let's go.

298
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,869
Thank you.

299
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,620
Since when did you become so observant?

300
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,780
What are you waiting for? Get in the car.

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,260
The co-driver's seat is mine.

302
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,840
Sister,

303
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,500
you are really possessive.

304
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,260
Look, Lu Jing.

305
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,560
What are you doing?

306
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,440
Get in the back, now.

307
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,860
Okay. I'm going.

308
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,380
Showing off your affection online.

309
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,660
Disgusting.

310
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,860
Huh.

311
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,900
Let's get down. The car is broken.

312
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,440
I...

313
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,880
Orange.

314
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,520
After you left,

315
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,020
I witnessed a very interesting thing.

316
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,400
What is that?

317
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,340
A Hunanese girl came to see Lu Jing.

318
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,840
Who?

319
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,900
You have to ask him.

320
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,580
It's nothing. She's just a neighbour.

321
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,580
My foot!

322
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
That's not what actually happened.

323
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,740
I saw it with my own eyes.

324
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,440
That girl was questioning him

325
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,020
whether he was seeing a girl.

326
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,660
What did you tell her, then?

327
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,120
Me? Nothing.

328
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,620
My foot!

329
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,000
She was really disappointed.

330
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,340
She kept asking him,

331
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,260
"How much do I mean to you?"

332
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,720
You're so dangerous.

333
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,820
How did you answer her?

334
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,800
Didn't you see it?

335
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,040
How I answered her?

336
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
I missed that part.

337
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,860
You asked me to get inside.

338
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,860
Tell me, what did you say?

339
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,400
[We've known each other for so long.]

340
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,940
[How much do I mean to you?]

341
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,300
[I'm sorry, you have
no place in my heart.]

342
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,660
As expected of my brother!

343
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,400
Is that so?

344
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,440
I told you,

345
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,860
Lu Jing would never hurt you.

346
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,420
When did you say that?

347
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,540
Just now. I said it a few times
inside my head.

348
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,040
Good job.

349
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,600
Come on.

350
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,660
This is for you.

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Such a good boy.

352
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,820
Don't call me that.

353
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,620
It makes me sound like a kid.

354
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,220
Sound like a kid?

355
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,420
You are a kid.

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,940
Say it again.

357
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,200
Who is the kid?

358
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,900
It's me, I'm the kid.

359
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,860
The kid at your gunpoint.

360
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,760
Chen Chen.

361
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,340
Here's a healing salve.

362
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,740
-Who are you calling?
-Who are you calling?

363
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,540
Who do you think I'm calling?

364
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,040
You're awesome.

365
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,380
Have you two had enough?

366
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,360
You taunted this poor bachelor
in real life,

367
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,980
and now you're taunting him online.

368
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,340
Isn't that mean?

369
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,380
I'm mean?

370
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,900
Get your own girlfriend, then.

371
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,340
Are you provoking me?

372
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,300
You...

373
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,460
You never had a girlfriend
after all these years.

374
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,400
Lu Jing, if you keep provoking me,

375
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,000
Believe it or not, I will go after you.

376
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,680
No way, I won't agree
even if he agrees with it.

377
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,740
Are you out of your mind?

378
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,960
Let's go.

379
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,360
By the way, I'm short of a smoke grenade.

380
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,420
Lu Jing, can I have one?

381
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,700
No, because you
eavesdropped on me earlier.

382
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,220
Cheapskate!

383
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,080
Brother, I'm out of smoke grenades.

384
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,100
Can I have one?

385
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,160
I gave them all to your sister-in-law.

386
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,160
Ask her.

387
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,220
Sister-in-law, can I have a smoke grenade?

388
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,640
Here you go.

389
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,880
What's wrong with you?

390
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,240
This is bullying.

391
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,200
Just call me sister-in-law.

392
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,080
Go on.

393
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,020
Go to hell.

394
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,720
-Come on.
-Let's go.

395
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,900
[Chen Chen,]

396
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,640
[when will you be ready]

397
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,420
[to meet my parents?]

398
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,220
What's your problem?
Can you drop it already?

399
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,580
[I can't wait]

400
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,680
to start the next phase

401
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,100
of my life.

402
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
I'm tired. I have to go.

403
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,440
What did you say? I can't hear you.

404
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,700
Bye-bye.

405
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,140
-Bye-bye.
-Goodnight.

406
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,640
[Lu Jing.]

407
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,160
[How's your plan to study abroad]

408
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,420
[coming along?]

409
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,100
[I've got the letter of admission.]

410
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,660
[My admission is next year.]

411
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,860
[Great.]

412
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,120
[I know you've been preparing for this]

413
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,100
[since freshman year.]

414
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,500
[I never thought you'd be
graduating so soon.]

415
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,220
[In all my years of teaching,]

416
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,720
[I've seldom come across a student
as talented]

417
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,180
[and as hardworking as you.]

418
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,740
[Do your best.]

419
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,080
[I will.]

420
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,170
[Letter of admission]

421
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,700
Have you eaten?

422
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,920
No.

423
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,940
Let me check the fridge.

424
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,620
Do you know how to cook?

425
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,060
Why don't we order takeout?

426
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,320
Okay.

427
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,800
What do you want to eat?

428
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,080
Anything will do.

429
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,300
I will go ahead and order.

430
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,500
I need to answer a call.

431
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,340
Lu Jing, how about pizza?

432
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,200
Thanks.

433
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,580
I'm asking, is pizza fine with you?

434
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,440
Yes.

435
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,900
Who are you calling?

436
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,280
The courier.

437
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,660
The courier? Do they speak English?

438
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,840
It's for an overseas parcel.

439
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,720
I see.

440
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,980
I'll order a fruit pizza for you.

441
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,880
Would you like that?

442
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,040
Sounds good.

443
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,420
What about spicy pizza?

444
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,480
Sounds good.

445
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,340
Wasabi pizza?

446
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,240
Sounds good.

447
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,020
Durian pizza?

448
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,540
Sounds good, too.

449
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,700
Why do you like everything?

450
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,500
But I love you the most.

451
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,400
What's going on?

452
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,140
Nothing, just want to hug you.

453
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,340
Are you sure you're okay?

454
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,980
The food delivery will take some time.

455
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,660
Why don't we play a game first?

456
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,920
Let's go.

457
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,920
Sit down.

458
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,180
What are you trying to do?

459
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,720
Log in.

460
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
Why are you looking at me?

461
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,260
Looks like your handling needs work.

462
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,900
No wonder you are so
slow to pick up items.

463
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,980
Run downstairs. Look alive.

464
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,880
Stop picking those up.

465
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,040
Are you going to sell those garbage
for money or what?

466
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,920
Shut up!

467
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,460
What are you waiting for? Just hit it!

468
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,400
Why are you putting your head down?

469
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,600
You keep mumbling beside me.

470
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,340
I can't hit any of them.

471
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,400
What's wrong?

472
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,440
Don't move.

473
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,380
I have to teach you by grabbing your hand.

474
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,580
Your chair

475
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,460
is too awkward.

476
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,660
Let me find you another chair.

477
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,040
Never mind.

478
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,260
Isn't this better?

479
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,300
Try to feel it.

480
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,700
This is how you handle recoil.

481
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,940
You didn't hit it, either.

482
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,900
It's a mistake.

483
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,220
Don't move. I'm nervous too.

484
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,540
The phone is ringing.

485
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,420
Why don't you go and answer it?

486
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,160
Hi.

487
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,820
Why must the phone ring at this moment?

488
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,820
Hello, what would you like?

489
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,100
A latte, please.

490
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,820
Extra coffee, extra milk.

491
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,560
We have a promotion right now.

492
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,060
Half price for the second
cup, do you want it?

493
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,700
Not for me. Two cups is too much.

494
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,380
You can share it with your girlfriend.

495
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,560
No thanks. She's watching her figure.

496
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,620
She's laying off the stuff.

497
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,060
Okay, please wait for a moment.

498
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,920
[Yesterday evening,]

[He announced that their
wedding is coming soon.]

public three months ago.]

Why are you laughing?

516
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,600
Nothing.

517
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,320
It's Taro.

518

[Sun Bin Yu]

519
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,740
So annoying.

Hi, what's up?

521
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,340
Where are you, Orange?

522
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,680
I'm at home.

523
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,100
Come to my place at once.

524
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,580
Ms Ma's in trouble.

525

Why is Shan Shan there?

526
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,290
Please come over, Ms Ma is drunk.

527
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,239
I can't handle her by myself.

528
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
Hang on. I'll be right there.

529
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,199
Bye.

530
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,989
-What's going on?
-I'll explain on the way.

531
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,560
-Where's Shan Shan?
-She's inside.

532
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,639
Shan Shan.

533
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,949
Shan Shan. Shan Shan.

534
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,760
What happened?
Why did she drink so much?

535
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,679
I have no idea.

536
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,540
The waiter at the bar called
and asked me to go there.

537
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,320
When I arrived, she was already like this.

538
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,100
She even became sworn
brothers with the bottles.

539
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,730
She must've drank a ton.

540
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,290
She's sweating bullets.

541
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,860
Get a glass of water.

542
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,840
Okay.

543
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,740
Why did she drink excessively?

544
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,100
Sun, the hangover soup is ready.

545
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,860
Where is he?

546

Jing.

547
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,260
-Grandma.
-What are you doing here?

548
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,620
When did you come back?

549
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,860
Just now, Grandma.

550
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,080
Hello, Grandma.

551
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,960
Hello.

552
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,620
Is this kid okay?

553
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,260
She's just drunk. She'll be fine
after a good sleep.

554
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,820
Jing, why didn't you answer my calls?

555
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,620
Your father's been
looking for you all day.

556
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,000
He wants to talk to you

557
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,940
about the matter of
studying abroad next year.

558
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,780
Let's go back, Grandma.

559
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,440
I will explain to you when we go back.

560
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,500
Okay, let her drink the
soup while it's still hot.

561
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,200
You should return your father's call now.

562
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,340
Otherwise, he's going to be worried.

563
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,400
Okay.

564
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,700
Settle the study abroad thing first.

565
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,820
Okay, let's go back.

566
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,460
Are you planning to study overseas?

567
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,400
Why didn't you tell me?

568
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,280
I...

569
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,280
I'm sorry.

570
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,580
What do you mean "sorry?"

571
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,700
Sorry for not telling you earlier.

572
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,620
So if Grandma hadn't brought it up,

573
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,740
you would never tell me, is that it?

574
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,380
Here's the water.

575
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,360
Here's the water.

576
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,300
Why don't you two go out?

577
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,440
Okay, Liang Chen.

578
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,320
Go out, please.

579
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,960
Let's go.

580
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,100
Come on.

581
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,360
Come on.

582
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,260
What's the matter?
Did you two have a fight?

583
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,820
She found out about
my plan to study abroad.

584
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,560
Even I know that.

585
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,740
You didn't tell her?

586
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,620
I mean, why didn't you let her know?

587
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,120
I don't think it's necessary.

588
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,500
You don't think it's necessary?

589
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,540
So I'm the only one who doesn't know?

590
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,560
Liang Chen.

591
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,380
Don't just stand there.

592
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,460
Chase her.

593
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,820
Liang Chen!

594
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,640
[Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is turned off.]

595
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,740
[Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is turned off.]

596
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,720
[Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is turned off.]

597
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,900
[Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is turned off.]

598
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,160
[Liang Chen]

599
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,300
What's wrong, Ms Liang?

600
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,660
You've changed your clothes already?

601
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,500
Are you okay?

602
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,880
I'm fine.

603
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,660
I didn't sleep well, that's all.

604
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,660
Is something wrong?

605
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,640
Why don't you get up
and freshen up?

606
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,580
You have a rehearsal
with the band, remember?

607
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,580
Wear more clothes.

608
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,560
The temperature came down
last night.

609
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,380
I nearly froze to death on my
way here this morning.

610
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,400
Okay.
