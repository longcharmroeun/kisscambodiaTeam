00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,480
It feels like you two are close.

190
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,839
You must be mistaken.

191
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,680
Well, maybe I am.

192
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm going now.

193
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,160
Be safe. Bye.

194
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,160
Alright.

195
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
[We thank Liang Chen and Herman]

196
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
[for an exciting streaming session.]

197
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,870
[At the same time,
we hope you can give your support]

198
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,440
[to the Beautiful Soul.]

199
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,360
[But do remember.]

200
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,080
[Reasonable gaming boosts your brain,
excessive gaming burns your body.]

201
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,240
[Make sure you manage your time wisely]

202
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,120
[so you can enjoy a healthy life.]

203
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,080
[This is the end of the live stream.]

204
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,600
[Goodbye, everyone.]

205
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,880
Lu Jing took a short cut to meet his idol?

206
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,000
Totally shameless.

207
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,800
I've asked Ms Ma so many times

208
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,280
but she kept ignoring me.

209
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,480
[Want to play a game?
Two-player mission.]

210
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,150
[No.]

211
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
[Come on.]

212
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,320
[Are you bored?]

213
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,520
I'm not bored. I'm dogged.

214
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm so funny.

215
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
[Only one game.]

216
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
[If I beat you,]

217
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,280
[don't ever bother me again.]

218
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,680
[Game on.]

219
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,040
Ms Ma is so naive.

220
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,080
It's time to flex those skills.

221
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,840
A robot is coming.

222
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,000
[Don't panic, Ms Ma.]

223
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,800
I'll go finish him now.

224
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,160
He's dead.

225
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,280
Ms Ma, lady luck is on your side.

226
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
Another one is coming.

227
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,040
Let's go there.

228
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,080
A troop is closing in.

229
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,800
Be careful, Ms Ma.

230
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,240
They're all dead.

231
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,300
This is boring.
I'm not playing anymore.

232
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,680
The mission is not over yet.

233
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,680
The scores are not out yet.

234
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,280
Why are you stopping?

235
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
There are 50 robots.

236
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,960
I killed 26.

237
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
You'll never beat me.

238
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,040
What?

239
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,680
Ms Ma. You logged out?

240
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,680
She...

241
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,990
She keeps track of the body counts
as she plays?

242
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,080
Ms Ma is so smart.

243
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
You played well today, senior.

244
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,360
Do you practise a lot?

245
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,400
My...my work takes up a lot of time.

246
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,560
I don't get to practise so much.

247
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Then you must be

248
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,360
a gifted player.

249
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,560
That's all.

250
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,200
Mr Lin.
Who else is coming tonight?

251
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,600
You'll know later.

252
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
He is the bridge of our collaboration.

253
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,240
Ding.

254
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,480
Sorry I'm late.

255
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,800
-Take a seat.
-Sit, sit.

256
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,700
Ding recommended you to us.

257
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,040
You have a good eye.

258
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,720
It's nothing.

259
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Liang Chen is indeed the right choice.

260
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,960
I've been following
your live stream today.

261
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,120
You played well.

262
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,480
Thank you for recommending me.

263
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,170
Come. Let's toast.

264
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,610
Thank you all for your wonderful effort.

265
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,730
Cheers.

266
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,620
Cheers.

267
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,040
[Ms Ma, let's play another game.]

268
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,320
[Ms Ma, are you there?]

269
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,790
Wait. What is this?

270
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,440
She blocked me?

271
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,320
[Hello.]

272
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,920
[The number you have dialled
is not available.]

273
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,560
[Please call again later.]

274
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,410
She...

275
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,680
She really blocked me.

276
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,930
Charismatic. I like it.

277
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,170
Liang Chen.

278
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,900
Not only is your singing amazing,

279
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,310
your gaming skills are awesome too.

280
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,410
So...

281
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Let's collaborate more.

282
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,720
Great.

283
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,720
Cheers.

284
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,680
I got it.

285
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,120
Alright.

286
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,610
Ding.

287
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,160
How did it go?

288
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,920
Liang Chen is right for you, isn't she?

289
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,200
Yes, she is.

290
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,120
Come. Let's drink.

291
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,880
Cheers.

292
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,800
Here.

293
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,440
Mr Lin.

294
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,360
I don't want any payment for today.

295
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,800
I want something else instead.

296
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,120
What do you want?

297
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,200
Little Fire Dragon.

298
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,120
Now I remember.

299
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,160
That was a prop

300
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,040
introduced during the launch
of Beautiful Soul.

301
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
But the company decided to

302
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,920
cancel it.

303
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
They don't feature it anymore.

304
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,640
But if you really want it,

305
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,760
I can give it to you.

306
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,320
Since you're not afraid of
attracting firepower anyway, right?

307
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,200
Thank you, Mr Lin.

308
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,760
But it's not for me.

309
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,160
I plan to give it to someone.

310
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,040
Really? Who?

311
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,120
Some noob player.

312
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,120
So that she can play with it
when she's bored.

313
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,040
Are you alright?

314
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,750
Since she's a noob,

315
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,160
keeping a little fire dragon

316
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
is practically suicide.

317
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,920
It's alright.

318
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,640
She is with me almost everyday.

319
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,160
I'll deal with the firepower.

320
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,920
She can just play with
the little fire dragon.

321
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,200
I...I'll go get something to eat.

322
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,190
Thank you, Mr Lin.

323
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,120
No problem.

324
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,400
I'll get something to eat too.

325
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,360
Alright.

326
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,140
Don't catch a cold.

327
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,150
I'm not cold.

328
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,420
Can you do me a favour?

329
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,820
What favour?

330
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,480
Just a tiny favour.

331
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,280
It won't take up too much of your time.

332
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
Why don't we

333
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,870
go to the corridor to talk about it?

334
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,770
Alright.

335
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Boss.

336
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,680
If you really like her,

337
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,080
you need to do take the first step.

338
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,020
Senior.

339
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,440
Your button popped out.

340
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,560
Let me get it.

341
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,470
Alright.

342
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,280
Thanks.

343
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,950
Liang Chen.

344
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,800
Jia Yun. Are you looking for me?

345
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,760
Nothing.

346
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
It's cold tonight.
I'm just afraid you'll catch a cold.

347
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
Put this on.

348
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,290
Here.

349
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,650
Thank you, Jia Yun.

350
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,400
My friend's movie is premiering.

351
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,560
I want to invite you...

352
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,760
Jia Yun.

353
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,200
What is it?

354
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,480
I...I've been a long time fan.

355
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,040
I grew up watching your movies.

356
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Can I have your autograph?

357
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,080
Alright.

358
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,880
Thank you.

359
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,420
You're really kind.

360
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,950
Is there anything else?

361
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,050
Ms Liang Chen.

362
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,080
Can I also have your autograph?

363
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,840
Sure.

364
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,280
Thank you.

365
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,400
-Thank you, Ms Liang Chen.
-Thank you.

366
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,930
Let's go.

367
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,320
Ding.

368
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,950
I have asked the driver
to get the car ready

369
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
to send everyone back.

370
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,080
Don't worry about me.
My assistant drove his car here.

371
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,440
My driver is here too.

372
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,680
Then the two of you

373
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,960
can ride in my driver's car.

374
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
That's great.
Thanks, Mr Lin.

375
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,440
Don't worry about me, Mr Lin.

376
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
I'll find my way back.

377
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,760
Thank you.

378
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,800
You're welcome.

379
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,910
Are you free this Sunday?

380
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,320
It's my friend's movie premiere.

381
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,800
Do you want to go with me?

382
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,000
I have a recording this Sunday.

383
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Then forget it.

384
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm off now.

385
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,290
What a great weather today.

386
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,160
Senior, where do you live?

387
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,600
Bocui Tianchen. Why?

388
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm on that route too.
Give me a ride.

389
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,320
Where are you going?
Sun Bin Yu's place?

390
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,280
Hop on then.

391
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,120
I'll go now.

392
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,560
-Alright.
-Bye.

393
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,730
Bye.

394
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,150
Boss.

395
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,000
If I'm not mistaken,

396
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,840
Ms Liang and Mr Sun's place
are not in the same direction.

397
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,530
I know.

398
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,400
Buckle up.

399
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,260
I don't know how.

400
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,320
Can you help me?

401
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,120
[Are your arms broken?]

402
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,800
[Just because you buttoned my top,]

403
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,320
[you expect me put on
the seat belt for you?]

404
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,320
I'm just kidding.

405
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,880
Did you

406
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,080
talk about me secretly?

407
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,200
No, of course not.

408
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,480
All done now.

409
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,590
Thank you.

410
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,530
You're welcome.

411
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,909
Senior.

412
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,980
Do you want to come up?

413
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,389
No. No, thanks.

414
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,199
Alright then.

415
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,800
Goodbye, senior.

416
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,150
Goodbye.

417
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,970
[You cold-hearted woman.]

418
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,020
[You kept trampling on my heart.]

419
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,120
[I'll never forgive you.]

420
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,170
Come in.

421
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,470
Great.

422
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,020
That's what I like you about you, Ding.

423
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,870
When I need a drink,

424
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,230
you are here.

425
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,730
It's like you read my mind.

426
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,840
Here.

427
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,800
About Liang Chen's live stream today,

428
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,440
do you know who was playing with her?

429
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,920
Who?

430
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,320
Your neighbour.

431
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,800
Lu Jing?

432
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,320
What happened?

433
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,000
That puppy came on quite strong.

434
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,840
How did Liang Chen know him?

435
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,200
It's through mutual friends, I think.

436
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,920
What friends?

437
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,840
Introduce them to me.

438
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,320
I don't know them.

439
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,680
I wonder who they are too, right?

440
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,210
Do you know

441
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
what kind of relationship they're in?

442
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,560
Only one kind of course.

443
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,760
Ordinary online friends.

444
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,210
Ding.

445
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,400
I've been wanting to ask you something.

446
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,080
Do you have feelings for Orange?

447
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,200
Yes.

448
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,360
Oh my goodness.

449
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
You really do?

450
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,120
Are you serious?

451
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,960
[You two are my buddies.]

452
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,120
[Now you're fighting over a woman?]

453
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,560
[What do you want me to do?]

454
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,940
Oh, man.

455
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,800
This is a mad, mad world.

456
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,840
So this is Little Fire Dragon.

457
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,580
[Pet System]

458
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,700
[Pet Name: Little Fire Dragon]

459
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,680
Cute.

460
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,420
[Are you free? Log on now.]

461
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,160
So soon?

462
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,160
[Coming.]

463
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,640
Do you have something to tell me?

464
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,530
No.

465
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,400
Have you heard of Little Fire Dragon?

466
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,000
It circles around the person
spitting fire.

467
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,280
That kind of little fire dragon.

468
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,280
I know that. It's fun.

469
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,160
Do you want it?

470
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,520
Yes, I do.

471
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,370
But they are not featured anymore.

472
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,840
You lost your chance.

473
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,810
But you...

474
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:25,170
[I should have strangled you
with the seatbelt today.]

475
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,270
It's late.

476
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,880
I got to go.

477
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,920
Wait.

478
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,320
It's so cute.

479
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,120
Were you waiting for this the whole night?
