By the way,

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,320
come over to my house for dinner tomorrow.

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
I will invite a few friends over

7
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
for a welcome back party.

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
Fine, stop dilly-dallying.

9
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,400
Can you please hurry up?
Put on your shoes and go.

10
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,320
Go, go.

11
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,280
Such a small world, Ms Ma!

12
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,920
Come on in, Shan Shan.

13
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,320
Yes, come in, come in.

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Hi.

15
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,640
Ma...

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,720
Ms Ma, I hope you didn't pinch your feet.

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
Come in and have a seat.

18
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,440
I remember you like
to drink hot chocolate.

19
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
Here you go, your earphones.

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Thank you.

21
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
So how have you been?

22
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm good.

23
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,600
You attended the homecoming?

24
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,280
How was it?

25
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,360
The students were enthusiastic.

26
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Speaking of which, Mr Qin spoke of you.

27
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,600
He said you were his best student.

28
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,360
I should go back

29
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,200
to see him sometime.

30
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,760
I will come with you.

31
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,520
I mean, did you see him
when you were there?

32
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,240
I hadn't noticed.

33
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,040
I should go now. I have some things to do.

34
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,120
So soon? Don't you
want to stay a bit longer?

35
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm on the clock.

36
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,200
Let me walk you out.

37
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Ms Ma!

38
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,680
Ms Ma, Ms Ma.

39
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,960
Are you going home alone?

40
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,640
Yes, obviously.

41
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,560
Ms Ma, I mean...

42
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,960
It's the weekend, and it isn't
easy to order a taxi.

43
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
So?

44
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,520
So I was wondering if
you could give me a lift?

45
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,920
My home isn't very far from here.

46
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,320
I...

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,320
Get in the car, Ms Ma.

48
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Get in.

49
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,720
I'd never imagine that

50
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,800
you and Orange were classmates.

51
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,159
If she had told me earlier,

52
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,920
wouldn't we have met already?

53
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,360
Have you ever heard about the
six-dimensional space theory?

54
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,000
Also known as six degrees
of separation theory?

55
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,560
It's a theory that anyone on the planet

56
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
can be connected to anyone else

57
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,440
through just five intermediaries.

58
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,480
So...

59
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,320
To sum it up,

60
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
I think we can become

61
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
close friends.

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,000

63
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,100
As the saying goes,
the more friends you have,

64
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,520
the more options you'll have in life.

65
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,200
When we were acting together last time,

66
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,520
we were quite a team.

67
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,640

are coming over to my
place for dinner tomorrow.

Feel free to join us if you have time.
It's just us friends.

00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,960
I...

76
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,360
This...

77
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Officer,

78
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,040
were you calling me?

79
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,880
Your identity card, please.

80
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
So you're Sun Bin Yu?

81
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, that's me.

82
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
What's going on?

83
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,960
Did you book a taxi?

84
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,200
Are police nowadays driving taxis too?

85
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,240
Not only do we provide hire car service,

86
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,000
we also offer day trips
to the police station.

87
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,640
Are you serious?

88
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,520
Here's the thing.

89
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,440
The taxi driver couldn't
get through to you.

90
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,280
And he saw that you were
moving fast on the GPS.

91
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,000
He called the cops because he
thought you might be in danger.

92
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,680
This is all a misunderstanding.

93
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,040
I was in my friend's car.

94
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,560
I thought it was a prank call.

95
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,760
Be more mindful next time.

96
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,200
The taxi driver wasn't
worried about his business,

97
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,720
he was worried about your safety.

98
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,760
Yes, yes.

99
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,120
The taxi driver

100
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
is truly a caring citizen.

101
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,400
I will send him a silk banner later.

102
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,760
You look kind of familiar.

103
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,000
Have we met before?

104
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,720
As humble as I am,

105
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,840
I'm actually a famous actor.

106
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,669
Really?

107
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,400
Yes, I'm the real deal.

108
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,240
Then that's all the more reason
you should lead by example

109
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,600
and pay attention to your public image.

110
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Right, right.

111
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,030
I have to set a good example

112
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,080
for all my fans.

113
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,480

118
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,920
We haven't set a deal for tomorrow!

119

Ms Ma! Ms Ma! Ms Ma...

120
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,400
It's truly my honour.

121
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,880
Thank you, officers.

122
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,160
Thank you for giving me a ride home.

123
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
You're welcome. It's our
duty to serve the people.

124
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
You should be careful not
to repeat such actions again.

125
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,480
Don't mislead your viewers.

126
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,400

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,240
Officers,

128
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,600
why don't I take a picture with you?

129
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
I shouldn't let you come
all this way for nothing.

130
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,480
Come on.

131
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,800
Officer, take the phone.

132
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,960
You do it.

133
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
Maybe you should do it.

135
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,440
come here, help us take a photo.

139
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,600
Okay.

140
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,040
Nice.

141
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,640
Okay, we should go now.

142
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,760
Okay, thank you.

143
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,920
Thank you, thank you.

144
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,160
Thank you.

145
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,120
Goodbye.

146
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,640
Bye-bye.

147
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,920
Are you going in

148
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,760
or did you just come out?

149
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,200
Watch it!

150
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,640
Liang Chen is coming to
my place for dinner tomorrow.

151
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,520
I might just tell her
embarrassing stories about you.

152
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Jing.

153
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,280
Jing, what are you doing?

154
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,720
I say, Jing,

155
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,240
stop playing with Uncle, okay?

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,320
If you keep doing that,

157
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,680
you're going to pull out all its hairs.
You hear me?

158
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,720
Give it to me, give it to me.

159
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,200
Come here, come here.

160
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,120
Jing, you're always either

161
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,560
reading books

162
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
or playing with my baby.

163
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,120
Shouldn't you go get yourself a girlfriend

164
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,520
and start dating?

165
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,440
I...

166
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,960
I'm working on it.

167
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,280
Working on it?

168
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,320
I want to see you take action.

169
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,320
Let's go, good boy.

170
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,360
[This is my house.]

171
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,080
[I certainly can't let you cook.]

172
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,560
[Let's wait for Ding.]

173
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,920
[We will wait to try Jing's cooking then.]

174
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,640
What are you looking at?
Why didn't you go in?

175
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,840
Nothing.

176
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
How is it, Ding?

177
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,960
The brisket today is going to impress you.

178
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,680
It smells so nice.

179
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
It will taste even better
with some coriander.

180
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,040
Authentic.

181
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
I'll serve this up first.

182
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,560
Ding, hurry up and come out.

183
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,400
Not only do Jia Yun's dishes taste great,

184
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,920
they're presented well, too.

185
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
Here comes the last dish.

186
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,120
Where is the coriander?

187
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,440
Didn't I put some in just now?

188
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,040
If you add coriander,

189
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,640
that's the end of our friendship.

190
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,800
Okay, come on.

191
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,080
Thank you all for coming
to my humble abode today.

192
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
We have fine food,
fine wine, a beauty

193
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,920
and handsome guys like us...

194
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,240
That's enough.

195
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
Can we eat already?

196
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,600
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

197
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,480
Here we go.

198
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
Jing,

199
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm making three-ingredient
dumplings today.

200
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,720
Eat more of this later.

201
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,480
Do we have any vinegar?

202
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,720
Your grandfather has
used up the vinegar.

203
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,440
We don't need vinegar for
three-ingredient dumplings.

204
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,720
Vinegar will drown out the savory taste.

205
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,160
I'm craving vinegar today.

206
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,280
Okay, I'll ask your grandpa to buy one.

207
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,920
Grandma,

208
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,280
I will go.

209
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay, go on then.

210
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,680
It's superb.

211
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,720
Isn't it?

212
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,040
I'll go and check it out.
You guys dig in.

213
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
-It's delicious.
-How is it?

214
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,040
This pork ribs with glutinous
rice taste really good.

215
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,960
What do you want?

216
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,960
I need to borrow some vinegar.

217
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,240
It's in the kitchen. Help yourself.

218
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,640
Jia Yun, you haven't

219
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,880
gotten rusty at all.

220
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,040
It's really delicious.

221
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,640
Have some more.

222
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,280
Orange,

223
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
my little brother is handsome, isn't he?

224
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,720
What are you talking about?

225
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,320
He's just a young boy.

226
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,040
Right, Director He?

227
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,720
Yes, yes, just a young boy.

228
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,720
Young boy.

229
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,400
Here, Ding.

230
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,160
Here, have some shrimp.

231
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,920
Close the door on your way out.

232
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,240
That boy

233
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,600
is really strong.

234
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,160
Here.

235
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,280
Director He,

236
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,600
here's a toast to you.

237
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,920
Without you,

238
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,960
we wouldn't have been able to
finish the film so smoothly.

239
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,200
I've known you for so many years,

240
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,680
you are still as superficial
as you used to be.

241
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,240
By the way, that boy just now...

242
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,240
I'll go.

243
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,640
What do you want this time?

244
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,480
My grandma asked me to borrow some garlic.

245
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,200
Go on, go on.

246
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,640
It's in the refrigerator. Help yourself.

247
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,600
Have some greens.

248
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Sorry about that.

249
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,080
It's okay, it's okay.

250
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
Cheers, Director He.

251
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Thank you, Jia Yun.

252
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,680
I can manage.

253
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,240
Okay, sorry.

254
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,640
What's wrong with him?

255
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
Come on, eat some dishes.

256
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,440
Your door is very solid.

257
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,920
So is my refrigerator.

258
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,920
Come on, cheers.

259
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,040
Cheers.

260
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
Interesting.

261
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,000
Here comes my chance.

262
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,840
Beware, you guys.

263
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,840
Hurry up.

264
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,160
That little brat.

265
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Your grandma hasn't finished cooking?

266
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,840
It's 9 p.m. now, man.

267
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,080
She's making a midnight snack.

268
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,040
What do you want to borrow this time?

269
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,520
-A pan.
-A pan?

270
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,120
You're telling me you
want to borrow a pan?

271
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,040
Any problem with that?

272
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,400
My grandma is getting old.

273
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,720
She forgot where she put her pan.

274
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,480
Unless your grandma

275
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
put her pan in the closet,

276
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,560
there was no way she couldn't find it.

277
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,920
Fine. Come in.

278
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,920
It's in the kitchen. Go help yourself.

279
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,840
Come on, let's carry on.

280
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,440
A pair of sixes.

281
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,640
-A pair of sevens.
-Hold on.

282
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Let her play the cards.

283
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Hold on, no.

284
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
Let her play it.

285
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,160
No.

286
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,800
Play it.

287
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,840
Think before you play.

288
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,040
What's there to think about?

289
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Here you go.

290
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Triple plus one.

291
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,200
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

292
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,440
You can't take it back.
It's on the table now.

293
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,160
I made a mistake.

294
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,840
Don't touch it. I got you. Four jacks!

295
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,200
Triple plus one? Game over.

296
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,200
This...

297
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,160
You lost. It's still your treat tomorrow.

298
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,040
It's getting late now.
I have another date.

299
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,240
-I have to go now.
-Okay.

300
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,440
Okay, bye-bye.

301
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,840
Hey, are you leaving just like this?

302
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,720
Goodbye.

303
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,200
I can't believe I lost.

304
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,880
Ding, now that he's left,

305
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,640
let's play two more
rounds with just the three of us.

306
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,360
Two more rounds. Come on.

307
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,280
Jing,

308
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
why did you bring back a pan?

309
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,960
It's a gift from the
washed-up actor next door.

310
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,000
I think it's used.

311
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,000
Look, it's oily inside.

312
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,480
They are having

313
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,200
braised beef brisket
with potatoes tonight.

314
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,560
I'm going to return
this stupid pot to him.

315
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,400
What a coincidence, Liang Chen.

316
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,840
Indeed. Do you live here?

317
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,480
Let's go.

318
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,240
How are you getting home?

319
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,320
I'm going to book a taxi.

320
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,240
What about your chauffeur?

321
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,880
I gave him the day off.

322
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,280
Let me give you a ride home then.

323
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,400
My house is nearby.

324
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,200
All the more reason I should take
you home and save you the trouble.

325
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,280
You're done with the pan so soon?

326
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
My grandma found her pan.

327
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,880
Congratulations.

328
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,520
Would you like to

329
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,720
borrow anything else then?

330
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,440
How come you've stopped borrowing stuff
since Liang Chen left?

331
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
You're nuts.

332
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,960
Who's nuts?

333
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
You've knocked on my
door several times tonight.

334
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,480
Get real.

335
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,280
That is Liang Chen.

336
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,800
What's that look on your face?

337
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,360
You're not really thinking
of courting her, are you?

338
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,520
She's surrounded by popular celebrities.

339
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,040
Aren't you cold? You're wearing so little.

340
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm fine.

341
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,920
Put some warm clothes on, Liang Chen.

342
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
You're not as strong and healthy
as young people, after all.

343
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,680
He is your fan, isn't he?

344
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,880
Probably.

345
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Young fanboys these
days can be really bold.

346
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,240
The more people adore us,

347
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,960
the greater our responsibility.

348
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,280
But even if they idolise a celebrity,

349
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,120
young people should still have
their priorities straight.

350
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
It'd be improper if they

351
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,520
have some unrealistic expectations.

352
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,680
I used to have unrealistic
expectations too.

353
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,360
For example,

354
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,200
I wanted to be a singer.

355
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,840
Our ride is here.

356
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,080
[Put some warm clothes on, Liang Chen.]

357
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,600
[You're not as strong and healthy
as young people, after all.]

358
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,520
Check.

359
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,520
Was that

360
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,120
Ding Jia Yun last night?

361
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,320
Yes.

362
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,240
He and Liang Chen seemed close.

363
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,680
They are close.

364
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
I mean,

365
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,760
one of them is an actor,
the other one is a singer.

366
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,760
Why are they so close?

367
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,640
When it comes to a man and a woman, it's
either because they have much in common

368
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,680
or...

369
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,400
No, I made a wrong move.

370
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,400
Let me take it back.

371
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,800
Finish your sentence first.

372
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,680
Or they

373
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,840
have feelings for each other.

374
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,280
Yes, this is the right move.

375
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,800
Checkmate.

376
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,430
[Orange]

377
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,040
Hey, what are you doing right now?

378
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm busy. What do you want?

379
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
Are you at home?

380
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Yes, just tell me what you want.

381
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,960
Nothing.

382
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
I'm hanging up, bye-bye.

383
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,040
What was that about?

384
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
[What are you doing right now?]

385
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,400
[Playing with my dog at home.]

386
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,120
Hurry up.

387
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,320
You gave me a fright!

388
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,480
Why are you here?

389
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,880
I just stopped by to see you.

390
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
Stopped by?

391
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,880
I'm busy now. I don't have time for you.

392
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,720
Wait. Since I'm here already,
just let me inside.

393
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,840
I'm here to return something.

394
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,360
Return what?

395
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,400
Is this mine?

396
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,440
I don't remember giving you this stuff.

397
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,080
It's your neighbour's.

398
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,120
That young boy lent this to me last night.

399
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,480
He went to see you off yesterday?

400
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,880
No, the wind was strong last night.

401
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,480
So he lent me his coat.

402
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,120
The wind was strong, was it?

403
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,120
What's with that weird look on your face?

404
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,840
What's wrong with that?

405
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,480
Let me tell you, I'm pretty
and I have a sweet voice.

406
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,120
What's wrong with lending me a coat?

407
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,400
He probably wanted to give me

408
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,400
a big hug too.

409
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,840
I have stuff to do. I should go now.

410
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,320
Since you've come all this way,

411
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,200
why don't you sit down for a while?

412
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,160
Come on.

413
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,080
I don't want to.

414
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,600
Just for a while. It's not like
you haven't met him before.

415
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You just told me that

416
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,160
he probably wanted to give you...

417
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,280
What was it again?

418
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,360
A big...

419
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,600
Here you go.

420
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,120
What were you guys doing just now?

421
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
It's such a coincidence.

422
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,280
You came after we had just
finished two rounds of chess.

423
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,920
Carry on with your game then.

424
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,760
I should go now.

425
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,120
Liang Chen,

426
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,120
didn't you say you came
to return something?

427
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,480
Yes, yes.

428
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,400
Here you go.

429
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,840
Thank you.

430
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,000
You shouldn't have, Liang Chen.

431
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,040
You should keep it.

432
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,400
I should keep it?

433
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,840
[How can I keep it?]

434
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,200
I'd better keep your
token of appreciation then.

435
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,280
[Token of appreciation?]

436
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,120
[What does that mean?]

437
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,800
You are indeed pretty and your voice
is indeed sweet.

438
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,280
I was just joking.

439
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,080
Do you like to joke, Liang Chen?

440
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,160
I do.

441
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,120
That's what friends do among themselves.

442
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,400
Right, Taro?

443
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,040
But I tend to take things seriously.

444
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,600
Then I'll joke less in the future.

445
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,440
Aren't you guys tired

446
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,480
from all this talking?

447
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,120
It's like you're doing a stand-up comedy.

448
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,560
Have a seat and drink some water.

449
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,080
I've got some stuff to do.

450
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm leaving.

451
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,320
Okay, bye.

452
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,480
I will walk her out.

453
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,800
Let me walk you out.

454
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,480
Help me throw the garbage
away on your way out then.

455
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,560
It's okay.

456
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Don't be afraid.

457
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,400
Liang Chen,

458
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,800
are you fantasising about an
elevator malfunction scenario?

459
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,920
No.

460
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Good.

461
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,520
You've been staring at the
alarm for quite some time.

462
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,440
What? Should I be staring at you instead?

463
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,440
Sure.

464
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,800
[How did he manage to say such things]

465
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,640
[without blushing?]

466
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,280
Thank you for walking me out.

467
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,680
Bye-bye.

468
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,680
Liang Chen,

469
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,520
do you want a...

470
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,000
No, no.

471
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,840
Ms Qing,

472
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,960
what brings you here?

473
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,670
I've approved Ke Ke's
annual leave this week.

474
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,190
Finally.

475
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,230
What did you bring me?

476
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,120
I brought you Doubendou Soymilk.

477
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,760
Have a bottle to replenish your nutrients.

478
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,880
Thanks.

479
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,320
The live stream of Beautiful Soul
is going to kick off soon.

480
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,670
Are you ready for it?

481
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,230
Honestly,

482
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,360
my gaming ability

483
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,030
isn't good.

484
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,440
If you really can't handle it,

485
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
ask Sun Bin Yu to lead you in the game.

486
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,560
I can do that?

487
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,400
The organisers intended to find someone

488
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,710
to team up with you.

489
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,630
They even asked me for recommendations.

490
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,360
I have an immature little suggestion.

491
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,560
Hello.

492
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,560
[Hello.]

493
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,800
I am Liang Chen's manager, Liu Yi Qing.

494
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,320
Is this Mr Herman?

495
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,440
Yes, how can I help you?

496
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,920
Here's the thing.

497
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,520
I would like to invite you to join

498
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,400
the live stream promotion of
Beautiful Soul with Liang Chen.

499
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,840
I wonder if you would
be interested in joining?

500
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,760
I need to discuss this

501
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,880
with someone very important to me.

502
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,840
[Can I reply later?]

503
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
Sure, I'll wait for your call. Thank you.

504
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,720
Someone important?

505
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,800
It's 3 p.m. now. I have a phone meeting.

506
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,200
Someone very important?

507
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,040
Who?

508
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,080
So it's me.

509
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,960
[Liang Chen's manager called me just now.]

510
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,520
[She invited me to join Liang Chen in
the live stream of Beautiful Soul.]

511
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,120
[Say yes then.]

512
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,920
Trying to get me to lead you
by using another account?

513
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,440
Nice try.

514
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,080
[Doesn't it bother you that
I'm leading another girl?]

515
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,240
Should I tell him that

516
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,800
I am Liang Chen?

517
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,720
No, no.

518
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,720
I can't tell him.

519
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,240
[I don't mind. Go right ahead.]

520
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,880
[But it bothers me.]

521
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,560
[You're my only pupil.]

522
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,920
[How can I simply team up with others?]

523
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,280
[So]

524
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,280
[I'd better reject Liang Chen's offer.]

525
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,040
[Sadako, Sadako!]

526
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,960
[Goodness, Sadako!]

527
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,080
[You're so well nourished.
How can you die?]

528
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,960
[Sadako...]

529
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,920
[There are socks in the
house I haven't washed.]

530
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,360
[Can you wash it for me?]

531
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,320
[Sure. I will wash it all.]

532
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,000
[As long as you don't die.
Please don't die.]

533
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,520
[Don't die. Hang it there.]

534
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,160
[Hang in there.]

535
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,480
[Don't die now. Not now.]

536
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,800
Hello.

537
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,760
Do the live stream with me.

538
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,920
You don't even bother to start the

539
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,960
conversation with a greeting now?

540
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,680
I'm in no mood for this. Yes or no?

541
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,360
No.

542
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,080
I have a reputation to keep.

543
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,320
Taro, you disappointed me.

544
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,240
Are you that upset?

545
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,040
Let me give you a solution.

546
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,840
Talk to my little brother.

547
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,040
[He'd be happy to help.]

548
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,280
He turned me down.

549
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,240
[What?]

550
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,160
He turned you down?

551
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,840
That shouldn't be.

552
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,360
Why?

553
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,880
Isn't he your fan?

554
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,200
Being in the same room with his idol
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

555
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,240
How could he not appreciate it?

556
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,560
[You're my only pupil.]

557
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,920
[How can I simply team up with others?]

558
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,280
[So]

559
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,240
[I'd better reject Liang Chen's offer.]

560
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,800
It's a complicated story.

561
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,880
I've got to go.

562
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,320
I'll figure this out on my own. Bye.

563
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,760
I wonder what Ding is doing.

564
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,800
He's probably really free.

565
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,400
Ding,

566
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,800
our girl Liang Chen

567
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,040
is having a big problem right now.

568
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,680
Don't you think we should
give her a little help?

569
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,070
[Ding Jia Yun]

570
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,520
Hello, Jia Yun.

571
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,680
Hello, Liang Chen.

572
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,840
Do you need my help with the live stream?

573
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,600
What a coincidence, Lu Jing.

574
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,600
Have you eaten?

575
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,560
No.

576
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,320
You actually turned down your
idol's invitation to do the live stream.

577
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm waiting for her to beg me
when she fails to find anybody.

578
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,800
Young boy, you're still too young.

579
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,280
Do you really think Liang Chen won't
be able to find someone to help her?

580
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,240
She invited you?

581
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,840
No.

582
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
She's going to invite the
more capable one, of course.

583
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,200
Ding Jia Yun?

584
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,040
You may be terrible at making choices,

585
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,560
but you're pretty good at guessing.

586
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,920
Jia Yun,

587
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,880
it is just an ordinary live stream.

588
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,320
I don't want to trouble you.

589
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,320
It's fine. I've got time.

590
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,040
It really is no big deal.

591
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,480
I don't want to trouble you.

592
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,720
Chen Chen.

593
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,120
Jia Yun, hold on.

594
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,360
-What's the matter?
-Herman called.

595
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,160
He said he wants to do
the live stream with you.

596
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,400
He said yes?

597
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,560
Really?

598
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,320
Okay, one moment.

599
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,440
[Hello, Jia Yun.]

600
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,320
Hello.

601
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,680
[Ms Qing has settled it for me.]

602
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,040
But thank you anyway.

603
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,120
No worries.

604
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,520
That settles it, then.

605
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,840
Bye-bye.

606
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,920
He said yes!
