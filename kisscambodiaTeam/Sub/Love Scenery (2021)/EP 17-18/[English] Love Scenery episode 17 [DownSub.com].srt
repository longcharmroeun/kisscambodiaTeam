4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello.

5
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,860
Why did you answer
the phone call so quickly?

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,780
I've been waiting for you.

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,780
Do you want to come to my concert?

8
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,180
Sure.

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,180
Are you not going to ask why?

10
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,180
You can come now.

11
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,640
Sure.

12
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,020
Have you left home?

13
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,020
Yes, I've left home.

14
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
My acting career is coming to an end

15
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,860
yet I still have the mood to doll up.

16
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,040
Boss.

17
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
You stayed up all night for the shoot.

18
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,380
You should take a rest today.

19
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,360
Wait for me in the car.

20
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,580
I'll join you later.

21
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,700

Hello, Jia Yun.

25

Yi Qing.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,100
How is she doing?

27
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,540
Are you free?

28
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,020
Let's meet up.

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,160
Okay.

30
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,980
Vocal cord polyps?

31
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,580
How is she feeling?

32
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,020
She appears to be fine.

33
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
However, the more she pretends,

34
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,380
the more worried I am.

35
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,820
This way, please.

36
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,080
Come in.

37
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
Here?

38
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,380
A concert?

39
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,940
This could be

40
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,560
the most special concert

41
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,420
of my life.

42
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,620
Your voice...

43
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,340
Are you okay?

44
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,580
Be good and take a seat.

45
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Take a seat.

46
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,160
Just enjoy

47
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,180
being the only audience in the concert.

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,660
Everyone's life

49
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,180
is full of accidents.

50
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,380
Sometimes you're surprised.

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,980
Sometimes you feel helpless.

52

53
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,940
is specially dedicated to
the only member of the audience.

Yes.

I feel sorry for you.

60
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,880
You might not be able to listen

61

in the future.

Liang Chen.

63
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,140
What did the doctor say yesterday?

64
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,440
What other songs do you want to hear?

65
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,580
I'll sing them for you.

66
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,660
Are you sure I can choose any song?

67
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

68
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,420
Don't mind if I do.

69
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,940
I wish to listen to all your songs.

70

71
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,900
I'll sing

72

73
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,080
Sure.

74
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,300
You sang a few songs for me.

75
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,900
It's my turn to sing.

76
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,520
What's wrong?

77
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,540
Was it because I sang awfully?

78
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,020
I'm just wondering,

79
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,580
do I really have to

80
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,500
let other people ruin my songs
moving forward?

81
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,580
I didn't mean to ruin your song.

82
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,340
I'm just kidding.

83
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,460
It's because

84
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,100
moving forward,

85
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,580
I may not be able to sing anymore.

86
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,060
I have vocal cord polyps.

87
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,220
The doctor recommended me

88
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,460
to undergo a surgery.

89
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,180
I'm so scared.

90
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm worried that I can't sing anymore.

91
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,380
I just want to sing.

92
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,980
I don't want to go through a surgery.

93
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,640
Don't worry.

94
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,440
Don't worry.

You have class tomorrow, right?

99

You should go home now.

I need to talk to Liang Chen
about something important.

101
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,860
I'm done talking with Liang Chen.

102
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,880
Please hold on.

103
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,500
Are you aware of her health condition?

104
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,440
It's so cold.

105
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,000
How could you take her on a walk?

106
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,200
She's a singer.

107
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,460
She's not like you.

108
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,220
If you hadn't interrupted,

109
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,980
I would've sent her home.

110
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,260
Jia Yun, what's the matter?

111
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,160

Thank you for your time.

113
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,940
Rest early.

114
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,020
It's so cold.

115
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,220
Don't let her stay outside for too long.

116
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,340
I'll get going.

117
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Bye.

118

I was told

121
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,620
something is wrong with your voice.

122
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,520
Jia Yun, I'm fine.

123
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,560
Don't worry about me.

124
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,520
Liang Chen, you don't have to
pretend to be strong

125
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,220
in front of me.

126
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm really okay.

How is that possible?

128

If you lose your voice,

129
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,860
you will lose your career.

131
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,100
Are you really okay

132
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,660
or are you just refusing to admit
that you're not okay?

133
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,520
We tried to reach you the whole day,

134
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,780
but your phone was turned off.

135
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,780
I'm sorry.

136
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,140

It's okay.

138
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,700
You must be tired.
Go home to take a rest.

139
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,960
Don't worry about your voice.

140

151
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm reading for fun.

152
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,860
Are you thinking of switching careers?

If you're so free,

161
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,220
wash my stockings.

162
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,860
If you don't want to wash them, fine.

163
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm so scared.

164

I'm worried that I can't sing anymore.

165
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,980
I just want to sing.

166
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,500
I don't want to go through a surgery.

167
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,700
I want to sing

168
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,620
no matter what happens.

169
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,800
Jing.

170
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,700
Jing.

171
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,980
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

172
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,040
-I have something to do.
-What is that?

173
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,960
Are you meeting up with
your internet friend?

174
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,880
When are you going to

175
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,540
introduce your internet friend to us?

176
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,940
Don't even think about it.

177
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,260
Oh no.

178
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,560
What's wrong?

179
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,980
Do you think

180
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,180
Lu Jing would fall in love
with someone distasteful?

181
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,600
No way.

182
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,080
Therein lies the problem.

183
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,220
Why does he refuse
to introduce his internet friend to us?

184
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,980
Is he worried that
I might steal his girlfriend?

185
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,200
Zhou Zhou.

186
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,640
Do you have a fever?

187
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,540
Don't touch me!

188
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,500
That's why,

189
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,740
based on my analysis,

190
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,580
Jing might have fallen for a man.

191
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,980
Are you serious?

192
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,740
Let me break it down for you.

193
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,440
Until now, Jing's internet friend

194
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,220
has been using a voice changer.

195
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,760
They might have fallen in love
with each other

196
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,280
before they met up.

197
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,160
When they met up,

198
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,620
they realised that
the other party was a man.

199
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,560
What should they do?

200
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,220
He could only accept it.

201
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,200
Otherwise, why does he refuse

202
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,300
to let us see his crush even until now?

203
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,940
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

204
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,740
Let's follow him in secret.

205
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,760
Lu Jing!

206
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,040
Wait for me.

207
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,860
What? Cut to the chase.

208
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,300
Qi Qi and I have become a couple.

209
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,100
So?

210
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,700
Let me buy you some soy milk.

211
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,860
To celebrate my escape from singledom.

212
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Where is the soy milk?

213
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,820
Get it yourself.

214
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,080
Can't you see I'm injured?

215
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,660
It's okay. I'll skip it.

216
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,660
You're just pretending to be injured.

217
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,320
You're wrapping yourself up like a mummy.

218
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,060
What if you get hurt for real one day?

219
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,140
What do you know?

220
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,840
One has to sacrifice

221
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,180
in order to win a lady's heart.

222
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,060
That's enough. Stop following me.

223
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,340
Help me out.

224
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,200
It's difficult to walk like this.

225
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm heading out too.

226
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,380
He's doomed.

227
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,220
I was right.

228
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,860
Well...

229
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,860
Are you kidding me?

230
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,800
I knew it.

231
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,260
He talks about Box Spirit all the time.

232
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,420
Have you seen any player
worse than Gu Fei Ming?

233
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,540
You haven't, right?

234
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,680
Hey.

235
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,380
How is it? Are you feeling better today?

236
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,700
I feel so much better.

237
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,220
I...

238
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,740
I still don't want to get the surgery.

239
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,740
I opt for a conservative treatment.

240
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,540
I will recover eventually.

241
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,660
Chen Chen.

242
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,100
You're a singer.

243
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,860
You'll use your voice all the time.

244
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,240
If you opt for a conservative treatment
by taking medicine only,

245
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,900
it won't be fully cured.

246
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,340
What if the condition becomes worse

247
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,260
when the treatment process is prolonged?

248
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,560
If you don't want to get
the surgery right away,

249
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,740
it's okay.

250
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,100
Take a few days off.

251
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,860
We'll go for the surgery
after you've made up your mind.

252
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,640
I have singing classes to attend.

253
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,180
I can't take a few days off.

254
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,460
I've applied for a leave for you.

255
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,520
What about the theme song of the movie?

256
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,660
Forget it. I'm turning it down.

257
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,160
How can we do that?

258
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,560
Why didn't you ask me first?

259
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,740
You're not fit to work.

260
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,880
But you knew

261
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,080
how important this opportunity is to me.

262
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,740
Your health is more important
than anything else.

263
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,300
In the next two days,

264
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,400
you should stay home and rest.

265
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,700
Don't think too much.

266
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,920
Something came up.

267
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,880
I need to go back to the office.

268
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,140
I can't keep you company.

269
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,580
Take good care of yourself.

270
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,320
See you.

271
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,300
Lu Jing!

272
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,740
Lu Jing!

273
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,740
Lu Jing!

274
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,380
You bought so much food.

275
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,260
Are you having a feast?

276
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,260
Lu Bao Bei!

277
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,660
Did you miss me?

278
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,860
Why are you here?

279
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,300
I'm here to take it for a walk.

280
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,380
I'm not in the mood.

281
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,220
What's wrong? Did you get rejected?

282
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,260
Can't you show your friend some concern?

283
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,520
What's wrong? Why are you so touchy?

284
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,340
You don't even know that
Liang Chen has fallen sick.

285
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,140
Is that how you treat your friend?

286
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,020
Liang Chen has fallen sick?

287
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,380
What kind of sickness?

288
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,060
What's wrong, Lu Jing?

289
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,700
Lu Jing, are you abandoning your dog?

290
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,620
Lu Jing!

291
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,620
Lu Bao Bei.

292
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,940
It's been a while
since you went on an excursion, right?

293
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,660
Let's explore the world. What do you say?

294
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,900
So it's a deal, right?

295
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,360
Let's go.

296
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,660
Let's go.

297
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,660
Jing.

298
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,020
What are you doing?

299
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,020
The actor next door is sick.

300
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,900
Her throat is not feeling well.

301
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,580
You're lying.

302
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,700
You're pursuing someone, aren't you?

303
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,660
Grandma, actually,

304
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,180
your future granddaughter-in-law
has fallen sick.

305
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,420
I want to make her some soup.

306
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,780
You should have told me earlier.

307
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,060
Here, let me see.

308
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,780
Jing.

309
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,180
You're chopping vegetables
using a boning knife.

310
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,100
What soup are you making?

311
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,640
Radish soup with monk fruit.

312
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,920
I'll make a few side dishes too.

313
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,520
All right, leave it to me.

314
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,660
Wash the vegetables.

315
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,940
Thank you, Grandma.

316
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,020
My goodness, what a mess.

317
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,140
I'm home.

318
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,180
Something smells good.

319
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,580
The food looks good.

320
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,100
Who is it for?

321
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,320
Are you

322
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,800
cooking for your dancing partner?

323
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,940
Don't talk nonsense.

324
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,080
Let me try it.

325
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,200
-Don't touch it.
-I just want a taste.

326
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,980
Jing made this.

327
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,860
Jing made this?

328
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,500
How is that possible?

329
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,000
Our future daughter-in-law
has fallen sick.

330
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,800
After knowing that, Jing

331
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,620
immediately asked me to teach him
how to cook.

332
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,020
I see.

333
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,340
You've grown up.

334
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,540
By the way,

335
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,940
Jing,

336
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,100
bring her some Doubendou Soy Milk.

337
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,280
She must have lost her appetite
since she's sick.

338
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,420
Let her have some nutritious drinks.

339
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,860
It's good for her body.

340
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,400
-Sure.
-Look, he's shy.

341
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,400
All right, I'll leave it to you.

342
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,300
He's grown up. Jing has grown up.

343
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,140
We're off. Take your time.

344
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,500
♫ Let youth bloom ♫

345
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,720
♫ Let youth bloom ♫

346
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,140
♫ In the sea of dream ♫

347
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,040
♫ Each second ♫

348
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,280
♫ Stubbornness is ♫

349
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,380
Ms Liang, it's time to eat.

350
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,940
Are you home?

351
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,180
Yes.

352
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,240
Open the door!

353
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,820
It's so cold out here!

354
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,140
Why are you here?

355
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,620
Can we talk inside?

356
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,020
It's so cold here.

357
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,900
Come in now.

358
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,940
Come in.

359
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,700
Why don't you take a seat?

360
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,760
Sure.

361
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,060
Ke Ke. Ke Ke.

362
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,940
Do you mind leaving now?

363
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,040
He just came in,

364
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,620
and you're already kicking me out.

365
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,500
I haven't finished the food.

366
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,820
Then take it back with you.

367
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,380
Will you hurry up?

368
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,100
I haven't eaten.

369
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,780
How can I hurry?

370
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,680
Give me that.

371
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,100
All right, you can leave now.

372
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,260
Don't find any excuses to come back.

373
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,700
Why are you back?

374
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,780
Hurry up!

375
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,860
Here.

376
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,380
It's nutritious and healthy.

377
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,760
Thank you.

378
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,260
It's made with love.
Have it while it's warm.

379
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,520
Try it.

380
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,060
Try this.

381
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,080
It's good for your throat.

382
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,020
Have more.

383
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,949
Is it tasty?

384
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,540
Was it made by you?

385
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,600
No.

386
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,810
Did you hurt your hand?

387
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,060
No, Lu Bao Bei bit me.

388
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,060
Your dog sure has huge teeth.

389
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,860
Hold on. Let me dress your wound.

390
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,500
Is it painful?

391
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,000
No.

392
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,600
It's done.

393
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,340
Given your dressing skills,

394
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,980
you should only dress me.

395
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,780
Don't dress anyone else.

396
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,020
Are you okay? Did I touch your wound?

397
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,100
Is it painful?

398
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,460
You lied.

399
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,420
What's wrong?

400
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,480
Chen Chen.

401
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,220
Mind if I look around?

402
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,300
Ms Ma.

403
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,780
You're there, right?

404
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,860
Ms Ma, please open the door.

405
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,360
Ms Ma, please open the door.

406
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,280
It's such a beautiful day.

407
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,080
Don't you want to go
on a walk with the dog

408
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,900
and have a chat?

409
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,340
Ms Ma, let's go for a stroll.

410
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,600
Ms Ma.

411
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,400
Ms Ma!

412
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,960
Ms Ma!

413
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,280
Ms Ma!

414
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,460
Ms Ma!

415
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,860
Ms Ma, can you hear me?

416
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,940
Ms Ma!

417
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,960
If you don't open up,

418
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,460
Lu Bao Bei will pee at the door.

419
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,800
Ms Ma!

420
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,620
Ms Ma!

421
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,200
Ms Ma!

422
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,800
Ms Ma!

423
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,680
Ms Ma!

424
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,700
Hello, Ms. Ma.

425
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,920
[I'm at the door.]

426
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,280
Just open the door.

427
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,380
You don't have to call me.

428
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,680
Why are you making noise?

429
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,200
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

430
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,780
I just want to catch up with you.

431
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,320
If you don't open the door,

432
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,660
[the neighbours are going to get angry.]

433
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,340
Ms Ma, you...

434
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,560
Ms Ma, why are you eating takeout?

435
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,420
-It's so unhealthy.
-What do you want?

436
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,140
I'm worried, that's all.

437
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,820
Liang Chen is sick.

438
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,540
I feel bad for her.

439
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,860
Aren't you curious

440
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,220
what happened to your university mate?

441
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,940
She should go to hospital if she's sick.

442
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,100
What does it have to do with me?

443
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,140
I'm worried.

444
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,140
I'm here to see

445
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,440
if you have any suggestions.

446
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,400
After all, you were a music major

447
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,520
back in university, too.

448
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,880
When it comes to voice,

449
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,460
you're more experienced than I am.

450
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,740
What happened to Liang Chen?

451
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,620
What else?

452
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
She's got the blues.

453
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,560
So her voice is deteriorating.

454
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,860
Her voice?

455
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,180
Is it hoarseness?

456
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,020
It could be itchiness.

457
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,460
It could be a blockage, too.

458
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,720
Well, the doctor said that

459
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,980
her throat...

460
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,780
I mean vocal cord...

461
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,180
Vocal cord polyps?

462
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,320
Yes!

463
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,420
That's it.

464
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,180
See? You do know your stuff.

465
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,900
Liang Chen

466
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,700
must be very sad right now.
