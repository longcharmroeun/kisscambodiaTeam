00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,800
What's wrong with Liang Chen?

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,720
What else could it be?

6
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,280
It's like...

7
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,840
Well, the doctor said

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,080
her throat...

9
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,070
The vocal cords.

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,229
Vocal polyps.

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,539
Yes!

12
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,500
That's the one.

13
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,320
See, Ms Ma is the experienced one.

14
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
Liang Chen

15
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,760
must be feeling depressed now.

16
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,140
This is where I normally compose music.

It's my workplace in general.

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,240

Feel free to look around.

20
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
Okay.

21
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,079
Hi, Jia Yun.

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,170
Liang Chen.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,440
Tomorrow noon,

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,710
could you spare me some time?

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,870
Why?

26

[This is the thing.]

27

My uncle

28
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,760
is an otolaryngologist.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,240
He is a leading expert
in treating vocal polyps.

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,880
[I've shown him your medical record.]

31
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,000
[He made a new diagnosis
and treatment plan for you.]

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,680
I hope you can meet
him as soon as possible.

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,240
Treatment plan? Is it surgery?

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,560
Surgery might be unavoidable.

35
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,630
Thanks, Jia Yun.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,320
I need some time to think it over.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,220
Okay.

38
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,030
Once you made up your mind,

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,200
let me know.

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Okay.

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,990
What are you looking at?

42
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,200
This is Foster's violin.

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,600
How do you know about it?

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,870
This is a handmade violin from the UK.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
I have an identical one.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,640
You know how to play violin?

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,800
I can play all your songs.

48
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,320
Can I have a listen?

49
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,940
No problem.

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
But...

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,880
You have to promise me one thing.

52
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,800
What is it?

53
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
I will let you know later.

54
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,800
I still remember I once went to school,

55
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,080
I overheard someone playing this song.

56
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,510
That was not you, right?

57
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,159
You overheard it?

58
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,600
I never would have
thought that you could play so well.

59
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,920
Actually I saw you that day.

60
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,920
I was in my car.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,320
Were you outside?

62
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,920
I recognized you at first glance.

63
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,560
Why are you giggling?

64
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,700
I see something

65
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,280
on your face.

66
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,200
Is it dirt?

67
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,520
Eye boogers.

68
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,950
I'm just kidding.
You actually believed it?

69
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,990
Of course not.

70
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,200
You seem happy,

71
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,400
so I'm willing to play along.

72
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,980
Senior.

73
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,040
It's time for you to keep your promise.

74
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,520
What promise?

75
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,520
Please get your medical treatment.

76
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,250
But...

77
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm afraid.

78
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,320
Senior.

79
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
If this accident hadn't taken place,

80
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,159
once you are 30 years old,

81
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,880
or even 40 years old,

82
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,630
would your voice still be the same?

83
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
Of course not.

84
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,520
Will you still be singing then?

85
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,320
I will sing as long as I live.

86
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,200
Your voice quality

87
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,960
might change as age catches up,

88
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,840
but your strength won't be weakened,

89
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,050
and technique will
gradually get stronger too.

90
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,720
I believe

91
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,520
the change

92
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
would just be in your tone

93
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,630
or singing techniques.

94
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,360
Right?

95
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,830
Do you really think I can do it?

96
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
There are so many songs

97
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,740
I want to hear you sing.

98

I've made up my mind.

104
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
I want to go for medical treatment.

105
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
So I wonder if you could

106
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,160
help me to contact your uncle?

107
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,400
[I knew it.]

108
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,040

110
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm here just to take two books.

111

Where were you?

114
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,420
I met a friend, that's all.

115
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,080
Then...

116
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,170
Did you both

117
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,880
have fun?

118
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,240
What are you all trying to imply?

119
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,520
Nothing, nothing.

120
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,310
Oh yes, your virtual friend,

121
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,800
is she from our school?

122
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,930
Yes.

123
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,350
What's wrong with you all?

124
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
Jing, I...

125
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,630
I know this is not an easy journey,

126
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,600
but just ignore
those judgemental ones.

127
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Keep it up!

128
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,560
We'll always back you up.

129
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
Are you all stalking me?

130
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,040
Don't you spread one word about it.

131
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,090
We understand.

132
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,790
If this was made known to others,

133
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,240
it won't be good for both of you.

134
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,680
Don' worry, Jing.

135
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,640
It's a deal.

136
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,480

Just attend your class.

140

What are you doing?

143
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,400
Be careful, my leg!

144
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,600
What are you trying to do?

145
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
Aren't you wounded?

146

We are escorting you to class.

147

We'll soon be family.

148
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,880
You just cannot count on this person,

149
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,920
going to class by himself
without even thinking to help out.

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,760
Exactly.

151
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,240
But please don't worry.

152
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
We will admonish him later.

153
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,400
Say, he doesn't even know
how to be tender and loving.

154
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,030
He's bad at caring for others.

155
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,190
Keep your voice down!

156
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,350
He told us not to be ostentatious.

157
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,530
Ostentatious? Seriously?

158
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,890
We are helping him.

159
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
What are you talking about?

160
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,720
Go to class.

[Okay, let me know if you need anything.]

165
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
You are seeing doctor this afternoon.

We'll go with you.

167
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Don't worry, Jia Yun will be there.

168
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,280
You were against
getting the surgery, right?

169
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,080
What changed your mind?

170
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,960
I've thought this through.

171
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,240
Even without surgery,

172
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,640
as age catches up,

173
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,400
my voice will still change.

174
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,320
But not my skills.

175
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,960
As far as my techniques go,
they will only get better.

176
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,680
It's my voice that changes.

177
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Just a different singing technique.

178
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,480
So, It's not that scary after all.

179
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,920
I'm a roly-poly,

180

[Tai He Medical Hall]

185
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,160
How is it, uncle?

186
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,720
In my opinion,

187
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,600
you don't need a surgery for this.

188
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,200
When you were first diagnosed,

189
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,640
it was due to over-usage of your voice,

190
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,890
which caused haemorrhage from phonotrauma.

191
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,030
There was inflammation.

192
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,310
When you got a laryngoscopy,

193
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,840
it looked rather severe.

194
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,280
Now the result show that

195
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,520
the inflammation has healed.

196
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,560
Redness and swelling are basically gone.

197
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Most importantly, your polyps are not big.

198
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,040
I will prescribe some medication,

199
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,320
and combine it with nebulization.

200
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,280
A complete recovery is highly possible.

201
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Is that so? That's wonderful.

202
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,920
Thank you very much.

203
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
But please take precaution in the future.

204
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,960
Do not overuse your voice.

205
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,670
Have a light diet.

206
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,990
Take note on work-rest balance,

207
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,680
Take good care of your vocal cords.

208
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,630
Don't worry.

209
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
I'll take good care of

210
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
of my own vocal cords.

211
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
That's great.

212
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
Jia Yun.

213
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,280
Thank you so much.

214
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm glad you're alright now.

215
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,920
I'm surprised that I don't
have to go through surgery.

216
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,160
What wonderful news.

217
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
Lu Lu Xiu.

218
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,720
Is she is alright now?

219
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,000
Shan Shan, what brings you here?

220
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
I...

221
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
I was on the way, so I decided to drop by.

222
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,640
Jia Yun.

223
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,800
You both take your time.

224
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,960
I'll be off.

225
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,040
Jia Yun, I can't thank
you enough for everything.

226
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,080
I'll treat you to a meal.

227
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
Sure.

228
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,420
-Bye.
-Bye.

229
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,520
Let's go in.

230
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,240
Is that for me?

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,680
Here's the old duck
soup from behind the campus.

232
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,330
I remember it was your favourite.

233
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,500
It has been a long time
since I last had it.

234
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,960
It still tastes as good as it used to be.

235
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,040
Seems like it's still the same owner.

236
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,520
Are you okay?

237
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,480
I'm fine, why?

238
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
I heard from Sun Bin Yu

239
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,600
there's something wrong
with your vocal cords .

240
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,990
I went for a consultation today.

241
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,280
The doctor told me

242
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,720
that my vocal cords can recover.

243
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm glad. I was so worried.

244
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,980
Glad that you're fine.

245
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,280
You treat your vocal cords
as important as your life.

246
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,200
When I got here, I was thinking
how I should console you.

247
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,960
I was thinking,
it doesn't really matter anyway.

248
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
I stayed away from music for so long,

249
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,200
yet I'm still doing fine, aren't I?

250
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,960
Take more.

251
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,250
I'll leave you be.

252
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
Shan Shan.

253
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,640
Could you stay a little longer with me?

254
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
What's wrong?

255
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,920
I have no idea what's up with me.

256
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,600
Perhaps

257
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,720
I'm still frightened.

258
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
I thought

259
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I could no longer sing like I used to be.

260
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,760
You have no idea.

261
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,720
When I got my letter of diagnosis,

262
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,040
I was really shocked.

263
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,400
I was thinking,

264
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
if I couldn't sing any more,

265
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,520
what else could I do?

266
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,280
I couldn't just be an airhead.

267
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,440
Everything is alright now.

268
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,970
It's alright now.

269
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,480
[Liang Chen]

270
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,840
Hi, how is everything going?

271
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,600
Where are you?

272
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,080
Wait for me. I will be right there.

273
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,460
Aunty.

274
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,870
-Aunty.
-Who's that?

275
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,360
Stop shouting.

276
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
The place is closed.

277
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,680
What do you want?

278
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,440
Aunty, my girlfriend is in danger.

279
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,640
Could you open the door for me?

280
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,090
Young people nowadays are impulsive.

281
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,680
Just stay calm.

282
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,040
Don't quarrel.

283
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,680
Everything will be okay.

284
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,160
Just persuade her gently will do.

285
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,560
Everything will
eventually fall into place.

286
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Thanks, aunty.

287
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,040
Be careful!

288
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,080
No quarrelling!

289
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Liang Chen!

290
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,320
Call me 'senior'.

291
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,760
Are you okay?

292
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
I went to the hospital today.

293
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,840
The doctor said,

294
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,720
I can no longer sing.

295
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,960
Don't worry.

296
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,520
There will always be other options.

297
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,480
But please don't harm yourself.

298
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,620
I'm kidding!

299
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,670
It's not serious.

300
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,920
No surgery required.

301
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,400
Are you...

302
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
angry?

303
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,360
Please don't be mad at me.

304
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
I was just joking with you.

305
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,950
Okay, I'm sorry.

306
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,240
Okay, I'm not angry any more,

307
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,080
for the sake of your pitiful look.

308
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,880
How dare you lie to me?

309
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,720
Senior.

310
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,920
Can I be your boyfriend?

311
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,540
That depends on your performance.

312
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,200
Then can I

313
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
hold your hand?

314
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,320
No, you can't.

315
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,200
Then what about...

316
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,720
No, you can't.

317
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,980
What I'm trying to say is,

318
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,160
can I send you home?

319
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,130
That's...okay.

320
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,870
It's late now after all.

321
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,080
Senior.

322
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,120
Are you a roly-poly?

323
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,600
What do you mean by that?

324
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,280
You always think the other way round.

325
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,080
Lu Jing.

326
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,080
Thank you very much.

327
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,000
I always have my head in the cloud.

328
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,020
Thanks for be with me during this time.

329
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,900
Or else,

330
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,730
I tend to take things too hard.

331
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,410
Do you feel relieved now?

332
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,080
I feel like

333
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,720
I've gotten back something
I had lost earlier.

334
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,270
I've also figured out that

335
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,640
I should start over again.

336
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,680
What you mean by starting all over again?

337
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,720
As for my future,

338
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,600
the moment when I
was ready for surgery

339
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,030
I've planned

340
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,440
for the worst scenario
of losing everything.

341
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,960
But when I found out
I didn't have to have surgery,

342
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,360
the very first thought
that came to me was that

343
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,120
from now on,

344
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
I'll only sing

345
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
the songs that I myself like.

346
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,520
Then?

347
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,800
Then what?

348
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,160
Am I not part of your

349
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
future planning?

350
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,180
It's cold in the corridor.

351
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,800
Go inside and rest.

352
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,550
Good night.

353
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,840
Good night.

354
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,680
Bye.

355
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,200
Waiting for me?

356
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,120
You're back.

357
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,400
No class tomorrow?

358
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Throwing garbage again?

359
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,000
Obviously.
I can't be patrolling the grounds.

360
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,440
I think that's a good idea.

361
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,590
The neighbourhood is
not quite safe recently.

362
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,400
I can hardly see a patrol guard.

363
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,320
Don't worry. It's very safe.

364
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,140
What an amorous smile.

365
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,820
Something good happened recently?

366
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,650
Good thing?

367
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,440
You mean love?

368
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,120
How dare you talk about
love in front of a bachelor.

369
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,920
Lu Jing, that's too much!

370
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,590
Okay, then stop talking about love.

371
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,520
Let's talk about dreams.

372
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,160
Bye.

373
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,440
Come, let's go home.

374
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,040
He's too arrogant.

375
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
Flaunting about love and ideals.

376
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,120
As if he is the only one
who is experienced.

377
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,600
Deep inside the inferno,

378
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,680
