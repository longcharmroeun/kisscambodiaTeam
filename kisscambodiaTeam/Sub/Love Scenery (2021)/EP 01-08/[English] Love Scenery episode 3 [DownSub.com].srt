00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,230
[You're in a good mood today.]

187
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,840
[A little bit.]

188
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,640
[A little bit.]

189
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,200
1264.

190
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,200
1265.

191
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,920
1266.

192
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,760
1267.

193
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,280
1228.

194
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,840
1269.

195
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,040
Hold on, I need a break.

196
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,280
Just a short break.

197
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,720
[Who are those two next to you?]

198
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,320
My finger slipped.
I clicked on the wrong mode.

199
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,640
They are passerby players.

200
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,400
[It's fine.]

201
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
[Four players won't be an issue.]

202
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,960
I'll assign tasks later,

203
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll team up with you.

204
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,440
Okay.

205
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,720
[Mission One. Please search
for the entrance to the tomb.]

206
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,240
Guys, are you there?

207
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,360
I'll assign the tasks.

208
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,720
Oh my god.

209
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,760
Herman!

210
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,400
Are you Herman?

211
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,640
I can't believe I got to
be matched with Herman.

212
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,120
Am I going to win this round
without having to lift a finger?

213
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,240
Please take a photo with us.

214
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,760
Yes, yes.

215
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,040
Herman?

216
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,400
You didn't know I was Herman until now,

217
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,280
did you?

218
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,520
Of course not.

219
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,320
What is Herman?

220
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
What? You don't even know about Herman?

221
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,840
Gaming streamer, Herman.

222
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
You're kidding, right?

223
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,760
You don't know Herman?

224
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,560
The sniper god.

225
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,600
Herman?

226
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,200
Did you play the song Downwind?

227
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
And then, that song became famous?

228
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,440
It was me.

229
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,720
You are a fan of Liang Chen?

230
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,960
Any problem with that?

231
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,520
No problem.

232
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,640
No problem at all.

233
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,880
We'll split into two teams to find clues.

234
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,560
Guys, you're going to
the direction of the camp.

235
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
There are fewer robots over there.

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We're going to the opposite direction.

237
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,720
Whoever finds the entrance
to the tomb first

238
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,680
will inform everyone.

239
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,640
Any questions?

240
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,920
No.

241
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,880
No.

242
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,280
No!

243
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,960
Just shut up.

244
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,400
Why do you like Liang Chen?

245
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,640
Is it because she is
exceptionally outstanding?

246
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,920
Exceptionally beautiful?

247
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,760
Exceptionally talented?

248
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,760
Have you seen it?

249
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,880
There are seven robots out there.

250
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,440
So?

251
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,319
So do you prefer to die by a robot's gun

252
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,720
or mine?

253
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
Let me ask one more question.

254
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,640
One last question.

255
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
What exactly is this mission of ours?

256
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,360
We need to retrieve the rare energy stone

257
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,600
left by the Mayans from the robots.

258
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,560
What is the use of energy stone?

259
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
It's no use for us,

260
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,640
but it can stop the evil robots

261
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
from making powerful weapons
to threaten earth.

262
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,640
Saving the planet.

263
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
I like this mission.

264
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,040
Get in the car.

265
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,440
Coming.

266
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,560
Here's your chance.

267
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,840
Give me a hand.

268
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,960
Don't miss this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

269
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,200
Or you will regret it.

270
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,920
Wait.

271
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,360
I'm your idol!

272
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,240
Sir, wait for me!

273
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
Drive slower!

274
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,840
Sir!

275
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,800
Why did you pick up so many things?

276
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,240
Based on your capability,

277
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,560
the best you can do is running after me.

278
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,720
I picked them up for you.

279
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
They're not for me.

280
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,320
For me?

281
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,720
I read a guide before.

282
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
It said that this is particularly useful.

283
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,560
You're being favoured by god indeed.

284
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,960
You actually found an airdrop gun.

285
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,000
Is this gun that powerful?

286
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,400
It gives longest period of continuous fire

287
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,640
with highest accuracy rate.

288
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,880
It's usually available
in airdrop box only.

289
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,760
Use it then.

290
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,240
I have a lot of other things for you
in my bag.

291
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,600
You see.

292
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,920
Bullets.

293
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,560
And cartridges.

294
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,720
I'm your human backpack now.

295
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,480
Just tell me if you need anything.

296
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,560
You

297
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,040
trust me that much?

298
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,160
Of course.

299
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,920
You are much stronger than

300
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,240
those players in video tutorials.

301
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,280
Since you trust me so much,

302
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,280
-I'll take you for a ride then.
-Okay.

303
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,920
I'll show you
my drift skill in the jungle.

304
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,840
Okay.

305
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,400
Lu Jing, drive slower. I'm scared.

306
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,440
Lu Jing, slower.

307
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
There is a slope ahead!

308
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,760
Don't be afraid.

309
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,040
I'm taking you flying.

310
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,840
Keep showing off.

311
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,320
You've crashed, haven't you?

312
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,600
You called this a crash?

313
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,120
I call this a skilful brake.

314
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,400
Who are you talking to?

315
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,520
My son.

316
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,320
You insolent son,

317
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,160
is this how you talk to your father?

318
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,120
Seriously?

319
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,680
What makes you think

320
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,560
you can pick on me?

321
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,200
Don't fight.

322
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,760
Let go of me, let go.

323
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm going to fight him in real life today.

324
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,820
We'll see about that.

325
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
Come on.

326
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,080
He challenged me!

327
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,320
He... he challenged me!

328
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,920
You promised to take me flying,

329
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,560
but we crashed before we even flew higher.

330
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,760
Wait up.

331
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,040
We found the tomb.

332
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,120
Come here now.

333
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,560
We found the tomb?

334
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,800
You see.

335
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
I told you,

336
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,560
you would find the exit if you follow me.

337
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,000
The luck of a rookie like you who
always dies in the beginning of the game

338
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,360
is usually good.

339
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,240
Can't you just compliment me?

340
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,200
No.

341
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,640
I...

342
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,160
You're welcome...

343
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,800
Not even a thank you.

344
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,720
[Mission One completed.]

345
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,240
[Data has been saved.]

346
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,040
[Next, please get the Mayan Energy Stone.]

347
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,400
-Herman.
-Herman.

348
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,360
Let's hurry up.

349
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,240
Once the door is open,

350
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,600
the robots should be here soon.

351
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,920
You guys go in first
to find the energy stone.

352
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,320
I'll stay here and block them.

353
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,720
You too, go in first.

354
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,480
Are you sure you can do this alone?

355
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,040
Let me stay and help.

356
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Go in.

357
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,600
Stay safe.

358
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,000
[He's stopping the robots all by himself.]

359
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,040
[It's so dangerous.]

360
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,040
Lu Jing.

361
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,400
What are you doing back?

362
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,240
I'm giving you the bullets,
in case you run out of them.

363
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,840
Here.

364
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,080
Smoke bomb.

365
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Here.

366
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,600
Are you trying to blind the enemy

367
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,160
with flash grenade?

368
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,160
Sorry, a mistake.

369
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,960
Here.

370
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,440
Let's go.

371
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,080
It's so foggy.

372
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,760
How are you going to shoot?

373
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,160
See how I did it?

374
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,400
Whenever I shoot,

375
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,360
watch and learn.

376
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,760
I'll try next time.

377
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,760
How do you tell their positions

378
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,320
in this situation?

379
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,880
Before I threw the grenades,

380
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,480
I had already confirmed their positions.

381
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,960
Also,

382
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,440
when you are unable to tell,

383
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,400
just listen.

384
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,280
Expert,

385
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,720
may I have your autograph?

386
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,480
That was such a brilliant performance,

387
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,080
but why aren't your two fans reacting?

388
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,920
For the sake of your return
to give me bullets,

389
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,040
it was a private tutoring.

390
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,160
I didn't press the talk button.

391
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,440
They couldn't hear me.

392
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,040
[Why are you laughing?]

393
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,000
You heard it?

394
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,800
Because I have good hearing.

395
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,520
I just got a feeling like I'm

396
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,200
a person who got only
20 points in mathematics,

397
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,320
and I suddenly received
a tutor by Hua Luo Geng.

398
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
So

399
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,320
you got only 20 points in maths exam?

400
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,280
No.

401
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,320
I don't need to take maths for my major.

402
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,680
Let's go.

403
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,940
Coming.

404
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,280
What are they looking for?

405
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,440
The mechanism to the treasure.

406
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,920
Let's go look for it too.

407
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,240
Just now,

408
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,360
why did you call your roommate, your son?

409
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,840
We might look like roommates,

410
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,200
but actually,

411
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,000
we all want to be each other's father.

412
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,880
Is this how college students
interact with each other nowadays?

413
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,800
You're not a student?

414
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,520
I graduated many years ago.

415
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,800
Did you think

416
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm a student?

417
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
I can't believe

418
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,280
someone would still think I'm a student.

419
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,040
Based on your gaming capability,

420
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,360
you're probably
just an elementary student.

421
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,680
Can't be older than that.

422
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
What's the matter?

423
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,480
It seems that every tone is different.

424
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,480
It's a pentatonic scale.
Do, Re, Mi, Sol and La.

425
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
I found a stone tablet.

426
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
How do we use this?

427
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,280
Looks like it's a music formation.

428
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,440
The five large bells

429
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,840
represent the pentatonic scale.

430
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,600
We should use the musical score
on the stone tablet

431
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
to ring the corresponding bells.

432
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Let me try it.

433
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,880
Go and hit the bell. I'll cover you.

434
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,880
Wait!

435
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,960
Hold on.

436
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,160
Music.

437
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,040
Charge!

438
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,240
What are you doing?

439
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,680
How many bells are left?

440
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,200
One.

441
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,440
Hit the bell!

442
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,200
[Mission Two completed.]

443
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,880
[Data has been saved.]

444
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,360
[Next, please return
the Mayan Energy Stone.]

445
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,040
What is this place?

446
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,800
It's so beautiful.

447
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,320
The energy stone belongs to the universe.

448
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,520
After we returned it,

449
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,480
the system will rain down
meteors automatically.

450
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,520
What happened?

451
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,760
Is the system having a bug?

452
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,800
Did I set off fireworks?

453
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,920
What else could it be?

454
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,960
Oh my god! I actually set off fireworks!

455
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
I actually saw the fireworks!

456
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,680
[This is awesome!]

457
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,720
No way.

458
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,040
I have to take a photo
and share it on my social media.

459
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,480
I have to record this historic moment.

460

461
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,680

Even Orange has set off fireworks.

465
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,360
It made me feel like playing too.

466
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,200
Let me watch a live stream.

467
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,320
[Request channel timed out.
Please re-enter channel.]

468
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,400
What...

469
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,000
What's with the poor network connection?

470
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,040
I can't even watch a live stream.

471
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,640

474
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,800
Ms Ma.

475
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,360
-It's good, it's good.
-It's not bad.

476
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,840
Finally something to look forward to
for the rest of the days.

477
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,120
Rest assured. It's safe, absolutely safe.

478
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,140
I say, you really are a pro.

479
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,080
That was impressive.

480
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,080
I'm fine.

Who are you calling a little box?

486
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,360
Definitely not myself.

487
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,640
Goodbye.

488
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,040
I wonder what he was thinking.

489
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,640
He is obviously an expert player,

490
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,360
why would he use such creepy nickname?
