Bullets have no eyes.
I was afraid of getting hurt.

193

Put on the bulletproof vest.

for invading the earth.

Why does this class

375
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,910
always have a good attendance?

376
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,710
Okay. Let's start our class.

377
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,220
Let's recap

378
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,990
what we learned last time.

379
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,420
[Ocean Deep Chaos National
Undergraduate Challenge in Big Data]

380
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,170
How was it?

381
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,230
Among these four demos,

382
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,070
two of them were composed
by famous producers,

383
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,470
another two were composed by newcomers.

384
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,750
They're all special on their own.

385
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,030
What's the matter?

386
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,430
Still not happy with it?

387
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,110
They're special on their own indeed,

388
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,150
but I can't decide yet now.

389
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,190
This time,

390
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,030
we really spared no effort

391
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,630
to find good songs for you.

392
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,910
But now, it's extremely difficult

393
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,510
to find a good song.

394
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,550
I know.
Mr Zhou, thanks for your hard work.

395
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,390
Then, I'll listen to them again.

396
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,310
If you have something to do, go ahead.

397
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,660
Sure.

398
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,820
Listen to them first.

399
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,190
I really think

400
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,120
that these songs are really good.

401
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,640
Think it over.

402
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:57,930
How did it go?

403
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,350
Anything suitable for the album?

404
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,620
They're not bad,

405
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,690
but I just don't feel anything.

406
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,390
What happened?

407
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,430
Will it get better
if you give it another try?

408
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,430
I'm not sure either.

409
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,250
What is going on?

410
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,790
If you keep staying in your comfort zone,

411
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,950
of course it's boring.

412
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,670
If you want a breakthrough,

413
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,110
you have to take the challenge.

414
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,990
Amazing.

415
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
As expected from our top student.

416
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,910
This is not something that an ordinary
people like me can understand.

417
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,270
This contest only accepts teams.

418
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,330
You know, don't you?

419
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,750
So?

420
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,110
I've signed you up too.

421
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,910
What?

422
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,830
You signed me up for Big Data Contest?

423
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,350
Why do you have confidence in me?

424
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,310
I have confidence in myself.

425
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,430
If you stick with me,

426
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,030
you're bound to make progress.

427
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,030
Where's Lu Jing?

428
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,440
Follow me.

429
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,030
[What time are we meeting tonight?]

430
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,460
[Teachers,]

431
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,389
[propagate the doctrine, impart knowledge
and resolve doubts.]

432
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,830
[Today, we've invited]

433
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,110
[Professor Chen Bei from the artificial
intelligence at Nanze University]

434
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,949
[to explain the current
cutting-edge results.]

435
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,469
Liu,

436
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,429
take me to Nanze University.

437
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,389
Okay.

438
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,870
Chen, why do you want to go
to Nanze University?

439
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,469
To find inspiration.

440
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,590
What are you doing?

441
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,550
Do you remember losing your bet last time?

442
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,270
Now it is time for you to pay the price.

443
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,160
Go!

444
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,390
There is never an end of taking revenge.

445
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,590
If you're a man, learn to let go.

446
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,750
No way.

447
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,790
Dream on it.

448
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,230
You wish.

449
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,230
Follow me.

450
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,110
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

451
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,990
Come on.

452
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,150
Where on earth are you taking me to?

453
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,340
It's definitely

454
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,980
the Faculty of Music.

455
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,550
Let's go, let's go.

456
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,270
Chen, where exactly are you going?

457
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,430
It's right ahead of us,

458
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,430
the Faculty of Music.

459
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,110
Chen, there are so many people here.

460
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,350
Don't worry. Just be careful.

461
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,390
No one will notice us.

462
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,350
I remember
that when I was still a student,

463
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,930
I often felt the magic of music

464
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,150
brought by nature here.

465
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,110
Back then,

466
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,550
all my worries would disappear.

467
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,910
Chen,

468
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,190
you don't have

469
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,590
to make skipping class
sound so novel and sophisticated.

470
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,470
Nature and music are just so magical.

471
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,670
I feel like all the troubles

472
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,310
have gone away now.

473
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,270
Hello.

474
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,150
Hello, hello.

475
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,790
Hello, everyone.

476
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,950
We're the Fantastic Four
from Computing Science.

477
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,420
The guy standing beside us

478
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,870
is a top student
from Computing Science, Lu Jing.

479
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,710
All of you must be tired
from practising.

480
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,190
Next,

481
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,870
let us enjoy

482
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,430
his wonderful solo performance!

483
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,070
A round of applause!

484
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,640
Zhou Zhou,

485
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,230
didn't you say he's tone-deaf?

486
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,360
This melody is so familiar.

487
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,390
Symphony No. 35 in D major.

488
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,880
When I was composing 'You Have Me',

489
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,490
it was my inspiration.

490
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,590
It sounds really nice.

491
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,040
Chen, it's this way.

492
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,700
[Concert Hall]
