00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,980
Good luck!

187
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,140
What do you mean?

188
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,680
Since it's a present,

189
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,140
it'll be more sincere
to obtain it yourself.

190
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,780
You're really stingy!

191
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,740
How can this song be changed like this?

192
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,980
What is this? It's such a mess!

193
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,420
The original version is better.

194
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,700
For me, it's more sure-footed to
sing the original version.

195
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,180
She has been trying to change
these days.

196
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,160
Do you want to drink milk tea?

197
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,020
Yes.

198
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,390
How about you, Lu Jing?

199
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,480
What on earth is in your phone?

200
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,340
Did someone send you red packets?

201
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,700
No, I'll go back to dorm first.

202
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,300
I think there's something
wrong with Lu Jing.

203
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,860
No, isn't he usually like this?

204
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,140
He has been staring
at his phone the whole day.

205
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,340
Was he like this before?

206
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,980
He even smiled at the wall
this morning.

207
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,870
Really?

208
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,220
Don't forget that he had drunk before.

209
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
I know what's going on.

210
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,140
Is Lu Jing trading stocks?

211
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,500
That's why he feels ups and downs.

212
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,180
Don't go.
Did I say anything wrong?

213
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,380
Chen, something's wrong.

214
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,420
Chen, this is bad.

215
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,310
-What is?
-The video of your rehearsal got out.

216
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,320
How is it? Is it particularly great?

217
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,750
No, the Internet has gone crazy.

218
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,090
[Is this Liang Chen?]

219
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,780
[Why is there a vast diversity
in her style?]

220
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,580
[Her agency is to blame.]

221
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,380
[Don't they know
the positioning of Liang Chen?]

222
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,380
[Liang Chen doesn't fit this style.]

223
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,440
[I support our Orange to make changes.]

224
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,460
[Chen Chen, you can do this!]

225
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,560
[Wake up, Liang Chen!]

226
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,080
[Please don't insult rock.]

227
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,660
Are you still planning
to sing this song now?

228
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,300
This is only the fans' opinion.

229
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,660
Okay.

230
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,500
I'll try my best to

231
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,940
fight for you if you insist to.

232
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,260
You don't have to care
about what happens on the Internet,

233
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,180
I'll handle it.

234
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,580
Thank you, Ms Qing.

235
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,860
Hello, Jia Yun.

236
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,820
[Hello, Liang Chen.]

237
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,500
I saw your rehearsal.

238
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,020
Your version of the song is not bad.

239
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,950
Thank you, Jia Yun.

240
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,060
Don't read the comments on the Internet.

241
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,220
[The audience need some time to accept]

242
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,460
[your change after all.]

243
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,980
[Take your time.]

244
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,740
I understand.

245
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,220
Liang Chen,

246
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,420
I...

247
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,780
I think it's better to sing
the original version

248
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,150
on the show tomorrow.

249
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,860
It'll be safer that way.

250
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,660
[It is premature for you to change now.]

251
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,500
Okay, I'll give serious
consideration to it.

252
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,540
Bye bye.

253
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,740
You guys may go back first.

254
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,860
I need some time alone.

255
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,650
Alright, rest well then.

256
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,100
Don't overthink.

257
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,420
[Are you busy?]

258
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,180
[Not really.]

259
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,300
[Are you in a bad mood?]

260
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,900
[How do you know that?]

261
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,220
[I can feel it conversing with you.]

262
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,060
[I'll show you something interesting.]

263
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,070
[Don't be depressed.]

264
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,350
[Just try to fix it if there's a problem.]

265
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,020
[What if I can't fix it?]

266
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,820
[If you still can't fix it
after making efforts,]

267
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,460
[just take a break then.]

268
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,220
Chen,

269
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,900
the production team
has rushed us several times.

270
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,100
You need to make a decision.

271
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,140
What will Liang Chen sing today?

272
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,980
Don't tell me that it's the song
she sang yesterday.

273
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,740
[Is Liang Chen going down the drain?]

274
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,540
[Why is she dabbling in rock music?]

275
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,360
[Liang Chen's voice is
totally unfit for rock music.]

276
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,500
[It's an awful arrangement.]

277
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,900
[She even dared to sing it.]

278
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,780
[If you're not gifted,]

279
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,980
[just keep your nose clean
and sing your love songs.]

280
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,140
Ms Qing, I'm so glad that

281
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Chen is singing the original version.

282
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,900
Finally, I don't have to work overtime.

283
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
Ms Qing, what's wrong?

284
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,060
I don't know why.

285
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,660
I actually feel some loss.

286
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,580
See, it's better to sing
the original version.

287
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,780
You had me worried sick.

288
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,460
I was so worried
you'd sing the new version.

289
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,580
Ke Ke,

290
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,950
go do your work.

291
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,990
Drink some warm water.

292
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,820
Don't stress yourself out.

293
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,320
It's me who overestimated myself.

294
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,340
I'm not well-prepared

295
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,100
to make brand new attempts.

296
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,460
Do you think that I'm terrible?

297
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,740
No.

298
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,070
I think you're really brave.

299
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,220
At least, you already tried to change.

300
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,430
No such thing can be achieved overnight.

301
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,260
Hello.

302
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,780
It was good.

303
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,740
It's true, I saw it.

304
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,180
Let's have dinner together
after completing the show.

305
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,230
Okay.

306
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,820
I haven't had a proper meal

307
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,220
since I had been busy rehearsing.

308
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,700
I booked a restaurant. You'll like it.

309
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,180
Boss, it's our turn soon.

310
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,060
Okay.

311
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,510
Then, I'll go first.

312
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,360
Guess what this is.

313
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,140
I'll give you a hint, 7th of November.

314
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,040
Have you thought of anything?

315
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,380
Data Mining Competition.

316
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,020
What? The competition is on that day?

317
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,580
What should I do then?

318
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,420
I managed to get two

319
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,860
tickets of Liang Chen's birthday fan meet.

320
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,860
The competition takes place every year

321
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,380
but we can't get

322
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,310
these tickets every time.

323
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,540
We must go to the competition.

324
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,630
Then, I'll go on my own.

325
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,140
Alright.

326
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,860
Then, you'll have to do revision
by your own

327
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,220
in the following final exams.

328
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,100
You...

329
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,880
[Face ID]

330
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,600
[Unlock with Face ID
or enter passcode]

331
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,350
Ke Ke, why did you
change my wallpaper again?

332
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,720
I didn't change it.

333
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,780
Isn't your phone here with me?

334
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,460
Whose phone is this then?

335
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,580
Ms Chen, did you see my boss's phone?

336
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,820
Is it this?

337
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,820
Yes, it is.

338
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,700
Thank you, Ms Chen.

339
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,240
Zhu Guang,

340
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,420
when is Jia Yun's birthday?

341
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,820
December 24. Why?

342
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,500
Nothing.

343
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,110
Then, I'll leave first.

344
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,980
Goodbye, Ms Chen.

345
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,900
What was our record last time?

346
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,220
Thirty.

347
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,660
We are going to break the record.

348
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,740
Brothers, give it your all.

349
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,820
We can do this.

350
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,580
[Let me ask you a question.]

351
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,140
[Let me ask you a question.]

352
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,780
[Go ahead.]

353
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,140
[Go ahead.]

354
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,180
[If you set a girl's birthday
as your phone passcode,]

355
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,180
[If you set a girl's birthday]

356
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,300
[as your phone passcode,]

357
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,580
[does it mean that you like her?]

358
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,820
[does it mean that you like her?]

359
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:54,700
[It could be that she's my mother.]

360
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,620
[It could be that she's my mother.]

361
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,060
Slow down! Stop shaking!

362
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,500
Fantastic!

363
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,540
We are going to succeed!

364
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,780
One piece to go to break the record.

365
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,700
Lu Jing, you do it.

366
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,420
You do it.

367
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,340
[Who set your birthday as the passcode?]

368
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,940
[Who set your birthday as the passcode?]

369
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,140
[No, it happened to a friend of mine.]

370
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,340
[No, it happened to a friend of mine.]

371
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,860
Friend?

372
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,300
Brother Jing.

373
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,080
Brother Jing!

374
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,580
She couldn't even lie.

375
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,260
Liang Chen, let's go.

376
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,260
Jia Yun, I'm not feeling well
all of the sudden.

377
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,380
I'm sorry.

378
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,740
What's wrong?
Do you need a ride to the hospital?

379
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,620
No.

380
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,590
It'll be fine for me to go home
and have a rest.

381
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,300
It's okay.

382
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,500
How about we start it all over again?

383
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,660
I quit. I'm going to play basketball.

384
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,810
What's wrong with him again?

385
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,140
Bad mood?

386
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,380
Do you know why?

387
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,100
Let's go take a look.

388
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,140
We could play too.

389
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,020
Let's go.

390
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,500
Go, go, go.

391
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,340
They are fully occupied.

392
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,420
Forget it. Let's head back
and write codes.

393
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,940
Gu Fei Ming, do you want to join us?

394
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,470
Are you really that desperate?

395
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,780
I don't want to write codes.

396
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,510
What do you want?

397
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,150
How about a bullfight?

398
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,700
Deal!

399
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,340
I'm starving to death.
My goodness.

400
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,380
Master, are you there?

401
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,980
Nice shot!

402
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,460
Nice! Nice!

403
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,700
Nice shot!

404
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,699
Nice shot!

405
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,500
Chen,

406
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,460
are you sure it's alright

407
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,940
to eat like this?

408
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,570
I tell you what.

409
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,449
You need to
clean them up later.

410
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,860
Don't get caught by Ms Qing.

411
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,159
Let me use the toilet first.

412
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,179
I'll continue later.

413
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,260
Why hasn't he replied yet?

414
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,620
Stop, enough.

415
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,180
You guys win.

416
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,240
Let me rest for a while.

417
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,700
[Master, are you there?]

418
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,420
[Master, are you there?]

419
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,220
I'm here.

420
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,980
Ten minutes, wait for me.

421
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,940
Ke Ke, the milk tea is here.
Open the door.

422
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,540
I still need some time.

423
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,940
Fine, I'll open it.

424
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,220
Coming!

425
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,100
[Thousand Years Box Spirit]

426
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,020
Ke Ke bought these.

427
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,940
I don't want to eat but she made me to.

428
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,540
She said I won't suffer from
stomachache after eating these.

429
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,150
Then, do you still want
the porridge and medicine

430
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,270
that I bought for you?

431
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,500
Sure.

432
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,260
Thank you, Jia Yun.

433
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,980
Do you want to come in and have a sit?

434
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
No, you need to get some rest.

435
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,860
I'll go now.

436
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,260
What is this?

437
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,260
It's from Jia Yun.

438
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,420
Mr Jia Yun is being so nice to you.

439
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,180
Ke Ke,

440
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,110
do you think I gave Jia Yun

441
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,340
the wrong idea?

442
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,590
About what?

443
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,740
Nothing.

444
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,900
[I got caught up just now. I'm sorry.]

445
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,900
[I got caught up just now. I'm sorry.]

446
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:16,580
[I got caught up just now. I'm sorry.]

447
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,860
[I got caught up just now. I'm sorry.]

448
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,260
[Oh.]

449
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,020
[When are you coming back?]

450
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,400
[When are you coming back?]

451
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,000
What does he mean?

452
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,620
[What do you mean?]

453
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,260
[What do you mean?]

454
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,260
[I analyzed meteorological map
in recent hours]

455
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,980
[I analysed the meteorological map]

456
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,100

[and ran a forecasting model
for rainstorm.]

458
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,020
[and ran a forecasting
model of rainstorm.]

459
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,780
[The probability of having rainstorms in
Shanghai next week is up to 83 percent.]

460

[The probability of having rainstorms
in Shanghai next week]

461
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,460
[is up to 83 percent.]

462
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,980
What is that?
Can't he just watch the weather forecast?

463
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,060
[So what?]

464
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,860
[So what?]

465
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,820
[Stay safe when you're on the way back.]

466
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,000
[Stay safe when you're on the way back.]

467
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,740
[Why would I stay until next week?]

468
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,780
[Why would I I stay until next week?]

469
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,420
[I'll go back tomorrow.]

470
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,140
[I'll go back tomorrow.]

471
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,860
Ke Ke, let's go back tomorrow.

472
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,180
We still have job to do on tomorrow.

473
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,860
The job may not be finished
until afternoon.

474
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,220
We'll go back after finishing the job.

475
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,100
That's right.

476
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,950
Alright.
