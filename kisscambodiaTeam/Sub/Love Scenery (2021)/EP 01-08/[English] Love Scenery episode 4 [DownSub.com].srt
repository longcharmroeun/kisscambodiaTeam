How did you know?

376
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,680
That year, Nanze University

377
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
[unexpectedly accepted a huge batch
of students.]

378
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,710
Let me show you the latest script.

379
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,630
Sure.

380
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,150
What is the new script?

381
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,120
Why do I feel like

382
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,150
I am a scientist?

383
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,930
Our mission is to escape
the chamber of secret.

384
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,760
Why am I given a spoon?

385
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,200
Am I required to learn from the movie

386
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,600
'The Shawshank Redemption'
and dig a tunnel?

387
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,470
It could be.

388
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,620
You can try it.

389
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,150
Why do I feel that
you are fooling me around?

390
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,670
Not bad.

391
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,070
At least you didn't fall into the trap.

392
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,200
At least I have a spoon.

393
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,980
What do you have? You have nothing.

394
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,120
I only need my brain.

395
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,150
I only need my brain.

396
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,240
Come here.

397
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,710
What are you doing?

398
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,920
Let me check

399
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,880
if you have a map tattooed on your body.

400
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,160
That is how it works in movies.

401
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,750
Check it for me.

402
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,270
-I can't see.
-Sure.

403
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,190
What are you doing?

404
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,510
What are you doing?

405
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,040
Tidy up yourself.

406
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,240
What is wrong? You said
you wanted to check my body, right?

407
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,870
What are we looking for?

408
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,480
You have no idea
what the spoon is for, right?

409
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Lend it to me.

410
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,230
Is this a chip?

411
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,800
Did we win?

412
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,120
If I am not mistaken,

413
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,110
the moment you open the door,

414
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,680
you will see many robots.

415
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,750
We shall just stay here.

416
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,520
Don't be scared.

417
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,680
Are you here to accept challenge
or to enjoy?

418
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,150
If you don't take the risk,

419
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,760
how would you know you'd lose?

420
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,430
What is this?

421
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
There are so many zeros and ones.

422
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,150
This is Binary Addition.

423
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,530
It shares the same concept
with the usual addition method.

424
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,970
Start from the ones.

425
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,180
Add each digit according to the sequence.

426
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,480
Zero plus zero equals to zero.

427
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,710
Zero plus one equals to one.

428
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,400
One plus one equals to one zero.

429
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,950
The additional digit on the left

430
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,910
has to be carried over.

431
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,120
What are you talking about?

432
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't get it.

433
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,960
Don't count on me.

434
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,710
However, there is no robot.

435
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:22,360
It is full of robots.

436
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,429
Be patient.

437
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,239
Observe how the robots move around.

438
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:26,730
There is a regular pattern.

439
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,449
Follow me.

440
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,949
This is their blind spot.

441
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,159
They can't see us.

442
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Let's go.

443
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,190
Let me show you a military drill.

444
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,630
Did you see that?

445
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,750
These robots are no match for me
in shooting.

446
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,480
They are also bad at close combat.

447
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,500
Where is she?

448
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,800
I found a Level Three Helmet.

449
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,090
It is so cool, isn't it?

450
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,430
Fine.

451
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,840
I performed for nothing.

452
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,550
Jump with me.

453
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,920
Come down.

454
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,960
No, it's so high!

455
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,210
I will shoot you
if you don't come down.

456
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,530
Don't!

457
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,130
Why didn't you hold me?

458
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,500
My blood level will decrease
if you hit me.

459
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,750
Let's go.

460
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,840
[Do not cross]

461
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,970
Run!

462
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,080
No!

463
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,380
Help! Help me, Lu Jing!

464
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,650
[Lu Jing, help me!]

465
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,570
-[Help!]
-You can run in zig-zag quite well.

466
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,710
I will die really soon
if you don't save me.

467
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,950
Help!

468
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,460
Jing.

469
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,100
I am coming in.

470
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,240
Thank you, grandma.

471
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,080
Jing, what are you doing?

472
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,720
I am watching a movie.

473
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,840
Lu Jing.

474
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,620
Let's go.

475
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,430
What?

476
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,470
Lu Jing.

477
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,640
Lu Jing.

478
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,540
[Lu Jing.]

479
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,510
[Lu Jing.]

480
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,560
[Wake up, Lu Jing.]

481
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,720
[Lu Jing, why aren't you moving?]

482
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,240
[Volume]

483
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,320
I seem to hear a girl talking.

484
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,750
Grandma, you must have heard it wrong.

485
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,560
They are killing a pig in the movie.

486
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
Enjoy the movie.

487
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,250
[Soymilk]

488
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,910
I am scared to death.

489
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,040
We were almost turned into boxes.

490
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,570
It was so dangerous.

491
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,070
Why didn't you hide?

492
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,160
[We live and die together.]

493
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,720
What were you doing?

494
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,190
I recorded a video.

495
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,240
Do you want to see?

496
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,560
What video?

497
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,950
[Help!]

498
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,050
[Lu Jing!]

499
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,120
[I will die really soon
if you don't save me.]

500
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,900
[I have added the video of you walking
in zig-zag in my collection.]

501
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,840
What a jerk.
