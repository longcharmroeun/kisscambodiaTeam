00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,490
he used 28 minutes and 41 seconds

378
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,880
to complete the task.

379
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,660
It was a new record.

380
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,440
On the day you won the awards.

381

he played Downwind.

383
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,820
Is that why this song is popular now?

384
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,610
It's not only because of this reason.

385
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,500
Don't you think this song
fits the game pretty well?

386
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,170
After the task is completed,

387
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,240
celebrate with the song Downwind.

388
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,720
If you fail the mission,

389
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,860
the song is a blessing.

390
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,280
That's how everyone plays.

391
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,989
So, should I thank him?

392
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,400
I think

393
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,730
you should

394
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,560
check out Herman's live stream.

395
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,300

Ke Ke, is this the game

416
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,510
that made Downwind a hot search?

417
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,920
Downwind is very popular now.

I've spoken to the Project Manager.

423
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,420
He said his original intention

424
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,560
was to create a novel

425
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,660

Who is it?

567
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,680
Why do you look like you've seen a ghost?

568
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,470
Did you do something guilty?

569
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,770
Not even a superstar like you

570
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,640
feels guilty about barging
into a man's house.

571
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,140
Why should I feel guilty?

572
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,410
Because you went missing for two days,

573
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,550
I've come to see you personally.

574
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,710
Orange.

575
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,960
I have some good news

576
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,840
and some bad news.

577
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,020
Which one first?

578
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,220
Bad news.

579
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,320
The bad news is,

580
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,700
I'm going to a faraway place for shooting.

581
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,430
You?

582
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,350
Shooting?

583
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,400
You...

584
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,740
Even a washed up actor like you
has a movie?

585
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,820
I don't like your tone.

586
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,920
What do you mean by "washed up actor?"

587
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,010
Was I a famous actor before?

588
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,370
You're right.

589
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,830
This can't be counted as bad news.

590
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,050
I can't bring you to play
with fireworks anymore.

591
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,340
What's the good news?

592
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,300
That's the good news.

593
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,600
Taro, how could you do this?

594
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,100
What should I do?

595
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,360
I am such a kind person,

596
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,140
I can't sit around doing nothing.

597
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,560
Why don't we do this?

598
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,420
I'll get a good player to guide you.

599
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,040
He's the dark horse of the
world ladder tournament.

600
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,990
I can't go back empty handed today.

601
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,980
Jeez, I haven't packed yet.

602
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,020
Okay.

603
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,080
I'll wait for your news.

604
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,610
Okay.

605
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,990
What is it again?

606
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,670
Don't tell him who I am.

607
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,910
I know.

608
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,450
I know you are famous.

609
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
Here.

610
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,220
Let's go.

611
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,620
My dear.

612
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,640
Over here, please leave.

613
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,580
I didn't even have a sip of water.

614
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,430
You'll soon have it,

615
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,710
your house is two minutes away.

616
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:16,770
You'll drink at home.

617
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,340
-You'll be happy.
-We don't live on the same street.

618
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,980
Safe journey home.
