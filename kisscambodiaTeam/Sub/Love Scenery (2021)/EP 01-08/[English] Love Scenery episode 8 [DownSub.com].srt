I will not die.

563
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,470
Have you heard of this?

564
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,360
The person I adore is a great  hero.

565
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,030
Someday he will we put on a
first-class bulletproof vest,

566
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,470
wear a second level helmet,

567
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,510
take a heavy duty Magnum
military sniper rifle,

568
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,470
and ride an auto-rickshaw to pick me up.

569
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,380
Ready to shoot.

570
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,670
Take it.

571
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,550
You do it.

572
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,750
I control the car, you control the gun.

573
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,190
Aim at the bulls-eye.

574
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,340
Three.

575
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,610
Two.

576
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,460
One!

577
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,720
I hit the target.

578
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,170
Yes, you shot it.

579
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,410
Get ready.

580
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,940
Shoot!

581
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,310
Here.

582
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,750
Shot!

583
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,470
shoot!

584
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,060
Nice job.

585
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:59,670
♫ The wind directs me to your side ♫

586
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,190
♫ You shot me with the arrow of love ♫

587
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,390
♫ Breaking my defences ♫

588
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:13,260
♫ So let's go just with the wind ♫

589
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,230
Awesome!

590
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,680
You sing very well.

591
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,860
That's...

592
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,810
[I'm the original singer,
of course it's good.]

593
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,750
I practised for a long time.

594
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,520
I was hoping for a chance
to sing out loud.

595
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,200
Your water.

596
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,100
Complimentary?

597
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,230
[Webmaster: The water you
ordered has been delivered! ]

598
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,640
Forget it.

599
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,480
The service here is pretty good.

600
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,420
Free water for me.

601
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,950
The service of my cyber cafe
is not good at all.

602
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,080
You are also at a cyber cafe?

603
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,470
Who ordered fish-flavoured
shredded pork rice?

604
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,830
Who ordered fish-flavoured
shredded pork rice?

605
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,700
Who ordered the fish-flavoured
shredded pork rice?

606
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,750
Did you order this, mister?

607
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,370
I'm sorry.

608
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,490
Your fish-flavoured
shredded pork rice?

609
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,470
You ordered it?

610
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,950
Why didn't you answer my call?

611
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,910
What a bother.

612
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,560
Fish-flavoured shredded pork rice?
