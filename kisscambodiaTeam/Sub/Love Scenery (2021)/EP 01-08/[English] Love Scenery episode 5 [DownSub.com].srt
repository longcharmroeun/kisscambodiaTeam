[Episode 5]

4
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
That was scary.

5
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,960
I thought we'd turn into boxes.

6
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
It was so dangerous.

7
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Why didn't you hide?

8
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,640
We sink or swim together.

9
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,400
Why do I feel

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,000
there's something wrong with Jing today.

11
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,480
What's wrong?

12
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,800
You were like this

13
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,270
when you chased me back then.

14
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,430
Did your brain short-circuited?

15
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Who chased who?

16
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
I chased you.

17
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,480
I chased you, yes I did.

18
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,200
It's so high. I can't get up there.

19
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,600
You're so weak. You can't do it for sure.

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,960
I... I'm not weak.

21
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,890
Let me show you.

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,630
I'll go up first and you follow me.

23
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,340
That was a misstep.

24
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,680
I know, a misstep.

25
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
No need to tell me.

26
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,440
Good luck.

27
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
Something is wrong
with the programming.

28
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
There seems

29
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,520
to be an air wall up there.

30
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,730
I've come over.

31
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,800
There is a hole here.

32
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,800
Quickly get in here.

33
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,750
You think I'll crawl
into the hole like a dog?

34
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Yup.

35
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,640
Don't mind me. I'll try again.

36
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
Didn't you say you wanted to
climb over the wall?

37
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,760
If you

38
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,360
had crawled into that hole
with me earlier,

39
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,480
we would have finished
the task long ago.

40
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,640
There must be a bug in the new copy.

41
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
What?

42
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,550
A bug.

43
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,380
I thought

44
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,860
I've found something new.

45
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,750
I'll go offline first.
I have class tomorrow.

46
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
Good night.

47
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,490
Good night.

00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,840
Alright, get ready.

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,080

51
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,290
Is this your first kiss on screen?

52
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Are... Are you kidding me?

53
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,600
My kisses are textbook.

54
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,260
One more time.

55
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,680
Clapper.

56
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,680
Alright, ready?

57
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,730
Action!

58
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
What?

59
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Well...

60
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,360
That's enough.

61
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,200
I... I'm sorry, Ms Ma.

62
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,560
I really couldn't help it.

63
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,750
No, no, no. I didn't mean it.

64
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,950
Ms Ma...

65
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,230
I... I'm sorry.

66
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,090
You! What were you doing?

67
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,330
Didn't I tell you to fake it?

68
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
No, Director He...

69
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,400
I... I really didn't mean it.

70
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
No need to explain.

71
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,830
I know you.

72
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
Director...

73
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,710
You know I'm not that kind of person.

74
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,800
Is your intimate scene with Ms Ma

75
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,920
enough?

76
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,980
Enough!

77
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,980
Enough?

78
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,320
I was going to add more for you.

79
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,200
Forget it.

80
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,240
Do it. Do it.

81
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,040
Okay.

82
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,060
Thank you, sir.

83
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,880
Lu Jing.

84
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Lu Jing, do you have class in the morning?

85
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,560
Yes.

86
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,720
We're going to celebrate
the university anniversary.

87
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,560
Are you going to perform?

88
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,400
I heard you play good violin.

89
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm not attending.

90
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,880
But I heard that Liang Chen will come.

91
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,080
Really?

92
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,640
Who told you?

93
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,970
My friend.

94
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,460

[Famous Alumni]

96
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,240
Lu Jing, I'll go on stage
to present flowers on that day.

97
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,230
Would you like to be my escort?

98
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,310
No, thanks.

99
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,820
Lu Jing,

100
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,700
don't you like Liang Chen?

101
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,100
Why do you not want to come?

102
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,670
How do you know I like her?

103
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,900
I heard from other people.

104
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,580
They said you have
many Liang Chen's albums.

105
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,220
I also like Tesla.

106
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,000
What are you guys talking about?

107
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,240
I'll go to class first.

108
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,830
What were you talking about?

109
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,630
University anniversary celebration.

110
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,990
She asked if I want to go on stage.

111
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,400
What for?

112
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,390
Perform?

113
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,410
Yeah, I'll sign up tomorrow.

114
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Really?

115
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,250
What are you going to perform?

116
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,480
Playing violin?

117
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,900
Crushing boulder on my chest.

118
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,310
Are you serious?

119
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,350
Will lying to you do me good?

120
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,560
It's surprising.

121
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,360
A delicate-featured man like you

122
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,150
have such a special skill.

123
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,080
Students, let's start the class.

124
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,510
Can I leave now?

125
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,680
Do you know who he is?

"Three-Nos" Professor Liu.

128
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,680
no early dismissal and no phones.

129
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,070
But I'm supposed to be
at my department head's class now.

130
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,830
The student at the back.

131
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,360
The one in black.

132
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,960
Don't look at others. I'm talking to you.

133
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,480
Right, it's you.

134
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
I have never seen you before.

135
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,580
Are you from our department?

136
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,600
No... No.

137
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,550
Then why are you attending this class?

138
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,630
I...

139
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,530
I'm keeping him company.

140
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,030
[I've come over. There is a hole here.]

141
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,060
[Quickly get in here.]

142
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,620
[You think I'll crawl into
that hole like a dog?]

143
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,000
[I thought]

144
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,520
[I've found something new.]

145
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,760
Liang Chen,

146
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,490
what are you thinking?

147
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
Let's try something different today.

148
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,590
Like what?

149
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,940
I wrote this on a whim last night.

150
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,380
It is different
from our previous genres.

151
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,980
I've incorporated electronic music.

152
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,840
Let's try it.

153
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,150
-Well?
-It's upbeat and fun.

154
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,870
Let's give it a go?

155
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,870
Sure.

156
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,040
It's the first time
they're trying this genre.

157
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,590
It's quite interesting.

158
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,690
Is this a new song you wrote?

159
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
-What do you think?
-Very nice.

160
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,770
It's different from your previous genres.

161
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,400
I want to try something new.

162
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,560
But I'm still figuring things out.

163
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,800
By the way,

164
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,550
there'll be
a private music party tomorrow.

165
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,760
Many famous bands will be there.

166
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,920
Would you like to come?

167
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,300
Will Salted Fish Band be there?

168
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,280
I guess so.

169
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,040
So are you coming?

170
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,240
Okay.

171
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,569
That's settled then.

172
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,160
Call the manager of Salted Fish Band
for me.

173
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,780
[Liu Shun]

174
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,850
Hello, Da Shun.

175
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,600
What's up?

176
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,080
[Can you go to a place with me tonight?]

177
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,760
[My colleague gave me two tickets]

178
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,880
[of a private music party.]

179
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,520
[There'll be many hot girls.]

180
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,210
A party?

181
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,000
Do you think I dance?

182
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,040
[Just go to have some fun.]

183
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,680
[I don't want to go alone.]

184
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,510
-No.
-[Come on.]

185
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,680
[Last time, I gave you]

186
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,320
[Liang Chen's special edition gift.]

187
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,200
[Can you do me a favour this time?]

188
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,960
Okay.

189
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,520
What's wrong?

190
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,550
I'm allergic to pollen.

191
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm sorry.

192
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,110
It's fine.

193
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,440
Please wait a second.

194
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,170
Are you cold?

195
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,350
No.

196
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,320
Hello.

197
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,760
Can I give the kid a bouquet of flowers?

198
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,940
Yes.

199
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,400
Do you like it?

200
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,320
Yes, I do.

201
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,480
Say thank you.

202
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

203
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,450
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

204
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,600
Let's go.

205
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,320
Are you going to sell insurance?

206
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,150
Okay, my bad.

207
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,040
Let's go in.

208
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,750
Few people know about this party.

209
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,520
Only those in the industry were invited.

210
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,350
Maybe we'll get to meet some bands

211
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,910
that you know.

212
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's go.

213
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,280
A masquerade party?

214
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,520
It's interesting.

215
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,200
Pick a mask.

216
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,510
Jia Yun,

217
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,930
you can wear this.

218
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,920
Okay.

219
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,650
And I'll wear this.

220
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,440
How do I look?

221
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,680
You look handsome.

222
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,960
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

223
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
It's very different from what I thought.

224
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,840
Really?

225
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,570
Hi, would you like something to drink?

226
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,180
Would you like some wine?

227
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,360
Can I?

228
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,920
Forget it. You can have orange juice.

229
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,080
Let me try it.

230
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,960
Really?

231
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,740
Enjoy yourselves.

232
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,390
I have to pick up a call.

233
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,920
-Are you fine to be alone?
-Yes.

234
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,610
Alright, I'll be right back.

235
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Sorry. Sorry.

236
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,000
It's okay.

237
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,200
Can you give me a napkin?

238
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,080
Thank you.

239
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,240
Thank you.

240
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,440
Go ahead.

241
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,280
No, no. I need more time.

242
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,400
I'll get you another drink.

243
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,420
Okay.

244
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,380
One more.

245
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,250
Give me a glass of the strongest liquor.

246
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
You're back.

247
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,120
Is this for me?

248
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,160
Thank you.

249
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,840
Jia Yun, this is so strong.

250
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,960
One more of this. Thank you.

251
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,820
Drink it.

252
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,800
Hello, everyone. We're Salted Fish.

253

Salted Fish! Salted Fish! Salted Fish!

255
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,920
I mistook someone else for you.

256
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,870
I know you wouldn't give me wine.

257
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,310
It's impossible. But...

258
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,230
I'll take you home.

259
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,550
But the Salted Fish Band is so...

260
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,120
Let me tell you. They're so...

261
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,440
Watch out.

262
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,410
You're drunk.

263
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,520
Listen.

264
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,300
I won't be helping you up

265
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,980
every time you fall down.

266
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,020
I might hold you in my arms

267
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,560
if you fall again.

268
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,440
Let's go.

269
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,280
Ms Liang.

270
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,220
Is this really a great movie?

271
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,280
I don't know any of the actors.

272
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,280
There's barely anyone here.

273
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,350
Trust me. It's really good.

274
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,240
This is the second time I'm watching it.

275
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,680
His life is so miserable.
Why is he smiling?

276
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,030
Who doesn't have
a lonely and difficult life?

277
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,690
We're born to be alone.

278
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,950
No one can save you except yourself.

279
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,560
He smiled in the end

280
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,990
because he has let it go.

281
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,360
May I have a tissue?

282
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,640
There's no more.

283
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,160
I gave you the last piece.

284
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,720
Thank you.

285
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Lu Jing is back.

286
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,920
Lu Jing, did you go to sell insurance?

287
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,480
Don't... Don't look at me.

288
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,640
I have no money.

289
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,280
What's the smell? Did you drink?

290
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,440
Just a little.

291
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,280
I thought you didn't drink?

292
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,180
Why didn't you invite us?

293
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,720
Let's drink now?

294
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,250
Everyone.

295
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,200
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,400
Did I see wrongly?

301
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,679
Ms Liang,

302
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,370
why did you delete the photo?

303
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,489
You looked great!

304
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,960
I posted it while I was drunk.

305
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,260
I forgot to set the group.

306
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,280
Didn't you know
we're going outstation today?

307
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,500
What did you do yesterday?

308
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,159
I went to a party.

309
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,400
With whom?

310
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,010
Jia Yun.

311
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,670
You went out alone with Jia Yun?

312
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,130
Are you two dating?

313
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,630
No.

314
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,440
I went to see Salted Fish Band.

315
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,270
In fact, he is not bad.

316
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,930
He is tall and good-looking.

317
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,600
He's also such a gentleman.

318
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,190
Why don't you consider him?

319
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,240
Consider what?

320
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,010
It's a conflict of interest.

321
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,970
We're just friends.

322
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,800
What are you thinking?

323
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,070
It's definitely not her.

324
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,930
What are you looking at so seriously?

325
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,960
Nothing.

326
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,480
Beautiful Soul has launched
a reward programme.

327
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,200
Players can use points to redeem weapons.

328
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,070
Let's play to earn some points tonight.

329
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,160

What have you been up to lately?

331
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,910
Are you going to earn points with others?

332
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,770
Am I still your friend?

333
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,400
You have never been.

334
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,760
Fine, I will leave you alone.

335
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,430
I can face the future on my own.

336
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
The sponsor will send the outfits over
in the afternoon.

337
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240

338
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,820

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,240
It's her.

353

Why do you still team up with her?

354
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,720

355
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,360
You seem to like playing
with her every night.

Teaming up with her

357
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,690

00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,490

00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,640
No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.

362
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,330

00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,930
[I can't hear you.]

378
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,790
You go find a seat first.

379
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,730
I was asking

380
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,430
where you are now.

381
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,160
[Supreme Master]

382
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,300
[I was asking where you are now.]

383
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,720
Ms Liang, are you feeling stuffy?

384
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,600
Your face is so red.

385
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,280
Oh my goodness.

386
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,600
It's so hot in here.

387
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,400
Isn't there ventilation in the lift?

388
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,920
Is it hot?

389
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,800
Yes.

390
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,110
[I'm in Shanghai]

391
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,550
[I'm in Shanghai.]

392
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,380
[What are you doing there?]

393
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,870
[For work]

394
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,470
[Working.]

395
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,190
[Okay.]

396
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,630
[I may not have time
to use the computer these few days.]

397
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,780
[I may not have time
to use the computer these few days]

398
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,430
[Focus on your work, Little Box.]
