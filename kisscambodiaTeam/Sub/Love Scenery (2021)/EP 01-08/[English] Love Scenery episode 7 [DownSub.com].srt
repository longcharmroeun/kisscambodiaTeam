381
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,020
Why are you so petty?

382
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,020
Yes, I'm petty when it comes to love.

383
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,740
But at least I know what I want.

384
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,040
Mr Sun.

385
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,660
I don't remember you having
any PR events today.

386
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,060
What are you doing?

387
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,820
I'm thinking.

388
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,480
I'm thinking when I would

389
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,400
have the chance to collaborate
with Shan Shan

390
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,940
on a comedy.

391
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,740
Love themed, of course.

392
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,880
Do you want to remake

393
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,100
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
with Shan Shan?

394
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,900
What do you mean?

395
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,960
I'm a versatile actor.

396
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,440
My only restriction

397
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,620
is my handsome face.

398
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,080
Then why do you want to collaborate
with Shan Shan?

399
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,500
You two don't seem compatible.

400
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,140
Because

401
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,700
she's my "hard disk goddess."

402
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,780
Ten terabytes.

403
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,780
You're awake, Ms Ma.

404
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,340
No, I...

405
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,340
I can explain, Ms Ma!

406
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,360
[Taro's Drive]

407
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm right.

408
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,780
I have another nine terabytes back home.

409
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,620
Wait for me!

410
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,120
We're only going for two days.

411
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,360
Why carry such a big suitcase

412
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,780
for five pairs of socks?

413
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,700
You don't know what it's like
to a man of refinement.

414
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,200
Hello?

415
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,080
[Hello.]

416
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
[Are you the passenger]

417
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,460
[of flight DA1718 to Guangzhou?]

418
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,000
Yes, I am.

419
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,880
[I'm sorry.]

420
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
[There's only one seat left]

421
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,260
[in the economy cabin.]

422
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,159
[We can upgrade]

423
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,199
[one of your seats to first class.]

424
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,020
[Which one of you will take the upgrade?]

425
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,179
Lu Jing, have you been in
a first class cabin?

426
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,179
What time is the flight, Ke Ke?

427
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,739
7:50.

428
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,280
In the past, at this time of year,

429
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,380
my new album would've begun selling.

430
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,540
But this year,

431
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,220
there's nothing.

432
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,780
Don't pressure yourself.

433
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,210
I'm going over, Chen.

434
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,760
[I'll be busy in the morning.]

435
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,150
[Hit me up tonight if you want]

436
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,200
[Hit me up tonight if you want]

437
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,110
[to play Beautiful Soul.]

438
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,210
[to play Beautiful Soul.]

439
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,940
Was that Liang Chen?

440
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,830
Yes.

441
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,570
But don't tell anyone.

442
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,320
[Guess who I saw
in the first class cabin?]

443
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,420
[Guess who I saw
in the first class cabin?]

444
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,580
Are my earphones with you?

445
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,860
Thank you.

446
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,660
Thank you.

447
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,500
Why are you standing there?

448
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,820
I...

449
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,500
Are my earphones here?

450
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,240
[I'll be busy in the morning.]

451
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,320
[I'll be busy during the morning.]

452
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,680
[Hit me up tonight if you want]

453
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,760
[Hit me up tonight if you want]

454
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,720
[to play Beautiful Soul.]

455
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,820
[to pay Beautiful Soul.]

456
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,380
I'll look for it.

457
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,920
[I'm on a business trip.]

458
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,000
[I'm on a business trip.]

459
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,920
[I'm not free.]

460
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,020
[I'm not free.]

461
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,040
[Where?]

462
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,140
[Where?]

463
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,160
[Guangzhou.]

464
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,260
[Guangzhou.]

465
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,350
[Okay.]

466
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,100
Who are you texting?

467
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,670
My mother.

468
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,250
I'm selecting some dresses for her.

469
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,100
This looks nice.

470
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,960
[Flight mode on]

471
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,780
Your earphones.

472
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,040
[1]

473
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,820
Hello, sir.
Please return to your seat, thank you.

474
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,700
-Little Box?
-[Ladies and gentlemen.]

475
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,940
[Our plane will be taking off soon.]

476
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,040
[The cabin crew]

477
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,940
[will begin their security check.]

478
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,560
[Please fasten your seat belts]

479
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,780
[and put up the trays.]

480
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,240
[Keep the window shades open.]

481
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,780
[Thank you for your cooperation.]

482
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,340
How could it be?

483
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,780
What are you looking at?

484
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,940
Nothing.
