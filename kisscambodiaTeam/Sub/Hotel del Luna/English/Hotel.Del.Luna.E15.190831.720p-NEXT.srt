00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:13,281
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:16,550
If I knew Ms. Jang was never
going to return after she left,

3
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:19,521
I should've at least said goodbye to her.

4
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:23,690
It's good that she was able
to leave after she got rid...

5
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:26,630
of the resentment she's
had for a very long time.

6
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:30,600
Let's not forget to say goodbye
to each other before we leave.

7
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:32,970
Let's not leave all of a
sudden without saying goodbye.

8
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,500
Promise me.

9
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,280
I promise.

10
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:48,990
But what do you think is going
to happen to this hotel?

11
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,021
Like always, the Grim Reaper never
gives us a straight answer.

12
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:56,030
But it seems like Ma Go is getting
ready to welcome a new owner.

13
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:19,981
I'll leave this to ferment
until the next full moon.

14
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:23,690
Now, I just need to add...

15
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:26,160
the most important ingredient
which is the Moon Tree flower.

16
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:41,670
Oh, dear.

17
00:01:42,496 --> 00:01:44,640
We're out of Moon Tree flowers.

18
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,080
I heard you asked your sister
at the chemist's shop...

19
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:51,445
to start making a new batch of wine...

20
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,280
for the new owner of the
Guest House of the Moon.

21
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,390
That alcohol is currently being fermented,

22
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:58,261
but it will taste bitter and horrible...

23
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,520
to someone who holds a deep resentment.

24
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,390
When Man Weol first drank that wine,

25
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:06,201
she told me that she'd like
to pluck out my tongue.

26
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,426
Whoever drinks that wine
will be influenced...

27
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:11,925
by the power of the moon...

28
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:14,270
and will no longer be a
part of life or death.

29
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:18,881
The Moon Tree will suck in
his or her remaining life...

30
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,180
and replace the body.

31
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:24,646
And the person's soul will
be tied to the Moon Tree,

32
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:27,180
which make him or her the owner
of the Guest House of the Moon.

33
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:33,990
The wine will be ready
by the next full moon.

34
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:37,890
But we're out of the most important
ingredient, the Moon Tree flower.

35
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:39,631
I'll look for it.

36
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,101
Where can I find it?

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,471
That only blooms in the garden
of the Guest House of the Moon.

38
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,011
But there's not a single flower here.

39
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:51,911
But I do recall seeing a flower bloom...

40
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,710
at the garden that existed 200 years ago.

41
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,605
Then I should go to the
Guest House of the Moon...

42
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:57,811
that existed 200 years ago.

43
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:59,550
You don't need to go.

44
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:03,821
I'll send someone else there.

45
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:23,971
You came to work early again.

46
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:25,710
I just wanted to check...

47
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:27,680
if she's here.

48
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:34,851
I have something for you, Mr. Ku.

49
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,061
This medicine enables you to block
your ability to see things.

50
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:47,960
Ms. Jang...

51
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,031
once asked me for a favor.

52
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,471
If you think...

53
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,811
Chan Seong should no
longer come here anymore,

54
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:03,881
I want you to give him this.

55
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:06,550
Why are you giving that to me?

56
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,590
I'm giving it to you just in case...

57
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,490
because I trust you the most.

58
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,400
Up until now, I trusted
that she'll be back.

59
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,801
But now,

60
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,671
I think...

61
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,611
it's time that I give you this.

62
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:43,951
I guess you think that she
isn't going to return.

63
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,991
The reason Ms. Jang has left
this medicine for you...

64
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,830
is because she wants you to
start living in reality,

65
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:55,671
instead of staying here
where she no longer exists.

66
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,691
Chan Seong.

67
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:23,991
Ta-da.

68
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,730
Guess what I'm about to go out and eat.

69
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,941
My gosh, you have no idea at all.

70
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,765
It's obviously rice with thistle.

71
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:40,405
This is thistle, the white
part is rice, the sauce,

72
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:41,575
and the spoon.

73
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,780
Okay?

74
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:44,236
Let's go.

75
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:47,121
Oh, wait. My phone. I
have to take pictures.

76
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,900
Why are you staring at me?
You're way too naughty.

77
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:18,350
What is this?

78
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:21,080
Did you bring those special
service requests again?

79
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,375
Okay, fine. Bring those to me.

80
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,761
Give those to me.

81
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,356
What will a ghost do in the
bedroom all night long?

82
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:31,290
I can just work and look into
other people's dream calls.

83
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:34,556
Harvard? What do they teach there?

84
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,830
Do they only make you study?

85
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:38,571
I don't even want to see you. Leave.

86
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:03,916
Chan Seong, once you leave our hotel,

87
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,160
you'll become an even more amazing
person than Hwang Moon Sook.

88
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:11,741
You'll live long, and you'll
become very rich too.

89
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,871
This hotel guarantees it.

90
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,910
But you can't show off like that already.

91
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,150
Hey.

92
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:25,421
Look down.

93
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,871
Is Ms. Jang here?

94
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,970
I have to ask you to do something.

95
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,780
What is it?

96
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:35,490
You have to stop by Man Weol Lodge.

97
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:37,490
Man Weol Lodge?

98
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,316
Isn't that Del Luna's name
in the Joseon Dynasty?

99
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:43,691
You're right. You have to go there.

100
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,126
In the garden of Man Weol Lodge,

101
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:52,740
you'll find a medicinal flower
that shines under the moonlight.

102
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,096
You can bring that to me.

103
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,571
It's not a big deal.

104
00:08:57,395 --> 00:09:00,811
You can go there yourself. Why
are you asking me to do it?

105
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,311
Because I thought you might like it.

106
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:05,576
If you go there,

107
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:09,191
you can get a good look at
the old Man Weol Lodge.

108
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,360
Then will I get to meet...

109
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:15,191
Ms. Jang of that time?

110
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,360
Probably.

111
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:20,500
If you don't want to do it, then forget it.

112
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,830
I'll do it.

113
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:29,671
I'll go.

114
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,675
Once you go around the tree,

115
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,210
you'll see the entrance to Man Weol Lodge.

116
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:41,821
You can return the opposite way.

117
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:49,360
Once you get there, do not
eat or drink anything.

118
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:53,460
If you do, you won't be able to return.

119
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,401
(Man Weol Lodge)

120
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:19,106
You rat on me, didn't you?

121
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:21,045
I just told the truth. What now?

122
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:23,515
Why didn't you just die alone?

123
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:26,346
- I didn't want to!
- Then kill me. Try to kill me!

124
00:11:26,346 --> 00:11:27,915
- Do you really want to die?
- Yes! Kill me!

125
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:29,856
- That's Ms. Choi.
- Darn you!

126
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,730
- You little...
- Please don't do this.

127
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,161
Please calm down and come this way.

128
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,870
My goodness.

129
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:47,805
Excuse me, is this the liquor for Ms. Jang?

130
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,250
Yes.

131
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:55,816
I cannot believe how much she's drinking.

132
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,250
That's Mr. Kim.

133
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,210
Who goes there?

134
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:37,260
You are alive. How did you get in here?

135
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:41,230
Are you here to steal?

136
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:46,740
You are dressed oddly.

137
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:48,911
Where are you from?

138
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,510
Ms. Jang Man Weol.

139
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,750
How do you know my name?

140
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:58,921
Are you...

141
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,391
Mr. Oh of Dangyong sent you here, right?

142
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:11,291
You probably came here after
you saw the IOU I gave him.

143
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,571
Go and tell Oh Chung Hwan...

144
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:18,431
that I will be there myself
in a month to pay him back.

145
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,681
I came from a place much further than that.

146
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:33,250
You cannot...

147
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,990
recognize me at this moment.

148
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:39,860
You can...

149
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,490
see ghosts.

150
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:46,330
Who gave you that ability?

151
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,626
Jang Man Weol!

152
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,164
- Darn it.
- I came back for you!

153
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:00,165
- You came.
- I didn't even die...

154
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:02,005
- and came back.
- Ms. Jang isn't here.

155
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:03,535
- What's wrong?
- I came yesterday,

156
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:07,075
I'm here today, and I'll come tomorrow too.

157
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,250
Darn it, that lousy old woman.

158
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,321
She didn't even die and came back today.

159
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,685
Man Weol, I'm here again.

160
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,654
Isn't that Ma Go?

161
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,785
Bring some rice!

162
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:18,655
- You know her?
- We don't have any.

163
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:19,730
Yes.

164
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:22,931
I met her five times to this day.

165
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:24,671
But I haven't met her.

166
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,970
Are you close to her?

167
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,865
Her sisters treated me nicely.

168
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,141
Is that so?

169
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:38,411
Do you want a drink?

170
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,330
You've probably just begun working here.

171
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:55,630
It's been less than two years.

172
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,171
This drink is from this world.

173
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,740
It's been a while since
we had a living guest.

174
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,840
Don't you have a living manager?

175
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,181
"A manager"?

176
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,850
You must mean a living steward.

177
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,811
He died a short while ago so we
don't have any at the moment.

178
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:15,951
Are you the new steward
brought in by Ma Go?

179
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:18,860
No, I'm not.

180
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,531
She mistook me for Mr. Oh from Dangyong.

181
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:24,990
Who is that?

182
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:26,655
Dangyong is the gambling den.

183
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,086
And Oh Haeng Su is the money lender.

184
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:29,500
Gambling den...

185
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,931
Does Ms. Jang gamble?

186
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:37,510
After the living steward, who took
care of her for a long time, died,

187
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,110
we thought she went out at
nights because she was bored.

188
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:45,051
But she was actually gambling.

189
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,760
What should I do?

190
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:57,061
I'm all in.

191
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,330
If you are scared, just croak.

192
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:02,801
- I'm all in.
- Here's my house deed.

193
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,370
Okay, show me.

194
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,836
This is good enough.

195
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,181
Wait!

196
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,951
I'm sorry about this.

197
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:23,521
How much is all this?

198
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:25,645
She worked with a ghost gambler.

199
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:28,045
So she raked in all the money at first.

200
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:30,061
Then Ma Go found out about it.

201
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,626
After that, Ma Go, that brings in poverty,

202
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,356
comes here every day.

203
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:38,870
So Man Weol's storeroom is
about to completely empty.

204
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,000
She is gambling with the
help of a ghost gambler.

205
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,840
The situation here is worse.

206
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:47,740
We might have to sell the
farmland and this house next.

207
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:51,811
We need a proper living steward.

208
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:28,381
Please enjoy yourselves.

209
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:43,701
Ms. Jang.

210
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:45,970
Do you gamble?

211
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:51,171
I was bored so I only played it as a game.

212
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:52,441
A game?

213
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,766
If you lived in my world,

214
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:56,106
you would have gone to prison.

215
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,111
I am planning to stop.

216
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:00,606
After I get back all the money I lost.

217
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:03,116
If you think like that, you
will never be able to stop.

218
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,745
I have to get back the money
to take care of the guests.

219
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:07,460
You don't need money to
take care of your guests.

220
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:11,691
Is there anything you don't know?

221
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:16,296
All right.

222
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,341
It seems you have some sort of a
relationship with the Ma Go sisters.

223
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:22,141
Go and tell that old
beggar woman you saw...

224
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:23,810
to leave this place.

225
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,841
You can't drive deities out just like that.

226
00:18:28,336 --> 00:18:29,451
That's right.

227
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:33,945
That's why I can't kick that beggar out.

228
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:35,145
Neither can I refuse her.

229
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,376
She comes here every day
wanting me to gamble with her.

230
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:38,720
I can't win.

231
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,320
I'm about to become a beggar myself.

232
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:47,161
I once persuaded a deity to leave a place.

233
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,570
- Really?
- If I send her away,

234
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,871
will you never gamble again?

235
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:54,970
Never.

236
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:57,441
I will put my hand on the line.

237
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:14,820
Oh, gosh.

238
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,230
It tastes...

239
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:19,631
horrible.

240
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:23,371
Did you...

241
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:25,901
enjoy your meal?

242
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,770
Who are you?

243
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,195
I came here to get the Moon Tree flower.

244
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:31,770
My name is Ku Chan Seong.
Your sister sent me.

245
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,010
My big sister sent you?

246
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:37,550
You came from a very faraway place.

247
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,020
I know you are punishing
Ms. Jang for what she did.

248
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:43,851
But can't you please stop now?

249
00:19:45,346 --> 00:19:47,415
I plan to make her go broke.

250
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:48,691
Please go easy on her.

251
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,730
I don't like to see her suffer too much.

252
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:53,631
Why not?

253
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,701
If you don't like it,

254
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:01,141
will you play a round...

255
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:03,240
with me?

256
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,710
You can choose the game.

257
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,451
How about a game of go?

258
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,181
Game of go?

259
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:15,891
I like that.

260
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,911
What's going on? Is he winning?

261
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,881
It's a very close game.

262
00:20:39,935 --> 00:20:42,066
This young man is doing
quite well against a deity.

263
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,536
He was so sure of himself.

264
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,720
He said something about Harvard.
Do you know Harvard?

265
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:49,346
He studied there.

266
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:51,990
He said he had a great
brain if nothing else.

267
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,060
I guess he wasn't lying.

268
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:55,621
You are so noisy.

269
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:17,681
Oh, no.

270
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,661
I lost.

271
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:32,256
Go away right now.

272
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:33,460
Don't ever come back.

273
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:37,371
- I'm going.
- Quickly.

274
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:42,101
Well done.

275
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,836
(I will never enter a gambling den.)

276
00:21:51,836 --> 00:21:53,550
Are you happy?

277
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:55,581
Please sign it.

278
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,091
Write your name.

279
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,831
You're so picky.

280
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:08,000
I noticed you had too many
horses in the stable.

281
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:09,725
Keep only three, and sell the rest...

282
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:11,756
- to pay off your debt.
- Just three?

283
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:13,766
You will say you want to
make the stable look good.

284
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,911
But that's not acceptable.
Pay off your debt first.

285
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:20,135
Or I'll call the old beggar again.

286
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:23,451
All right. I will sell them. Happy?

287
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,106
(Jang Man Weol)

288
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:30,820
There. Are you happy with this note?

289
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,385
If you are bored, don't
go to gambling dens.

290
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:38,831
Find a new hobby.

291
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:46,300
Look.

292
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,651
Joseon has the shape of a tiger.

293
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:58,810
A tiger?

294
00:23:00,576 --> 00:23:02,990
Bibimbap is delicious in Jeonju.

295
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,121
In winter,

296
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:07,361
Pohang is famous for half-dried herrings.

297
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,131
You will love the Pyongyang
naengmyeon up there.

298
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,931
Are you telling me to go on gourmet trips?

299
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:16,671
Have you eaten all of them?

300
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,331
Yes, I have.

301
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:19,901
With someone.

302
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:29,240
Will it be more fun than gambling?

303
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,750
You will enjoy it.

304
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,220
Enough for you to enjoy for 200 years.

305
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:38,121
Do you want to go with me?

306
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,030
Hey.

307
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:48,000
Would you be interested in
working as a steward here?

308
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:50,831
I like you.

309
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:11,290
Stay by my side here.

310
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,361
Do not eat...

311
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,030
or drink anything there.

312
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,901
If you do, you won't be able to return.

313
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,441
I won't have to worry about
you disappearing here.

314
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,681
I can stay by your side without worrying.

315
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:40,320
There.

316
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:43,451
Drink up, Ku Chan Seong.

317
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:08,510
I have to go back.

318
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,951
There's a woman I must wait for.

319
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:16,790
Is she your lover?

320
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:20,060
Yes.

321
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,290
She's someone I love a lot.

322
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:28,960
It's too bad.

323
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,710
I guess I might regret it once I go back.

324
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:07,070
When you leave,

325
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:10,235
all the memories about those
who traveled back in time...

326
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,171
will disappear.

327
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:15,641
Did you come to check on me because
you were worried I wouldn't leave?

328
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:19,050
It's your choice whether you go back...

329
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:20,651
or stay.

330
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,675
If you stay here,

331
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:28,185
you'll probably become Jang Man Weol's...

332
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:31,490
85th human steward before you die.

333
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:36,201
Will you go back to being
someone who sends her off,

334
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:38,470
or will you remain here
as someone passing by?

335
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:40,300
That's...

336
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:42,540
for you to decide.

337
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:57,671
Thank you for bringing this back for me.

338
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:00,740
I can see why you sent me there.

339
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,951
You helped me realize how I should feel...

340
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:06,881
while waiting for her.

341
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:08,951
For now,

342
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:11,591
you should be happy.

343
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:14,421
Man Weol has come back.

344
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:54,331
She must be here.

345
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:11,250
I'm sorry I'm late.

346
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:14,480
It was a short period of time there,

347
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,351
but you must have waited for a long time.

348
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:19,945
Ms. Jang!

349
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,520
- Ms. Jang!
- Ms. Jang.

350
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:22,720
Ms. Jang!

351
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:31,201
Ms. Jang.

352
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:35,141
Ms. Jang.

353
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:58,218
I'm glad Ms. Jang is back.

354
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:02,282
I was upset because we started
talking about a new boss.

355
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:04,623
Ms. Jang must have taken a while...

356
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:06,867
because she had to see them off
on the bridge to the afterlife.

357
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:09,698
But, because she stepped on the bridge,

358
00:31:10,022 --> 00:31:12,498
Ms. Jang has lost a lot of her memories.

359
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:19,577
Her memories of the person
she sent off is almost gone.

360
00:31:19,903 --> 00:31:22,748
Do older memories disappear first?

361
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:25,777
The memories that bothered
us for the longest time...

362
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,218
will disappear first.

363
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:33,428
It feels futile, but it also
gives me a sense of relief.

364
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:37,658
Don't worry.

365
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:40,627
I didn't forget anything about you.

366
00:31:44,123 --> 00:31:47,168
Is that so? Then should I test you?

367
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:49,637
You're being so difficult.

368
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:52,978
The red car or me?

369
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:55,248
You. Happy?

370
00:31:56,173 --> 00:31:57,678
The most important thing is still safe.

371
00:31:58,673 --> 00:32:00,343
Do you remember how many
cars you have left?

372
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:01,448
Three...

373
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:05,488
Hey! You didn't sell them off
while I was away, did you?

374
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:07,127
I didn't sell your cars,

375
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:10,127
although I asked the horse to be sold off.

376
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:13,968
Do you remember Mr. Oh from Dangyong?

377
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:19,097
How do you know Oh Chung Hwan?

378
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:22,408
Even your memories from
200 years ago are safe.

379
00:32:22,762 --> 00:32:23,877
That's good.

380
00:32:24,762 --> 00:32:26,277
Did Mr. Kim tell you?

381
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:27,908
I can already see it.

382
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,807
You guys must have talked behind my back.

383
00:32:29,972 --> 00:32:32,448
- What else did he say?
- Have a drink.

384
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,712
I'm really upset about refusing
a drink from a woman...

385
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:36,958
just a while ago.

386
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:40,728
"A woman"? Why are you lying?

387
00:32:41,012 --> 00:32:43,027
There's no way you would
have another woman.

388
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:46,123
Are you upset because I made you wait?

389
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:48,567
But I do. She's someone really beautiful.

390
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:53,837
Chan Seong, don't underestimate me.

391
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:56,292
I'm not the jealous type.

392
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:59,307
I'd just kill you. Die, die, die.

393
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:01,772
Your wrist is intact,

394
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,178
so it looks like you kept your promise.

395
00:33:06,202 --> 00:33:08,347
I went to Man Weol Lodge to meet Ms. Jang.

396
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:10,918
- Me?
- Ma Go sent me.

397
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,142
Also, I was the one who saved you...

398
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:15,458
from losing everything on gambling.

399
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:18,182
I don't have such a memory.

400
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:19,858
I was told that you wouldn't remember.

401
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:24,867
I only went there briefly to
find the Moon Tree flower.

402
00:33:27,332 --> 00:33:28,537
"Moon Tree flower"?

403
00:33:30,203 --> 00:33:31,507
Does she need that?

404
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:33,507
She told me she's making wine.

405
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:36,278
- Do you know about it?
- Yes.

406
00:33:37,403 --> 00:33:40,287
I had a taste of it a long time ago.

407
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:42,617
It was disgusting.

408
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,298
I guess Ma Go is making the wine again.

409
00:34:37,662 --> 00:34:40,307
But her brother, Ji Hyun Joong,

410
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:42,907
died many years ago.

411
00:35:03,193 --> 00:35:04,298
Hyun Joong!

412
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,197
Tae Seok!

413
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:08,168
Hey, give me a ride.

414
00:35:08,263 --> 00:35:10,462
- Where's your bike?
- I left it at home.

415
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:12,177
- Hop on.
- Nice.

416
00:35:12,562 --> 00:35:14,407
- Just kidding.
- My gosh.

417
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:21,048
You guys used to go to school
with the old man together.

418
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:24,487
Then I guess he's not a bad
person who stole your life.

419
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,557
He's a good friend who's been
taking care of your sister for you.

420
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:35,197
I did some research on
Doctor Ji Hyun Joong.

421
00:35:36,122 --> 00:35:37,237
Look.

422
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:39,967
He did a lot of good deeds as a doctor.

423
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:42,807
And it turns out that a lot
of people respect him.

424
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:45,338
He lived a really good life with your name.

425
00:35:46,432 --> 00:35:49,048
Yes, he lived a very diligent life.

426
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:52,478
He's taking care of your sister
at the hospital he built,

427
00:35:52,502 --> 00:35:53,947
so wouldn't your sister...

428
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:56,717
be able to live for at least 10 more years?

429
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:04,827
Hey, I got a text from
your sister's caregiver.

430
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:06,498
What?

431
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:09,367
I asked for her number that day.

432
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,278
Hyun Joong.

433
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:46,438
Fortunately, she's stable again.

434
00:36:46,462 --> 00:36:49,438
Like always, she managed
to overcome the worst.

435
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:51,708
Thank you for everything.

436
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:53,208
Bye, then.

437
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,447
Hyun Mi's okay again.

438
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,028
You must be very disappointed.

439
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:26,507
Young lady.

440
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:35,748
Did you take my photo?

441
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,682
What photo?

442
00:37:37,682 --> 00:37:41,153
You once talked to me about
Hyun Joong last time.

443
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:44,257
You took the photo of me and
Hyun Joong, didn't you?

444
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:46,398
You have a photo of Hyun Joong?

445
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:49,898
I guess you really were friends.

446
00:37:51,723 --> 00:37:55,708
You're his friend, so make sure his
sister stays alive for a long time.

447
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:59,478
Hyun Joong's always watching you.

448
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:01,208
He was also watching you...

449
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:03,548
just a while ago.

450
00:38:10,013 --> 00:38:12,987
Wait. Is Hyun Joong alive?

451
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:17,122
Did he leave his sister with me
and leave me to live like this...

452
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:18,998
even when he's still alive?

453
00:38:19,582 --> 00:38:22,427
Where is Hyun Joong? Where is he?

454
00:38:24,863 --> 00:38:29,307
My goodness, you really used to
be an elite student, Hyun Joong.

455
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:31,232
I was also really popular.

456
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:33,732
I can already imagine. Even
the ghosts here told me...

457
00:38:33,732 --> 00:38:35,772
that their hearts flutter
every time you smile at them.

458
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,447
I'm sure you were popular.

459
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:41,173
Back when I passed the civil
service exam at a young age...

460
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,918
and was known as a genius,

461
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:45,212
all the young ladies in the neighborhood...

462
00:38:45,212 --> 00:38:49,012
gathered beneath my house wall so
they could hear me read out loud.

463
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:51,323
I guess they only heard your voice...

464
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:52,898
since they couldn't see your face.

465
00:38:53,482 --> 00:38:55,892
You do have a nice voice, Mr. Kim.

466
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:59,568
A man should have a nice voice.
Don't you agree, Mr. Ku?

467
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:02,938
He not only has a nice voice,
but he also has good looks.

468
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:08,347
The person next to you must
be your school friend.

469
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:12,677
Yes, he's the person who's taking care...

470
00:39:13,303 --> 00:39:14,418
of my sister Hyun Mi right now.

471
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:24,157
And thanks to him, Hyun Mi was
able to stay alive today.

472
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:31,168
It seems like Hyun Joong
will be leaving soon.

473
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:32,967
So I've been thinking about something.

474
00:39:33,093 --> 00:39:36,192
How about we hold a
special event for him...

475
00:39:36,193 --> 00:39:38,307
before he leaves with his
sister once she comes here?

476
00:39:38,403 --> 00:39:42,102
Hyun Joong never got to spend
much time with his sister.

477
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:43,973
So how about we open up
an amusement park...

478
00:39:43,973 --> 00:39:46,048
so they could have fun together
at least for a short time?

479
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:48,588
An amusement park?

480
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:53,358
I don't think it's a bad idea to
turn the bar into a kid's cafe.

481
00:39:53,712 --> 00:39:56,712
He's been kindly waiting for
his sister for 70 years.

482
00:39:56,712 --> 00:39:59,597
He should at least get to talk
to his sister for a short while.

483
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:04,668
Do you really think he's
been staying here...

484
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:06,867
just so he could wait for his sister?

485
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:10,832
Being the pure and kind young man he is,

486
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:13,162
do you really think he's
been waiting here...

487
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:16,248
for 70 years just because he
was worried about his sister?

488
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,148
Have you all forgotten?

489
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:25,387
He came here after he got shot.

490
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:42,033
If you didn't want to hold an event
for Hyun Joong and his sister,

491
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,902
you could've just stayed quiet
instead of ruining the mood.

492
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:46,307
I once...

493
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:49,907
shot someone with this gun.

494
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:55,018
I shot the ghost's enemy with a
bullet filled with resentment...

495
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:00,088
so that he could live in agony forever.

496
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:04,522
Are you saying you're
going to do the same...

497
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:06,157
to the guy who killed Hyun Joong?

498
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:10,593
Hyun Joong already shot his enemy...

499
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,867
with his own bullet of resentment.

500
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:15,608
What do you think that bullet is?

501
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:22,278
It's Hyun Mi. I'm talking
about his sister, Ji Hyun Mi.

502
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:28,513
His sister couldn't even see properly...

503
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:30,148
and was mentally ill.

504
00:41:30,513 --> 00:41:34,688
And he kept her beside his friend
and made him suffer forever.

505
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:38,053
It's true that Hyun Joong...

506
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:40,628
has been waiting here for 70
years for his sister to come.

507
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:44,737
But he also used her to harass
the guy who killed her...

508
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:46,668
for 70 whole years.

509
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:49,037
The person who killed Hyun Joong...

510
00:41:50,363 --> 00:41:52,278
is his friend that's
taking care of his sister?

511
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,557
Yu Na.

512
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:06,287
Hyun Joong.

513
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:10,427
I brought someone who
really wishes to meet you.

514
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:12,597
Me?

515
00:42:24,763 --> 00:42:25,938
Hyun Joong.

516
00:42:37,113 --> 00:42:40,927
Ms. Jang, Hyun Joong's
so-called friend just came.

517
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,427
Yu Na brought him here.

518
00:42:44,622 --> 00:42:47,157
I guess he's here to ask
him for forgiveness.

519
00:42:57,232 --> 00:42:59,938
Hyun Joong ran away as soon
as he saw the old man.

520
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:02,507
I guess he doesn't want to meet him.

521
00:43:02,573 --> 00:43:05,278
I didn't bring the old man
here so he could feel at ease.

522
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:09,418
Hyun Joong can get his stolen life back...

523
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:14,028
only while he's still alive.

524
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:15,927
That's why I brought him here.

525
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:20,867
Hyun Joong needs to decide for himself.

526
00:43:41,272 --> 00:43:45,012
There was a bombing, and that
killed both his parents.

527
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:48,188
And Hyun Joong barely managed
to save his little sister.

528
00:44:02,962 --> 00:44:04,237
Eat slowly.

529
00:44:06,662 --> 00:44:07,807
Is it good?

530
00:44:08,903 --> 00:44:12,117
Hyun Mi. Once we get to our
uncle's place in Busan,

531
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:13,843
you can eat a lot of good food...

532
00:44:13,843 --> 00:44:16,318
and get treated so that you
aren't in pain anymore.

533
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:19,458
His sister was badly hurt,

534
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,453
so he was in a rush.

535
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:23,487
Instead of going with the refugees,

536
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:26,057
I heard he decided to take
shortcuts through the mountains.

537
00:44:45,943 --> 00:44:47,077
Do not move.

538
00:45:02,923 --> 00:45:04,068
Hyun Joong?

539
00:45:05,562 --> 00:45:06,668
Tae Seok.

540
00:45:07,462 --> 00:45:09,608
That's where he met a runaway soldier,

541
00:45:10,232 --> 00:45:11,637
who turned out to be his friend.

542
00:45:18,943 --> 00:45:20,217
Eat slowly.

543
00:45:22,673 --> 00:45:24,487
My sister is badly hurt.

544
00:45:25,613 --> 00:45:27,157
Do you know the shortcut?

545
00:45:30,723 --> 00:45:33,597
We're headed to our uncle's place in Busan.

546
00:45:34,553 --> 00:45:35,867
Come with us, Tae Seok.

547
00:45:42,392 --> 00:45:43,568
Take off your uniform.

548
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:46,037
Take it off!

549
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,872
I'll get shot and die
if I keep this uniform,

550
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:49,947
so...

551
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:52,278
take that off.

552
00:45:55,073 --> 00:45:56,188
Tae Seok.

553
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:08,752
You can't take this. Hyun
Mi's medicine is in here,

554
00:46:08,752 --> 00:46:10,228
and she'll die without it.

555
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:19,807
Let go before I shoot you.

556
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:50,668
Hyun Joong.

557
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:53,237
Hyun Joong!

558
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:55,278
Hyun Joong!

559
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,878
- Hyun Joong!
- Hyun Joong.

560
00:46:58,843 --> 00:47:01,487
I didn't do this on purpose.
You know that, right?

561
00:47:01,743 --> 00:47:02,847
- Hyun Joong!
- Darn it.

562
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:05,257
- Hyun Joong!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

563
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:08,588
(Ji Hyun Joong)

564
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:11,927
- Hyun Joong!
- Take my sister with you.

565
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:13,798
Hyun Joong!

566
00:47:13,982 --> 00:47:16,923
Take my sister with you.

567
00:47:16,923 --> 00:47:18,568
- Hyun Joong!
- Please.

568
00:47:30,403 --> 00:47:31,617
Hyun Joong!

569
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:33,648
Hyun Joong!

570
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,263
His friend took Hyun Mi...

571
00:47:58,263 --> 00:48:00,162
and went to his uncle's house.

572
00:48:00,162 --> 00:48:01,232
(Ji Hyun Joong)

573
00:48:01,232 --> 00:48:03,577
They recognized Hyun Mi,

574
00:48:03,903 --> 00:48:06,177
so they naturally thought the
one who brought her there...

575
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:09,248
was Hyun Joong.

576
00:48:09,743 --> 00:48:12,358
Ever since that time, he has
lived as Ji Hyun Joong.

577
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:19,998
Ms. Jang said...

578
00:48:20,283 --> 00:48:23,197
Hyun Mi is the bullet
he shot his enemy with.

579
00:48:24,962 --> 00:48:27,093
Hyun Joong always talked
about his sister...

580
00:48:27,093 --> 00:48:28,838
with a smile on his face.

581
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:31,537
He probably loathed him very much
as he looked at his friend...

582
00:48:32,462 --> 00:48:34,407
who took care of his sister.

583
00:48:44,412 --> 00:48:47,318
Hyun Joong, why are you sulking here?

584
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:55,122
Goodness, the leaves and
flowers are all gone,

585
00:48:55,122 --> 00:48:56,668
so it looks really shabby.

586
00:48:57,122 --> 00:48:59,363
And it looks even worse
with a guy sitting here...

587
00:48:59,363 --> 00:49:01,367
looking like a dog who
was caught in the rain.

588
00:49:10,332 --> 00:49:11,717
This isn't fair.

589
00:49:12,272 --> 00:49:14,812
It was tough to see how he
got to do everything...

590
00:49:14,812 --> 00:49:16,748
that I dreamed of doing.

591
00:49:19,743 --> 00:49:21,088
I'll never forgive him.

592
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:24,327
How can you forgive someone who
punched a hole in your chest?

593
00:49:26,582 --> 00:49:28,197
Just go and hear him out.

594
00:49:28,823 --> 00:49:30,823
I'm sure he didn't come here to show off...

595
00:49:30,823 --> 00:49:32,268
that he had a good life
after he killed you.

596
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:34,807
He's probably here to make an
excuse saying that life was...

597
00:49:35,093 --> 00:49:36,407
tough and harsh for him too.

598
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:42,947
But it's not too bad to
hear out someone's excuse.

599
00:49:43,872 --> 00:49:45,278
You feel a little better too.

600
00:49:47,243 --> 00:49:49,787
Did that happen to you too?

601
00:49:50,343 --> 00:49:51,418
Yes.

602
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:56,287
That's how I could see
him off one last time...

603
00:49:57,182 --> 00:49:58,498
as he turned around and left.

604
00:50:00,022 --> 00:50:04,128
You said you didn't remember
the firefly incident.

605
00:50:05,823 --> 00:50:07,597
You have no time to nitpick over my memory.

606
00:50:08,493 --> 00:50:10,732
If you're going to sit here and sulk,

607
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:12,307
I'll send him away.

608
00:50:14,372 --> 00:50:17,208
Goodness, Yu Na did all that for nothing.

609
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:28,088
This will make him feel relieved
for the rest of his life.

610
00:50:28,712 --> 00:50:29,827
But...

611
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:33,057
since Yu Na brought him
here, go and see him.

612
00:50:35,653 --> 00:50:36,898
A girl that you like is...

613
00:50:37,323 --> 00:50:39,568
trying to do something for you.

614
00:50:51,473 --> 00:50:53,318
I guess bringing you here...

615
00:50:54,102 --> 00:50:56,347
made Hyun Joong feel more tormented.

616
00:50:57,372 --> 00:50:58,918
Please leave.

617
00:50:59,912 --> 00:51:01,427
Well, in that case,

618
00:51:04,553 --> 00:51:06,498
can you give this to him?

619
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:15,608
(Ji Hyun Joong)

620
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:19,378
Hyun Joong loved going to school.

621
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:34,257
Mr. Oh Tae Seok.

622
00:51:35,013 --> 00:51:37,998
Mr. Ji said he will see you.

623
00:51:46,493 --> 00:51:48,537
He wants to see you in this room.

624
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:50,338
Please go in.

625
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:35,748
You still look the same, Hyun Joong.

626
00:52:37,912 --> 00:52:41,688
I kept my eyes on you as you grew older.

627
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:43,858
Tae Seok.

628
00:52:55,493 --> 00:52:57,708
(Oh Tae Seok)

629
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:12,358
(Ji Hyun Joong)

630
00:53:12,712 --> 00:53:14,553
Why aren't you worried about Hyun Joong...

631
00:53:14,553 --> 00:53:15,858
after leaving him with his
enemy in the same room?

632
00:53:16,412 --> 00:53:18,128
Because Hyun Joong is nice.

633
00:53:19,352 --> 00:53:21,628
And he has been keeping his eyes on him.

634
00:53:22,122 --> 00:53:24,637
I'm sure he already feels
much more at ease...

635
00:53:24,962 --> 00:53:26,498
as he was watching Mr. Oh look
after Hyun Mi to the very end.

636
00:53:26,622 --> 00:53:29,168
Since the nice Hyun Joong
feels much more at ease,

637
00:53:29,732 --> 00:53:31,363
the wicked owner will...

638
00:53:31,363 --> 00:53:33,278
make him pay the compensation.

639
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:37,007
Are you going to take money from him?

640
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:40,278
Hyun Joong's friend is filthy rich.

641
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:44,987
I should throw a party for our
little kid before he leaves.

642
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:51,682
You donated a lot of money and
even founded a hospital...

643
00:53:51,682 --> 00:53:53,398
under Ji Hyun Joong's name.

644
00:53:53,752 --> 00:53:57,298
I have lived all of my
life while repenting.

645
00:53:59,223 --> 00:54:01,068
Then do one more thing while you're at it.

646
00:54:01,932 --> 00:54:05,407
Please buy a school under
Ji Hyun Joong's name.

647
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:09,177
If you can help it, the prestigious
school Hyun Joong used to attend.

648
00:54:09,732 --> 00:54:10,947
Please buy it for us.

649
00:54:13,473 --> 00:54:16,847
(Dongsun High School)

650
00:54:17,142 --> 00:54:18,843
We're so thankful...

651
00:54:18,843 --> 00:54:22,757
Dr. Ji Hyun Joong donated such
a large sum to the school.

652
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:26,622
However, are you sure you're okay...

653
00:54:26,622 --> 00:54:28,998
with such a small event in
the middle of the night?

654
00:54:29,053 --> 00:54:32,068
All Ji Hyun Joong wants is an
honorary high school diploma.

655
00:54:32,323 --> 00:54:35,407
Also, nighttime is easier
for those attending today.

656
00:54:35,932 --> 00:54:39,077
The one receiving the diploma
is also Ji Hyun Joong.

657
00:54:39,162 --> 00:54:41,507
He has the same name as Dr. Ji.

658
00:54:42,832 --> 00:54:45,248
He's a student who loved
going to this school.

659
00:54:47,443 --> 00:54:48,617
There he is.

660
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:55,827
(Ceremony for Ji Hyun Joong's
Honorary High School Diploma)

661
00:54:56,312 --> 00:54:58,097
They must be his family.

662
00:55:00,383 --> 00:55:02,367
Yes. We're a family.

663
00:55:09,162 --> 00:55:11,268
Is everyone here?

664
00:55:12,502 --> 00:55:14,778
Yes. So many people came.

665
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,787
Why did you invite everyone
and create such a commotion?

666
00:55:23,912 --> 00:55:26,217
Hyun Joong is popular, you know.

667
00:55:27,082 --> 00:55:29,783
The Grim Reaper provided us with a bus,

668
00:55:29,783 --> 00:55:31,427
so you don't have to worry.

669
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:42,907
Here is your honorary diploma.

670
00:55:48,272 --> 00:55:49,878
(Ceremony for Ji Hyun Joong's
Honorary High School Diploma)

671
00:55:56,013 --> 00:55:57,487
Congratulations on graduating.

672
00:55:58,182 --> 00:55:59,418
Thank you.

673
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:07,528
Thank you for coming, everyone.

674
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:16,593
For...

675
00:56:16,593 --> 00:56:18,403
- Hyun Joong!
- Hyun Joong!

676
00:56:18,403 --> 00:56:20,778
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

677
00:56:23,973 --> 00:56:25,048
Chan Seong.

678
00:56:25,473 --> 00:56:27,778
Are all those people ghosts?

679
00:56:28,142 --> 00:56:31,458
Yes. The people you can see have
been ghosts for a long time,

680
00:56:31,613 --> 00:56:32,858
so they can show themselves
in a tangible form.

681
00:56:32,912 --> 00:56:35,858
Show themselves? What an ability to have.

682
00:56:36,883 --> 00:56:38,182
Aside from that table,

683
00:56:38,182 --> 00:56:40,128
this whole place is filled
with our employees.

684
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:44,597
That table is full, and
this table is full too?

685
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:50,062
Sanchez, if this is too hard on
you, it's okay to stay outside.

686
00:56:50,062 --> 00:56:51,708
No, I'm okay.

687
00:56:52,062 --> 00:56:54,533
When else will I get the chance to
watch ghosts have a team dinner?

688
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,407
Isn't it hard to do?

689
00:56:57,303 --> 00:57:00,347
Hey, are you sure Man Weol's
cousin isn't a human?

690
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:03,173
It's a long story. She was a ghost,

691
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:04,372
then she possessed someone else's body...

692
00:57:04,372 --> 00:57:06,513
Forget it. They even possess people.

693
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:09,182
I'll look after everyone, and
work even harder from now on.

694
00:57:09,182 --> 00:57:11,283
- Thank you!
- Good luck!

695
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:12,697
- Let's go!
- Bravo.

696
00:57:16,953 --> 00:57:19,298
Chan Seong, do you like those ghosts?

697
00:57:19,823 --> 00:57:21,938
It's our first time having a meal together.

698
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:24,467
It feels good when you have a
meal with your colleagues, right?

699
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:30,577
Sanchez, don't drink much to get drunk.

700
00:57:30,932 --> 00:57:32,872
Some mischievous ghosts...

701
00:57:32,872 --> 00:57:34,748
like to possess people that are drunk.

702
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:37,217
Are you serious?

703
00:57:38,743 --> 00:57:40,657
The one at that table...

704
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:43,088
keeps on looking at you.

705
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:45,757
Be careful.

706
00:57:48,223 --> 00:57:51,697
Ghosts must like good-looking
people like me. Am I right?

707
00:58:08,973 --> 00:58:11,518
(Dashcam Settings)

708
00:58:17,153 --> 00:58:19,657
Goodness. Is that a ghost?

709
00:58:19,953 --> 00:58:21,798
I must be able to see them now.

710
00:58:26,493 --> 00:58:29,807
Here. He was recorded clearly.
It's not a ghost.

711
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:31,938
You startled me.

712
00:58:32,932 --> 00:58:34,077
I guess he's not a ghost.

713
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:39,018
There's no need to be so scared.
Ghosts used to be people too.

714
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:41,073
It's normal to be scared.

715
00:58:41,073 --> 00:58:42,418
You're the one who turned strange.

716
00:58:44,343 --> 00:58:47,387
Chan Seong, I think you're going too far.

717
00:58:47,642 --> 00:58:50,588
I'm worried you might completely
move on to the other side.

718
00:58:52,122 --> 00:58:54,228
I understand your concern,

719
00:58:55,122 --> 00:58:58,197
but the people you saw today
are all going to leave.

720
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:00,298
Man Weol, too?

721
00:59:02,562 --> 00:59:03,637
Yes.

722
00:59:05,102 --> 00:59:06,278
Man Weol, too.

723
00:59:17,743 --> 00:59:19,318
I gave Mr. Ku the medicine...

724
00:59:19,843 --> 00:59:22,188
while you were away.

725
00:59:29,622 --> 00:59:30,967
He didn't take it.

726
00:59:32,622 --> 00:59:33,867
I see.

727
00:59:34,562 --> 00:59:36,993
Mr. Ku must have trusted...

728
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:38,537
you'd return.

729
00:59:43,173 --> 00:59:44,978
I guess you didn't.

730
00:59:45,272 --> 00:59:48,318
I was glad you were freed from this place.

731
00:59:48,973 --> 00:59:50,088
However,

732
00:59:51,142 --> 00:59:52,318
you returned.

733
00:59:53,182 --> 00:59:55,757
I didn't return because I'm tied
to the Moon Tree like before.

734
00:59:57,482 --> 00:59:59,557
A new owner will be coming.

735
01:00:00,323 --> 01:00:01,927
Ma Go is working on it.

736
01:00:02,923 --> 01:00:05,537
Does Mr. Ku know about this?

737
01:00:06,863 --> 01:00:09,608
Yes. He does.

738
01:00:10,932 --> 01:00:12,407
Although neither of us talks about it.

739
01:00:15,432 --> 01:00:18,778
I want to send off Mr. Kim,
Hyun Joong, and you...

740
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:22,688
while I'm here.

741
01:00:24,272 --> 01:00:25,418
But...

742
01:00:27,642 --> 01:00:29,188
I'm not sure if I will have enough time.

743
01:00:48,473 --> 01:00:50,847
Ms. Jang is inside.

744
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:52,347
Ms. Choi.

745
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:54,677
I paid a visit to that woman...

746
01:00:55,312 --> 01:00:56,847
we found at the pharmacy,

747
01:00:57,412 --> 01:00:59,018
and she'll be giving birth soon.

748
01:01:00,843 --> 01:01:03,657
If the baby ends up carrying
on the family name,

749
01:01:06,323 --> 01:01:07,858
will you continue to stay behind?

750
01:01:10,723 --> 01:01:12,298
Are you afraid...

751
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:14,493
that I'd wander the nether world...

752
01:01:14,493 --> 01:01:16,168
after Ms. Jang is gone...

753
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:18,438
and Hotel Del Luna disappears?

754
01:01:20,332 --> 01:01:21,507
So you know.

755
01:01:22,903 --> 01:01:24,548
I just found out.

756
01:01:26,272 --> 01:01:30,188
Ms. Jang is no longer
tied to the Moon Tree.

757
01:01:30,973 --> 01:01:34,717
She could have gone to the
afterlife if she wanted.

758
01:01:36,453 --> 01:01:40,028
What has her tied down here must be you,

759
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:42,467
Mr. Ku.

760
01:01:43,593 --> 01:01:45,338
Are you worried that I'd become...

761
01:01:46,193 --> 01:01:47,537
another Moon Tree?

762
01:01:48,533 --> 01:01:49,807
I'm reminded...

763
01:01:50,593 --> 01:01:53,537
of something Ma Go said to a priest...

764
01:01:53,832 --> 01:01:56,478
who came for a ghost wedding.

765
01:01:57,473 --> 01:01:58,918
She said that it needs more courage...

766
01:01:59,903 --> 01:02:03,148
to let go than to hold on.

767
01:02:31,943 --> 01:02:34,518
Gosh, it's so heavy. It's so heavy.

768
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:44,128
What are these?

769
01:02:44,883 --> 01:02:46,728
I take them out from time to time.

770
01:02:47,783 --> 01:02:49,427
There's so much dust.

771
01:02:56,593 --> 01:02:59,208
It's so strong. Try opening it.

772
01:03:13,082 --> 01:03:14,588
- It's a camera.
- Yes.

773
01:03:15,312 --> 01:03:20,197
I used it to take all these pictures.

774
01:03:22,022 --> 01:03:23,228
It looks quite old.

775
01:03:24,522 --> 01:03:27,537
Did your previous general managers
take those pictures for you?

776
01:03:27,593 --> 01:03:29,237
Let's see...

777
01:03:30,332 --> 01:03:32,932
That's the one. The one who took
this photo of Man Weol Inn...

778
01:03:32,932 --> 01:03:35,037
ran away after using up all of my money.

779
01:03:35,403 --> 01:03:37,102
I chased after him, and it turns out...

780
01:03:37,102 --> 01:03:39,077
his wife was close to giving birth.

781
01:03:39,443 --> 01:03:40,677
I just let him go.

782
01:03:41,673 --> 01:03:44,887
You already know Hwang Moon
Sook from Hotel Del Luna.

783
01:03:45,182 --> 01:03:47,617
And way before this one...

784
01:03:48,212 --> 01:03:49,387
There it is.

785
01:03:50,812 --> 01:03:52,323
The general manager then...

786
01:03:52,323 --> 01:03:54,998
was really handsome.

787
01:03:56,153 --> 01:03:58,153
They say if a man is handsome,
you should call them your honey.

788
01:03:58,153 --> 01:04:00,498
He was more than just a honey.

789
01:04:01,832 --> 01:04:03,137
I don't believe you.

790
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:06,002
Mr. Kim told me everything.

791
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:08,278
Out of all the general managers
he saw in the last 500 years,

792
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:12,117
I'm the most handsome one.

793
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:17,088
He told me you fell in love
with me because of my looks.

794
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,342
Why would you talk about
such a thing with Mr. Kim?

795
01:04:20,343 --> 01:04:22,287
When did you two get so close?

796
01:04:23,082 --> 01:04:25,383
That's why you should've
taken these pictures...

797
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:27,653
with the people who were
with you at that time.

798
01:04:27,653 --> 01:04:29,068
Then you'd have the evidence to refute.

799
01:04:30,093 --> 01:04:31,168
Back then,

800
01:04:32,062 --> 01:04:35,237
passing relationships
were meaningless to me.

801
01:04:35,863 --> 01:04:39,708
But looking at these with you,

802
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:44,677
it's too bad I didn't
leave any records behind.

803
01:04:47,743 --> 01:04:49,248
Would you like to leave
a record right now...

804
01:04:50,013 --> 01:04:51,318
with that camera?

805
01:04:56,383 --> 01:04:58,383
Hyun Joong got his honorary diploma,

806
01:04:58,383 --> 01:04:59,757
but he didn't get to take any pictures.

807
01:05:00,153 --> 01:05:02,498
We should all get together
to take a picture.

808
01:05:02,522 --> 01:05:03,697
I'll take it for you.

809
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:25,142
I've never taken a picture before.
I wonder if I'll be visible.

810
01:05:25,142 --> 01:05:28,157
You will. I took a picture
with a phone before.

811
01:05:28,953 --> 01:05:31,812
We should have put on more blush.

812
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:33,998
We look pale like ghosts.

813
01:05:34,453 --> 01:05:35,827
It's okay.

814
01:05:35,852 --> 01:05:37,967
What's so wrong with looking
like ghosts when we're ghosts?

815
01:05:38,923 --> 01:05:42,232
Hyun Joong, don't open your
mouth when we take the picture.

816
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:44,967
Mr. Kim, don't blink.

817
01:05:50,272 --> 01:05:51,378
All right.

818
01:05:52,303 --> 01:05:53,518
I'll take it now.

819
01:05:53,973 --> 01:05:57,347
1, 2, 3.

820
01:06:09,823 --> 01:06:11,423
Mr. Ku, you should join us.

821
01:06:11,423 --> 01:06:13,022
Yes, hurry on over.

822
01:06:13,022 --> 01:06:14,697
Come over, Mr. Ku.

823
01:06:54,518 --> 01:06:56,263
How can I put it away when
you're sitting on it?

824
01:06:57,018 --> 01:06:58,192
Get off.

825
01:06:59,388 --> 01:07:00,862
Try to lift me off of it.

826
01:07:03,257 --> 01:07:06,303
I said, try. I won't
move unless you lift me.

827
01:07:06,697 --> 01:07:09,313
Forget it. You can put it away then.

828
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:17,813
To the room.

829
01:07:32,558 --> 01:07:35,303
We took a picture, and
let's go eat jjajangmyeon.

830
01:07:39,228 --> 01:07:40,372
Darn it.

831
01:07:45,238 --> 01:07:46,482
You took a picture.

832
01:07:47,207 --> 01:07:49,013
It was a lot of fun.

833
01:07:50,877 --> 01:07:52,282
Why didn't you call me?

834
01:07:52,478 --> 01:07:56,522
We took those with Mr. Ku
before Ms. Jang leaves...

835
01:07:56,617 --> 01:07:59,593
and the hotel disappears.

836
01:07:59,787 --> 01:08:02,063
Is the hotel going to disappear? Why?

837
01:08:02,518 --> 01:08:07,133
Ma Go is preparing to make a
new Guest House of the Moon.

838
01:08:09,197 --> 01:08:12,442
Then Ms. Jang's Hotel Del Luna...

839
01:08:13,327 --> 01:08:14,402
will disappear.

840
01:08:14,697 --> 01:08:15,942
What about you?

841
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:20,082
Are you going to leave
if the hotel disappears?

842
01:08:51,997 --> 01:08:54,343
It's fermenting really well.

843
01:08:56,978 --> 01:09:00,982
I heard Ma Go is preparing the
wine for the next hotel owner.

844
01:09:01,877 --> 01:09:03,518
I'll drink it and become the owner.

845
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:06,188
It's up to Ma Go to decide
who it'll be the owner.

846
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:09,518
Then Ms. Jang should drink it
and keep on being the owner.

847
01:09:09,518 --> 01:09:11,018
Do you think Ma Go would
make Ms. Jang the owner again?

848
01:09:11,018 --> 01:09:12,603
They had to work hard to free her.

849
01:09:13,728 --> 01:09:15,257
When is Ma Go coming?

850
01:09:15,257 --> 01:09:16,398
Where can I find her?

851
01:09:16,398 --> 01:09:19,728
She's not someone you can meet
just because you want to.

852
01:09:19,728 --> 01:09:21,803
Can't anyone from here meet with her?

853
01:09:23,167 --> 01:09:27,167
I think Mr. Ku has the permission
to enter Ma Go's medicine shop.

854
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,883
He said he found the firefly from her shop.

855
01:09:55,938 --> 01:09:57,643
(Medicine Shop, 11-28,
Yakjae-golmokgil, Gyeongdong Market)

856
01:10:02,037 --> 01:10:03,952
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

857
01:10:07,707 --> 01:10:09,853
Sanchez, thank you for everything.

858
01:10:10,148 --> 01:10:12,318
Let's go out to eat with Chan Seong.

859
01:10:12,318 --> 01:10:13,318
It'll be my treat.

860
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:15,362
Are you moving back home?

861
01:10:15,888 --> 01:10:17,133
She's moving in with me.

862
01:10:17,858 --> 01:10:19,332
Are you going to live together?

863
01:10:20,358 --> 01:10:22,063
It's going to be so tough
for you, Yeong Su.

864
01:10:22,827 --> 01:10:25,398
Mi Ra tries to help around the house,

865
01:10:25,398 --> 01:10:27,343
but she's useless.

866
01:10:28,068 --> 01:10:29,673
I already know.

867
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:31,667
We had so many fights,

868
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:35,013
so we decided to see how
much more we can fight.

869
01:10:35,238 --> 01:10:38,082
Luckily, I'm good at cleaning.

870
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,952
And she's better at cooking than me.

871
01:10:43,547 --> 01:10:44,793
She is?

872
01:10:44,848 --> 01:10:45,992
Yes.

873
01:10:46,648 --> 01:10:50,332
The kimchi and side dishes
she brought me were good.

874
01:10:51,188 --> 01:10:54,133
I didn't make them all by myself.

875
01:10:54,327 --> 01:10:57,496
- My parents helped me.
- I see.

876
01:10:57,497 --> 01:11:00,667
It's not a lie since they
make it at the factory.

877
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,103
"The factory"?

878
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:06,313
My parents run a kimchi factory.

879
01:11:07,438 --> 01:11:09,278
They're always on the shopping channel.

880
01:11:09,278 --> 01:11:10,438
Haven't you heard of Daeho Kimchi?

881
01:11:10,438 --> 01:11:12,253
"Daeho Kimchi"?

882
01:11:12,308 --> 01:11:15,423
I used to always eat it when I lived alone.

883
01:11:16,678 --> 01:11:20,522
Is that why Mi Ra's side
dishes were just my taste?

884
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,192
No wonder.

885
01:11:22,457 --> 01:11:26,433
The food that raised you
was made by my parents.

886
01:11:27,488 --> 01:11:29,428
We're meant to be together.

887
01:11:29,428 --> 01:11:30,832
I think so.

888
01:11:30,957 --> 01:11:33,968
Chan Seong and I ate that kimchi too.

889
01:11:33,968 --> 01:11:36,398
It's a kimchi brand that fed
countless people in Korea.

890
01:11:36,398 --> 01:11:38,638
I don't think it's anything special.

891
01:11:38,638 --> 01:11:41,238
Yeong Su says it's just his taste.

892
01:11:41,238 --> 01:11:43,152
- Right?
- Yes.

893
01:11:43,308 --> 01:11:44,813
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

894
01:11:45,037 --> 01:11:46,906
- Love shot?
- Love shot.

895
01:11:46,907 --> 01:11:48,223
You read my mind.

896
01:11:51,047 --> 01:11:53,917
They should get along until
they move in together.

897
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:55,723
I don't want that they have a fight
and Mi Ra ends up staying here.

898
01:11:59,488 --> 01:12:01,362
- Is it good?
- It's good.

899
01:12:05,197 --> 01:12:07,572
Both of you are writers, aren't you?

900
01:12:07,598 --> 01:12:10,742
This is something Li Bai liked to drink.

901
01:12:11,997 --> 01:12:15,482
He's a writer of a best-selling novel.

902
01:12:15,808 --> 01:12:18,238
He passed away just before
the release of his new book.

903
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:19,853
It's really unfortunate.

904
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:22,417
I did a lot of research,

905
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:24,152
and the story was really interesting.

906
01:12:24,577 --> 01:12:26,362
What is your novel about?

907
01:12:26,417 --> 01:12:29,263
It's about a scholar
from the Joseon Dynasty.

908
01:12:30,257 --> 01:12:31,717
The bartender is a scholar...

909
01:12:31,718 --> 01:12:33,963
who passed the state exam
with the highest mark.

910
01:12:34,627 --> 01:12:35,973
Really?

911
01:12:36,228 --> 01:12:38,398
What is your name?

912
01:12:38,398 --> 01:12:41,003
My name wasn't recorded
anywhere in history.

913
01:12:41,068 --> 01:12:43,968
The protagonist of the novel I
was going to write about...

914
01:12:43,968 --> 01:12:46,383
is someone who also passed the
state exam with the best mark.

915
01:12:46,468 --> 01:12:49,777
But his appointment got canceled.

916
01:12:49,778 --> 01:12:51,383
Did that actually happen?

917
01:12:51,707 --> 01:12:54,007
He got caught for writing lewd literature,

918
01:12:54,007 --> 01:12:56,117
so he was beaten up by other scholars...

919
01:12:56,117 --> 01:12:57,577
and they retracted the fact
that he passed the state exam.

920
01:12:57,577 --> 01:12:59,223
It's the story of a perverted scholar.

921
01:13:00,787 --> 01:13:01,963
That's interesting.

922
01:13:02,888 --> 01:13:05,263
What's the name of that perverted scholar?

923
01:13:05,518 --> 01:13:07,162
He has a grandiose name.

924
01:13:07,228 --> 01:13:09,633
It's Si Ik, which means
the wings of the era.

925
01:13:10,257 --> 01:13:12,332
His name is Kim Si Ik.

926
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:19,813
Kim Si Ik!

927
01:13:20,608 --> 01:13:21,968
If you have any shame,

928
01:13:21,968 --> 01:13:24,612
do not ever dare to lift
up your face again.

929
01:13:28,308 --> 01:13:30,978
The writing had already been done,

930
01:13:30,978 --> 01:13:33,563
so it might be published
as my posthumous work.

931
01:13:34,218 --> 01:13:36,192
I hope it does get published.

932
01:14:04,478 --> 01:14:07,963
I heard the liquor is made
with the energy of the moon.

933
01:14:15,627 --> 01:14:18,003
It came back to how it used to look like.

934
01:14:19,058 --> 01:14:21,442
No, it's different from that time.

935
01:14:22,228 --> 01:14:24,742
Back then, it was just on display.

936
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:28,742
But now, time passed once again,

937
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:30,253
grew out leaves,

938
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:32,482
bloomed flowers, then they fell off.

939
01:14:35,407 --> 01:14:38,577
Do you hope to see it...

940
01:14:38,577 --> 01:14:41,563
grow out leaves and bloom flowers again?

941
01:14:48,888 --> 01:14:50,332
This is dead.

942
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,543
If I wish to have such time once again,

943
01:14:55,228 --> 01:14:56,572
I should probably cross over.

944
01:14:58,398 --> 01:14:59,543
Probably.

945
01:15:02,778 --> 01:15:05,482
Yu Na, what's wrong?

946
01:15:08,907 --> 01:15:10,022
Ms. Jang.

947
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:14,162
I stole this liquor from Ma Go's pharmacy.

948
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:22,633
She said it's for the new owner.

949
01:15:25,098 --> 01:15:27,202
Can you drink this...

950
01:15:28,627 --> 01:15:30,372
and stay in this hotel?

951
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:58,902
A girl who has been coming
in and out of your hotel...

952
01:15:58,928 --> 01:16:01,572
stole the liquor I made.

953
01:16:02,398 --> 01:16:04,912
I'm sure she did this
because she was afraid...

954
01:16:05,337 --> 01:16:06,683
the reception guy, Hyun Joong, would leave.

955
01:16:07,138 --> 01:16:08,942
She didn't want the hotel to disappear.

956
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:13,482
Then she probably brought that to Man Weol.

957
01:16:16,877 --> 01:16:19,417
If she drinks that...

958
01:16:19,417 --> 01:16:21,848
and regains the power of the Moon Tree,

959
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:23,732
Hotel Del Luna will remain here,

960
01:16:25,888 --> 01:16:27,032
and you two...

961
01:16:27,888 --> 01:16:30,103
can be together again.

962
01:16:34,598 --> 01:16:36,372
If Ms. Jang makes such a choice,

963
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:38,973
will you not stop her?

964
01:16:41,837 --> 01:16:43,753
You wanted to let her go quietly.

965
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:49,353
If I do not stop her,

966
01:16:50,348 --> 01:16:53,063
what will you do?

967
01:17:09,768 --> 01:17:11,568
Mr. Ku, it's Yu Na.

968
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:14,313
I know. Where's Ms. Jang?

969
01:17:41,068 --> 01:17:43,843
On the first day that I was
tied down to the Moon Tree,

970
01:17:46,907 --> 01:17:49,652
the full moon was as big
and bright as that one.

971
01:17:57,778 --> 01:18:01,423
The liquor I had at that time
came back into my hands.

972
01:18:07,157 --> 01:18:08,303
Chan Seong.

973
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:14,843
Should I drink this again?

974
01:18:29,678 --> 01:18:31,253
When I went back in time...

975
01:18:32,988 --> 01:18:34,362
and met you,

976
01:18:35,488 --> 01:18:37,393
I wanted to take the
drink you offered me...

977
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:39,963
to stay with you there.

978
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:47,372
If I had done that,

979
01:18:48,497 --> 01:18:50,513
I would have become your 85th passerby,

980
01:18:52,068 --> 01:18:54,383
and I may have drawn a portrait of you.

981
01:19:10,988 --> 01:19:13,503
I had this thought as I hung
a picture we took together.

982
01:19:16,558 --> 01:19:20,603
That I will be your last
manager, the 99th one.

983
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,442
I won't...

984
01:19:24,797 --> 01:19:27,912
let you spend meaningless
time with the 100th one.

985
01:19:41,218 --> 01:19:42,322
So...

986
01:19:45,558 --> 01:19:46,832
don't drink that.

987
01:19:57,667 --> 01:20:00,043
I knew you would say that.

988
01:21:14,377 --> 01:21:15,952
Thank you, Chan Seong.

989
01:21:31,028 --> 01:21:32,133
I love you.

990
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:46,423
I love you.
