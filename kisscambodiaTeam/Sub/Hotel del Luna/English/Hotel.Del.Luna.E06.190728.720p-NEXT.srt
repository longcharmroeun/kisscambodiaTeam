00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,568
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:36,188 --> 00:00:37,587
Ku Chan Seong.

3
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,358
When you see me off,

4
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,098
don't feel lonely.

5
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:47,028
Keep on taking good care of me,

6
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:50,498
then try to see me off.

7
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,138
That's what Ma Go wants.

8
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,248
What are you doing?

9
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:02,348
What?

10
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,447
Do you want me to go right now?

11
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,027
Don't be in a rush. Now
isn't the right time.

12
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:19,898
Do you really think I'll leave that easily?

13
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:24,507
I'll make you feel miserable
and get sick and tired of me.

14
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,438
When I leave,

15
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:29,938
you'll probably put on a big smile
and feel extremely relieved.

16
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,567
Sir.

17
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:29,437
You shouldn't be here.

18
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:33,907
Sir.

19
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:36,436
I know you can see me.
You can hear me, right?

20
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:38,277
My gosh, seriously!

21
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,247
Please don't spit on me.

22
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:44,847
Stop it.

23
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:46,847
How drunk is he?

24
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,486
I don't think he's drunk.
I think he's just crazy.

25
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:50,516
Sir!

26
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:53,186
- My goodness.
- There are so many weird people.

27
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:56,198
Calm down and follow me.

28
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:58,766
- My gosh.
- Poor thing.

29
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:01,398
Hey, be quiet. Let's not provoke him.

30
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,407
I bought you beer like I promised.

31
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:11,108
Thank you.

32
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,578
Go to the hotel I told you about
once you're done with the beer.

33
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:17,617
You'll be able to find it
if you follow the moon.

34
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:19,548
Okay.

35
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:24,157
- I can't believe this.
- This is so cool.

36
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:27,488
- My gosh, look at him.
- Kim Joon Hyun?

37
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,698
It's a sausage.

38
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:34,837
Welcome.

39
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,037
That's 2 dollars and 80 cents.

40
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:40,977
- It's really him.
- He's really fat.

41
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:43,238
I'm a fan of yours. Are you
shooting something nearby?

42
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:45,948
I really like it when you take
those huge bites on your show.

43
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:48,377
- I can't believe it's him.
- Gosh, look.

44
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,516
- He's coming.
- He's coming.

45
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,486
- Hello.
- Hi.

46
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,388
- I'm a huge fan.
- Thank you.

47
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:56,958
Can I please get an autograph?

48
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:00,557
- Why are you going after him?
- This is so cool.

49
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,668
I can't believe he's even
popular among ghosts.

50
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:10,467
This place came out in "The
Guys Who Died After Eating".

51
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,107
Kim Joon Hyun can eat...

52
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:14,978
5 sticky rice cakes in 1 just bite.

53
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:18,308
He's really one of a kind.

54
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,287
Ms. Jang likes him too.

55
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,256
- I got the leg.
- You need to put that in.

56
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:32,888
- Yes.
- My goodness.

57
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,157
You're only going to have
the webfoot octopus?

58
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:36,258
Yes.

59
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,868
Ms. Fourth Choice came by
today, and she's very clever.

60
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,768
She volunteered to intern here.

61
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,097
You should let her do that.

62
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:46,667
Let her do what she wants.

63
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:50,438
Then I'll put Hyun Joong
in charge of training her.

64
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:53,078
I'll make sure he teaches her well
so she can take over right away...

65
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:54,676
as soon as Mr. Ku quits.

66
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,917
Did Chan Seong leave?

67
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:59,486
Yes, he took the afternoon off today...

68
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,357
and went home early.

69
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:03,688
One bite!

70
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:08,398
(Joon Hyun attempts to eat
everything in one bite.)

71
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,227
Do you want to eat that?

72
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:16,568
Should I have the intern go buy some?

73
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,808
Forget it.

74
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:22,107
I don't really crave anything today.

75
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:35,717
Did you...

76
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:38,188
find this?

77
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:43,328
No.

78
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:46,868
I thought I lost it.

79
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,938
Is finding it worth another leaf?

80
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,537
If I want to show him this,

81
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:00,477
I should start craving the webfoot octopus.

82
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,398
Hello? Hey, Man Weol.

83
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,828
Chan Seong? He's not home yet.

84
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,998
He's not answering his phone.

85
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:23,167
Once he comes home, tell him to wait
since I'll be picking him up...

86
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:24,808
in my brown car.

87
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:27,777
Man Weol, Chan Seong might
come home late tonight.

88
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:29,136
What? Why?

89
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,977
His girlfriend came by today.

90
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,176
What did you just say?

91
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:39,487
She's the girl he used to date
back when he was in the States.

92
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,688
She came to my house to meet Chan Seong.

93
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:43,487
But they must be meeting outside.

94
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:45,828
My gosh, you startled me.

95
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:47,828
I didn't know you were here already.

96
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:53,297
Chan Seong has a girlfriend?

97
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:57,268
Who is she? Is she pretty?

98
00:06:58,268 --> 00:06:59,938
- Well...
- Forget it. Stop talking.

99
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,578
Why would you tell me about her?
I never said I was curious.

100
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,808
I'm not interested.

101
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:09,547
- See you.
- But I haven't said anything yet.

102
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:12,148
If you want to tell me so badly, go ahead.
I'll hear you out.

103
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:16,318
Is she pretty?

104
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:20,888
I just asked if she's pretty.

105
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:25,797
Yes, she's pretty. She's pretty.

106
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,037
Sanchez.

107
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:35,977
You really are slow-witted.

108
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,878
You know nothing, do you?

109
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,047
You're so stupid.

110
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:45,787
Is she...

111
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:48,157
that pretty?

112
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,857
Yes, she's really pretty. She's smart too.

113
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,527
And she and Chan Seong make a great couple.

114
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,826
I have a photo. Do you want to see it?

115
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,167
I'll go find it. Wait here.

116
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:07,907
If she really turns out to be pretty,

117
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,648
you'll be dead, Sanchez.

118
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:20,618
Man Weol, look.

119
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:24,688
Man Weol? Did she leave?

120
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,657
I wonder if Chan Seong's
late because he met Mi Ra.

121
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:43,677
Their connection has lasted
for a very long time.

122
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:54,557
I hope he takes good care of her...

123
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:59,027
so that she doesn't end
up getting hurt again.

124
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,437
- Unbelievable.
- This is incredible.

125
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,238
When is Kim Joon Hyun coming?

126
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,608
My gosh, this is cool.

127
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:20,777
Excuse me.

128
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,377
Are they shooting "The Guys
Who Died After Eating"?

129
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:27,317
Yes, are you also here to get
Kim Joon Hyun's autograph?

130
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:30,557
A person I know is a fan of his.

131
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,086
- His girlfriend is a fan of his.
- My mom is a huge fan.

132
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,327
My dad is a fan.

133
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,868
My boss is a fan. She likes him a lot.

134
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,497
Hey, you guys.

135
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,137
He's over there in his van.
People are getting his autograph.

136
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,498
- Let's go.
- Come on.

137
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:46,108
Sir, you should come.

138
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:06,657
Maybe I should've gotten his autograph.

139
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:08,797
She would've liked it.

140
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,768
Ms. Jang?

141
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:23,177
What are you doing here? Did
you know that I was here?

142
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:25,848
I heard.

143
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:27,877
Did you meet?

144
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,118
Well, yes. Kind of.

145
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,118
You must've been so happy.

146
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:34,758
So how was it?

147
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,586
A lot leaner than I thought.

148
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,957
With a small face and great skin.

149
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:40,627
Why don't you go see for yourself?

150
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:42,696
I'm sure he's still there. If
you rush, you can see him.

151
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:44,598
Forget it. Why would I?

152
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:47,167
I came out to eat webfoot octopus.

153
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:48,838
Webfoot octopus?

154
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:53,106
You want to eat webfoot octopus
dressed like that at this late hour?

155
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:56,677
That's right. Webfoot octopus.
That's the only reason I'm here.

156
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:02,248
That's the earring I found.

157
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:04,947
Oh, yes.

158
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:08,118
I bought these to wear them when I'm
going out to eat webfoot octopus.

159
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:10,657
I'm headed to eat webfoot octopus
since I found these earrings.

160
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:12,588
You must come with me because you found it.

161
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:15,056
You're just craving webfoot octopus.

162
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,696
Stop coming up with these
excuses that make no sense.

163
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:19,868
Why? Are you sick and tired of me?

164
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:21,537
You can't stand me anymore?

165
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:28,037
If you want to eat webfoot octopus now,

166
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,407
we should go to Noryangjin.

167
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:32,907
Actually, no. The west coast
is famous for webfoot octopus.

168
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:34,478
Do you want to go to the sea?

169
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:38,648
Well, okay.

170
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:41,988
I guess we can see the
sunrise on the way too.

171
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,057
Although I'm not sure if we
can see it on the west coast.

172
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:46,327
Let's go.

173
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:50,027
Sure.

174
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:52,768
We'll take that tacky brown
car, which you love.

175
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,138
Let's go have some webfoot
octopus, Chan Seong.

176
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:58,067
Yes, let's go.

177
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:01,677
By the way, are you sure you
don't want to see Kim Joon Hyun?

178
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:03,608
Kim Joon Hyun?

179
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,207
How can I see him?

180
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:08,447
Didn't you come here to see him?

181
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,348
He's filming something over there.

182
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,248
Darn it. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

183
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:17,057
Oh, she can run.

184
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,287
Ms. Jang!

185
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:34,067
That's how much hangover soup he ate today.

186
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:37,577
I heard he was chosen again today
in that segment, One Bite.

187
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:41,307
I can't believe I missed it.

188
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:45,748
That's where he sat,

189
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,456
so just be satisfied with
having the hangover soup there.

190
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:49,657
Eat before it gets cold.

191
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,457
Then why don't you show me how
much you can eat in one bite?

192
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:54,926
With some radish kimchi. Slurp it all in.

193
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:56,827
Don't overestimate me, please.

194
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:59,167
I'll enjoy this, in many bites.

195
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:05,667
This restaurant will do very
well now that Kim Joon Hyun...

196
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:06,968
has dined here.

197
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:12,148
This restaurant would've done
fine even without Kim Joon Hyun.

198
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:14,348
Because of her.

199
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,317
What about that baby?

200
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,557
She brings a lot of luck to this place.

201
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,018
She was born with a
tremendous amount of luck...

202
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:26,157
because of all the good karma
she built up in her past lives.

203
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,927
Any family with such a child
becomes successful in no time.

204
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:31,598
You can be born with a lot of
luck when you do many good deeds.

205
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:35,167
Then in the opposite case...

206
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:38,067
You're either born dirt
poor or as a dog or a pig.

207
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,207
Then if you're reincarnated...

208
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,907
What? You just thought...

209
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:51,047
I'd totally be reincarnated as
a dog or a pig, didn't you?

210
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:53,287
I mean, I'm not sure. But
I am worried indeed...

211
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:54,547
because it's highly likely.

212
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:57,387
I've already paid for all my
sins by running the hotel...

213
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:58,627
for over a millennium.

214
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,426
But it's not like you treated
all the customers that well.

215
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:03,358
How could I have treated them better?

216
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,596
You ignored some of them,
saying they're nuisances.

217
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,667
And you took money from the
rich ones to buy booze...

218
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:09,898
and cars for yourself.

219
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:11,836
I'm really worried about you.

220
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,767
It's none of your concern.

221
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,877
It is. I should be concerned.

222
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:17,777
I don't want you to be
born as a dog or a pig.

223
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,947
Gosh, it is none of your business!

224
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,848
Imagine you being reincarnated as a pig.

225
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,748
I don't want to meet you
again as hangover soup.

226
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:25,388
Be nice.

227
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:27,618
I don't want this anymore.

228
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:29,388
I lost my appetite because of you.

229
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:34,758
I saw a ghost wandering
around the area earlier.

230
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,257
I told him to go to the hotel,

231
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,596
but you should take him
since you're here anyway.

232
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:39,697
Be nice to him.

233
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,968
Chan Seong.

234
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:47,066
Don't strike up conversations with
ghosts you don't even know...

235
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,836
or go up to them. You really shouldn't.

236
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,648
They could be evil spirits.

237
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:53,907
It's dangerous.

238
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,848
Does wandering the living realm for
a long time make them evil spirits?

239
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:03,388
Any wandering spirit turns
evil whenever it harms humans.

240
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,056
And such a ghost can
devour all other spirits,

241
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,957
let alone humans.

242
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,457
If it's caught by the Grim Reaper,

243
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:14,128
it certainly won't be
reincarnated as a lucky child...

244
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,738
or even as an animal. Its soul
will be perished on the spot.

245
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:28,848
Why didn't you report to me about
this room's guest leaving the hotel?

246
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:32,088
It was due to a mistake of our
general manager, who's human.

247
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:34,718
What can we do? She left the hotel.

248
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:40,728
Her soul is filled with hatred
and resentment toward humans.

249
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:44,127
If she causes any trouble
in the outside world,

250
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:45,868
I will hold the hotel accountable.

251
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:53,207
What a headache.

252
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,677
The Grim Reaper will manage to
catch her and bring her back.

253
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:57,676
If she causes trouble
before she's caught...

254
00:15:57,677 --> 00:15:59,508
and turns into an evil
spirit, we'll be doomed.

255
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:02,817
She's a dangerous one, but
I feel so bad for her.

256
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:07,417
I hope she returns safely.

257
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,927
(Hot new releases. Enjoy.)

258
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,537
Shall I take a quick break?

259
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:27,737
(Real hot stuff)

260
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:28,838
What's this?

261
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:40,817
She's taking her clothes off.

262
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,657
Turn around. Let me see your face.

263
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:00,707
Are you enjoying this?

264
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:07,608
You like this?

265
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:10,517
I'm hot, aren't I?

266
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:21,646
(Are you going to pick me up again today?)

267
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,116
(When will you be here?)

268
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:27,288
(I can skip the afternoon classes.)

269
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:30,298
How dare a ghost ignore my messages?

270
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:34,598
I'm telling you. Yu Na is possessed.

271
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,338
I got goosebumps all over that day.

272
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:39,166
How about I try throwing this at her?

273
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:40,937
- Good idea.
- Yes, try it.

274
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:42,007
Let's see if she can avoid it again.

275
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:43,808
- All right, here I go.
- Do it.

276
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,007
Just a second.

277
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,416
- Did you get a text?
- No, it's not me.

278
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,048
- It's not me either.
- Same here.

279
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,517
I didn't get anything either.

280
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,017
- What is this, then?
- What's going on?

281
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,427
Other girls hate her so much.

282
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:10,667
(I'm here. Behind you.)

283
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:28,348
I got Ms. Jang's permission
that you can come to the hotel.

284
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,888
All right. Let's go there now, then.

285
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,187
Now? But what about your classes?

286
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:36,128
Didn't you see earlier? I'm
struggling to fit in anyway.

287
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,098
I have no problem quitting school.

288
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:42,497
It's because of the friends
that bully you, right?

289
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,368
They're quite annoying, but it's fine.

290
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,237
The real Kim Yu Na was a bad girl.

291
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,308
I'm actually enjoying seeing
how much this girl...

292
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,048
is hated by others.

293
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,217
It's just that school is boring.

294
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,187
Why do you think school is boring?

295
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:06,588
I had so much fun back
when I was in school.

296
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,098
I studied and played sports.

297
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:11,866
I always came home so late from school...

298
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,598
that our chief servant
had to come to get me.

299
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:16,767
"Chief servant"?

300
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,667
Yes, he lived in our servants' quarters.

301
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,437
He was in a relationship with
Un Nyeon, my sister's nanny.

302
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:25,038
But he always fought with my dad's driver.

303
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,308
They were in a love triangle.

304
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:34,487
A chief servant, a nanny, and a driver too?

305
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:36,957
I guess you were a son of a
nobleman before you died.

306
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,157
You were born with a golden
spoon in your mouth.

307
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,657
No, it was a silver spoon.

308
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,167
All of the spoons at my house were silver.

309
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:50,896
You were born into a rich family
with a silver spoon in your mouth,

310
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:53,138
but you must have been disappointed
to have lived a short life.

311
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,977
Yes. I am so disappointed that
I can't seem to let it go.

312
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,217
I can't even go to school
even if I wanted to,

313
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:06,917
so try to have a better time at school.

314
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,088
Schools these days have
gotten so much better.

315
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:16,898
You guys wear nice school uniforms.

316
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:19,467
And you have a great piano like this one.

317
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:25,608
This piano is better than
the one at my house.

318
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,007
Well,

319
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,937
it sounds like you learned
how to play the piano too.

320
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,548
Play it.

321
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:41,348
I don't know how to play it, but
I'll listen to it if you play.

322
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:42,917
I've probably forgotten everything.

323
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,257
Come on, rich guy. Play the piano.

324
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,628
Whom are you talking to now?

325
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,167
What are you talking about?
I was playing the piano.

326
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:02,477
Sure. Play it then.

327
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,777
Go ahead, Yu Na. You're
good at playing the piano.

328
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:07,148
Play the piano.

329
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:24,528
- See?
- I was right.

330
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,667
Hey, she can really play.

331
00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:22,687
You're pretty good, rich boy.

332
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:24,818
See? You didn't forget it.

333
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:28,957
I guess not.

334
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:31,328
I can't seem to forget this.

335
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:37,167
Hyun Joong!

336
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:50,416
Will you ride the bicycle with me...

337
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,878
even when you grow up later, Hyun Mi?

338
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:53,417
Yes!

339
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,457
You have to ride it with me.
You made a promise to me.

340
00:23:57,057 --> 00:23:58,788
Young Master! Over here!

341
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:00,388
Young Lady!

342
00:24:49,607 --> 00:24:51,136
Don't you think it's appropriate...

343
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:53,507
for me to train Ms. Fourth
Choice instead of Hyun Joong?

344
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:54,646
I'm older than him.

345
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,717
I'm sure she'll see more eye to eye
with Hyun Joong who had been...

346
00:24:57,718 --> 00:25:00,047
educated in the modern times
instead of a scholar...

347
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:01,816
who talks about Confucius and Mencius.

348
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:04,616
However, Hyun Joong is leaning
toward Mr. Third Choice.

349
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:07,558
Emotionally, he's bonding more with Mr. Ku.

350
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,628
But he must accomplish his
goal in this world too.

351
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:13,697
He knows that the hotel might disappear,

352
00:25:14,268 --> 00:25:16,297
so I doubt that he will side with Mr. Ku.

353
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:20,068
Right. He has to stay at
the hotel until that day.

354
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,177
I'm glad that...

355
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:24,737
there aren't more changes
after the leaves grew out.

356
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,388
What's going on?

357
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,616
Ms. Jang must be angry.

358
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:38,656
But she's with Mr. Ku now.

359
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:41,288
I guess Mr. Third Choice must
have gotten her riled up.

360
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:45,257
I hope she burns with rage so the
leaves fall off the branches.

361
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,638
We must sell off the cars you don't need.

362
00:25:56,738 --> 00:25:59,106
I need every single car here.

363
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:03,616
You said you didn't drive 7 of
these 14 cars once last year.

364
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:05,917
They are decorating my parking lot.

365
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:07,618
Look.

366
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,916
I've put these beautiful
cars in the same color.

367
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,987
And these cars are working hard to
make my parking lot look pretty.

368
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,527
This is a huge space.

369
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:18,098
Imagine there are only three
cars in this big space.

370
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:20,866
That will look so empty.

371
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,737
Exactly, my point. There's
only one passenger.

372
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:26,038
It makes no sense to have such
a huge parking lot like this.

373
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,806
Narrow down to three cars
and park near the storage.

374
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:33,177
And we can utilize this
space for our customers.

375
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:37,148
What's your problem?

376
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:39,618
Why do you want me to sell off my cars?

377
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:42,858
Because your finances are in the toilet.

378
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,927
If you keep it up, you'll go bankrupt.

379
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:53,868
(General Manager Ku Chan Seong)

380
00:26:58,337 --> 00:26:59,767
It will be difficult to pay off...

381
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:02,068
your next month's card bills
with the balance we have now.

382
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,336
The painting of Mount Baekdu.

383
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:05,547
No one is buying. It's not
as wanted as I had expected.

384
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:07,146
The gold bars from Kim Yu Na.

385
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:09,447
You bought a car with that. The car.

386
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,848
Right. What about the black card?

387
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,116
I sent it back.

388
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:17,487
You have to pay for the things
you bought for the wedding.

389
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:20,987
Have you gone mad? Why
would you send that back?

390
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:23,628
I cannot have you reincarnated
as a dog or a pig.

391
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:28,528
I won't help you extort
money from people anymore.

392
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:31,568
Live an honest life and save money.

393
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:36,177
Hey, Ku Chan Seong.

394
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:38,838
You have nothing to lose.

395
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,507
So what if I get reincarnated
as a dog or a pig?

396
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:42,878
I'm fine even if I get
reincarnated as a chicken.

397
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:45,416
Even if I meet you again as
a bowl of chicken noodles,

398
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:48,957
I can say, "Hello, I'm tastier when
you eat me with fresh kimchi."

399
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,316
I'll say hello to you like this. I mean it.

400
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:53,856
If you don't sell off your
cars and settle your bills,

401
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:57,098
you won't have a penny to buy
chicken noodles next month.

402
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,507
Will I be poor again?

403
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:09,278
Oh, no. I hate being impoverished.

404
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:13,177
Ku Chan Seong, you're lying, right?

405
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:15,477
You're just trying to scare me, right?

406
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:18,947
Ms. Jang wasn't always well-off.

407
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:23,088
When I came to the hotel,
things were rough.

408
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,457
Back then, things were really tough.

409
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,957
As things were hectic, we didn't
have a human to be our manager.

410
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,257
Ms. Jang went through a lot.

411
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,707
I would love to have a bowl of
makgeolli and radish water kimchi.

412
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:46,747
When the US Army truck passes by later,

413
00:28:46,748 --> 00:28:48,548
I'll try to get some food.

414
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:53,148
The new recruit can speak English
since he was educated recently.

415
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:57,457
Give me the chocolate.

416
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,157
Thank you very much.

417
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:04,457
You're pretty good. I'll keep you on.

418
00:29:05,198 --> 00:29:06,727
Thank you very much.

419
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:21,278
I hate being poor.

420
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:25,217
I will keep on eating caviar
and drinking champagne.

421
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:30,816
When she didn't have enough money,

422
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:33,088
she managed to get by with
kimchi and makgeolli.

423
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,427
She can save up more money.

424
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:39,398
Then, Ms. Jang will hate you.

425
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,298
What if you get kicked out...

426
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:44,967
You're doing a great job.
You're truly loyal to her.

427
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:48,467
I can take care of her current finances.

428
00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:51,037
But can the hotel be in
a financial problem?

429
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,047
When there was a war,

430
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:55,146
there were more people
who died than survived.

431
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:57,848
And those people must have had
unfinished business here.

432
00:29:57,948 --> 00:30:00,646
When that happens, the door
to the afterlife opens wide,

433
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:03,088
so not that many people stay at our hotel.

434
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,457
We managed to get past a
difficult era together.

435
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:09,628
You did very well too, Mr. Kim.

436
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,828
You were the one who had
the most difficult time.

437
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:15,866
Let's not be picky with our customers...

438
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:17,997
and protect our hotel the best we can...

439
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:20,106
until the day we achieve our goals.

440
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,267
Here.

441
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,076
1, 2, 3.

442
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:25,407
We can do it.

443
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:52,467
Your Majesty.

444
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,507
We're well into the night.

445
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:32,477
Who's there?

446
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:34,548
Stand back...

447
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:37,247
Cut!

448
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:46,028
Mr. Yu, shouldn't the
king sound more solemn?

449
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,457
- I'm sorry.
- We'll take a short break.

450
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:53,267
A king needs to sound
formidable, so work on it.

451
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:55,997
Yes, ma'am. Formidable, right.

452
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:57,967
My gosh!

453
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:09,848
How dare you. How dare...

454
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:14,717
Who's there?

455
00:32:22,228 --> 00:32:23,798
What a relief.

456
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:25,967
Who's there?

457
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,267
How dare you.

458
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:38,306
Who are you?

459
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:40,407
Such insolence! Make way!

460
00:32:41,508 --> 00:32:43,447
Yu Oh!

461
00:32:44,518 --> 00:32:45,848
- My gosh.
- Mr. Yu?

462
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:49,457
- Yu Oh!
- Wake up.

463
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,416
- Please wake up.
- Can You hear us?

464
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:52,656
- Do something.
- Wake up!

465
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:54,687
- What's wrong with him?
- Goodness.

466
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,497
Yu Oh, wake up.

467
00:32:56,498 --> 00:33:00,898
Why isn't there anyone who can hear me?

468
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,138
Yu Oh, come back to us.

469
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:30,227
Welcome!

470
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:39,838
Your Majesty?

471
00:33:42,307 --> 00:33:43,538
How dare you!

472
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:55,148
Ms. Choi, something is going on?

473
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:59,358
A VVIP has come to our hotel.

474
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:05,997
"A VVIP"?

475
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:09,227
A king has made his way here.

476
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,797
I was never able to see one while I lived,

477
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:13,238
but now I get the chance.

478
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:16,178
A big score has entered the hotel.
Gather everyone.

479
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:19,036
We'll provide the VVIP
with the best service...

480
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:21,077
and have him thoroughly satisfied.

481
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:38,028
Your Majesty!

482
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:45,068
It's an honor to accommodate
someone of your status.

483
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:48,068
I am the owner of this hotel,

484
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:51,577
Jang Man Weol.

485
00:34:56,218 --> 00:34:57,378
A king?

486
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:01,017
Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se.

487
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:03,717
Which King could he be?

488
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:07,687
You must be exhausted as is. Allow
me to escort you to your room.

489
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:50,238
Your Majesty, we have
brought you your meal.

490
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:07,347
This...

491
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,218
It's a portable toilet.

492
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:11,316
I know he doesn't need it,

493
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:13,327
but I thought it'll bring him some comfort.

494
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:16,297
That is very considerate of you.

495
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:19,497
Now that I've served the king,
I wouldn't even mind dying...

496
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:23,137
Well, I'm already dead, but
that's just how delighted I am.

497
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:28,908
Your Majesty...

498
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:33,146
I don't want our energy disrupted here,

499
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:34,508
so don't allow any more new guests.

500
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:36,648
They can come back after he leaves.

501
00:36:36,948 --> 00:36:38,048
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:44,488
Ms. Jang.

503
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:47,727
You shouldn't discriminate
against guests like this.

504
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,187
Well, I can.

505
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:52,358
I'm busy here, so go home if
you're only going to nag me.

506
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:55,727
He's dressed like a king of Joseon.
Which one is he?

507
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:57,798
Some were tyrants, you know.

508
00:36:59,868 --> 00:37:02,537
Nonsense! He didn't seem evil.

509
00:37:03,078 --> 00:37:06,307
Then did he seem generous and wise?

510
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:08,878
Well...

511
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:12,948
Why are you complaining again?
What's wrong this time?

512
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,787
You must be clueless.

513
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:18,517
It's understandable considering
it's your first time serving one.

514
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,327
Have you served one while
working in a hotel then?

515
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:25,028
Of course.

516
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:28,198
I've served a few members
of Dubai's royal family.

517
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:30,896
So?

518
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:33,137
Are you seriously bragging about it?

519
00:37:33,437 --> 00:37:35,167
- That's not it...
- Enough.

520
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:37,577
Then you don't know jack.

521
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:38,707
Dismissed!

522
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:43,378
Chan Seong, the painting of Mount Baekdu...

523
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:46,287
Try selling it at half price.

524
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,588
Don't come to work until you do.

525
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:56,557
They're just too excited
because of the king.

526
00:37:58,198 --> 00:37:59,427
His Majesty's presence...

527
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:01,467
will make the flowers bloom in the garden.

528
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,597
Making sure he rests well before
leaving for the afterlife...

529
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:04,867
is most important.

530
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:06,307
Ma'am!

531
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:08,838
I had him sign the hotel register.

532
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:10,936
(Hotel Register)

533
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:14,077
So his name is Lee Hyun.

534
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:16,678
"Lee Hyun"?

535
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:19,617
Which King had Lee Hyun for a name?

536
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,687
It sounds somewhat familiar.

537
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,517
Let me see.

538
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:26,927
Han Seok Kyu played Lee Do,
Lee Seo Jin played Lee San,

539
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:29,797
- and Kim Soo Hyun played Lee Hwon.
- That character doesn't count.

540
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:33,167
It was a character made-up
for that particular series.

541
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:36,867
Right, a crossover period drama.
I'm aware of that.

542
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:40,068
So who's Lee Hyun? Did you look it up?

543
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:41,738
I found him.

544
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:45,037
Right? I knew he existed.

545
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:48,247
He's a character from a TV series.

546
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,148
Let me see that.

547
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:56,218
"The Crowned Queen"?

548
00:38:58,857 --> 00:39:00,327
Oh, that's right.

549
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:02,758
The king from this series
goes by the name Lee Hyun.

550
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:05,128
He is a king!

551
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:10,167
Lee Hyun is just like
Lee Hwon from earlier.

552
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:13,968
He's a TV character from a
crossover period drama.

553
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:16,977
What?

554
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,610
"The Crowned Queen"...

555
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:26,380
is about a queen...

556
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:28,641
who hires a gisaeng that looks similar...

557
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,811
to take her place in the
palace in order to stay safe.

558
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:35,250
Lee Hyun is the name of the king...

559
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:36,590
who is also the husband.

560
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,420
Then who is that king that just came in?

561
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,121
Why does he say he is Lee Hyun?

562
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:43,360
The guest who came to the hotel...

563
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,791
is the actor Bang Tae Woo.

564
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:49,601
The actor Bang Tae Woo...

565
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:52,469
mostly played minor roles
and supporting roles.

566
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,469
The first leading role he had
was the role of King Lee Hyun.

567
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,440
However, sadly, before
filming even started,

568
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,840
he had a cardiac arrest while working out.

569
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,981
He died suddenly.

570
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:07,950
You mean he is not a king.

571
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:11,990
He was putting his soul into
acting to take the role of a king.

572
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,420
He was an actor.

573
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:15,090
The way he talked and walked...

574
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:17,791
was perfectly like a king.

575
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:20,360
He died while he was so
immersed in the role.

576
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:24,431
I believe he thinks he is a real king.

577
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:33,840
This is so embarrassing.

578
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,081
After we serve him breakfast,
send him off in the bus...

579
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,751
first thing in the morning.

580
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,601
I heard he was not a king.

581
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,409
You should have recognized it right away...

582
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,041
when I voiced my suspicions.

583
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,141
Good for you.

584
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,679
I didn't send back the guests...

585
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,240
who had come, just in case.

586
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,380
I acted in a wise way.

587
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,981
I said, good for you!

588
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,420
When I saw him, there was
a small scar on his face.

589
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:17,920
You didn't see it, right?

590
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,960
It is impossible for a king
to have a scar on his face...

591
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:22,661
in Joseon Dynasty.

592
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:24,090
You know Queen Yoon who
got kicked out, right?

593
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,231
You should know since you love dramas.

594
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,429
I know her. She was Prince Gwanghae's mom.

595
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,601
It was Prince Yeonsan.

596
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,029
You should have checked which king he was.

597
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,840
I thought you felt the energy of ghosts.

598
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:36,400
But you were fooled by an actor.

599
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,880
It looked so real.

600
00:41:41,341 --> 00:41:43,311
What do you know about acting
that is filled with spirit?

601
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,580
To put it bluntly, he must have...

602
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:47,080
wanted that role so much.

603
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:49,121
That's why he thinks he is a
king even after he is dead.

604
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,750
Why do you look down on a ghost
giving such a performance?

605
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,791
How dare you look down on that?
Who do you think you are?

606
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,420
I am...

607
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:58,560
just saying I recognized
that he wasn't a king.

608
00:41:58,561 --> 00:42:02,431
If a guest says he is a king, a
hotelier should treat him as such.

609
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:04,400
Whether he is Mansour
or a king from a drama.

610
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:06,501
The guests in our hotel are all kings!

611
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,110
When did she ever treat
our guests like kings?

612
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,860
(Yu Oh is such a terrible actor.
I'm sick of Yu's terrible acting.)

613
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:29,690
A popular star who can't act
has replaced the dead actor.

614
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:30,961
He is being criticized so much.

615
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:35,860
If it was him,

616
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:38,970
he would have shown great acting.

617
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:48,681
If an actor performs as
if he's possessed...

618
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,081
Would that be possible?

619
00:42:57,751 --> 00:43:00,391
I repented a lot after talking to you.

620
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,360
When you said guests were our kings,

621
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,661
I was also moved.

622
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,199
If you know that, you should
work better in the future.

623
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,601
So I have been thinking.

624
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,029
If the guest wants to act,

625
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,700
we have to help him realize his wishes.

626
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,211
Us hoteliers...

627
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,780
will help our guests to become
kings if that is what they want.

628
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:23,141
Whether that is Mansour...

629
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,610
of a king from a drama.

630
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,061
One more time.

631
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,200
We need to upload it online.

632
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,561
Show how tasty it is.

633
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:44,470
Okay. 1, 2, 3.

634
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:49,569
Sanchez's shop was asked
by Yu Oh's fan club...

635
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,311
to send a pizza truck to the filming set.

636
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:54,380
So we were able to get into the set easily.

637
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:58,980
What's the use of giving
a possessed performance.

638
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:00,820
It's not like that his
face will be on screen.

639
00:44:00,981 --> 00:44:03,521
I should have acted as if I was
possessed after eating this...

640
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:05,751
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's delicious.

641
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:08,119
Ask him to look around the set...

642
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,431
then offer some pizza to
the staff, and leave.

643
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,331
Ms. Jang.

644
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:14,601
It's what the guest wants.

645
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,331
He is looking so forward to it.

646
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:18,900
- Hoteliers should...
- Forget it.

647
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:20,030
I get it.

648
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,170
Look after the pizza truck.

649
00:44:23,171 --> 00:44:24,771
I'll go get the shooting schedule.

650
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,041
(Food Truck Staff "The Crowned Queen")

651
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,981
Excuse me. Food Truck lady?

652
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:37,549
Please take five pizzas
to our costumes staff.

653
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,691
Thank you.

654
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,021
Stop there.

655
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,061
Hey.

656
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,161
This is not a delivery truck.

657
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,101
If they want to eat, they should
come and get it themselves.

658
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:53,771
Okay.

659
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:58,470
How impertinent.

660
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,181
(Enjoy the pizza and act
as if you're possessed.)

661
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:05,311
If he could only act...

662
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:11,550
Sir, it's me Yu Oh.

663
00:45:12,651 --> 00:45:15,391
Did you talk to the writer about
me not filming those scenes?

664
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:18,530
I am skipping the last two weeks, right?

665
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,360
I don't care whether the
drama fails or not.

666
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:25,330
Just tell them my injury is serious.

667
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:26,530
It's so uncomfortable.

668
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:31,270
How can the woman become a
queen when there is no king?

669
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,371
The acting fees?

670
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:34,810
I don't need the couple of
hundred thousand dollars.

671
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:36,311
I just want out.

672
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,110
Couple of hundred thousand dollars?

673
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:40,380
I don't care if I die, or if I'm killed.

674
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,320
Just tell them Yu Oh is dead.

675
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,220
Wait a minute.

676
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,231
Even if his face is not seen,

677
00:45:51,731 --> 00:45:54,030
he can get his acting fees.

678
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,771
The king doesn't appear
as much as I thought.

679
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,009
He only has one scene. Let's help him.

680
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,610
With this one scene,

681
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:13,751
he will have to show how he
can act as if he's possessed.

682
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:21,661
How did scene 17 end?

683
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:29,231
- Then we can go from here.
- Hurry up.

684
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:30,900
We're starting.

685
00:46:32,721 --> 00:46:36,720
"My queen, you are the
only one I loved." What?

686
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:40,060
I'm really bad.

687
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:42,031
What am I going to do?

688
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:44,500
"You are the only one."

689
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:49,131
The Queen?

690
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:51,241
I must ask her to help me.

691
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,611
Hello, Queen.

692
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,281
Queen, can you do this with me?

693
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,481
Ms. Queen.

694
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,491
Queen.

695
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,961
Can you go over the script with me?

696
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,830
Director gets so annoyed with me.
Please help me.

697
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:35,610
Scene 42 is an emotional scene.

698
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:36,810
Oh my goodness.

699
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,390
Who are you?

700
00:47:42,051 --> 00:47:45,321
Look at me straight, your majesty.

701
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:50,560
Your Majesty.

702
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,461
Your Majesty?

703
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:28,801
What is it, my queen?

704
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:35,410
You are the king of all
the people of this land.

705
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,180
I am.

706
00:48:37,611 --> 00:48:40,711
I am Lee Hyun, the king of this land.

707
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:55,830
Your Majesty.

708
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:59,060
I am a fake.

709
00:49:00,031 --> 00:49:01,631
I am not the queen.

710
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,341
Is that why you wanted to leave my side?

711
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,341
If I stay with you,

712
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,941
you will be in danger.

713
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,341
If you hide in the mountains,

714
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,950
I will cut down all the trees to find you.

715
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:16,750
If you go to the seas,

716
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,651
I will dry up the sea and stop you.

717
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:22,151
Your Majesty.

718
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,091
This is the order from
the king of this land.

719
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:31,361
Don't leave me alone.

720
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,580
Cut! Okay!

721
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,011
Gosh, that was great!

722
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,310
You were amazing.

723
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,619
My Queen.

724
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,651
That was incredible!

725
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,731
Nice job!

726
00:50:03,591 --> 00:50:04,861
You did great!

727
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,171
- This is great, isn't it?
- You did an amazing job!

728
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:10,301
- What just happened?
- What?

729
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:13,100
Are we done?

730
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,841
Great job!

731
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:26,321
You were amazing, Your Majesty.

732
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,430
His Majesty arrives!

733
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,790
Do not...

734
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,961
talk to me about dethroning the Queen.

735
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:09,260
Your Majesty, Her Majesty
is a woman of lowly status.

736
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:13,700
She cannot maintain the
dignity of the royal family.

737
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:16,901
Please consider her
dethronement, Your Majesty!

738
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,270
How dare you?

739
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:25,910
Our guest agreed to help him
act until the drama ends?

740
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:31,120
Let's see.

741
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:34,421
Yes, apparently so.

742
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,921
Why? I thought she wanted to send him away.

743
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,289
His face might not appear
on TV even if he acts,

744
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,890
but she'll gain something else.

745
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:48,830
My gosh, this is unbelievable.

746
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,599
After I went over my lines with you,

747
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,370
I suddenly acted like I was possessed.

748
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,071
You know what I mean, right?

749
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:58,680
I felt like I was possessed
by someone else when I acted.

750
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,610
By any chance, are you an acting teacher?

751
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:02,881
Do you want...

752
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:04,950
to keep this up?

753
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:07,490
Of course. Please do me a favor...

754
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,321
and continue to help me out.

755
00:52:09,491 --> 00:52:10,591
Then...

756
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,620
let's start negotiating your pay.

757
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:15,531
My pay?

758
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:18,430
Oh, sure. I guess you already know.

759
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:20,030
You can take everything.

760
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:22,099
How much do you get paid for each episode?

761
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,269
I get paid 120,000 dollars per episode.

762
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,899
I was supposed to be absent for
two weeks, but not anymore.

763
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,310
So 4 times 120,000 dollars
is 480,000 dollars in total.

764
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:29,640
I guess that will be
enough to rent a house.

765
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,180
Go ahead and take everything.
It's fine with me.

766
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:36,209
Our guest is actually
working for that money,

767
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,151
and he also agreed with this.

768
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,720
So I have no objections.

769
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:44,290
Hey, I didn't know actors
got paid that much money.

770
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,590
Chan Seong, how about you
start a career in acting?

771
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:50,531
I don't know how to act.
I'm a horrible actor.

772
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:54,700
I guess you're right. I can
tell that you'll be bad at it.

773
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:56,700
So tell me.

774
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,200
You told me that I don't even have
enough money to buy myself...

775
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:03,540
a bowl of chicken noodles. But
that was a lie, wasn't it?

776
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,881
It's true that your loan is overdue.

777
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,850
But I did lie about the chicken noodles.

778
00:53:08,281 --> 00:53:10,950
You have enough money for webfoot octopus.

779
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,680
Oh, right. Webfoot octopus.

780
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:14,890
I couldn't eat that because of you.

781
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,390
Yes, you're right. It's all my fault.

782
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,660
I'll forgive you since you
know you're at fault.

783
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,231
Then let's go to the west coast.

784
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:27,869
We might get lucky and see the sunrise.

785
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,131
And we can also eat webfoot octopus.

786
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:30,430
What's going on?

787
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,301
Why are you being so nice?

788
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,869
Are you suddenly being nice to me...

789
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,881
because I told you I'm going
to be your last guest?

790
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:41,749
"We'll give you everything you want."

791
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,881
Gosh, what an incredible hotelier.

792
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,890
I'm not that incredible.

793
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,361
Hoteliers aren't supposed to have
personal feelings for their guests.

794
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,160
What?

795
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:01,071
What kind of personal
feelings do you have for me?

796
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,631
The leaf.

797
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,301
You showed me that I got two leaves.

798
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,711
How do you expect me to ignore that?

799
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:16,651
Let's not go today. I
had too much champagne.

800
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:20,651
We can have the webfoot octopus tomorrow.

801
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,220
I need to go to the filming set tomorrow.

802
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:25,821
You don't need to come.

803
00:54:25,991 --> 00:54:27,790
I hired an intern for you.

804
00:54:30,861 --> 00:54:32,801
("The Crowned Queen")

805
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:40,599
You're the intern?

806
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,711
Yes.

807
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:44,481
Feel free to quit whenever you wish.

808
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,111
I'll take your place.

809
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,750
You should be in school.

810
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,151
I'm planning to stay in school.

811
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:57,091
I'm doing it for someone who
used to love going to school.

812
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,130
School's over today, so I
can go with you, right?

813
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,830
I can't find the hotel on
my own during the daytime.

814
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,930
Let's go next time. I
have an appointment here.

815
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:07,470
Who are you meeting?

816
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,030
A ghost?

817
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,941
No, it's a human being.
I'm meeting a friend.

818
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:14,470
I'm not interested in humans. I'll see you.

819
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,310
Gosh, this looks nice.

820
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:20,849
I like it.

821
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,711
- Thank you for the food.
- No problem.

822
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,220
I heard you're Man Weol's relative.
You should come often.

823
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,321
Okay.

824
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:28,950
Hey, Mi Ra.

825
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,591
Chan Seong's waiting for you inside.
Go ahead.

826
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:56,211
I thought he was meeting a friend.
But I guess he meant his girlfriend.

827
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,220
It's been a while.

828
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:07,261
Yes, it has.

829
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:18,700
Where are you going, Ms. Jang? You
look like you're in a good mood.

830
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,140
Yes, I'm going to the beach.

831
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:23,441
The beach? There's a beach in our hotel.

832
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:25,511
You can't compare that to a real beach.

833
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,309
How is it different?

834
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,580
Our beach is...

835
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:32,981
Webfoot octopus.

836
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,119
There's no webfoot octopus here.

837
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,790
I'm on my way to eat that.

838
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:40,060
Should I ask Yu Na to buy you some?

839
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:43,160
No, I want to eat it there.

840
00:56:43,161 --> 00:56:46,100
Gosh, it would've been nice
if Mr. Ku went with you.

841
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,361
Should I call him?

842
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,531
There's no need. He'll be here.

843
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:51,800
I guess you're right. I
feel a little sorry...

844
00:56:51,801 --> 00:56:53,600
about rushing him since
he's with his girlfriend.

845
00:56:54,571 --> 00:56:57,310
Yu Na apparently saw her. I
heard she's really pretty.

846
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,579
Mr. Ku's always around ghosts,

847
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,810
so he should meet a lot
of humans when he can.

848
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:05,849
If he ends up growing old...

849
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:08,691
all by himself just like Mr. No did,

850
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,390
I'd feel so sorry for him.

851
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:17,531
Ms. Jang, I hope you eat a lot
of delicious stuff at the beach.

852
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:18,930
Hyun Joong.

853
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:21,970
Tell the guests to empty the
hotel beach within 30 minutes.

854
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,441
I want to take a rest there.

855
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,241
I thought you were going
to go to a beach far away.

856
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,571
Why would I go? They're
all the same anyway.

857
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:31,381
I'm...

858
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,810
not going.

859
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,520
Should I buy you some webfoot octopus?

860
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,419
You acted like you were never
going to come back to Korea.

861
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,520
But here you are.

862
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,289
Are you nervous to see me here
since it was so unexpected?

863
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,231
I'm just glad to see you.

864
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:51,099
I found it weird that
you suddenly showed up,

865
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,361
so I asked around.

866
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:53,599
I heard you took out a loan...

867
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,829
and got kicked out from
your parents' house.

868
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,171
It was only a small amount.

869
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:58,740
I'm a doctor. I'll quickly
be able to pay it off.

870
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,970
Is that so? That's good to hear.

871
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,441
I don't have much time, so
let's cut to the chase.

872
00:58:03,571 --> 00:58:05,840
I want my 5,000 dollars back.

873
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:08,450
It's been ages since we last met.
Let's not talk about money.

874
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,320
I'm only talking about money
because it's been a long time.

875
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,349
Otherwise, I would've sued you.

876
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,490
I don't believe you.

877
00:58:16,491 --> 00:58:18,860
I know how much you loved me.

878
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,620
You'll never sue me.

879
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:24,229
You're right. When you told me your
family was struggling with money...

880
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:26,300
and asked me to lend you 5,000 dollars,

881
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:29,830
I liked you so much that I even
gave you money from my tuition.

882
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,200
Chan Seong.

883
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:35,071
Try to remember how much
you liked me back then.

884
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:38,939
First, let me calculate how
much you need to pay me back.

885
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,950
Gosh, I'll pay you back.

886
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:43,881
But I actually called you
because I really missed you.

887
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,580
It's so nice to see you again.

888
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,119
I guess you're still hopeless.

889
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,591
And it's still charming, isn't it?

890
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:51,290
Okay, fine.

891
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,330
That's enough. You have a bad stomach.

892
00:58:58,861 --> 00:59:00,401
You haven't changed either.

893
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:05,640
Chan Seong, I heard you're single.

894
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,901
Just a second.

895
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:24,220
Excuse me. Wait up!

896
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:48,091
Excuse me. Wait up!

897
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,580
- Yes?
- Mr. Kim Joon Hyun.

898
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:12,850
Yes?

899
01:00:14,351 --> 01:00:16,591
- Can I get an autograph?
- Sure.

900
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:19,661
You must have run here.

901
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,089
Wait. Let me borrow your back.

902
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,361
- My back?
- Yes. It has to be flat.

903
01:00:26,661 --> 01:00:27,971
What's your name?

904
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:30,129
- It's Jang Man Weol.
- Jang Man Weol.

905
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,301
She's a huge fan.

906
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,270
Thank her for me. What a great name.

907
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,881
Okay.

908
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,310
Bye.

909
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,011
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

910
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,080
Can we take a photo too?

911
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:46,180
She doesn't trust people easily.

912
01:00:46,181 --> 01:00:49,951
She doesn't trust people? I see.
Sure, let's take one.

913
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,390
People take photos these days.

914
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,530
How should I pose? All right.

915
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:56,531
1, 2, 3.

916
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,011
(Ms. Jang)

917
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,940
I was just about to call you.

918
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,250
- I just met someone.
- Ku Chan Seong.

919
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,281
Take the day off. Don't come.

920
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,020
What about our trip to the sea?

921
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,020
I can go to the sea at the hotel too.

922
01:01:26,221 --> 01:01:27,721
It's all the same, anyway.

923
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,531
I don't have to go. Take the day off.

924
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:40,071
(To Jang Man Weol, I love you!)

925
01:03:12,561 --> 01:03:13,861
You're here.

926
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,131
How did you find me here?

927
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:18,241
Yeon Woo told me.

928
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,170
You should have told me first if
you found a good place like this.

929
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:26,310
Don't keep it to yourself.

930
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:28,681
It's a good place to drink alone.

931
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:30,580
Get lost.

932
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:53,161
Now do you realize this view is
much better than the previous one?

933
01:04:57,801 --> 01:05:00,270
Fireflies are all the same.
They aren't that different.

934
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,710
Of course, they are.

935
01:05:01,911 --> 01:05:05,710
Before, you were alone. But
now, I'm here with you.

936
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:12,651
Every sight you see with
me will look different.

937
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,091
From now on, drinking alone
here won't make you happy.

938
01:05:23,491 --> 01:05:24,901
Mark my words.

939
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,730
You'll be waiting for me to
suddenly show up like today.

940
01:07:00,861 --> 01:07:04,590
The tree I'm growing at
Guest House of the Moon...

941
01:07:04,931 --> 01:07:07,031
used to be as stiff as a rock.

942
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:09,371
But it's starting to look pretty now.

943
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:15,211
I guess the man you sent is
taking good care of the tree.

944
01:07:15,271 --> 01:07:17,440
You sent him there because you
thought he was the remedy,

945
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:18,940
but he might turn out to be poison.

946
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,510
Love can be one's remedy and poison.

947
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:27,321
But it's so hard to weave them together.

948
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:31,791
Darn it. It's tangled again.

949
01:07:32,821 --> 01:07:34,291
Darn it. What should I do?

950
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:36,130
Darn it. Goodness.

951
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:46,770
(Rich boy, do you want to
grab a sandwich with me?)

952
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,611
No. Asking a ghost to have a
sandwich with me sounds weird.

953
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,581
What should I say?

954
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:05,491
What was that?

955
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,821
That felt creepy just now.

956
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:11,560
(Hey, anything fun these days?)

957
01:08:11,561 --> 01:08:12,760
(Somebody, send me some fun stuff.)

958
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:14,230
(This.)

959
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:16,699
(It's going viral. If you're
scared, don't open it.)

960
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,640
(It's that famous video.
I didn't watch it.)

961
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,371
He's trying to scare me.

962
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:30,050
Are you enjoying this?

963
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,020
You like this?

964
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,890
I'm hot, aren't I?

965
01:09:07,681 --> 01:09:10,249
Ms. Jang is on the beach by herself?

966
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,520
Yes, she told me not to let anyone in.

967
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,779
The Air Handling Unit, right?
I'm on the beach now.

968
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,510
The sun is too strong now!

969
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,281
I don't want 12pm.

970
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,951
How about around 6pm? Change
the setting to sundown.

971
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:59,270
Whether the sun is blazing or goes down,

972
01:10:01,571 --> 01:10:03,840
the beach looks the same.

973
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,140
I should ask them to
make the waves stronger.

974
01:10:10,151 --> 01:10:11,581
The beach will still look the same.

975
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,651
Why are you here?

976
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,821
You refused to go to the beach with me.

977
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,630
I just wanted...

978
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:26,199
to laugh a little.

979
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,300
You wanted to laugh?

980
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,300
You and your capricious mind.

981
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,041
I told you to rest. What
are you doing here?

982
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,640
I did something silly,

983
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,871
but I can't tell you what I did
because you might laugh at me.

984
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,041
What did you do?

985
01:10:40,481 --> 01:10:43,310
- Don't laugh.
- I'm not in the mood. What is it?

986
01:10:51,821 --> 01:10:53,560
(To Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you.)

987
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:00,531
Doesn't it make you happy?

988
01:11:01,901 --> 01:11:04,770
"To Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you"?

989
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,741
Are you professing your love to me?

990
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:11,241
No! I didn't write this.

991
01:11:11,981 --> 01:11:14,340
This is Kim Joon Hyun's autograph.
Here, "Kim Joon Hyun".

992
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,211
Kim Joon Hyun?

993
01:11:19,351 --> 01:11:21,749
- It's true.
- I ran after him and asked him...

994
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,590
for an autograph on the streets
even though I was so embarrassed.

995
01:11:24,891 --> 01:11:26,161
I thought it'd make you happy.

996
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,961
Are you not happy?

997
01:11:38,071 --> 01:11:39,241
I am.

998
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,640
I love this.

999
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,850
I knew you'd like it.

1000
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,121
I felt so shy...

1001
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:56,421
about asking for an autograph.

1002
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,361
It's nice to come to this beach
instead of going somewhere far.

1003
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:08,730
Although there's no webfoot octopus here.

1004
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,541
That's okay.

1005
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,081
Because you're here.

1006
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,451
The ocean looks beautiful.

1007
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,161
Yes, indeed.

1008
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,060
It makes me sad.

1009
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,380
I'm...

1010
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:56,680
a little sad...

1011
01:13:00,551 --> 01:13:02,190
because the ocean...

1012
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,291
looks more beautiful now...

1013
01:13:10,731 --> 01:13:11,930
than it did earlier.

1014
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:21,630
(Hotel Del Luna)

1015
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:23,955
Since you can see my past,

1016
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,825
you'll gradually find out how
much of a horrible person I was.

1017
01:14:27,966 --> 01:14:29,266
You can't do this here, sir.

1018
01:14:29,996 --> 01:14:31,165
Just leave him be.

1019
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,465
Enjoy the bloodshed until
your anger subsides.

1020
01:14:33,466 --> 01:14:35,636
All right. Pick one.

1021
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:37,274
Lee Mi Ra.

1022
01:14:37,275 --> 01:14:38,904
I invited you to the hotel.

1023
01:14:38,905 --> 01:14:41,045
A mere dream can't lead you to the hotel.

1024
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,276
Only death can.
