00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,814
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,549
Stop.

3
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:35,058
What are you doing?

4
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:37,929
These are the belongings
of the beheaded men.

5
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:39,354
We were told to keep what's useful...

6
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:40,689
and burn the rest.

7
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:56,939
Don't burn the belongings of the dead.

8
00:00:58,733 --> 00:00:59,878
I want you to gather all of them.

9
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,579
Give these to the men who survived...

10
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,908
so they can use what's
left to hold a funeral.

11
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:35,018
Wait.

12
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:49,928
I will kill you.

13
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:53,398
I will kill you...

14
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,038
at all costs.

15
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:20,349
Chan Seong!

16
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,428
I thought you weren't coming back.

17
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:08,169
Who...

18
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:13,569
are you?

19
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:23,219
Mr. Ku!

20
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,318
- Mr. Ku!
- Mr. Ku!

21
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,019
Mr. Ku!

22
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:35,029
Thank goodness you're okay.

23
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:37,399
We were really worried.

24
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:39,169
I was so flustered.

25
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,178
Ms. Jang, you must've been really startled.

26
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:52,779
Do you feel unwell?

27
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:56,419
No, I'm fine.

28
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:04,459
I'm okay. I must've startled you a lot.

29
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,998
Ms. Jang must be angry.

30
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:18,039
She's probably just embarrassed that
she ran over here all startled.

31
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:21,979
Anyway, I'm relieved that you
managed to find your way out.

32
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:03,578
This is...

33
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:06,888
the end for us.

34
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:13,789
Who is that man?

35
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,399
Why? Do you think it could be you?

36
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:18,529
I thought that could be a possibility.

37
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,954
I figured what I saw could be...

38
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:22,138
a glimpse of my previous life
that I just can't remember.

39
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:28,008
Ku Chan Seong will
eventually bring him to you.

40
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:35,279
This is absurd.

41
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:37,849
Chan Seong can't be him.

42
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:58,738
Man Weol will end up
getting severely swayed...

43
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:00,669
just because...

44
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:04,178
of this small, green light.

45
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:09,948
You've...

46
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,344
become very weak because
you had to come back...

47
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:14,589
from the afterlife.

48
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:17,789
And now, you're so dim.

49
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:44,818
This alcohol is from this world.

50
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:46,944
You almost crossed the
threshold of the afterlife,

51
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,589
so hurry up and drink
something from this world.

52
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:52,258
Thank you.

53
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:00,128
I'm so relieved that you didn't
get lost and found your way out.

54
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:01,493
Yes, I heard...

55
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:04,123
that time runs at a
different speed there...

56
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:05,438
and that I could lose my memory.

57
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,634
Some people think they were gone
only for a very short while,

58
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,163
actually, 30 years had passed.

59
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:11,163
Such a folktale wasn't a joke.

60
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,873
I heard this from the Grim Reaper.

61
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:16,118
Someone remembered his past life on
his way back from the afterlife,

62
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:18,349
which completely ruined his
life in the living realm.

63
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,274
- He remembered his past life?
- Did you see...

64
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,859
anything odd when you were there?

65
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:33,499
I think I remember seeing
something twinkling in the dark.

66
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,098
- I see.
- What was that?

67
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,808
We don't know as we've never gone in there.

68
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:44,639
You got to see it before us even
though we're the dead ones.

69
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,434
By the way, how did you
manage to return right away?

70
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:48,743
I heard it's not easy.

71
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,318
Frankly, I have no recollection whatsoever.

72
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:53,013
I was already out of there when I woke up.

73
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:55,889
You lost your memory.
Here, drink some more.

74
00:08:58,513 --> 00:08:59,588
Ms. Jang.

75
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:09,799
I thought the kid got on
the car to the afterlife.

76
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,169
I ended up going in there
while trying to stop that.

77
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:15,678
Both the kid and I are
fine, so don't be mad.

78
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,249
I'm really fine.

79
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,928
You are just Ku Chan Seong.

80
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:18,909
Do you still...

81
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:21,909
see me in your dreams?

82
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,749
No, I haven't seen you in my dreams...

83
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,088
since the day I had a very long dream.

84
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:36,958
Then did you see someone else?

85
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,489
I haven't told you...

86
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:41,289
because I wasn't sure whether it was
a dream or just my imagination,

87
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:43,299
but I saw that man.

88
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,129
The man named Chung Myung.

89
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,198
He was waiting for you...

90
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,039
by the lake all by himself.

91
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:59,049
He was holding a moon-shaped ornament,

92
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:01,009
which seemed like yours.

93
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:07,149
Have you...

94
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:09,989
received such a gift?

95
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:14,228
No.

96
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,428
If I'm not peeking into your memories,

97
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:20,769
what was that dream about?

98
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:29,539
At first, you told me that
perhaps you're seeing...

99
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:33,608
memories from your past life
that you don't remember.

100
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,718
Right, but you said that's impossible.

101
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:41,958
Yes.

102
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:44,688
It's impossible.

103
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:48,999
Are you anxious...

104
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:51,828
because of how Song Hwa and
Yeon Woo ended up together?

105
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:53,499
Are you worried he might return like that?

106
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,068
I won't end up like them.

107
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,308
They were...

108
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,938
Fine. That happened in their past lives,

109
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:04,639
so let's say it's possible.

110
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,279
But with me, it happened in this lifetime.

111
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,588
Seeing Yeon Woo with that woman...

112
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,799
made me think some crazy
thoughts for a moment.

113
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,858
- Dad.
- Yun! Yes, Yun.

114
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,414
He fell asleep at a bus stop.

115
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:55,858
We brought him to the hospital
because he had a fever.

116
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:58,828
He took a fever reducer, so
the fever has gone down.

117
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,899
Thank you so much.

118
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,098
Where have you been?

119
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,308
I took the bus and went to the hotel.

120
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,379
He must've had a dream when he was asleep.

121
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:14,678
I went there to see Mom, but I
was told that she's not there.

122
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:20,749
When you're a little older,

123
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:24,914
I'll tell you where your mom
is and why she had to leave.

124
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,588
I'll tell you everything, okay?

125
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:28,328
Okay.

126
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:30,358
I'm sorry.

127
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:37,539
Would finding out later be less sad?

128
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:40,139
He'll learn that he can
never see her again.

129
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:49,478
Does Yu Na know that you're
planning to leave...

130
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:51,019
with your younger sister after she dies?

131
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:58,259
Yu Na.

132
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:01,954
- You see...
- Hey, Ms. Jang will yell at you...

133
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:04,483
if you go back now, so let's hang out.

134
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:06,023
- Well...
- I learned...

135
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:08,669
that you get scolded less if
you wait it out a little.

136
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,999
Wait here. I need to use the ladies' room.

137
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,208
I should tell her today.

138
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:32,328
Ma'am, listen to this for a moment.

139
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:43,568
Do you like this piano melody?

140
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:45,198
Well...

141
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:46,838
Yes.

142
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,409
My friend's sister...

143
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:53,348
I mean, you look a lot like
my friend's grandmother.

144
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:57,419
May I take a photo of you listening
to music to show my friend?

145
00:14:58,444 --> 00:14:59,519
Sure.

146
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:03,759
Thank you.

147
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:19,233
Well... Do you remember...

148
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,739
your brother's name by any chance?

149
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:23,478
Yes, I do.

150
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:27,149
My brother's name is...

151
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,649
Ji Hyun Joong.

152
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,749
You remember him?

153
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:34,889
Yes.

154
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:43,098
Hello, can I help you?

155
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,098
Hyun Joong.

156
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,299
Yes, Hyun Mi.

157
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:49,799
Were you listening to music?

158
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:52,739
Let's see.

159
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:56,338
Sir, are you the founder of this hospital,

160
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,204
Mr. Ji Hyun Joong?

161
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:03,678
Yes. You must be Mr. Kim's daughter
who was hospitalized here.

162
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:05,844
Hold on.

163
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:07,218
You're...

164
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:09,958
her brother?

165
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,728
Yes, I am. What's the matter?

166
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:15,159
But her brother, Ji Hyun Joong,

167
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,098
died many years ago.

168
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:19,399
What?

169
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:25,568
Hyun Joong? Hyun Joong.

170
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,239
- Where are you?
- Yes, I'm here.

171
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,608
Gosh.

172
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,389
There is someone who knows...

173
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:47,759
that Ji Hyun Joong is dead.

174
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:58,523
I told you not to bother Hyun Mi.

175
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:00,639
Does that man have something
to do with your death?

176
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:03,108
Did he steal everything you had?

177
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:04,863
And he's living as you now?

178
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:07,709
- It's none of your business.
- That's why you couldn't ascend.

179
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:11,449
You couldn't stand him living
a good life using your name.

180
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:15,884
- Just leave him be.
- How could I?

181
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,283
He stole your life.

182
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:19,154
Who cares? I'm already dead.

183
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:20,959
Look at yourself living a good life.

184
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:29,098
Right.

185
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:32,138
I stole someone's life too.

186
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,568
I was being too nosy.

187
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:35,904
Yu Na, that's not what I meant.

188
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:37,239
I'll mind my own business.

189
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:52,628
Hey, Sanchez. Everything's
going well, right?

190
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:55,128
- Eat up!
- What's up with all the noise?

191
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,029
Is someone else home?

192
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,624
Mi Ra had Detective Park sleep
in your room last night...

193
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:01,628
because his leg was swollen.

194
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,624
I think he's fine now,
but Mi Ra kept saying...

195
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,533
he must eat well as he's injured.
We're eating now.

196
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,033
When we were having a meal,

197
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:11,364
Detective Park's colleagues came
over since it's their day off.

198
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:13,303
And when they came over,
they said I had a nice yard,

199
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:15,148
so they're having the watermelon
they brought in the yard.

200
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,279
Gosh, you guys look great together.

201
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:21,749
Mi Ra brought people to the house.

202
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,618
Chan Seong, it's very safe here.

203
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,513
Thanks to the incense Man Weol gave me,

204
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:28,253
spiritually, it's safe here.

205
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:30,253
When Mi Ra invited the
detectives over to my house,

206
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,598
I don't need to worry
about being in danger.

207
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:35,868
Sanchez, put Mi Ra on the phone.
I'll talk to her.

208
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:37,299
Don't.

209
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:40,194
I'm sure she's bringing people over...

210
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:41,608
in case I get depressed if I'm all alone.

211
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,078
It's nice and noisy here.

212
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,104
Chan Seong, all I could think about...

213
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:48,848
is making sure that they
don't ruin the grass.

214
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:52,549
Chan Seong, you don't
need to worry about me.

215
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:55,783
- This is good.
- It is, right? I bought it.

216
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:57,418
- No, you didn't.
- I didn't?

217
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:58,929
I'll eat it myself.

218
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:01,154
Come on, you're injured.

219
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:02,429
My arm is fine.

220
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,469
Should I break your arm, so
you will let me feed you?

221
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:08,939
Here.

222
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,838
It's good, right?

223
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,908
- You can eat it yourself now.
- It's good.

224
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:19,773
Isn't it sweet?

225
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:23,779
I thought Mi Ra and Detective Park
were always fighting like enemies.

226
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:25,888
Now that I see them
together, they seem fine.

227
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,019
You don't need to worry.

228
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,618
I think she'll move out soon.

229
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:33,358
Chan Seong, I'm going to go
eat some watermelon. Bye.

230
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:36,199
Sanchez.

231
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,628
Eat the melon the detectives bought.

232
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:40,993
- Come and join us.
- It's delicious.

233
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,068
Mi Ra.

234
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:45,138
That melon came from my fridge.

235
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:47,808
Is that so?

236
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,404
- Let's eat it.
- Things happen, you know.

237
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:53,134
- The melon did feel cool.
- Bring the cutting board.

238
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,578
What does it matter?

239
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:00,918
Come in.

240
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:11,358
Do you remember...

241
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:14,368
that Ms. Jang invited a woman
to our hotel a while ago?

242
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:16,539
This is an amazing hotel.

243
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:19,808
And from what I've heard,
she's your friend.

244
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:21,439
That's right.

245
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:25,009
Did she cross paths with
Ms. Jang in her previous life?

246
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,878
I'm sure their connection was ill-fated.

247
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:32,449
We have never...

248
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:36,558
tried to figure out Ms. Jang's story...

249
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:39,753
because we always assumed
that she had no intention...

250
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:42,628
of leaving after settling her resentment.

251
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:47,429
But the tree that tied her
down here has changed.

252
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:50,364
And I think the changes
have been brought...

253
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:53,638
by you and the connections
you have brought.

254
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,539
Your assumption...

255
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:58,608
is correct.

256
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:01,709
In addition to that lady,

257
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,679
will Ms. Jang face more
connections from her past?

258
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:07,689
He's already here.

259
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:09,489
And I'm sure...

260
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:11,418
more will come shortly.

261
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:18,029
I'll probably end up bringing the
man to Ms. Jang like the others.

262
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:22,598
That must be why Ma Go
brought you to our hotel.

263
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:24,823
Then, I take it that you
must have crossed paths...

264
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:26,769
with Ms. Jang in your
previous life as well.

265
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:28,608
No, I have not.

266
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,138
Is that so?

267
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,979
That's odd.

268
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:34,674
If you have never met her
in your previous life,

269
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:37,449
why did Ma Go choose you out of everyone?

270
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:46,229
I'm sure the deity must have a
reason for bringing you to her.

271
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:49,499
Anyway, it resulted in love.

272
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:52,668
I will continue...

273
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:55,529
to stay with her.

274
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,709
My heart breaks for Ms. Jang.

275
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:03,709
Soon,

276
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:07,049
she will have to face someone...

277
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:10,378
who will inflict the most pain.

278
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:29,939
Jang Man Weol.

279
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:32,739
Why are you leaving?

280
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:34,108
I don't want to see you.

281
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:38,638
Admire the flowers you have
wanted as much as you want...

282
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,374
and just leave.

283
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:41,449
Then...

284
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,418
will you let him just pass by?

285
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:46,489
Will you pretend to be clueless?

286
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:53,088
You have met him.

287
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,838
You can't run away from it.

288
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,168
He's already...

289
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,539
by your side.

290
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,148
I finally get to give this to you.

291
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:21,418
It's yours.

292
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,769
But I saw that man.

293
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:42,608
The man named Chung Myung.

294
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:47,848
He was holding a moon-shaped ornament,

295
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,418
which seemed like yours.

296
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:56,219
Is it Chan Seong?

297
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,959
If it is him,

298
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,989
will you be able to accept it?

299
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:07,168
Is Chan Seong...

300
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,699
that man?

301
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:14,134
The man you have been waiting
for over 1,000 years...

302
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:15,593
has finally shown up,

303
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,039
but you don't seem happy.

304
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:23,249
You were so sure of yourself
that once he came to this world,

305
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:26,648
you'd kill him and cease to exist.

306
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:30,289
Are you second-guessing yourself now?

307
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,299
So I asked...

308
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:39,799
if that man is Chan Seong.

309
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:44,199
You have fed the hatred
of yours for a long time.

310
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:48,509
Why don't you let go of your hatred
with your love which took ages...

311
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:50,908
to reach you?

312
00:24:57,243 --> 00:24:59,989
I have hated the man for over 1,000 years.

313
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:05,459
But you made me see him as a
man whom I fell in love with?

314
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,999
I'm curious to find out which man...

315
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,499
you'll see him as.

316
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:17,368
Will you see him as Ko Chung
Myung and cease to exist?

317
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:21,209
Or will you see him as Ku
Chan Seong and be saved?

318
00:25:22,394 --> 00:25:23,539
It is...

319
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,549
up to you.

320
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:24,699
Ms. Jang.

321
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:33,573
Every sight you see with
me will look different.

322
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:36,378
The view here looks prettier now
that we're seeing it together.

323
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:40,689
I'm proud of you,

324
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,219
Man Weol.

325
00:27:37,604 --> 00:27:38,779
I told you...

326
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:41,679
to trust me.

327
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:08,168
Chan Seong.

328
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:52,779
Ms. Jang.

329
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,318
Are you all right?

330
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,189
You look very pale.

331
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,509
A moment ago,

332
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:20,049
I killed Chan Seong in my thoughts.

333
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:26,019
He could be...

334
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:31,289
the reincarnation of the
man I abhor the most.

335
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:33,229
I'm sure it isn't him.

336
00:29:34,454 --> 00:29:36,799
Mr. Ku also said it wasn't him.

337
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:39,158
Right.

338
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,229
It might not be him.

339
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,523
But as long as there is
slightest possibility...

340
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:45,138
that it could be him,

341
00:29:45,593 --> 00:29:47,469
I will never be able...

342
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,608
to face Chan Seong.

343
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,179
Now...

344
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:55,209
what will you do?

345
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,699
I can never kill Chan Seong.

346
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,999
Ma Go says I have to empty out everything.

347
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:24,279
Now I have to think hard...

348
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,808
about how to do that.

349
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:02,078
I bought them from that shop you like.

350
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,878
You will feel better after
you eat something sweet.

351
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:07,949
Come and sit down.

352
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:15,759
What do you have in your hand?

353
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,638
It's the ornament I saw in my dreams.

354
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,279
This came from your dream.

355
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:36,209
Ma Go gave it to me.

356
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:39,318
In my dreams, it didn't
have any blood on it.

357
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:41,489
I told you he died at my sword.

358
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,088
This blood...

359
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:47,229
must be filled with the hatred for me.

360
00:31:47,454 --> 00:31:49,429
Why did Ma Go give you
such an ominous thing?

361
00:31:50,354 --> 00:31:51,999
Give it to me. I'll keep it for you.

362
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:58,739
I will get rid of this myself.

363
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,269
The moon covered in blood...

364
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:03,378
must be destroyed.

365
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:06,138
Ma Go always tells me that.

366
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,408
To empty the moon...

367
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:10,719
that is filled with hatred.

368
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:12,918
Can you do that?

369
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:16,818
I have to.

370
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:21,128
I want to call in...

371
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:24,358
the moon covered in blood.

372
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:31,368
Mr. Ku.

373
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,168
Mr. Ku.

374
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:34,769
You are here.

375
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,749
The Grim Reaper is looking for you.

376
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:43,179
Go on.

377
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,158
I have found the vengeful
spirit that cursed you.

378
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:58,999
You've found Seol Ji Won.

379
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:02,199
Has he become more powerful as he wanted?

380
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:05,398
Do you think a vengeful spirit that
holds unjustifiable resentment...

381
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,868
can become powerful as he wishes?

382
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:12,408
He is only hiding in the
dark like a gutter rat.

383
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:13,709
That's good to know.

384
00:33:13,803 --> 00:33:16,779
His yearning to become eviler
hasn't become stronger.

385
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:20,289
He's just hiding in the dark like a coward.

386
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,358
Can you help me?

387
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:27,759
I heard you were good at acting as bait.

388
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:30,799
I won't reveal who recommended you.

389
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,429
I'm sure it's Mr. Kim.

390
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:38,969
I'll take it that a work colleague
thinks highly of my skills.

391
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,908
Many human managers worked here.

392
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:44,979
Among them, you are...

393
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:50,148
That is my assessment.

394
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:54,418
Thank you.

395
00:33:57,144 --> 00:34:00,729
Did you start working at Guest
House of the Moon from the start?

396
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:02,789
Yes.

397
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:05,424
I guided a number of spirits...

398
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:07,729
from this place to the other world.

399
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,869
Take care of your guests.

400
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,139
Especially...

401
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,969
your first guest.

402
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,509
Who was the first guest of this place?

403
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,478
Ma Go said that the first
guest was the most important.

404
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:26,889
I have not guided...

405
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:30,818
the first guest of this place.

406
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,288
Nobody in this place...

407
00:34:35,354 --> 00:34:38,329
has seen the faint light of his existence.

408
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:40,998
How could that happen to a guest?

409
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:43,369
I do not give answers.

410
00:34:44,263 --> 00:34:45,498
I only guide them to the end.

411
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,038
First,

412
00:34:50,363 --> 00:34:51,779
let's go catch that vengeful spirit.

413
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:56,818
(The Sanzu River)

414
00:35:24,403 --> 00:35:26,279
Since it has the sign of the moon...

415
00:35:27,434 --> 00:35:29,679
he must have made it for you.

416
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:35,788
And you would have been so
happy when you received it.

417
00:35:39,743 --> 00:35:42,159
That disgusts me about you.

418
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,538
When he came,

419
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:03,378
I was going to throw him into
the fiery pit that you made...

420
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:06,079
and make both of you cease to exist.

421
00:36:11,743 --> 00:36:13,188
However, because of the
scheming of the deities,

422
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,929
I can't do that anymore.

423
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:19,559
I...

424
00:36:21,294 --> 00:36:23,739
ended up falling in love again.

425
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:30,438
Leaning on that love,

426
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:36,478
I tried to ignore you.

427
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:39,748
You just had to...

428
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:42,949
drag me down again.

429
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:54,168
I will...

430
00:36:55,224 --> 00:36:56,529
put you in here...

431
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,809
and dump it in a trash bin around here.

432
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,108
You will go berserk.

433
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:10,179
And we will cease to exist together.

434
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:03,398
Seol Ji Won.

435
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:04,768
Come out.

436
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:09,639
I know you're hiding in here.

437
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:13,079
The Grim Reaper is on his way to take you.

438
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:25,858
There you are.

439
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:32,329
So you went from being a
smug jerk to a loser.

440
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:38,838
I have something for you.

441
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:46,978
Eat this.

442
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:50,518
Eat it...

443
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:54,088
and become an evil spirit.

444
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:20,549
So he came hiding to the
place he's familiar with.

445
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:24,079
He's in the darkness, but he will
reveal himself once he sees you.

446
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:42,068
Ms. Jang, you're here too.

447
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:45,068
Yes, I came ahead.

448
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,108
Did you catch him?

449
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:51,779
I let him go.

450
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:57,179
Danger will now find you...

451
00:39:58,173 --> 00:39:59,349
because I gave him...

452
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:03,318
a special gift.

453
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:09,688
You'll have your work cut
out for you with this one.

454
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:14,268
He might go crazy with
his new-found powers.

455
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:17,199
What are you doing?

456
00:40:18,664 --> 00:40:19,768
Chan Seong.

457
00:40:22,593 --> 00:40:24,478
Ma Go said that you're him.

458
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:37,889
I need to kill you,

459
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:40,489
but I won't be able to.

460
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,228
I just like you too much.

461
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:54,239
But I won't protect you though.

462
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:58,309
I waited for over 1,000 years to kill you,

463
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:00,378
so I'll be making...

464
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:03,409
a mockery out of myself if I protect you.

465
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:13,059
If the vengeful spirit becomes an evil one,

466
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:15,728
he will become stronger, and
you will cease to exist too.

467
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:21,799
Whatever.

468
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:29,068
You're a human adored by Ma Go,

469
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,878
so they'll interfere before
the spirit gets to you.

470
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:34,378
And...

471
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:37,779
you'll perish.

472
00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:46,518
So I only ended up using you.

473
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,099
What I call love couldn't be more pathetic.

474
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:15,049
Ms. Jang!

475
00:42:30,993 --> 00:42:33,099
- What's with the hotel?
- Beats me.

476
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:36,038
All the lights in the
building have gone out.

477
00:42:48,573 --> 00:42:51,719
Mr. Ku, something happened to Ms. Jang?

478
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:53,358
I think there was a misunderstanding.

479
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:55,389
Do you know where she is?

480
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:57,754
She went into the garden where
the Moon Tree stands...

481
00:42:57,754 --> 00:42:59,199
and barricaded the door.

482
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:01,728
No one can enter.

483
00:43:29,783 --> 00:43:32,854
We should check on our guests first.

484
00:43:32,854 --> 00:43:34,869
I don't understand why
we're in trouble now.

485
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,418
Ms. Jang,

486
00:43:50,874 --> 00:43:53,179
what on earth are you up to?

487
00:43:57,914 --> 00:43:59,059
Is it true?

488
00:44:00,084 --> 00:44:02,088
Am I truly that man...

489
00:44:03,314 --> 00:44:04,759
whom Ms. Jang loathes?

490
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:08,469
I doubt those were her exact words...

491
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:09,998
since he...

492
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:12,398
is right here.

493
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,389
You've met him before, you know.

494
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:53,978
How...

495
00:44:55,303 --> 00:44:56,509
is this him?

496
00:44:57,743 --> 00:44:58,949
He is...

497
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:02,748
the first guest who stayed at...

498
00:45:03,274 --> 00:45:05,188
Man Weol's Guest House of the Moon.

499
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:16,323
I should take him to her.

500
00:45:16,323 --> 00:45:17,398
Actually,

501
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:21,838
shouldn't you stop her
from being perished first?

502
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:26,909
Find the object Man Weol handed
over to the evil spirit.

503
00:45:27,704 --> 00:45:29,349
Once the evil spirit makes his move,

504
00:45:30,004 --> 00:45:32,179
the ramification will be set in stone.

505
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,528
Working overtime earned
us a few extra bucks,

506
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:43,023
so let's grab a drink.

507
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:44,337
- Sure.
- Let's go.

508
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:54,647
I hear he cursed his wife
so that she'd die.

509
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:57,172
What a piece of garbage.

510
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:58,977
Does he have no shame?

511
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:17,468
Hello.

512
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,733
Who on earth are you?

513
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,877
You should hurry on out of here.

514
00:47:04,003 --> 00:47:05,348
Greetings, my friend.

515
00:47:11,782 --> 00:47:13,882
I was going to visit you
after I had some fun.

516
00:47:13,882 --> 00:47:15,127
But I guess you were in a hurry.

517
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:16,558
How did you find me?

518
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:18,098
I found you thanks to the owner...

519
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:20,127
of the item that you recently picked up.

520
00:47:22,692 --> 00:47:23,797
This?

521
00:47:23,822 --> 00:47:26,167
I came to take that back. Give it to me.

522
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:27,968
How are you going to do that?

523
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:31,078
You'll die before you can take it from me.

524
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:44,517
So this is how...

525
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:47,288
you've come to face me.

526
00:48:19,882 --> 00:48:21,158
I guess you're not going to give up.

527
00:48:21,683 --> 00:48:22,988
Let's see how long you'll last.

528
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:25,997
I was just buying time.

529
00:48:27,023 --> 00:48:28,127
The time has come.

530
00:48:29,422 --> 00:48:30,567
The moon's showing itself.

531
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:40,308
Why do you think she gave that to you?

532
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:42,448
I told you that she will protect me.

533
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:46,817
Do you see that sign of the moon?

534
00:48:49,672 --> 00:48:50,888
Once the moon fully reveals itself,

535
00:48:51,183 --> 00:48:52,988
you'll be doomed for having that with you.

536
00:48:53,112 --> 00:48:54,428
Stop trying to fool me.

537
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:56,258
I told you that death
isn't the end, didn't I?

538
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,828
I tried to stop you, but
you just chose to die.

539
00:49:03,453 --> 00:49:06,098
Now, it's time for you to
fall into the fiery pit.

540
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:08,538
Goodbye, Seol Ji Won.

541
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:29,788
How dare you lie to me?

542
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:31,658
Just die.

543
00:49:39,163 --> 00:49:40,437
I never lied to you.

544
00:49:43,592 --> 00:49:44,908
You're really doomed.

545
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:22,972
I was also once...

546
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:24,877
a vengeful ghost full of spite.

547
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:26,302
If we add up the years
that we've been dead,

548
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:27,647
it becomes a total of 770 years.

549
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:30,388
But you're nothing but
a runt that just died.

550
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:32,218
How dare you act up this way?

551
00:50:37,152 --> 00:50:39,658
Take what you found, and
go back to the hotel.

552
00:50:40,953 --> 00:50:42,067
Okay.

553
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:05,758
I caught him.

554
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:09,127
We did all the work.
You're just taking credit.

555
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:21,692
You gave yourself to the vengeful ghost...

556
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:23,267
and tried to turn him into an evil spirit.

557
00:51:24,262 --> 00:51:26,377
I cannot forgive you for that.

558
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:30,877
I took out my most wicked thought
that I had deep down inside...

559
00:51:33,043 --> 00:51:34,848
and gave it to the vengeful ghost.

560
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:37,587
Then what does that make you?

561
00:51:39,612 --> 00:51:41,428
Are you just a heartbroken moon...

562
00:51:41,913 --> 00:51:45,457
that blooms and withers flowers...

563
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:48,167
as time repeats itself?

564
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:56,038
Just make me perish.

565
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,857
No!

566
00:52:19,422 --> 00:52:20,598
I brought it back.

567
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:22,897
There's no reason that
she must cease to exist.

568
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:24,497
Please leave.

569
00:52:25,523 --> 00:52:26,897
Just make me perish!

570
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:35,977
Fine.

571
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:38,078
Go ahead and have what you want.

572
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:42,988
If you must torment yourself like that,

573
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:46,118
I'll become the guy that
you keep thinking I am.

574
00:52:51,152 --> 00:52:52,297
Kill me.

575
00:53:08,003 --> 00:53:10,408
I promised I'd stay by your
side even if I have to die...

576
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:14,448
for getting in your way.

577
00:54:11,063 --> 00:54:12,538
The man you've been waiting for...

578
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:17,078
is actually here.

579
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,087
You came all the way here.

580
00:54:24,442 --> 00:54:26,417
So you should listen to
what happened on the day...

581
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:30,587
that the moon got covered in blood.

582
00:54:32,882 --> 00:54:34,997
That way, you'll be able
to empty your resentment.

583
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,207
Is this the afterlife?

584
00:54:49,172 --> 00:54:53,147
The afterlife that you'll encounter
won't be so magnificent.

585
00:54:54,302 --> 00:54:57,187
But there are some people who
wish to see you before you leave.

586
00:54:58,112 --> 00:54:59,187
Me?

587
00:54:59,342 --> 00:55:01,587
Our hotel guests are waiting for you.

588
00:55:03,913 --> 00:55:06,727
This is a special service for our guests.

589
00:55:08,793 --> 00:55:10,468
What a typical number.

590
00:55:11,862 --> 00:55:13,797
What is this? Is it the fiery pit?

591
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:16,267
You'll find out once you go inside.

592
00:55:56,003 --> 00:55:58,118
Do you remember what you
said to all of us...

593
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:00,278
right before you killed us?

594
00:56:02,713 --> 00:56:03,788
Hello.

595
00:56:05,213 --> 00:56:06,357
Seol Ji Won.

596
00:56:24,393 --> 00:56:26,937
We should soundproof the hotel walls.

597
00:56:45,722 --> 00:56:49,368
(We invite you to Hotel Del Luna.
From Jang Man Weol)

598
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:13,788
(Jang Man Weol)

599
00:57:19,882 --> 00:57:22,627
(We invite you to Hotel Del Luna.
From Jang Man Weol)

600
00:57:26,922 --> 00:57:28,468
"Hotel Del Luna"?

601
00:57:29,233 --> 00:57:30,937
Mr. Ku Chan Seong works here?

602
00:57:31,063 --> 00:57:34,408
Yes, my boss invited you.

603
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:38,618
She invited the doctor too.
You two should come together.

604
00:57:45,183 --> 00:57:47,587
(We invite you to Hotel Del Luna.
From Jang Man Weol)

605
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:49,428
Jang Man Weol?

606
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:51,523
(Dear Ms. Lee Mi Ra)

607
00:57:51,523 --> 00:57:54,058
What's that? An invitation to a hotel.

608
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:56,853
I've already been there once
as my friend works there.

609
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:58,023
It's such a nice hotel.

610
00:57:58,023 --> 00:57:59,163
Where is it?

611
00:57:59,163 --> 00:58:00,598
Not everyone can go.

612
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:04,707
You can't go there without an invitation.
It's a special hotel.

613
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:06,937
Very special.

614
00:58:17,543 --> 00:58:18,817
Welcome.

615
00:58:20,313 --> 00:58:23,158
I'll take you to our sky lounge,
the pride of our hotel.

616
00:58:25,652 --> 00:58:26,957
My gosh.

617
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:30,598
You came to this fancy
place all by yourself?

618
00:58:31,192 --> 00:58:34,267
Welcome. We have a table
ready for you inside.

619
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:35,638
This way, please.

620
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,532
Here, everyone gets drunk and
dreams of their past life.

621
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:40,733
Hence the name, Chwisaengmong.

622
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:42,678
And I'm the bartender here.

623
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:45,543
Today, the deities made an
exception for the two of you...

624
00:58:45,543 --> 00:58:49,242
and gave me permission to
let you have a taste...

625
00:58:49,242 --> 00:58:50,587
of one of your past lives.

626
00:58:51,172 --> 00:58:52,213
"Deities"?

627
00:58:52,213 --> 00:58:55,258
He means he'll impress us
with super delicious drinks.

628
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:58,083
I blacked out last time,
so I don't remember much.

629
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:00,258
This time, I shall drink it
slowly and really savor it.

630
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:01,497
Give us our drinks.

631
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:16,402
This is a petal.

632
00:59:16,402 --> 00:59:18,977
It's a petal from the Moon Tree.

633
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:20,218
The Moon Tree?

634
00:59:20,402 --> 00:59:22,972
There is such a tree?

635
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:24,917
I'm sure there is.

636
00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:27,618
This is so pretty.

637
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,828
Those from that time of
your life are here now.

638
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,098
You'll be able to find out...

639
00:59:38,692 --> 00:59:40,638
more about him through them.

640
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:26,218
Chung Myung.

641
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:41,357
My father is looking for you.

642
01:00:42,152 --> 01:00:43,897
Why is he looking for me?

643
01:00:43,922 --> 01:00:46,422
We received a tip that you are in league...

644
01:00:46,422 --> 01:00:48,567
with the rebels in Mount Dongmo.

645
01:00:53,463 --> 01:00:55,778
You will die if you go see my father now.

646
01:00:55,972 --> 01:00:58,008
So I sent some soldiers.

647
01:00:59,472 --> 01:01:02,517
I told them to go capture everyone
helping the one you're waiting for.

648
01:01:03,072 --> 01:01:05,012
What do you mean?

649
01:01:05,012 --> 01:01:07,317
Those bandits are remnants of Goguryeo.

650
01:01:07,382 --> 01:01:09,683
If you capture all of them
and take them to my father,

651
01:01:09,683 --> 01:01:11,158
he will no longer suspect you.

652
01:01:12,483 --> 01:01:15,992
They're just wandering thieves
that steal from peddlers.

653
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:18,198
If you are executed as a traitor,

654
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:20,163
all your subordinates...

655
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:23,408
as well as everyone who is
related to you will die.

656
01:01:24,632 --> 01:01:26,207
Even if there are hundreds of people,

657
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,247
my father will kill them all
as he is afraid of a coup.

658
01:01:32,643 --> 01:01:34,317
Go and capture them all.

659
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:41,547
Just catch the ones that stole.

660
01:02:41,742 --> 01:02:43,647
Why are you taking all
the innocent villagers?

661
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:45,618
I'm not here to catch thieves.

662
01:02:46,112 --> 01:02:47,988
I came to quell the rebels.

663
01:02:48,282 --> 01:02:49,388
What?

664
01:02:49,512 --> 01:02:51,928
I'll try my best to help you so
that you can survive as a slave.

665
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:53,922
But for me to do that,

666
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:56,167
all your men must be killed as rebels.

667
01:02:56,893 --> 01:02:58,127
Why...

668
01:02:58,963 --> 01:03:00,567
Why are you doing this?

669
01:03:03,632 --> 01:03:06,178
I wanted to find a way
to join hands with you.

670
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:10,333
I wished to go to the new country...

671
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:11,477
in Mount Dongmo...

672
01:03:12,442 --> 01:03:13,948
with you.

673
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,988
But I got busted.

674
01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:20,988
And now, I must take your lives...

675
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:23,587
to cover it up.

676
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,258
After I bury all of it,

677
01:03:27,282 --> 01:03:29,797
I will pay for what I did with my own life.

678
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:32,437
No, don't.

679
01:03:37,862 --> 01:03:39,178
Just save Man Weol.

680
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:41,433
And to do that,

681
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:44,508
you must live as a traitor instead
of listing all the excuses...

682
01:03:45,342 --> 01:03:46,877
that you gave me.

683
01:03:51,043 --> 01:03:52,618
Then Man Weol will live.

684
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,937
He made a promise to Yeon Woo.

685
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:22,948
He's always been here.

686
01:04:30,052 --> 01:04:33,758
He was the first guest...

687
01:04:34,853 --> 01:04:36,098
that came to the Guest House of the Moon.

688
01:04:39,722 --> 01:04:44,308
You're not the only one who's been
paying for the past sins here...

689
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:47,278
all these years.

690
01:05:31,313 --> 01:05:32,957
Thanks to you, I made a great contribution.

691
01:05:41,222 --> 01:05:42,598
I will kill you.

692
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,698
I will kill you...

693
01:05:47,362 --> 01:05:48,607
at all costs.

694
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,278
If you wish to kill me,

695
01:05:55,802 --> 01:05:57,578
you will have to stay alive.

696
01:07:04,972 --> 01:07:06,448
You will live as a traitor.

697
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:09,317
If you do that, Man Weol will live.

698
01:07:38,503 --> 01:07:39,847
I've been waiting for you.

699
01:07:41,272 --> 01:07:44,887
I hope there won't be any hesitation
as you swing your sword at me.

700
01:07:46,612 --> 01:07:47,788
If so,

701
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,687
I won't hesitate...

702
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:53,897
to throw myself at the sword.

703
01:08:27,652 --> 01:08:29,128
You have never...

704
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:34,198
uttered his name. Not even once.

705
01:08:41,532 --> 01:08:42,948
If you call for him,

706
01:08:44,003 --> 01:08:45,677
he will show himself.

707
01:08:51,473 --> 01:08:53,387
Have you been here the whole time?

708
01:08:59,623 --> 01:09:01,727
If so, show yourself to me.

709
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:06,538
Ko Chung Myung.

710
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:19,278
Tell me if there's anything
else you wish to tell me.

711
01:10:21,463 --> 01:10:22,807
I'll listen to it.

712
01:10:25,373 --> 01:10:27,448
There's no more excuse to tell you.

713
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:31,217
Man Weol.

714
01:10:34,742 --> 01:10:36,628
You told me in your last moment...

715
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:40,028
that you would try to protect me.

716
01:10:45,123 --> 01:10:49,208
As I was chained to the Moon
Tree and full of resentment,

717
01:10:50,432 --> 01:10:52,078
my words chained you here...

718
01:10:55,503 --> 01:10:56,977
and stopped you from leaving.

719
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:09,028
I...

720
01:11:12,253 --> 01:11:13,857
have emptied everything now.

721
01:11:19,263 --> 01:11:21,038
So you should leave now.

722
01:11:24,992 --> 01:11:26,307
This is...

723
01:11:30,402 --> 01:11:31,948
the end for us.

724
01:11:37,742 --> 01:11:38,887
Yes.

725
01:11:41,682 --> 01:11:43,057
It's the end.

726
01:13:12,602 --> 01:13:17,187
His spirit doesn't have the
energy to go to the afterlife.

727
01:13:18,213 --> 01:13:20,757
If we leave him here,
he will cease to exist.

728
01:13:21,942 --> 01:13:24,788
He won't be able to have another life.

729
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:31,198
To avoid that,

730
01:13:33,022 --> 01:13:34,567
you should...

731
01:13:35,562 --> 01:13:36,668
send him off.

732
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:42,708
That is the last act of punishment...

733
01:13:43,373 --> 01:13:45,177
you will face here.

734
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:40,897
Yeong Su.

735
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:45,637
Are you up?

736
01:15:46,822 --> 01:15:50,293
You two got really drunk,
so Mr. Ku told me to escort you home.

737
01:15:50,293 --> 01:15:51,637
So I called a taxi.

738
01:15:52,503 --> 01:15:55,078
Well, you two can go
home on your own, right?

739
01:15:55,873 --> 01:15:57,977
- Yes.
- Goodbye.

740
01:16:04,213 --> 01:16:06,317
Gosh, this again?

741
01:16:07,383 --> 01:16:09,357
When I came to the hotel the other day,

742
01:16:09,553 --> 01:16:11,488
she was the one who sent me home in a taxi.

743
01:16:12,282 --> 01:16:15,597
But this time, I remember up
to drinking the cocktail.

744
01:16:23,032 --> 01:16:24,668
Yeong Su, why are you crying?

745
01:16:24,932 --> 01:16:27,607
I don't know. I feel sad.

746
01:16:29,902 --> 01:16:33,748
Seeing you cry like this
is making me sad too.

747
01:16:36,913 --> 01:16:38,488
This is so weird.

748
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:40,418
I'm right here. Why are you crying?

749
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:42,828
Don't cry.

750
01:16:54,332 --> 01:16:57,107
Does he really have no intention
of reconciling with me?

751
01:17:10,912 --> 01:17:12,926
We met for the first time...

752
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:14,857
on May 2.

753
01:17:41,712 --> 01:17:42,916
I found it.

754
01:17:49,782 --> 01:17:52,897
This watch looks pretty old.

755
01:17:53,021 --> 01:17:55,027
It's over 70 years old.

756
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:57,691
Time on that watch...

757
01:17:57,691 --> 01:18:00,537
has been flowing even when you were alive.

758
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:02,166
These kinds of watches must be rare.

759
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:04,577
It must've been hard to find one.

760
01:18:06,132 --> 01:18:07,277
Thank you.

761
01:18:08,202 --> 01:18:10,317
And I'm sorry.

762
01:18:13,742 --> 01:18:15,471
I wanted to let you know...

763
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:17,481
that you're an old man who
is 70 years older than me.

764
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:19,827
It wasn't easy to get that watch.

765
01:18:20,082 --> 01:18:23,126
So from now on,

766
01:18:23,351 --> 01:18:27,126
even if I look older than
you like your older sister,

767
01:18:27,151 --> 01:18:30,796
don't forget that you are
way older than I am.

768
01:18:34,091 --> 01:18:37,077
Put it on your wrist. I'm
sure it'll look great.

769
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:40,676
Yu Na.

770
01:18:41,172 --> 01:18:44,147
I will leave soon.

771
01:18:46,042 --> 01:18:48,586
I told you that I was waiting
for my sister, Hyun Mi.

772
01:18:50,882 --> 01:18:54,056
Right now, Hyun Mi is very sick.

773
01:18:56,351 --> 01:18:57,796
When she leaves,

774
01:18:58,882 --> 01:19:00,367
I must go with her.

775
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:04,897
Yu Na,

776
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:09,067
when this watch was made,

777
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:12,407
I had already been dead.

778
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:16,046
Time can't run...

779
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:19,817
for the dead and for the living together.

780
01:19:25,681 --> 01:19:27,857
I had died a very long time ago.

781
01:19:32,252 --> 01:19:33,766
It's so upsetting.

782
01:19:55,742 --> 01:19:57,187
I'll see him off.

783
01:19:59,612 --> 01:20:00,886
You'll be back in a jiffy, right?

784
01:20:02,822 --> 01:20:03,997
Of course.

785
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:05,796
I'll be back in a jiffy.

786
01:20:26,912 --> 01:20:28,117
You are coming back, right?

787
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:37,457
Wait for me.

788
01:21:12,851 --> 01:21:18,296
(The Sanzu River, this life, afterlife)

789
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:39,756
(A month later)

790
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:55,907
Ma'am, let me help you

791
01:21:59,771 --> 01:22:00,931
Once you go out to the beach,

792
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:03,542
you can rent any kinds of beach supplies.

793
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:04,771
Let's go.

794
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:06,687
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

795
01:22:14,612 --> 01:22:16,027
It looks like you've made progress.

796
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:18,527
Could you read it for me?

797
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:28,266
It's been a month since Ms. Jang left.

798
01:22:28,492 --> 01:22:30,037
Ms. Jang isn't here.

799
01:22:31,061 --> 01:22:33,306
But how come the hotel hasn't vanished yet?

800
01:22:33,332 --> 01:22:35,301
It means that Ms. Jang is no longer...

801
01:22:35,301 --> 01:22:37,317
the owner of Guest House of the Moon.

802
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:40,346
That's my guess.

803
01:22:44,941 --> 01:22:46,157
Mr. Ku.

804
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,096
I think you should head to the garden.

805
01:22:57,922 --> 01:22:59,136
Yesterday,

806
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:02,207
I saw a few leaves and flowers.

807
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:04,407
But the tree is completely lifeless now.

808
01:23:07,801 --> 01:23:09,147
I guess...

809
01:23:09,771 --> 01:23:12,886
that means Ms. Jang can't
come back for good now.

810
01:23:51,882 --> 01:23:53,327
Wait for me.

811
01:24:09,061 --> 01:24:10,376
Ms. Jang.

812
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:13,876
Come back quickly.

813
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:16,516
I'm getting...

814
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,416
anxious now.

815
01:24:28,212 --> 01:24:31,997
All of us are against having a new owner.

816
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:34,897
Help Ms. Jang return.

817
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:39,537
I'm with them.

818
01:24:40,632 --> 01:24:43,601
It took me 500 years to
get used to Ms. Jang.

819
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:46,107
Having another boss? I'm against it.

820
01:24:48,532 --> 01:24:51,716
It is up to her to return
to this place or not.

821
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:55,147
There's no way she won't come back
when Mr. Ku is waiting for her.

822
01:24:56,742 --> 01:24:58,586
If she set foot on the bridge,

823
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,256
she might have forgotten him.

824
01:26:47,051 --> 01:26:49,426
You can let go of all your
memories of this world...

825
01:26:50,792 --> 01:26:52,796
and cross the bridge...

826
01:26:54,132 --> 01:26:55,966
toward your most distant memories.

827
01:27:05,072 --> 01:27:07,886
Is that why all the flowers wilted?

828
01:27:08,372 --> 01:27:10,957
Then I guess the tree is really dead now.

829
01:27:11,742 --> 01:27:12,857
Right.

830
01:27:14,282 --> 01:27:16,287
All the flowers wilted and disappeared.

831
01:27:17,221 --> 01:27:18,357
I suppose Jang Man Weol...

832
01:27:19,452 --> 01:27:21,426
is really dead now.

833
01:27:28,561 --> 01:27:31,277
Should we be expecting a new owner
of the Guest House of the Moon?

834
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:38,376
The Moon Tree is the owner
of the guest house.

835
01:27:38,771 --> 01:27:42,787
But all the flowers and leaves are gone.
It's dead now.

836
01:28:03,632 --> 01:28:07,207
("The Guys Who Died After Eating")

837
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:16,787
It's piping hot.

838
01:28:17,082 --> 01:28:19,457
But Kim Joon Hyun ate five of this at once.

839
01:28:19,882 --> 01:28:21,556
It was so fascinating.

840
01:28:22,782 --> 01:28:25,397
That's where he sat.

841
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,322
Eat before it gets cold.

842
01:28:27,322 --> 01:28:28,792
(Kim Joon Hyun sat here.)

843
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:29,922
(Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you.)

844
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:32,466
"Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you"?

845
01:28:33,132 --> 01:28:34,231
Are you not happy?

846
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:35,462
Are you professing your love to me?

847
01:28:35,462 --> 01:28:37,707
This is Kim Joon Hyun's autograph.
Here, "Kim Joon Hyun".

848
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:41,147
It's heartbreaking if I remain
only as a flower petal...

849
01:28:42,431 --> 01:28:43,876
that's bound to vanish.

850
01:28:47,771 --> 01:28:50,457
(I'll check out all the good
restaurants in the country!)

851
01:29:47,601 --> 01:29:51,647
Not all of the flowers perished.

852
01:29:56,612 --> 01:29:58,886
There are still some flowers left.

853
01:30:07,551 --> 01:30:09,666
I put the flowers dreaming of the moon...

854
01:30:10,662 --> 01:30:12,666
in there.
