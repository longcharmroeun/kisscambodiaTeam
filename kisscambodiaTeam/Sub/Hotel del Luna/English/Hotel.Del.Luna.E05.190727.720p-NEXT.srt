00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:20,061
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:35,930
Ku Chan Seong.

3
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,273
You shouldn't look.

4
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,597
Don't let her hear your breathing.

5
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,342
But I hear...

6
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:49,070
Don't listen.

7
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,252
What's the matter?

8
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,894
She's a guest that's staying in this room.

9
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,376
You'll go crazy if you see her.

10
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,883
Don't turn around.

11
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,333
Get out of here the moment the door opens.

12
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,661
Go.

13
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,049
Miss.

14
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:44,099
You won't ever be able to
step out of that door.

15
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,078
I apologize for waking you up.

16
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:50,061
Why don't you go back
inside and get some sleep?

17
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,114
I guess the smell of
incense made you go crazy.

18
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,902
You've been locked up in that
closet for such a long time.

19
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,962
And you still get angry
when you see a human being?

20
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,332
Do you want to go outside
and vent your anger again?

21
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,415
You're a guest here.

22
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,226
So I won't force you to go back inside.

23
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,558
You should quietly crawl
back inside on your own.

24
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,502
Ku Chan Seong.

25
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,811
Ku Chan Seong.

26
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,756
Ku Chan Seong.

27
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,550
Ku Chan Seong.

28
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:28,861
Chan Seong.

29
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,602
Ms. Jang?

30
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,231
Chan Seong.

31
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,605
Chan Seong.

32
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,226
Stop being stupid.

33
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,142
You don't know what a coward he is.

34
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,033
No matter how many times you
call him, he won't come back.

35
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,260
Chan Seong?

36
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,932
Ms. Jang.

37
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,899
Was that Mr. Third Choice who ran
out at crazy lightning speed?

38
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,488
Even if you look with one eye
closed, it's not Mr. Ku.

39
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:57,528
I thought so too. The hair
was all loose and wild.

40
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,192
It's the guest in Room 13.

41
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:01,959
She has left the room.

42
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,610
Our plan has failed. This
is a serious predicament.

43
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,711
Chan Seong.

44
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,186
That thing is not here.

45
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:28,880
You can let me go.

46
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,661
You...

47
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,901
you saw it, didn't you?

48
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,601
Just a glimpse.

49
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,187
So have you gone crazy?

50
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,072
I'm not crazy.

51
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,208
I was so frightened that I
can't calm myself down now.

52
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,930
Are you hurt?

53
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,283
Are you all right, Man Weol?

54
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,250
Chan Seong.

55
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,731
Were you scared?

56
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,520
There's nothing wrong with me. I'm fine.

57
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:22,699
Why you...

58
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,218
You've gone a little crazy.

59
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,913
I was just playing around.

60
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,545
Were you really scared?

61
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,288
Then, is it really true
that you go crazy...

62
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,554
if you see that ghost?

63
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:39,453
I thought you said that to scare me.

64
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,118
Yes, it's true.

65
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,869
You've gone only a little crazy
because you got a glimpse of it.

66
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,769
If you had seen it properly, you
would've gone completely crazy.

67
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,790
Really?

68
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,870
She is not here still, right?

69
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,200
She ran away.

70
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,511
I thought you'd take care of it,
but you couldn't even stop it?

71
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,718
Yes. I didn't know some coward
would muster up the courage...

72
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,933
and come running in opening the door wide.

73
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,059
What a fool.

74
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,303
What...

75
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:21,531
Wait for me.

76
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,100
A coward?

77
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,127
Are you calling me a coward?

78
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:33,374
There's no one else here.
You're such a fool.

79
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:36,061
A fool?

80
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,489
Nobody ever called me
that in my whole life.

81
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,089
I have an MBA at Harvard, and world...

82
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,151
Shut up!

83
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,041
That's verbal violence. Please amend it.

84
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,629
- I amend it.
- Are you joking?

85
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,710
- It's a ghost!
- Where?

86
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,921
You are a coward.

87
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,492
Oh my goodness. I thought
there was a ghost.

88
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,978
I must have made a mistake while
burning incense. I apologize.

89
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,413
I'm glad you are safe.

90
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:09,719
Yes...

91
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,359
Ms. Choi, you should take
proper care of the rooms.

92
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,592
That dangerous guest could have
harmed our general manager.

93
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,478
No, I'm sorry for worrying you.

94
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,543
Do you see how I just improvised that?

95
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,778
Mr. Third Choice has absolutely no idea...

96
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,749
that we put him in that room on purpose.

97
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,982
I don't know. You looked rather guilty.

98
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,719
I think Mr. Ku is the fool
for not noticing that.

99
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,790
Even if he is a fool, he will notice
when Ms. Fourth Choice comes.

100
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:52,634
I should tell Hyun Joong to postpone
bringing in Ms. Fourth Choice.

101
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,421
Yu Na, what are you doing?

102
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,871
Get out the way.

103
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,668
- Did you just see Yu Na?
- Yes.

104
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,339
I heard she's possessed by Su
Jung's spirit. I think it's true.

105
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,972
If you call out Su Jung, she looks back.

106
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,568
- Really?
- Really?

107
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,009
- Let's go and see.
- Let's go.

108
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,509
- You call her name.
- She really looks back?

109
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,907
That's so weird.

110
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,541
Su Jung.

111
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,349
It must be true.

112
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,418
- That's so scary.
- It's scary.

113
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,542
- What?
- What is this?

114
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,474
Goodness.

115
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,970
- What?
- What?

116
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,196
- What's happening?
- What is that?

117
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,421
What are you doing?

118
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,839
I didn't want you to get hurt, so
I caught you. It can be painful.

119
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,328
If I got hurt, they would
have looked at me as a human.

120
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,242
Now, they will call me a monster.

121
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:53,401
Hey.

122
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,371
Wait for me.

123
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,724
She's getting mad at me for helping her.

124
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,775
You. How did you catch me?

125
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,331
Ghosts can't catch humans.

126
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,153
I'm not an average ghost.

127
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,811
There are prayer beads and amulets in here.

128
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,408
So get lost, you evil ghost.

129
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,730
My friend.

130
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,042
I'm not a spirit that can be
exorcised by power of religion.

131
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,649
I have the right to stay in this world.

132
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,537
I have a place I belong to,
and I also have a job.

133
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,970
Don't make me laugh. What
kind of ghost has a job?

134
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,439
I'm a hotelier. I'm from Hotel Del Luna.

135
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:35,782
Hotel Del Luna?

136
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,129
You know the owner and general
manager of our hotel, right?

137
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,229
They helped you live in that body.

138
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,850
So what? You want me to
come out from this body?

139
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,164
You are a really precious person.

140
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,765
You're our precious hope.

141
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,930
You are the fourth choice.

142
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:53,363
The fourth choice?

143
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,979
You are the fourth choice nominee
as our hotel's general manager.

144
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,468
Something has happened to Mr.
Third Choice, so I've come...

145
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,219
to take you, as you're the fourth choice.

146
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,228
I don't know what you're talking about.

147
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,353
But you are here because you need me.

148
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,640
Yes.

149
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,793
A ghost even has a mobile phone?

150
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:14,022
Of course. I have a job
so I also have a phone.

151
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,830
I have a right to stay here.

152
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,306
Your school's wifi is good.

153
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,401
Mr. Third Choice is unharmed.
Ms. Fourth Choice will be deferred.

154
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:28,178
Are you saying you don't need me?

155
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,801
For now. But I might be back to take you.

156
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:32,674
So...

157
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,321
keep studying hard at school.

158
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,510
Hey!

159
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,482
Give me your number. I want
to send texts to a ghost.

160
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,249
I've never shared my number with a human.

161
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,867
So you don't want to? You can't?

162
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,000
Forget it then.

163
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,290
Okay. We're now friends.

164
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,641
The general manager of Hotel Del Luna?

165
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,895
Sounds fun.

166
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,200
Right.

167
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,188
Wait...

168
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,474
Mr. Ji?

169
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:47,984
I'm glad to see you still
in your right mind.

170
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,444
Thank you for being genuinely delighted.

171
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,698
It sounds as if you all expected...

172
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,068
me to turn insane in that room.

173
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:59,089
Gosh.

174
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,547
You didn't and that's all that matters.

175
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,818
Ms. Fourth Choice is on standby.

176
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,749
We also discussed...

177
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,269
a couple of other ways to get rid of Mr.
Third Choice.

178
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,188
(Operation Eliminate Mr. Third Choice)

179
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:21,629
First, we can send him to...

180
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,618
the spirit stationed at the
haunted house in Shincheon-gun.

181
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,283
(The Spirit in Shincheon-gun)

182
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,769
30 years is guaranteed...

183
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,677
if he stays clear of the local Grim Reaper.

184
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:42,609
Next, we can use strong vengeful spirit...

185
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,208
to have him meet a sudden death.

186
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,433
(Vengeful Spirit in Uijeongbu)

187
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,911
He's an experienced killer
operating in Uijeongbu.

188
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,158
Since he's close by, we can easily...

189
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,261
No, just drop it.

190
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,725
Ku Chan Seong isn't leaving.

191
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,230
I'm keeping him by my side.

192
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,899
What if the tree keeps transforming?

193
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,592
Ma Go sent him here on purpose.

194
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,708
You must drive him out.

195
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,379
If he was really sent by a deity,

196
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,418
then just chasing him out
won't solve anything.

197
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,909
What if flowers blossom?

198
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,041
Flowers?

199
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,041
Let them blossom.

200
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,658
Will colorful flowers blossom...

201
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,199
and make me walk across the Sanzu River?

202
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,054
We'll wait and see.

203
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,379
Do you think she's had a change of heart...

204
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,215
and is ready to move on?

205
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,676
No, she's probably doubtful of...

206
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,719
flowers actually blossoming.

207
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,188
If that was the case,

208
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:58,179
she shouldn't have agreed
to letting him in Room 13.

209
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,657
Her and her mood swings.

210
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,806
I'm just glad that Mr. Ku
isn't the perceptive type.

211
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,905
It'll be awkward if he figures out
that we led him there on purpose.

212
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:15,009
You made me go there on
purpose, didn't you?

213
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,749
You wanted me to die or lose my mind.

214
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,757
You're not as dumb as I thought.
You're right.

215
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:22,867
Everyone's disappointed
that you didn't go crazy.

216
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,482
How can you all do this to me?

217
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,984
I truly thought of you as my colleagues...

218
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,733
and was going to consider you as friends.

219
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,228
Isn't this considered as harassment?

220
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:39,258
So? Are you here to tattle on them?

221
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,228
Should I give them an earful?

222
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,544
What's the point when you were in on it?

223
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,629
You always ask questions even
though you know the answer.

224
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,773
What a weirdo.

225
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,801
Wait.

226
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,833
Where did it go?

227
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,052
Ku Chan Seong, I'm missing an earring.

228
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,819
Check the floor for me.

229
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,640
Seriously?

230
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,738
Just let it slide. They're
simply jealous...

231
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,908
because you're still
alive when they're not.

232
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,399
How dumb do you think I am?

233
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,206
What was this really about?

234
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,546
The tree has changed after you arrived.

235
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,242
We're worried that our
time to leave is near.

236
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,359
Why did you save me though?

237
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,569
If you hadn't, I would've gone crazy.

238
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,476
I wasn't going to intervene,

239
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,706
but a leaf changed my mind.

240
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,161
A leaf?

241
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,978
- This one?
- Yes.

242
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:06,142
A part in me as small as
that made me change my mind.

243
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:10,740
Are you saying...

244
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:13,628
I won you over by this much?

245
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:15,663
You're doing it again!

246
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,399
Asking questions when
you know the answer...

247
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,299
Do they teach you that at Harvard?

248
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,399
Asking questions to induce an answer
can lead to determining the truth.

249
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,235
It's a known method by Socrates.

250
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,639
That's what the professors
at Harvard taught me.

251
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,438
But this isn't Harvard,

252
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,968
so just get back to finding my earring.

253
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,738
Is finding it worth another leaf?

254
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:34,801
Why you...

255
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,279
Don't bother looking for it.

256
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,085
Find it and I'll kill you.

257
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,477
You say you'll kill me
but you don't mean it.

258
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,003
You say you won't find it but you want to.

259
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,685
You're not the generous type but
your words are more cynical.

260
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,428
Is that how all ghosts get old with age?

261
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,029
No, I was born this way.

262
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,938
I've always been cynical.

263
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,449
Did you not catch that in your dream?

264
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,639
You were nice and kind.

265
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,546
Me? Seriously?

266
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,161
Yes, you cared for him with affection.

267
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:11,377
His name was Yeon Woo, I think.

268
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,646
So you saw him too.

269
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:26,949
I did.

270
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,720
Yeon Woo!

271
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,946
You called his name with love...

272
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,528
which is why it got stuck in my head.

273
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,200
Why?

274
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,182
Do you think you could be him?

275
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,740
The thought briefly crossed my mind,

276
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,732
but it doesn't seem likely.

277
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,921
Yeon Woo...

278
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,620
is the one who loved me the most.

279
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,796
So do you love me too?

280
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,286
I'm certain that I don't.

281
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:37,821
Leave then.

282
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,962
Yeon Woo...

283
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,671
Man Weol.

284
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:35,591
With this tree you love,

285
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,261
I'll build the biggest house
that has ever existed before.

286
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,583
You can then have it.

287
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,550
What?

288
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,208
You'll build a house with this tree for me?

289
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,635
Forget it. I don't intend to
live with you in that house.

290
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:52,809
You'll grow older soon which means...

291
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,472
you should put down roots.

292
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,607
I can't let an old lady
to live under a tarp.

293
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:03,054
This is a life where you could be
captured and killed the next day.

294
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:08,119
I don't even expect to live until I'm old.

295
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,486
But you can.

296
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,956
The fortune teller said...

297
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,710
that I'll live a long
life just like this tree.

298
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:17,504
I'm expected to live 100 years,

299
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,906
so I'll give you my extra years.

300
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,288
If you do, you'll die.

301
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,561
You're right.

302
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,732
It's okay though.

303
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,317
I don't mind dying for you,

304
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,870
so you can have it all.

305
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,619
This will find a human groom...

306
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,833
for your dead daughter.

307
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,768
Whoever finds the red pocket...

308
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,371
that holds the deceased's desires...

309
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,638
shall be her spirit's partner.

310
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,870
I hope a good man finds that pocket.

311
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,040
Su Min.

312
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,987
We're getting you married
so you don't get lonely.

313
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,950
No!

314
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,369
I don't want to get married to a stranger.

315
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,618
You're getting off early today.

316
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,510
Yes, I'm a bit tired.

317
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,689
Well, you're the type who makes the work.

318
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,988
It is my job to tend to the guests...

319
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:27,488
as a hotelier.

320
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,221
I guess you've changed your mindset.

321
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,391
I thought you hated our hotel.

322
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,594
I opened...

323
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:38,591
my heart to someone.

324
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,011
I'm actually a bit of a softie,

325
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,080
so I tend to repay favors
by ten times the amount.

326
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,079
- Sorry?
- That means if you're nice to me,

327
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,507
I'll treat you really well.

328
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,250
So please be nice to me.

329
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,609
Did he figure anything out?
What did he say?

330
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,226
He used sarcasm to threaten me.

331
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,690
He said he repays favors
by ten times the amount.

332
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,226
I knew Ma Go wouldn't bring a pushover.

333
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,207
Are you visiting the hotel, ma'am?

334
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:38,552
Please help me.

335
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:44,826
Are you all right, ma'am?

336
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,371
Do you think this is the hotel lobby?

337
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,539
Why do you keep leading the
guests to my office...

338
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,008
instead of their rooms?

339
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,438
She has her reasons.

340
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,653
Every ghost has their reasons.

341
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,865
And what's wrong with her? Is she drunk?

342
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:02,091
She's exhausted from
roaming around too much.

343
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,518
Ma'am. Ma'am? Please don't
act like this to our staff.

344
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,642
I'm all right.

345
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,304
Fine, then. Go ahead and hug her tight.

346
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:21,653
She's being forced into a marriage.

347
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,489
She doesn't want to get married
to a complete stranger...

348
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,208
and she doesn't want to cause a
nuisance to a living person...

349
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:27,464
by getting him possessed.

350
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,613
Is it a ghost wedding?

351
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,819
It's only meant for those left behind,

352
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,289
why don't you just go along with it?

353
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:48,361
You can go up to your room
and think it over again.

354
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,536
Our hotel even has a wedding hall.

355
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,317
If you pay the price, we can
even hold a party for you.

356
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:55,851
Go ahead and think about it.

357
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,886
Why don't you go up to your room?

358
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,901
This won't do. Excuse me.

359
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,250
Gosh...

360
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,093
Ku Chan Seong.

361
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,797
I see you're strong enough to carry her.

362
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:37,641
And you used a wheelbarrow meant
for cabbages to carry me.

363
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,655
A ghost wedding...

364
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:07,451
That guest was wearing fine cotton flannel.

365
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,417
That means she's from a rich family.

366
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:14,402
- Get ready for the wedding.
- Yes, ma'am.

367
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:17,673
Then I'll need to get a new dress.

368
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:20,881
And I'll need new jewelry too.

369
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:23,104
Shoes, a purse,

370
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,456
and what else will I need?

371
00:30:25,232 --> 00:30:27,517
Gosh, there's so much to prepare.

372
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:31,642
Ku Chan Seong...

373
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:35,518
better hurry up and get that money
for the Mount Baekdu painting.

374
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:14,737
Good morning!

375
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,683
Good morning, Sanchez.

376
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:18,003
You're up?

377
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:19,933
I guess you got some sleep last night.

378
00:31:20,252 --> 00:31:23,077
Yes, I slept well. I
didn't even dream, either.

379
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:26,194
Maybe it was because I was tired.

380
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:28,940
Why? Did you buy a lottery
ticket to get lucky?

381
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:32,219
No, I was expecting someone in my dreams.

382
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:33,755
Your ex-girlfriend?

383
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:38,302
The ex-boyfriend of a girl I know.

384
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:40,235
Or her ex-boyfriends.

385
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:44,176
It's not a dream, but you
missed a call from a friend.

386
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:45,364
"A friend"?

387
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:48,150
- Who?
- Man Weol.

388
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,959
- Who?
- Man Weol, from your hotel.

389
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:55,235
Your phone kept ringing,
so I just answered it.

390
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,562
Man Weol...

391
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:59,245
told me to ask you when you'd
get the money for the painting.

392
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:01,154
Sanchez,

393
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:05,331
did you really call her
by her name, Man Weol?

394
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:07,845
Didn't she get mad and yell at you?

395
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:12,273
She agreed to just call me by my name too.

396
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:14,971
We're even following each
other on our social media.

397
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:17,582
You know what? She's actually...

398
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,612
quite friendly and polite. Right?

399
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:22,341
Maybe it's because of her job?

400
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,488
It seemed like she's
used to being friendly.

401
00:32:30,962 --> 00:32:34,910
She must have known that
Sanchez is really rich.

402
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:38,392
That's why he was unharmed.

403
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:44,193
"Man Weol"?

404
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:47,002
- Put it right there.
- Yes, ma'am.

405
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:50,069
Ji Hyun Joong, did you say you
know how to play the piano?

406
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:52,249
- Practice.
- Yes, ma'am.

407
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:55,082
It's been so long since we had a
party that I'm getting excited.

408
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,281
It's better to have many
guests for the party,

409
00:32:57,282 --> 00:33:00,005
so should I invited some
guests who are free?

410
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:02,592
Would it seem like a wedding...

411
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:05,275
if there are tons of ghosts in here?
It'll seem like a funeral.

412
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:07,320
Make it simple.

413
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:10,931
Yes, ma'am. Have we
decided on the groom yet?

414
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:13,872
If an unlucky human finds that red pocket,

415
00:33:13,873 --> 00:33:15,229
he'll be the groom, I suppose.

416
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:18,840
The bride doesn't seem to
want an arranged marriage.

417
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:20,412
Mr. Ku went to find the red pocket...

418
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:21,971
so he could return it to her parents...

419
00:33:21,972 --> 00:33:23,604
and convince them to change their minds.

420
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:26,845
There won't be a wedding if he finds
it before anyone else, right?

421
00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:32,551
Chan Seong left to find the red pocket?

422
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,684
Yes, he's very diligent, so he's
probably looking for it already.

423
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:39,220
If he finds it, it'll cause trouble.

424
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:40,813
Why?

425
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,926
Will he become the groom...

426
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:48,867
if he finds it first?

427
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:51,002
He started to care so much for the ghosts,

428
00:33:51,003 --> 00:33:52,676
and now he's going to get married to one.

429
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:55,341
The bride didn't want to get
married to a complete stranger.

430
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:58,042
But I bet she'll be okay
with marrying Mr. Ku.

431
00:33:58,043 --> 00:33:59,614
That's good news, Ms. Jang.

432
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:06,206
Ms. Jang, are you going
to let him get married?

433
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:07,342
Darn you!

434
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:30,765
I heard the red pocket fell
somewhere near the lake.

435
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:40,843
Chan Seong, you're still searching?

436
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:44,014
What are you looking for?
I'll help you find it.

437
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:45,343
No, it's okay.

438
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:47,729
Don't mind me. You can
keep riding your bike.

439
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:48,733
You should ride another lap.

440
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,293
It's going to rain soon.

441
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:53,431
Then I'll go for one more lap.
Let's go home once I'm done.

442
00:34:53,432 --> 00:34:54,452
Okay.

443
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:21,383
What are you doing here?

444
00:35:21,963 --> 00:35:23,187
Can't you see?

445
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:25,128
I'm on a picnic.

446
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:27,825
Why are you on a picnic? It's hot outside.

447
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:30,993
Fine.

448
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:34,872
Let me answer the question that
you already know the answer to.

449
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:36,576
I'm here to see you.

450
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:39,362
I don't want you to look
for that red pocket.

451
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:40,632
Just leave it.

452
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:43,272
Are you worried I might have
to get married if I find that?

453
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,091
Chan Seong, I'm against this marriage.

454
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,592
I can't accept it.

455
00:35:50,722 --> 00:35:52,222
Just let some other guy pick it up.

456
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:54,805
She doesn't want to marry
someone she doesn't know.

457
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,401
Whoever picks it up will get startled.
If I find it,

458
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:58,932
you'll take care of it for me.

459
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:04,817
You think I'll have your back? Is
that why you're being stubborn?

460
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,437
Are you using that to find it?

461
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:17,576
Can you tell where it is?

462
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:26,309
I see it. I see it.

463
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:30,924
What's wrong with the bike?

464
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:51,274
I've found it.

465
00:36:52,623 --> 00:36:56,234
Chan Seong, you'll get to eat
at your friend's wedding.

466
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:07,762
Sanchez!

467
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:29,345
What is this?

468
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,204
Sanchez!

469
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:39,882
Where is he?

470
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,415
Sanchez, are you okay?

471
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:04,644
I don't know if it's because of
the rain, but it's really cold.

472
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:07,151
And this could also be because of the rain,

473
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:09,029
but I saw something really weird.

474
00:39:10,492 --> 00:39:12,807
Chan Seong, I saw a strange woman...

475
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:15,226
at our place earlier.

476
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:19,074
And I think she's still here.
I'm so scared.

477
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,253
What should I do?

478
00:39:20,972 --> 00:39:22,024
Sanchez.

479
00:39:31,713 --> 00:39:33,518
You should go inside and get some sleep.

480
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:34,905
Let me figure this out.

481
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:44,583
Hello?

482
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:47,448
Are you Mr. Ku, the general
manager at Hotel Del Luna?

483
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,384
Yes, that's me.

484
00:39:50,402 --> 00:39:52,062
I got a call from that hotel...

485
00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:54,725
saying they'd like to hold a
wedding for our daughter.

486
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:12,409
Did you say you got a call
from the owner of our hotel?

487
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:15,013
Yes.

488
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,876
Are you here because of this?

489
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:31,803
I didn't know there was a
hotel like this in Seoul.

490
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:37,767
Welcome.

491
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:41,276
I see that our general manager
safely brought you here.

492
00:40:42,012 --> 00:40:46,889
Let's start discussing
your daughter's wedding.

493
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,183
Come this way.

494
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:55,687
This is where the wedding will take place.

495
00:40:55,793 --> 00:40:57,975
We'll prepare a banquet...

496
00:40:58,262 --> 00:41:01,568
and provide a suite for her
just like any other wedding.

497
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:06,230
Then our daughter won't end
up dying a lonely soul.

498
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:09,432
Please provide the best of everything.

499
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:11,043
We're doing this for our child.

500
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:13,701
We'll pay and give you
everything that's necessary.

501
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:17,924
By the way, who's the groom?

502
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:21,151
You're forcing him to get
married against his own will.

503
00:41:21,652 --> 00:41:25,293
Don't you think you'd feel
uneasy about meeting the groom?

504
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,335
Are you going to congratulate
him or something?

505
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:31,104
Then I guess it'd be best not to meet him.

506
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:33,109
We'll entrust you with everything.

507
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:36,863
We'll do our best to prepare a wedding...

508
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:38,568
that will satisfy everyone.

509
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:51,122
I knew they'd be rich.

510
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:53,668
This is a black card that has no limit.

511
00:41:54,923 --> 00:41:58,431
Parents really have no limit when
it comes to loving their kids.

512
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:01,621
I love it.

513
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:06,875
What are you planning to do?

514
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:10,233
I'm going to prepare a wedding.

515
00:42:11,373 --> 00:42:13,341
Sanchez got really shocked.

516
00:42:13,342 --> 00:42:14,511
He's practically stupefied.

517
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:17,094
It's because he's weak-hearted.

518
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:18,982
That's why we should hold a wedding...

519
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:20,645
and make her leave as soon as possible.

520
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:24,112
Is Sanchez really going to be
okay once the wedding's over?

521
00:42:24,682 --> 00:42:26,253
Yes.

522
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,896
It's not like they're going
to register their marriage.

523
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:31,819
Just think of it as a short nightmare.

524
00:42:33,893 --> 00:42:36,662
There's so much to prepare.
We should get busy.

525
00:42:36,663 --> 00:42:38,499
Chan Seong, let's hurry.

526
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:46,081
I wonder if this is
really going to be okay.

527
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:01,636
I need to go to the bathroom so bad.

528
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:05,331
I'm about to burst, but I'm so
scared to go to the bathroom.

529
00:43:05,722 --> 00:43:07,365
Why isn't Chan Seong coming home?

530
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:13,885
Actually, no.

531
00:43:14,402 --> 00:43:17,055
It's okay. I can do it. I can do it.

532
00:44:16,132 --> 00:44:17,861
I thought it was an emergency.
Did you call me to go shopping?

533
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:20,759
It's a wedding, after all.
It should look sparkly.

534
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:33,480
Are we here to buy their wedding gifts?

535
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:36,728
Is it necessary for this wedding?

536
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:38,219
This one looks nice too.

537
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,158
Why do we only have 10 fingers?

538
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:42,760
I wish I could put on more than 10.

539
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,799
Are we here to buy your rings?

540
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,698
You told me this is an
emergency related to Sanchez.

541
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:49,698
This is no time to look at rings.

542
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:52,158
I got my hands on a credit
card without a limit.

543
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,100
If you're going to nag, wait
outside while eating bread.

544
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:09,318
I only have 1 neck, so I
can only wear 1 necklace.

545
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,635
These days, it's a trend
to wear several necklaces.

546
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,895
I like that.

547
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:15,684
Bring me some more.

548
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:22,069
Her parents didn't give you a
credit card to spend on yourself.

549
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,620
It's meant to be used for the wedding.

550
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:27,148
Exactly. I'm using their
money for the wedding.

551
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:31,779
Her parents will feel more relieved...

552
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,412
the more money I use.

553
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,478
Did you arrange the wedding
so you could do this?

554
00:45:36,479 --> 00:45:38,719
I'll return the credit card
and burn up the pocket.

555
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,748
Go ahead.

556
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:41,489
If you do that, your friend...

557
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,386
will have to live the rest
of his life with a ghost.

558
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,250
The red pocket encompasses a strong desire.

559
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,399
That desire tied the two of them
together with a red thread...

560
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,969
so that they're forced to be together.

561
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,569
If you burn the pocket,

562
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,018
the bride will never get
to go to the afterlife.

563
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:00,538
Can't you just cut their tie?

564
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:03,161
I'm not the almighty. Do
you know how hard that is?

565
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,448
We'll just have them get married,

566
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:07,152
then send the bride to the afterlife.

567
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,115
That's what our hotel can do.

568
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,831
Ma'am, please come to
this side to take a look.

569
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,444
Show me this one.

581
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:15,841
Ma'am.

582
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:23,019
You're really here.

583
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,551
Who are you?

584
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,421
I'm...

585
00:47:30,269 --> 00:47:32,004
I'm Ku Chan Seong from Hotel Del Luna.

586
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,899
You told me to come to this
address to look for you...

587
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,430
when we met on the subway.

588
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:43,037
That wasn't me.

589
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:45,510
That was my eldest sister.

590
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,618
Hey!

591
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,237
The weather outside is amazing!

592
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,810
Who are you?

593
00:47:56,659 --> 00:48:00,373
He came from Hotel Del Luna
to find our eldest sister.

594
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:03,029
Hotel Del Luna?

595
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,957
Our sister goes there often
to pick flowers, doesn't she?

596
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:08,572
Are you twins?

597
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,184
I mean, triplets?

598
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,560
There are more than three of us.

599
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:21,601
Why are you asking for our sister anyway?

600
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:31,928
There will be a ghost
wedding at Hotel Del Luna?

601
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:35,129
The bride doesn't want a
wedding she never asked for,

602
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,036
and the groom is shivering in fear.

603
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:38,324
Is there a way to fix this?

604
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,098
Like what your boss said,

605
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:44,239
it'd be best to do the ceremony...

606
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,370
to keep the living safe.

607
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,034
I guess we don't have a choice
but to hold the wedding.

608
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,373
I know! We could switch the groom.

609
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,248
Instead of someone living,

610
00:48:56,249 --> 00:48:59,584
you could find someone dead as her groom.

611
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,359
Where are we going to find a dead groom?

612
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,072
You have a lot of customers at your hotel.

613
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,198
You're right.

614
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:10,322
Right?

615
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,432
The bride can choose the groom she likes...

616
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,580
to give the red pocket.

617
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:19,408
The two spirits can get together...

618
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:22,739
and head over to the
afterlife, holding hands.

619
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,688
Yes, I'll try that.

620
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:26,687
Thank you. I'll get going.

621
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,711
Hey.

622
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,832
You must be tired from working at night.

623
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:38,855
You probably can't sleep well.

624
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:42,655
Try drinking this. It'll help.

625
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:49,963
It's herbal tea.

626
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:51,263
Thank you.

627
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:02,125
My sister must like you.

628
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,739
That's precious medicine.

629
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:09,058
You'll feel energetic
even from a short nap.

630
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,213
Really?

631
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:12,883
Thank you.

632
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,020
Great.

633
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,439
I narrowed it down to customers
who died before getting married.

634
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,491
Okay.

635
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:26,272
I better visit them one by one
to ask if they're interested.

636
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:28,215
Let's start with Room 507.

637
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,174
I'm sorry to interrupt when you're resting.

638
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,474
Are you interested in
going on a blind date?

639
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,759
We'll now start the date
between bride Lee Su Min...

640
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,351
and her five prospect grooms.

641
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:53,399
Why are you sitting there?

642
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,368
Because I want to get married too.

643
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:57,469
Employees can't participate. Get back here.

644
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,470
What?

645
00:50:58,471 --> 00:50:59,735
Get over here.

646
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,060
What?

647
00:51:01,479 --> 00:51:04,279
I even got changed for this.
This is unfair.

648
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,350
We'll start over again.

649
00:51:06,449 --> 00:51:08,897
Due to the time limit, we'll make it short.

650
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,649
Please greet each other while
the hourglass is running.

651
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,388
Tell her about what you
did when you were alive.

652
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:16,379
I hope you'll get to have
sincere conversations.

653
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,460
Gosh, Chan Seong is wasting his time again.

654
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,078
At least, the bride will
get to marry a groom...

655
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:39,221
whom she can connect better with.

656
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,988
I don't know. I doubt there
will be a man the bride likes.

657
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,020
I like this one.

658
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:57,268
As you might have noticed,

659
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:58,428
my friend has a weak heart...

660
00:51:58,429 --> 00:51:59,939
and won't be able to do the ceremony.

661
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,969
You should choose one of them to
leave for the afterlife together.

662
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,805
It's the best I can do for you.

663
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,018
Please make sure to keep time, everyone.

664
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:21,131
We'll start with the table number one.

665
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,828
Please give the red pocket
to the person you like.

666
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,181
Let's begin.

667
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:09,691
Please take it.

668
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,987
If I have a wedding with other
guys, I must go with them.

669
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,639
I want to go alone.

670
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,165
I want you, a human, to
take it so I can do that.

671
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,200
But...

672
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:25,888
If you don't want to, I'll just
stick to the original plan.

673
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:27,827
Please bring your friend.

674
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:58,171
What?

675
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,363
Whom did she pick as her husband again?

676
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,589
She said she wants to have
a wedding with Mr. Ku.

677
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:04,888
Mr. Ku accepted it,

678
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:06,888
so the bride and the groom
are getting ready now.

679
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:12,358
Will you be the officiant?

680
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,529
Ji Hyun Joong.

681
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,845
Go to Ms. Fourth Choice right now.

682
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,190
Why?

683
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:20,769
Are you going to send Mr. Ku...

684
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,720
to the afterlife together with the bride?

685
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:42,367
I don't even know what I'm doing now.

686
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:50,026
Okay. Let's just think this is a dream.

687
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,408
This is just a meaningless dream.

688
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:54,214
Everything will be gone once I wake up.

689
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,040
All right.

690
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:13,262
I'm just going to have a short dream.

691
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,760
Ms. Jang, are you getting married?

692
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:27,461
What are you saying?

693
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:29,853
Aren't you the one that is getting married?

694
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,549
(Groom's room)

695
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:40,094
I guess I actually had a dream just now.

696
00:56:40,249 --> 00:56:41,341
Chan Seong.

697
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,929
How dare you decide to get
married without my permission?

698
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,873
Why do I need your permission
when I'm the one getting married?

699
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:50,584
So are you actually going to marry her?

700
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:53,228
This is why you should have
helped her when she came to you,

701
00:56:53,229 --> 00:56:54,893
saying she didn't want to get married.

702
00:56:57,769 --> 00:56:59,708
Do you think she doesn't
want to get married?

703
00:57:00,369 --> 00:57:04,042
No way. She's a ghost that is
mad about getting married.

704
00:57:08,909 --> 00:57:11,122
The desperate wish sealed here...

705
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,149
belongs to that woman
who must get married...

706
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,271
before she leaves.

707
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,180
But...

708
00:57:31,269 --> 00:57:34,196
What a beautiful bride.

709
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,131
I heard there's a wedding in
Hotel Del Luna, and I came by.

710
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:50,467
This is my wedding gift for the bride.

711
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:03,449
You get married to become happy.

712
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,860
Chan Seong.

713
00:58:13,769 --> 00:58:15,647
I'll save you again.

714
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:17,834
You don't have to have
the unwanted wedding.

715
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,271
Then what do I do with this? You
said this can't be removed.

716
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:24,569
We should let her have a
wedding as she wishes.

717
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:28,887
I'm going to bring her real husband...

718
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,726
whom she can never leave behind.

719
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:47,878
This lady is your girlfriend, right?

720
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,296
Your girlfriend is marrying some other guy.

721
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:58,434
Hey, that's not funny.

722
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,459
I'm not kidding. If you
want to stop the wedding,

723
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,091
you need to go marry her.

724
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,701
I brought the groom...

725
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:29,925
that you actually want to marry.

726
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:35,879
We have such a great
customer service, don't we?

727
00:59:37,059 --> 00:59:38,864
It looks like you can finally marry...

728
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:41,839
the person you could never get over.

729
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,890
You must be...

730
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:48,199
very happy.

731
00:59:54,479 --> 00:59:55,825
He should be here any minute now.

732
01:00:55,269 --> 01:00:56,321
Su Min.

733
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,813
When the wedding is over,

734
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:14,479
the man will die.

735
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,190
The bride will take her man
to the afterlife with her.

736
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:33,545
I wonder if Chan Seong noticed.

737
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:56,112
That's why the man's parents
tried to marry her off...

738
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:58,088
with anyone through a ghost wedding.

739
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,583
The man's parents? They
weren't the bride's parents?

740
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,276
It was the man's parents who
requested to hold the wedding.

741
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,210
They were afraid the woman
would take their son with her.

742
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,438
Su Min is dead.

743
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:19,089
I can't let you go with her.

744
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:33,190
Why... Why won't it come off?

745
01:03:34,289 --> 01:03:38,248
Su Min, please let my son go. Please...

746
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:40,939
Please let him go!

747
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:14,318
Ms. Lee, stop. You shouldn't do this.

748
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:35,618
Let's be together forever.

749
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,589
Ms. Lee, he's still alive.

750
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,933
Stop right now!

751
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:56,200
Ms. Lee!

752
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:21,321
No.

753
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,892
We must stop.

754
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:29,731
Go back.

755
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,303
What's the matter, Su Min?

756
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:34,600
Go!

757
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,810
Su Min.

758
01:07:18,149 --> 01:07:20,719
You'll need to make a bigger decision...

759
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,953
to let go than to hold on.

760
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,111
I love you.

761
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,546
Please be happy.

762
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:45,116
This place looks cooler than I imagined.

763
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,969
I'll start working as the
general manager right away.

764
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:49,368
You can't yet. We have Mr. Ku Chan Seong.

765
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:51,032
Then I'll be the intern for now.

766
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:53,103
Let me start training as an intern.

767
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:58,210
Listen, friend. It's getting late.

768
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:01,886
You should go home to sleep so
you can go to school tomorrow.

769
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,400
Hey.

770
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:06,242
Hey.

771
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,244
I'm sorry I used you in such a vulgar way.

772
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:21,469
I'm sure you didn't survive
since the Tang Dynasty...

773
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:22,724
to be used that way.

774
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:26,520
Mi Ra.

775
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:31,100
It's been a while. I'm
here to see Chan Seong.

776
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,111
Thank you for helping me cut
the tie before my departure.

777
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:43,360
I hope your trip will be comfortable.

778
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:53,143
Those scissors are from the
third crone, isn't it?

779
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:56,298
Did she come to my hotel
without me knowing?

780
01:11:56,829 --> 01:11:59,073
He's the one who went to see Ma Go.

781
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:03,339
Now are the crones helping
Chan Seong together?

782
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,757
You're the one that Ma Go is helping.

783
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,348
He'll be the one to see you off.

784
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:28,171
At the previous hotel, I felt
proud to see the customers off,

785
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:31,415
but I feel lonely here.

786
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,137
That's because you won't
ever see them again.

787
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:39,719
Chan Seong.

788
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,598
You're doing a good job.

789
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,940
Ma Go did well by choosing you.

790
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:47,693
You deserve the love you get.

791
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:51,046
Did you know I met with her?

792
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:58,257
She told me to take good care of you...

793
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:00,791
so that leaves will grow...

794
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:02,842
and flowers will bloom.

795
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,310
You.

796
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:11,938
Do you still see me in your dreams?

797
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:33,941
Yes.

798
01:14:38,289 --> 01:14:40,473
Keep on taking good care
of me in your dreams,

799
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:42,752
then...

800
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:45,191
try to see me off.

801
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:47,553
That's what Ma Go wants.

802
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:56,780
I'll become your last customer...

803
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,821
because I like you.

804
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:11,339
Ku Chan Seong.

805
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,086
When you see me off,

806
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:19,892
don't feel lonely.

807
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:24,154
(Hotel Del Luna)

808
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,910
No one's picking up the phone.

809
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,249
What did you say?

810
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,518
Your Majesty!

811
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:30,888
He was dressed like a king
from the Joseon Dynasty.

812
01:16:30,889 --> 01:16:32,042
Which king is he?

813
01:16:33,019 --> 01:16:34,188
I'm very concerned.

814
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:35,429
Why are you doing this to me?

815
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,571
I can't let you become such a thing.

816
01:16:37,729 --> 01:16:39,361
You could get kicked out at this rate...

817
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:40,499
You're doing a good job.

818
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,264
1, 2, 3, let's go!

819
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:46,499
I hate poverty. I'm going to keep
eating caviar and champaign.

820
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,698
He had a girlfriend?

821
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:49,209
- I have her picture.
- Forget it. Stop talking.

822
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,808
Why are you telling me that?

823
01:16:50,809 --> 01:16:52,065
Is she pretty?
