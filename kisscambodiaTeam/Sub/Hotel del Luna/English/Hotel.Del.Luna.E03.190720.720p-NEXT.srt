00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:20,245
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,218
Are you alive?

3
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,112
Or are you dead?

4
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:30,980
I'm just...

5
00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:34,681
here.

6
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,144
I'm neither alive...

7
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:42,680
nor dead.

8
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:44,931
I'm just stuck.

9
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:48,318
I'm confined in a time zone...

10
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:51,729
that can't ever be turned back.

11
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:11,748
Let's go!

12
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:53,859
No!

13
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:00,925
You're the one that led
the group, aren't you?

14
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,161
You're the ringleader.

15
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:41,698
Hey.

16
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,383
You guys are thieves from
Gaori Village, aren't you?

17
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,710
That means you're a nomad from Goguryeo.

18
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,002
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?

19
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,393
- Hey!
- Shut it.

20
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,475
I'm also from the same place.
Hello, brother.

21
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,003
Or should I call you "sister"?

22
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:03,320
"Sister"?

23
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:05,190
Sister.

24
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,429
Why don't you let me free now?

25
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,218
I'm just a low class
officer who's in charge...

26
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,515
of escorting my superiors.

27
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,933
So you won't earn much money
by holding me hostage.

28
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,441
- I know how I'm going to get money.
- What?

29
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,366
The noble lady who didn't even care
about losing her silk bundle...

30
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:41,873
seemed to care very dearly
about something else.

31
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:59,766
It seems you didn't just
escort the lady's travels.

32
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:04,699
I talked with her a few times so
she wouldn't be bored on her way.

33
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:06,767
But since I'm such a good looking guy...

34
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:09,298
It seems it came to this
when I only talked with her.

35
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,070
Then your face must be
worth ample sum of money.

36
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:18,805
Can't I talk you into letting me go?

37
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,474
If my hands and feet were free,

38
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,985
I could persuade her much better.

39
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:30,929
If I cut off your tongue
for talking nonsense,

40
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:34,797
will the price for your face fall?

41
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:38,261
How can you say such a scary thing?

42
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,022
Darn.

43
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,590
Pull me up.

44
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:23,738
What are you doing? Can't you hear me?

45
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,809
How can I help you when
you're just talking?

46
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:29,432
If my hands and feet were free,
I could help you better.

47
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,234
Throw me your sword.

48
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:36,971
Don't move. If you move,
you'll be sucked in faster.

49
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:41,742
Throw me your sword.

50
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:13,554
Where... where are you going?

51
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:15,483
Come back!

52
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:46,170
Pull it.

53
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:49,980
Quickly!

54
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:07,066
You're my hostage now.

55
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:09,949
Price on myself would be much higher...

56
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:13,093
than the price on a low
class warrior's face.

57
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:20,476
Actually, I'm not a low class warrior.

58
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,007
The lady I was escorting is the
princess of Yeongju Castle.

59
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:26,539
And I'm the captain of her guards.

60
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:21,900
Are you looking at the moon
that has come up today?

61
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:25,355
Or the moon that came up
a thousand years ago?

62
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,735
They are all one and the same.

63
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:35,486
The flowers in the garden
have blossomed brightly.

64
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:37,867
You must have taken good care
of your guests so far...

65
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:40,449
at the Guest House of the Moon.

66
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:42,946
I've changed the name of this place.

67
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,094
It's not a guest house.
It's Hotel Del Luna.

68
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,238
Stop calling me an innkeeper.

69
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,606
I'm the president.

70
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:52,641
They are the same thing.

71
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,840
I saw that the human who
was serving you had left.

72
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:01,928
When he dies, it will
soon lead him to life.

73
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,385
I also died.

74
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,196
Why don't they take me?

75
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:09,727
You didn't die.

76
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,428
I told you, you are tied to the Moon Tree,

77
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:15,733
and the flow of life and
death has stopped for you.

78
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,502
How long will you keep me tied up?

79
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:20,159
It's you who is not budging.

80
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:22,820
I died dried up and shriveled.

81
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:25,495
If you cut it up and burn it,

82
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,103
I will be on my way.

83
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:32,620
The leaves sprout, and the
flowers blossom and fall.

84
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:36,791
The time of life and death
will flow once again.

85
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:42,198
Don't you think you should leave
something pretty like this behind?

86
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:47,799
I have nothing colorful
like that to leave behind.

87
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:51,256
Why don't you pick the bright flowers...

88
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:54,978
and send all those off to pitiful spirits?

89
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:04,079
That child is still...

90
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,823
filled to the brim.

91
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:14,804
I can't leave you like this forever.

92
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:05,920
Thank you for saving me earlier.

93
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:07,162
You were lucky.

94
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,359
I wouldn't have saved you if you had
been wearing shoes of other colors.

95
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:14,800
These are so much better than
those tacky brown color shoes.

96
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,312
You waited for me, wearing
shoes that I chose for you.

97
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:21,247
I never waited for you.

98
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:22,278
Come on.

99
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:25,757
You sent me a text on the pretext
of that tiger, and waited for me.

100
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:27,088
I was just curious.

101
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,456
Of course you were curious.

102
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:31,481
Because you could only think of me.

103
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,052
Did you...

104
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,978
put some spell on me?

105
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:38,103
Is that why you made me dream of you?

106
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:40,934
You dreamed about me?

107
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:43,578
Seeing ghosts like this is
already too much for me.

108
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,478
I don't want to see you in my dream too.

109
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,509
Why? Did I eat you up in
your dream or something?

110
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:02,980
Forget it.

111
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,164
I don't think it was you in my dream.

112
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:07,370
If it were you, you
wouldn't have done that.

113
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:11,321
I forgive you.

114
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:17,163
You are an adult, so you can
have a dream like that.

115
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:21,158
What? It's not that kind of dream!

116
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:26,621
Ku Chan Seong, I thought you were frail.

117
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,096
But you are very healthy.

118
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:33,527
Yes, I am very healthy.

119
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:35,263
Okay, keep on being healthy.

120
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:39,066
If you faint on the road like that,
it will be too troublesome for me.

121
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:42,402
How did you bring me here?

122
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,210
Can you teleport?

123
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:47,629
It was nothing.

124
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:49,618
Just as you brought a handcart,

125
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:51,784
I brought something and used
that to carry you here.

126
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,611
Take him away.

127
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,211
Let's move him.

128
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:17,007
Ms. Jang, I'm in him.

129
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:18,230
Let's go.

130
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,063
Wait for me.

131
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,507
Come on, Ms. Jang.

132
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:28,339
Come out.

133
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:29,948
Now that I'm in a human body,

134
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:31,857
may I go out and party a little?

135
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:32,917
Come out.

136
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:35,060
Gosh, I don't want to leave.

137
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:36,858
Ms. Jang. Come on.

138
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:37,939
Come out!

139
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:48,891
That must have hurt.

140
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,019
Go.

141
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:52,428
Go!

142
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,840
You just have to know that
I moved you here safely.

143
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:01,470
Yes.

144
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:07,374
Can you move your head all right?

145
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:09,179
Sure.

146
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:11,650
Why?

147
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,311
As long as you're fine, that's good.

148
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:17,291
Let's go. Now that you're at my
hotel, so I'll give you a tour.

149
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,205
Does this place really
exist in the real world?

150
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:30,077
Like I said last time,

151
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:32,878
our hotel is officially
registered at the Jung-gu Office,

152
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,786
and we pay all of our taxes too.

153
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:40,786
We do exist in the real world,

154
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:43,057
but our presence is very vague,

155
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:45,068
so the living does not notice us.

156
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:51,144
But we can sometimes be seen...

157
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:53,953
when the weather is bad or if the
person has a good sixth sense.

158
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:56,898
- I didn't know there was a hotel.
- You're right.

159
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:59,184
But it looks kind of scary. Let's just go.

160
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:07,030
But 3 to 4 times a year, there
are people who come in to check.

161
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:18,650
My goodness.

162
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:21,025
Our rooms are very expensive.

163
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,857
What do you do with the people
who insist on coming in?

164
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,501
I will check-in.

165
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:30,522
We have a special room
only for people like them.

166
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:34,330
Please go inside.

167
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:35,899
Sure.

168
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,991
There are people who have
checked into this room,

169
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:09,523
but no one has ever checked out.

170
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:15,242
What did you do to them?

171
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you want to know?

172
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:21,714
Do you want to go in?

173
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,017
There are other places you can look at.

174
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:54,130
Okay. Then let's head over there.

175
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,350
Why do you need to wear sunglasses
in the middle of the night?

176
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,010
What is this place?

177
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,709
Come here.

178
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:51,868
I don't come out here very often.
The sun is too bright.

179
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:54,530
It's nighttime in the middle of Seoul.
What is this place?

180
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:56,618
The inside of the hotel
isn't the real world.

181
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:58,305
The time and space here...

182
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,426
are different from the world you live in.

183
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:04,834
Maps and watches are
absolutely useless here.

184
00:21:29,318 --> 00:21:31,052
So this isn't the real world?

185
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,509
No.

186
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:36,725
Everything in this hotel doesn't
exist in the real world.

187
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:40,616
No matter how pretty it is,
it's not in the real world.

188
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:43,819
Is that the case...

189
00:21:44,598 --> 00:21:45,792
for you too?

190
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:53,660
Yes.

191
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:56,558
Me too.

192
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:18,888
Then I wouldn't die even
if I fell from here?

193
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:22,382
Be careful. You're still alive.

194
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:26,137
If a human falls down with their
weak body, they will face death.

195
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:45,336
This was what it was like
to have a warm body...

196
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:48,109
with a beating heart.

197
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:58,858
You have to live and do many things for me.

198
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:03,184
Keep staying by my side, Ku Chan Seong.

199
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:06,432
If I say no,

200
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,044
are you going to push me over?

201
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,102
It may be a surreal place,

202
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:29,203
but I demand realistic benefits.

203
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,195
And I am going to wear the
shoes that I want to wear.

204
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:41,648
Did you get scared that
I might push you over?

205
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,178
Is that why you have changed your mind?

206
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:44,817
I came all the way here.

207
00:23:44,818 --> 00:23:47,267
I don't think there is
more reason to run away.

208
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,157
To be honest, I'm a bit curious too.

209
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:54,758
And it looks kind of fun too.

210
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:58,624
I want to know more...

211
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:02,495
about you and this hotel.

212
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,769
Good.

213
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:24,388
I was going to let you pass
even if you ran away...

214
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:25,654
a few more times.

215
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:30,403
I told you that you caught my fancy.

216
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:56,578
It was her.

217
00:24:58,659 --> 00:24:59,710
That woman.

218
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:10,771
May I get a refill on the coffee?

219
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:13,760
Yes.

220
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,198
- Oh, right. Honey.
- Yes?

221
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:41,628
Let's stop by the grocery
store on our way home.

222
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:43,506
We'll have to take a detour.

223
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,025
Let's just go next time.

224
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:54,100
What happened?

225
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:55,941
What should we do?

226
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:57,017
Hello?

227
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:58,218
- What are we going to do?
- Is this 911?

228
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:01,074
- Is she dead?
- Someone got hit by a car.

229
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,087
No, it wasn't me.

230
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:04,925
She suddenly fell from an overpass.

231
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,367
Yes, can you please come quickly?

232
00:26:08,229 --> 00:26:11,014
Oh, right. The location?

233
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:14,342
We're currently at...

234
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:39,953
(911 Ambulance)

235
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:52,873
That darn loser.

236
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:56,661
This is driving me crazy.

237
00:26:58,179 --> 00:26:59,199
Whatever!

238
00:27:49,328 --> 00:27:51,062
What... What's going on?

239
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:55,700
What happened to me?

240
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:04,430
Who are you?

241
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:08,300
This is mine.

242
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:31,958
We have a new hotel manager.

243
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,468
I brought him from a
hotel that was named...

244
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:34,835
one of the best hotels by Forbes.

245
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,261
So he'll do a good job.

246
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:38,807
I know he graduated from Harvard,

247
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:41,178
but the work we do here
isn't based on knowledge.

248
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,918
He needs to have some guts.

249
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,918
But he seems very weak-hearted,
and that worries me.

250
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:46,948
How about we leave the
position vacant for a while...

251
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:48,448
and hire someone...

252
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:50,866
from the top two candidates
that you had in mind?

253
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,106
There were two other candidates
other than Ku Chan Seong?

254
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:55,287
Of course.

255
00:28:55,288 --> 00:28:58,258
Didn't the top candidate even
know how to perform an exorcism?

256
00:28:58,899 --> 00:28:59,991
What's the point?

257
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:02,407
He left to catch some useless ghost.

258
00:29:04,298 --> 00:29:05,938
I ask you this in the name
of the Father, the Son,

259
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:07,091
and the Holy Spirit.

260
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,929
Why are you here? What is your name?

261
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:23,130
- That's enough!
- Do not interfere!

262
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:29,233
I can't go there before I catch this ghost.

263
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,251
You should return.

264
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,067
I ask you this in the name
of the Father, the Son,

265
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,467
and the Holy Spirit.

266
00:29:38,598 --> 00:29:40,138
What is your name?

267
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,239
Answer me! Answer me!

268
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:44,959
- I'm more scared of him.
- Tell me your name!

269
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:48,182
I gave him the ability to see ghosts.

270
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,817
But he left to catch some other ghost.

271
00:29:49,818 --> 00:29:51,317
Wouldn't he come back once
he catches the ghost?

272
00:29:51,318 --> 00:29:53,492
That's going to be impossible.
That ghost is really strong.

273
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:55,241
Park Il Do, that punk.

274
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,081
Who was the second candidate?

275
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:01,128
He was a fighter pilot.

276
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:03,710
She went all the way to
the States to find him.

277
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:05,940
But he eventually left in that thing.

278
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:07,320
In what thing?

279
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,939
Let's go.

280
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:10,471
- Let's go.
- No.

281
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,985
I don't need the top two candidates.

282
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:30,576
Ku Chan Seong is here, so we're good.

283
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,347
His office is ready.

284
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,218
Mr. No knew he was going to leave...

285
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:35,789
and had the office cleaned up beforehand.

286
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,817
He worked here for 30 years,

287
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:39,728
but he didn't leave behind a single trace.

288
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:40,779
Yes, he did.

289
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:42,819
That over there.

290
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:45,130
Mr. No took that photo.

291
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:50,090
So many humans worked here,

292
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:51,700
but they're all so vague to me.

293
00:31:52,298 --> 00:31:55,369
How many people were here including Mr. No?

294
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,412
Ms. Jang is the only one who knows that.

295
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:00,660
They're all the same people.
It's useless to count.

296
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:05,667
What are you doing? Get back to work.

297
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,886
He was just the 48th human to work here.

298
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:58,493
And Ku Chan Seong...

299
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,044
will only be the 49th human to work here.

300
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:24,053
(Manager, Ku Chan Seong)

301
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:32,882
I caved in way too quickly.
That was so not like me.

302
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:36,502
Why did I do that?

303
00:33:44,078 --> 00:33:46,701
This was what it was like
to have a warm body...

304
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:50,411
with a beating heart.

305
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:54,517
I got swayed by the ambiance.

306
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:09,611
Ms. Jang told us to say
hello to the new manager.

307
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:12,114
If you all work here,

308
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,667
that means you're all ghosts, right?

309
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,785
I died about 500 years ago.

310
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:20,751
She died 200 years ago.

311
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:24,463
And he died 70 years ago. He's
the youngest of the crew.

312
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:27,249
I see.

313
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,393
I was an aristocrat who studied very hard.

314
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,698
After a long period of studying,

315
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,881
I passed the civil service
exam with the highest score.

316
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:45,896
But I suddenly died right before
achieving my lifelong dream.

317
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:50,410
And while I was wandering
around, I found Man Weol Inn.

318
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,132
I've been here the longest.

319
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:04,558
You said you used to study.
Then what do you do here?

320
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,297
I used to be very bright when
it came to writing poems.

321
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:08,655
And now,

322
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:09,993
I'm a bartender.

323
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:19,176
So you're the bartender who's in
charge of the food and beverages.

324
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,674
I was the eldest daughter-in-law
of a prestigious family.

325
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,948
But I ended up...

326
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,233
getting murdered by my own family.

327
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:51,740
While staying here,

328
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:56,093
I'll wait for the last member
of that loathful family...

329
00:35:56,818 --> 00:35:59,368
to die off.

330
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:03,263
You must have a huge grudge.

331
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:06,499
I'm in charge of the rooms.

332
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:08,518
I see.

333
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:11,004
I died during the Korean War.

334
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,762
This used to be called "Man Weol Inn".

335
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,342
They weren't doing so well back then.

336
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:48,498
I'm waiting to go with my sister...

337
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:49,824
who's still alive.

338
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,729
All of us have long stories to tell.

339
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,308
As for me...

340
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:58,377
The employees here first came as customers,

341
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:00,623
but are now working while
extending their stays.

342
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,678
Aside from Ms. Jang, the three
of us have been here...

343
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,046
the longest.

344
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:08,518
Then did Ms. Jang come here
as a customer like you,

345
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,187
and ended up staying long term?

346
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:11,240
No.

347
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:13,627
Ms. Jang is the owner of Hotel Del Luna.

348
00:37:13,628 --> 00:37:14,914
Owner of what?

349
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:17,609
She's just tied down here for
a punishment from that crone.

350
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:19,027
She's being tied down?

351
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,129
There's a huge tree in our garden, but...

352
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:26,038
Do we have a garden?

353
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,368
I think we left the front desk and
the bar unattended for too long.

354
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,623
We better go.

355
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:34,007
I can't be lazy at work or I'll
be sent to the otherworld.

356
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:35,308
I'll tell you my long story...

357
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:38,205
at the bar while treating
you to a glass of martini.

358
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:51,190
I'm sure you're good to
go home for the day.

359
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:53,668
Where is the garden with the huge tree?

360
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,567
I didn't get to see it today.

361
00:37:55,568 --> 00:37:58,558
She probably didn't show it to
you because it's unnecessary.

362
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:03,178
Is there some kind of tie
between Ms. Jang...

363
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:04,504
and that tree?

364
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:09,772
Mr. Ku.

365
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,852
How long do you want to work here?

366
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,184
As short as possible...

367
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,558
since I didn't come here out of choice.

368
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,924
Then, it'd be best to keep
your curiosities minimal.

369
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:25,625
You must mean the longer
I'll be tied to this place,

370
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,274
the more I know.

371
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:31,268
The rest of us will take care
of hosting the customers.

372
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:34,667
All you have to do is do the work...

373
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:36,310
related to the humans.

374
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:39,931
I'll do that.

375
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:58,266
Hey, are you going to work already?

376
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:01,527
No, I just got off work.

377
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:02,710
Did you have a night shift?

378
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:04,420
No.

379
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:06,407
I'm going to have to quit the hotel I'm at.

380
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:09,328
- Why?
- I now work at a different one.

381
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:10,498
Which hotel?

382
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:12,712
Why would you go somewhere else when
you're with Seoul's best hotel?

383
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,472
It has a private beach...

384
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,474
and a soaring sky bar.

385
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:17,929
That's the hotel I work at.

386
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,393
Is there such a hotel in Seoul?

387
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:22,369
I want to go there too.

388
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:24,599
You can't.

389
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:27,558
If you come, you'll be in room 404.

390
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,823
What's in room 404?

391
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:33,911
Is it a suite?

392
00:40:36,628 --> 00:40:37,721
I'm so tired.

393
00:40:40,628 --> 00:40:43,352
Hurray!

394
00:40:51,338 --> 00:40:54,134
Yes. This is the real world.

395
00:40:54,508 --> 00:40:56,559
I have a place, and I have a friend.

396
00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:58,454
I have lots of other
places asking me to work.

397
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,371
Don't get confused.

398
00:41:05,818 --> 00:41:06,981
I'm finally calming down.

399
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:09,350
This really helps.

400
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:36,729
Strange things have followed
me to the real world

401
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,770
It's a moon.

402
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:40,375
It's to show that it's mine.

403
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:03,859
Man...

404
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,201
Weol.

405
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:10,839
This is how you write it.

406
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:14,517
(Man Weol)

407
00:43:20,858 --> 00:43:22,898
I'm paying you back for
giving me good wine.

408
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:32,392
(Del Luna)

409
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:37,928
She was in my dream, and
now she's calling me.

410
00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:39,594
It's getting me confused.

411
00:44:42,938 --> 00:44:44,612
What took you so long to pick up?

412
00:44:47,809 --> 00:44:48,899
What is it?

413
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:53,137
I have your first job for you.

414
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:54,410
What is it?

415
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:57,528
I want to sell the
painting of Mount Baekdu.

416
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:01,278
What?

417
00:45:09,068 --> 00:45:10,976
The spirit of the mythical creature...

418
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:14,974
made the energy of this
painting even better.

419
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:17,522
I'll be able to get twice its price.

420
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:19,761
If we sell this,

421
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:23,113
what about the tiger inside?

422
00:45:23,648 --> 00:45:25,383
The tiger has just left.

423
00:45:26,048 --> 00:45:27,243
This is an empty painting.

424
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:28,811
The tiger has left?

425
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:31,938
The tiger lived in a zoo all his life.

426
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:34,836
He'd get sick of living in Mount
Baekdu in a couple of days.

427
00:45:35,258 --> 00:45:37,064
He went to the afterlife after
having fun there for a few days.

428
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:39,897
I'm sure he'll be reborn in blessing.

429
00:45:39,898 --> 00:45:42,627
Is this why you asked me to
get the painting? To sell it?

430
00:45:42,628 --> 00:45:44,199
Not because you cared about the tiger.

431
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,046
Of course I care about the tiger.

432
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:49,548
I even wore this for him.

433
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:51,260
Hey!

434
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,147
Make sure you get a good price for this.

435
00:45:54,148 --> 00:45:55,403
Then as a reward,

436
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:58,677
I'll get you a suit with
matching tiger prints.

437
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:02,348
No thanks, who would wear such a thing?

438
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:04,957
Why not? You love tacky brown color.

439
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:08,936
I even got the new car in
that color, just for you.

440
00:46:09,088 --> 00:46:11,547
- A new car?
- Make sure to sell this by today.

441
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:12,897
I have to pick up the new car.

442
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,227
You got a car?

443
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:16,667
The car you were in the last
time was also a new one.

444
00:46:16,668 --> 00:46:20,004
I'm broke now because I brought a new car.

445
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:22,875
Make sure you get a good
price for this painting.

446
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:25,075
Get at least double of its original price.

447
00:46:32,278 --> 00:46:37,155
Let's go pick up my new car

448
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,183
I really messed up.

449
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:45,162
Why did I even bother to ask?
She's nothing but a money chaser.

450
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:51,815
Is it really gone? Is it not here?

451
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:59,666
Roar.

452
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:03,725
Roar.

453
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:05,104
Roar.

454
00:47:25,798 --> 00:47:27,746
(Kim Yu Na)

455
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:41,006
That's not who you are.
You died right here!

456
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:52,066
Give my body back to me!

457
00:47:56,869 --> 00:47:59,246
Yes, Director. Thank you
for introducing me to him.

458
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,146
Yes, I'm heading to the gallery right now.

459
00:48:02,668 --> 00:48:03,862
I'll see you soon.

460
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:08,837
Give my body back to me!

461
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:18,897
Seems like Chan Seong brought
in a very annoying customer.

462
00:49:19,132 --> 00:49:22,294
She looks like she has issues.
She keeps saying she's not dead.

463
00:49:22,632 --> 00:49:25,742
This isn't our first time seeing
the dead saying they're alive.

464
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:28,312
They always say that they're alive,
they can't die or ask why they died.

465
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:30,111
We hear that all the time.

466
00:49:30,112 --> 00:49:32,051
Ms. Jang will handle it, right?

467
00:49:38,052 --> 00:49:39,452
I told you to go sell a painting,

468
00:49:39,453 --> 00:49:41,696
but why did you bring in
an unwanted customer?

469
00:49:41,752 --> 00:49:42,916
Are you tout?

470
00:49:43,322 --> 00:49:44,444
What did you say?

471
00:49:45,322 --> 00:49:47,985
You said that you comfort souls here.

472
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,801
She seems like she has issues,

473
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:52,159
why don't you come up
with a solution for her?

474
00:49:52,402 --> 00:49:54,872
You said you saw her other
self wandering around?

475
00:49:54,873 --> 00:49:56,332
She said that she's robbed of her body.

476
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,571
If that's true, we should
get it back for her.

477
00:49:57,572 --> 00:50:01,418
What you've brought is a soul
that came out of someone alive.

478
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,481
So you're saying that she is
out there without a soul?

479
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:08,952
You said that she's robbed of her body.

480
00:50:08,953 --> 00:50:11,298
Her body must be taken
over by another spirit.

481
00:50:16,652 --> 00:50:19,550
What's wrong with Yu Na?

482
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:22,292
Yu Na bullied her the most.

483
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:24,577
Maybe she feels guilty for
everything that she did.

484
00:50:24,732 --> 00:50:26,395
She's acting as if she
actually feels bad now.

485
00:50:33,773 --> 00:50:34,863
Is this the girl's house?

486
00:50:35,413 --> 00:50:38,983
Yes, Yu Na is the only
child of this household.

487
00:50:40,482 --> 00:50:43,370
Their one and only daughter's
body is taken over by a spirit.

488
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:44,781
Of course we have to get it back.

489
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:48,022
I ask this with confidence,

490
00:50:48,023 --> 00:50:49,583
but are you going to make the
parents pay you for this?

491
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:52,833
This isn't just a rich house.

492
00:50:53,623 --> 00:50:55,731
That's the brown car that I'm in love with.

493
00:50:55,732 --> 00:50:57,432
The fact that they're already driving it,

494
00:50:57,433 --> 00:50:59,647
which I tried so hard to book it.

495
00:51:00,532 --> 00:51:03,123
That means that they're filthy rich.

496
00:51:06,473 --> 00:51:09,736
We need to find out why
this is happening, right?

497
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,142
It's because of a necklace.

498
00:51:11,143 --> 00:51:13,285
It belongs to the dead
friend who took the body.

499
00:51:13,313 --> 00:51:16,111
The spirit stayed in the necklace,

500
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:17,378
then took over the body.

501
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:19,218
I thought they were friends.
Why would she do such a thing?

502
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:22,718
Stop asking questions. You said
we need to get the body back.

503
00:51:22,853 --> 00:51:24,801
Then that's all we need to do.

504
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:33,625
Go after her.

505
00:51:35,203 --> 00:51:36,223
Hey!

506
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:49,635
Let me go!

507
00:51:51,782 --> 00:51:53,455
I'm going to kill her.

508
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:56,477
This isn't even your body. Why
are you doing this to a friend?

509
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,852
She's not a friend.

510
00:52:00,732 --> 00:52:02,324
She killed me.

511
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:11,318
(Jung Su Jung)

512
00:52:14,572 --> 00:52:15,665
Give it back to me.

513
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:17,441
You live on social assistance...

514
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:19,728
and you want to waste your
money on something like this?

515
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,418
Do you have no conscience?

516
00:52:22,913 --> 00:52:24,719
The money you get is for
you to feed yourself.

517
00:52:26,552 --> 00:52:29,653
This is what we call, a waste of tax money.

518
00:52:31,163 --> 00:52:32,285
Give it back.

519
00:52:33,422 --> 00:52:34,961
Give it back!

520
00:52:34,962 --> 00:52:37,146
Take it if you can.

521
00:52:37,632 --> 00:52:40,009
- Here you go.
- Give it back to me!

522
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:42,423
Give it back!

523
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:44,564
Give it to me.

524
00:52:51,743 --> 00:52:52,835
You brat!

525
00:52:53,612 --> 00:52:54,878
Let me go!

526
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:11,944
I can't remember anything
after falling off the bridge.

527
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:14,235
When I gained conscience,

528
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:17,064
I realized that I'm in her body...

529
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:21,212
with my necklace in her hand.

530
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:29,251
Are you here to give Yu Na her body back?

531
00:53:29,252 --> 00:53:30,651
She killed me!

532
00:53:37,993 --> 00:53:39,187
That's it.

533
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:41,672
Use that to give my body back now.

534
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:43,394
The spirit in here...

535
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:47,602
doesn't disappear that easily.

536
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,235
Just tell my parents.

537
00:53:49,732 --> 00:53:51,916
They'll do anything for me.

538
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:54,863
Of course they should.

539
00:53:56,413 --> 00:53:58,219
They're the ones who made you, after all.

540
00:54:07,523 --> 00:54:10,624
What is it that you wanted to
talk to us about our daughter?

541
00:54:12,822 --> 00:54:15,955
Yu Na murdered someone.

542
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:21,472
Did you know...

543
00:54:21,473 --> 00:54:24,533
that Yu Na's classmate committed
suicide on that bridge?

544
00:54:26,072 --> 00:54:27,878
That's not entirely true.

545
00:54:28,672 --> 00:54:30,346
Your daughter killed her.

546
00:54:33,782 --> 00:54:36,944
This necklace is the evidence.

547
00:54:43,853 --> 00:54:46,239
What is it that you want?

548
00:54:49,732 --> 00:54:51,538
I came for a reward.

549
00:54:54,732 --> 00:54:58,476
Do you think it's wrong
of me to kill Yu Na?

550
00:54:58,802 --> 00:55:00,098
Let's look for a way.

551
00:55:01,342 --> 00:55:02,669
What way?

552
00:55:05,982 --> 00:55:08,328
No matter what I do, I
can't come back to life.

553
00:55:11,152 --> 00:55:12,958
I wanted to live!

554
00:55:15,223 --> 00:55:16,988
Even when they called me a parasite,

555
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:20,264
I still wanted to live on.

556
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,353
Let me go!

557
00:55:30,132 --> 00:55:31,193
Please let me go.

558
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,147
I can't let her return to this body...

559
00:55:38,842 --> 00:55:40,618
and live like nothing happened.

560
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:45,003
Please let me go.

561
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,185
Wait, just a second.

562
00:55:58,732 --> 00:56:00,294
I'll go get the necklace.

563
00:56:02,002 --> 00:56:04,247
You should just live in this body, okay?

564
00:56:14,282 --> 00:56:15,404
Where is the necklace?

565
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:20,061
We can't let her return to her body yet!

566
00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:22,121
It would be unfair for that girl!

567
00:56:22,493 --> 00:56:23,849
I already returned the necklace.

568
00:56:25,123 --> 00:56:26,489
It's in the hands of her parents.

569
00:57:00,362 --> 00:57:03,219
So this necklace belongs
to that dead girl, right?

570
00:57:04,263 --> 00:57:06,099
That woman told us this
is the only evidence.

571
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:11,256
There are two ways to pay for what she did.

572
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:13,341
One, take this necklace as evidence...

573
00:57:13,342 --> 00:57:16,067
to prove your daughter's
wrongdoing and punish her.

574
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:18,662
You should also apologize
to the dead girl's soul.

575
00:57:18,782 --> 00:57:19,965
Two,

576
00:57:20,913 --> 00:57:24,391
you can keep this a secret and
get rid of this necklace.

577
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:42,665
I'll pay as much as you want.

578
00:57:43,973 --> 00:57:45,023
Please...

579
00:57:46,603 --> 00:57:48,377
hand it over to us quietly.

580
00:57:50,243 --> 00:57:51,507
So you made your decision.

581
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:57,870
You'll have to pay a big price.

582
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:10,046
Everything will go back to normal, right?

583
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,353
Of course.

584
00:58:12,163 --> 00:58:13,867
Once that necklace is gone,

585
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:16,916
no one will know that you killed her.

586
00:58:17,773 --> 00:58:18,997
No one will notice, right?

587
00:58:20,672 --> 00:58:22,815
I told you that her grudge
is very strong, didn't I?

588
00:58:23,773 --> 00:58:25,211
Once that necklace is burned,

589
00:58:25,913 --> 00:58:29,657
your chance to get her forgiveness
will be gone for good too.

590
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:32,404
It doesn't matter.

591
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:35,914
It does.

592
00:58:36,623 --> 00:58:38,327
You won't ever be able
to go back to your body.

593
00:58:39,163 --> 00:58:40,183
Pardon?

594
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:43,891
I mean that your soul...

595
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,786
will really die without anyone realizing.

596
00:58:52,502 --> 00:58:53,564
Darn it.

597
00:59:04,152 --> 00:59:05,682
Let bygones be bygones
since she's already dead.

598
00:59:06,052 --> 00:59:08,165
Yu Na should continue to have a good life.

599
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:12,656
Yes, she should. None of this happened.

600
00:59:13,893 --> 00:59:15,015
But what do you think...

601
00:59:17,092 --> 00:59:19,103
that woman meant by the last comment?

602
00:59:21,473 --> 00:59:22,553
Right.

603
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:26,168
You should know that the choice you made...

604
00:59:26,842 --> 00:59:27,935
will kill your daughter's soul.

605
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:35,104
No!

606
00:59:38,252 --> 00:59:40,630
No! What do I do?

607
00:59:42,422 --> 00:59:46,122
Mom, take it out! Mom! Please...

608
00:59:46,123 --> 00:59:48,234
Please take it out, Mom!

609
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:51,390
I said, take it out! Take it out!

610
01:00:16,453 --> 01:00:18,095
You should live in that body now.

611
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:20,632
Although you're parasitic on that body.

612
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:24,730
Try your best to survive again.

613
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,570
She has become a true parasite.

614
01:00:50,252 --> 01:00:51,344
But...

615
01:00:52,362 --> 01:00:54,056
she found herself a golden host.

616
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:57,332
I bet they'll spoil her not knowing...

617
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:59,302
she's only their daughter's shell.

618
01:00:59,502 --> 01:01:00,686
That young girl...

619
01:01:01,402 --> 01:01:03,647
will be tortured while
watching her own shell.

620
01:01:04,232 --> 01:01:05,294
I feel bad for her.

621
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:08,800
She's only paying for what she did.

622
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:15,434
She's just tied down here for
a punishment from that crone.

623
01:01:17,853 --> 01:01:21,087
Are you also paying for what you did?

624
01:01:30,163 --> 01:01:31,459
I heard you're being punished.

625
01:01:34,402 --> 01:01:35,454
I am.

626
01:01:36,873 --> 01:01:39,453
Someone told me that I'm
arrogant and foolish.

627
01:01:40,942 --> 01:01:42,136
Although I don't agree with it.

628
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:47,205
I see.

629
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:50,839
What was that? Did you just say, "I see"?

630
01:01:51,382 --> 01:01:52,607
Are you looking down on me?

631
01:01:53,183 --> 01:01:54,304
No, I'm not.

632
01:01:55,023 --> 01:01:57,267
Sometimes. No, very rarely,

633
01:01:58,822 --> 01:02:00,118
I feel sympathetic for you.

634
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:16,012
(Text message)

635
01:02:16,013 --> 01:02:17,012
(Your pre-order for XJ50
edition has been canceled.)

636
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:18,064
What is this?

637
01:02:18,612 --> 01:02:20,857
The car I pre-ordered got canceled.

638
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:25,507
What kind of situation is this?

639
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:29,072
How is this possible? Are
they looking down on me?

640
01:02:29,752 --> 01:02:30,977
They're dead meat.

641
01:02:31,393 --> 01:02:32,648
Do you take me for a fool?

642
01:02:33,263 --> 01:02:34,384
Forget it.

643
01:02:35,393 --> 01:02:36,555
Forward me to the one in charge.

644
01:02:37,192 --> 01:02:38,733
I said, forward me!

645
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,216
When Ms. Jang gets angry, she
drinks champaign in bulk.

646
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,388
Mr. No always prepared it for her.

647
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:53,495
I didn't know my position required
serving Ms. Jang alcohol.

648
01:02:53,721 --> 01:02:55,556
You're so unlucky.

649
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,667
You were third in line,

650
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:00,813
but you ended up as our manager.
We didn't know you'd come either.

651
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,352
What do you mean I was third in line?

652
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,713
They told me not to talk about
you being the third choice.

653
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:16,490
Are you saying I was third
in line for the job?

654
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,805
- No.
- This means...

655
01:03:18,051 --> 01:03:20,734
there were two other two in line before me.

656
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,919
You're here now, so you're the winner.

657
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,584
It's a feat that I'm not happy about.

658
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:27,716
Here it is.

659
01:03:33,261 --> 01:03:34,399
What is this?

660
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,129
This sign shows that it
belongs to Ms. Jang.

661
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,906
Anything with this means it's Ms. Jang's.

662
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,323
It's a moon.

663
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:43,498
It's to show that it's mine.

664
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,501
Come this way.

665
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:10,481
Ms. Choi.

666
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,714
Do you know what Ms. Jang was
like when she was alive?

667
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:19,027
What does it mean that she's
tied down for a punishment?

668
01:04:19,241 --> 01:04:21,893
You're just a passer-by.

669
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,699
Like these people who stopped
by over the many years,

670
01:04:26,181 --> 01:04:28,323
consider that you are only
visiting for a moment,

671
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,346
and leave this place as soon
as possible as you wish.

672
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:12,544
(Man Weol Inn)

673
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:21,103
Why are you spending such
a long time like this?

674
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:44,211
Is this that tree?

675
01:06:17,461 --> 01:06:18,889
There are no leaves.

676
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,492
What are you doing here?

677
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,489
You didn't show me the garden,
so I decided to stop by.

678
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:37,865
Guests cannot come here. You
don't need to see this.

679
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:41,179
Is this that tree?

680
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,160
The tree that my father touched.

681
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:45,922
The reason why I was sold here.

682
01:06:45,951 --> 01:06:46,971
You're right.

683
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:49,303
You're paying the price too.

684
01:06:52,531 --> 01:06:54,130
But it didn't have to be me.

685
01:06:54,131 --> 01:06:55,630
I heard I was the third one on the list.

686
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,830
I really thought it had to be me.

687
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:02,422
You said I caught your fancy, so I
made a huge decision to come here.

688
01:07:02,871 --> 01:07:04,401
But I'm here in place of the
1st and 2nd of that list.

689
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:10,507
Yes, there were 1st and 2nd places
who were on the list before you.

690
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,610
Am I even the third place?

691
01:07:13,611 --> 01:07:15,417
Was I the 4th, or the 5th
place by any chance?

692
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,654
Who said you were the third place?

693
01:07:18,421 --> 01:07:20,389
- There were more before me?
- You're...

694
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,241
the zeroth place.

695
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:24,953
The zeroth place.

696
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:27,221
It had to be you.

697
01:07:27,531 --> 01:07:28,958
You completely caught my fancy.

698
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:33,953
Do you want a glass too?

699
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,070
It's a reward for saying...

700
01:07:37,071 --> 01:07:38,744
that you'll take a hefty sum
for the Mount Baekdu painting.

701
01:07:39,871 --> 01:07:43,146
Do you think the tiger saw what
he wanted to see in the painting?

702
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,293
He probably left without
complaining because he did.

703
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:50,854
He saw the past like a dream, a
time where he can never go back.

704
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,323
He got pretty lucky.

705
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,077
I'm sure you have things you
miss in the old times...

706
01:08:00,491 --> 01:08:01,725
that you cannot go back to.

707
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,267
I think I saw that.

708
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,073
I told you that I saw you in a dream.

709
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:17,901
In a dream?

710
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,003
You were smiling...

711
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:21,742
underneath a huge tree.

712
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,849
When someone said they'd build you a house,

713
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,727
you said mean things just as you do now,

714
01:08:27,121 --> 01:08:28,283
but you were happy.

715
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:34,169
The moon shined above the
wilderness where you were drinking,

716
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:37,032
and it was filled with
sounds of instruments,

717
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,828
along with your laughter.

718
01:08:46,571 --> 01:08:48,345
You were full of joy and happiness.

719
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:52,473
You weren't alone like you are now.
You had someone by your side.

720
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:56,798
The man who taught you how to
write your name, Man Weol.

721
01:08:58,251 --> 01:09:00,332
Is that the person you miss the most...

722
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:02,616
over your long stay here?

723
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:16,262
You.

724
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:20,643
You really...

725
01:09:22,911 --> 01:09:23,931
saw him.

726
01:09:26,711 --> 01:09:27,731
You have been...

727
01:09:28,281 --> 01:09:29,985
waiting for that person...

728
01:09:31,121 --> 01:09:32,885
over this long period of time.

729
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:12,681
Why do you see...

730
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,312
such things?

731
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,312
I don't know.

732
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:20,991
Why do I see you?

733
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,672
I'm scared that I may
have to pay the price.

734
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:27,822
Ms. Jang.

735
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:34,650
After I began to see you,

736
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,262
I think of you...

737
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,642
very much, awfully a lot.

738
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:47,615
Ms. Jang, I'm saying...

739
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,785
you are devouring on...

740
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,862
all my nights and dreams.

741
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:52,695
(Hotel Del Luna)

742
01:12:53,251 --> 01:12:55,433
The old memories that dried-up already...

743
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:57,728
crawled out again because of you.

744
01:12:58,661 --> 01:13:00,191
I need to check this for myself.

745
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:03,362
Chan Seong, you will take
ghosts starting tonight.

746
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,729
There is someone that they
need to see just once.

747
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:08,469
Every single ghost has someone
that they want to see!

748
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:10,847
You said that the owner
is really awful, right?

749
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:13,809
- Did you?
- The dried-up tree sprouted leaves.

750
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:14,861
I'm going to look after this.

751
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:17,103
I'm sorry.

752
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,711
Chan Seong, come to my hotel once you die.
