00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:12,526
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,156
It's a little kid.

3
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:52,671
It seems like...

4
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:56,455
her parents already
crossed the Sanzu River.

5
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,896
How did this little girl manage
to stay alive for so long?

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,455
I came to take her,

7
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:06,195
but I was also startled to see
that she was still alive.

8
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:10,390
This little girl is trying
so hard to stay alive.

9
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,236
Why don't you take a step back?

10
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,275
But she won't be able to last for too long.

11
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,846
You never know...

12
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:22,346
what might happen in that
short amount of time.

13
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:48,476
Father, I see something over there.

14
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,736
What?

15
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,376
My gosh.

16
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,685
Hey, they're filthy. Don't touch anything.

17
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:00,786
They're dead.

18
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:02,415
They must be from Goguryeo.

19
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:04,250
They were probably wandering around
after their country collapsed...

20
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,825
and ended up dying a futile death.

21
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,385
Let me see.

22
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:10,126
Let's take the wagon.

23
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,466
Thank you for the wagon. My goodness.

24
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:34,915
She moved.

25
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,955
Can you see me?

26
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:48,235
You're alive.

27
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,006
Don't be sad.

28
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,545
I'm sure your parents went to
the Guest House of the Moon.

29
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,686
I heard it from a granny
who sells medicine.

30
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:07,880
There's a place called the
Guest House of the Moon...

31
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,586
somewhere in the wilderness.

32
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,925
It's where dead people go...

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,996
to get some rest before they
leave for the afterlife.

34
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,795
What's your name?

35
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,316
Man Weol.

36
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,645
The moon.

37
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,786
Your name means "full moon".

38
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:45,686
It's pretty.

39
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,226
Do you think...

40
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:56,036
we could've met in our past lives?

41
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,806
I'm from 1,300 years ago.

42
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,506
I wonder how we came to meet.

43
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,945
Sometimes, it takes 1,300 years...

44
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,246
for two people to meet each other.

45
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,526
It takes a very long time
for us to be able to see...

46
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,326
the light coming from the stars.

47
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,105
The Orion Nebula is 1,300
light years away from Earth.

48
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,505
That means it takes 1,300 years...

49
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,976
for us to be able to see
it with our own eyes.

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,675
Really?

51
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,516
Where is it right now?

52
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:49,016
You can only see it during winter,
so you can't see it right now.

53
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,685
Winter?

54
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,156
Starting from the next full moon,

55
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,495
the energy of the moon will
be withdrawn from this place.

56
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,435
From now on, you won't be
getting any new guests.

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,776
I guess you're telling me to close it down.

58
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,235
Your Guest House of the Moon...

59
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,045
will only exist...

60
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,716
up until the next full moon.

61
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,386
It's a pity that we can only see it...

62
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,755
in winter.

63
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:31,191
Chan Seong, is there a star
we can see right now...

64
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:33,026
instead of the Orion Nebula?

65
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,865
Well...

66
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:39,530
I'm not sure. I'm not
very good with astronomy.

67
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,706
So I can't answer that question.

68
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:45,906
You dumb Harvard graduate.

69
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,631
You could've just pointed...

70
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,740
at any one of those stars in the sky.

71
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,615
Do you think I would've corrected
you if you were wrong?

72
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,485
I would've just acted like I was impressed.

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,396
Shall I, then?

74
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,321
Let's see. I should pick a
beautiful, shining one...

75
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:07,495
so that you'll like it.

76
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,935
Forget it. It's too late.

77
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,875
There really is one more.

78
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:19,646
Another star you can see after
living through 1,300 years.

79
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,076
Me, Ku Chan Seong.

80
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,415
I told you that I'm your dazzling star.

81
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,625
All right. You're all I need.

82
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,125
I don't care about the star
that I can only see in winter.

83
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,935
I'll be happy as long as I can see you.

84
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,571
Look at you, Chan Seong.
You shine so brightly.

85
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,315
I'm totally dazzled by you.

86
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,470
Look at you, Man Weol.

87
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,615
You're looking so bright
like the full moon.

88
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,881
"The full moon"?

89
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,526
Actually, I'll call you my lucky charm.

90
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,956
You deserve the nickname as
you've gotten much nicer.

91
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,096
Didn't you call me "Pork Rice Soup" once?

92
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,266
You said you'd happily be
reincarnated as chicken noodle soup.

93
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,896
What if that actually happens?

94
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,375
It's okay. I'll be the side
salad that goes with it.

95
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,336
Really?

96
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,206
- Seriously?
- Yes.

97
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,840
- You really mean it, right?
- Yes.

98
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,371
You said you'd be the side salad.
You promised me.

99
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,985
Yes, I'll really be the side salad for you.

100
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:07,016
Did Mr. Kim go somewhere?

101
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:10,685
He went out after chatting
with those guests.

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,185
Yes.

103
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,526
Where did he go?

104
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:20,451
My new novel will be released.

105
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:21,790
It's about a salacious
scholar, Kim Si Ik...

106
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,495
whose appointment got canceled
though he passed the state exam.

107
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,865
I should just leave before I must face...

108
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,076
such humiliation. I should really leave.

109
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,316
We have to say goodbye to
each other when we leave.

110
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:42,755
Promise me you won't leave
without saying anything.

111
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:45,586
Gosh.

112
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,125
Oh, dear.

113
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,420
Ms. Jang, I can't find Mr. Kim anywhere.

114
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,690
He's probably with Hyun Joong.

115
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,761
No, he's not.

116
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:01,806
I couldn't find him anywhere in the hotel.

117
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,200
Maybe he stepped out.

118
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,046
He rarely leaves the hotel.

119
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,775
Even when he does, he never leaves alone.

120
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:10,440
He still sounds like a man living
in the Joseon era, you know.

121
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,910
Apparently, he left the bar...

122
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,410
looking all worried in the middle
of chatting with some guests...

123
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,385
about a scholar who aced the state exam.

124
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,385
A scholar who aced the state exam?

125
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,226
You know about his situation, right?

126
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,066
By any chance, was his name...

127
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,836
Kim Si Ik when he was alive?

128
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,206
Who is the guest that spoke ill...

129
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:39,346
of Mr. Kim?

130
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,570
I was telling him that I died
before I could publish...

131
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,871
the book I wrote about
the scholar, Kim Si Ik.

132
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:50,611
And the novel mocks Kim Si Ik, doesn't it?

133
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:54,251
It's a fiction I wrote based
on thorough research.

134
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:57,726
So that novel will actually be released?

135
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:01,495
I sent the manuscript to my publisher.

136
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:05,466
They'll publish it as my posthumous work.

137
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,800
Who is this stupid publisher?

138
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,336
And how many people have read this?

139
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:14,231
I still write in longhand,

140
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,170
so there's only one manuscript.

141
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,086
I'm sure the editor-in-chief
is the only one who's read it.

142
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,086
I must find this publisher.

143
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,336
His handwriting is still so bad.

144
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:38,836
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

145
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,535
("Salacious Scholar, Kim Si Ik")

146
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,245
Is the air conditioner on?

147
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:56,015
I am not a salacious scholar.

148
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,186
This isn't fair.

149
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,525
First, bribe him to buy
the manuscript off him.

150
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,196
Offer him all the money from selling
the horses. He'll accept it.

151
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:12,706
But I'm worried Mr. Kim might
cause trouble before we do that.

152
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,361
If he does anything to harm humans,

153
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:16,605
the Grim Reaper won't let it slide.

154
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,875
Mr. Kim is like a crane.

155
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,745
Have you seen a crane attacking humans?

156
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,515
He can't harm anyone.

157
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,816
Still, he's been holding
a grudge for 500 years.

158
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,381
Cranes make sure their feathers stay...

159
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:31,655
as white as snow even when
they're standing in mud.

160
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:35,395
Mr. Kim waited for 500 years...

161
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,456
to clear his name.

162
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,426
I'm Kim Si Ik. I am not salacious.

163
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,105
I scared him too much.

164
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,605
I just want to make sure the
book won't be published.

165
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,446
Should I have gone easy on him?

166
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,346
Sir!

167
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,186
What's wrong?

168
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,355
I saw a ghost.

169
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,956
- Sorry?
- A ghost?

170
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,285
I just saw Kim Si Ik, who is dead.

171
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,680
- Hold on.
- You saw his ghost?

172
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,495
- It means the book will be a hit!
- We will hit the jackpot!

173
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,666
My gosh, sir!

174
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,035
- I was really scared.
- What a lucky dream!

175
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,430
It wasn't a dream. I
really saw him, you fool!

176
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,601
- Are we celebrating tonight?
- A team dinner will be nice!

177
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:57,505
- Guys, how about sushi?
- My gosh.

178
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,115
Mr. Kim.

179
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,655
Mr. Ku, Ms. Jang. You knew I'd be here?

180
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,125
Look at yourself.

181
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:16,851
Let's go back to the hotel first.

182
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:19,966
I cannot go back to the hotel
for I am too humiliated.

183
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:23,895
I'll just take the bus here
and head to the afterlife.

184
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,265
Mr. Kim, why are you being like this?

185
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,035
You're the ace of our hotel, and
you're like a dignified crane.

186
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,505
Cranes do not drop their heads.

187
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:32,946
Hold your head high.

188
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:39,416
I'll get the manuscript from
the publisher no matter what.

189
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,446
Mr. Ku...

190
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,273
You're refusing to return to the hotel,

191
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:50,088
so you should stay in Chan Seong's room.

192
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,117
Thank you, Mr. Ku.

193
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,912
Only the editor-in-chief has read this,

194
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:56,428
and he didn't even finish it.

195
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:59,127
I went through hoops to persuade him
because the author is very famous.

196
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:01,058
How did you persuade him?

197
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:03,027
I told him that Kim Si Ik is my ancestor.

198
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,623
Chan Seong lied to him
that he's your descendant,

199
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:07,338
and I spent a fortune to buy it off him.

200
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,237
Thank you so much.

201
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,462
"Salacious Scholar, Kim Si Ik"?

202
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:13,462
("Salacious Scholar, Kim Si Ik")

203
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:15,973
I suppose I'll never be
able to clear my name.

204
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:18,542
If it's not true, explain
and prove your innocence.

205
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:21,117
Could you tell us what happened?

206
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:26,958
Everyone called me a
genius because I passed...

207
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:29,058
the triennial state exam
at a very young age.

208
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:32,828
However, I failed the main
civil service exam every year.

209
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,698
After the age of 40,

210
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,938
I left my hometown and
settled down in Hanyang.

211
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:43,308
Then I focused solely on
studying for the exam.

212
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:47,737
Watching how others live was the
only thing that gave me joy...

213
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:52,578
while studying so hard, which
made me feel lonely at times.

214
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:57,247
I saw a young girl looking
after her blind father,

215
00:14:58,072 --> 00:15:00,113
and I also saw two
brothers whose families...

216
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:01,487
always fought.

217
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:03,253
- My gosh.
- Hey.

218
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:06,623
Seeing a young couple fall in love,
disregarding their social status,

219
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:09,428
was beautiful too.

220
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,068
When reading books became boring,

221
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:18,907
I came up with stories based on
what I had seen on the street.

222
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:21,308
Master, this is so sad.

223
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:23,108
What happens next?

224
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,442
Of course, back then, for scholars,

225
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:31,017
writing a story other than
in Chinese characters...

226
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:33,688
was considered unconventional.

227
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:38,523
However, the stories I had written
weren't degrading at all.

228
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:40,653
Wait, you wrote stories...

229
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,223
about a dutiful daughter, a
faithful woman, and siblings...

230
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:46,062
Are they about Sim Cheong, Chun
Hyang, Heung Bu, and Nol Bu?

231
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,167
You wrote all of those stories?

232
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:51,808
The authors of these stories
are unknown in this world.

233
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,202
If that's true. You're Shakespeare
of the Joseon Dynasty.

234
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:59,647
But those stories ruined my life...

235
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,787
when my life was at its peak.

236
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:06,018
Master, congratulations.
You'll make a glorious return.

237
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:09,187
Your appointment will be canceled.

238
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,897
What do you mean?

239
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:16,528
It's my understanding that
you wrote these stories.

240
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:18,892
You call yourself a scholar.

241
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:21,392
How dare you write stories about
lowly lives of the commoners?

242
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:24,193
Seeing how you call these
stories as your writing,

243
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,977
it's a humiliation to fellow scholars.

244
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:29,402
Every scholar will make sure that
someone as vulgar and nasty...

245
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:32,278
as you does not receive a title of rank.

246
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:35,147
I only wrote stories about people's lives.

247
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,112
How could you call these stories degrading?

248
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:39,417
A story of an adulterous couple.

249
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:43,358
A story where the order
between brothers is broken.

250
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:47,322
A story that confuses the masses
through absurd imaginations.

251
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:50,298
How can a scholar come
up with such stories?

252
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:53,637
Master! Master!

253
00:16:58,332 --> 00:16:59,707
Kim Si Ik.

254
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:02,677
If you know what it means to be humiliated,

255
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:04,377
don't you ever lift your head up.

256
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:10,488
Due to the petition brought by other
scholars, I was disqualified.

257
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:15,657
The son of a powerful
family took up my position.

258
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:21,227
My father who was in my
hometown was humiliated,

259
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:24,627
so he refused to eat which
caused him to die in the end.

260
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:28,707
I didn't have the courage to face
my wife who had been supporting me.

261
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:36,078
As I could neither go back to
my hometown nor stay there,

262
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,207
I died...

263
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:41,477
all by myself, feeling lost in the world.

264
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,588
I feel incredibly wronged.

265
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:01,622
At first, he waited for his
so-called humiliating stories...

266
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,768
to disappear in this world.

267
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:07,562
But people puffed up his stories,
and the stories spread even more.

268
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:08,973
Everyone in this world...

269
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:12,348
knows the stories of Chun
Hyang and Sim Cheong.

270
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,402
I'm sure a part of him was feeling hopeful.

271
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:17,812
He could have washed his humiliation
and felt proud instead.

272
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:21,018
However, there's no evidence.

273
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:24,627
Can you truly trust everything he says?

274
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,998
No wonder why someone would
write a book about him.

275
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:31,193
People don't know about
the stories he wrote.

276
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,062
He just became a salacious scholar...

277
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,167
who got disqualified in the end...

278
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,437
because he wrote so-called nasty stories.

279
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:42,147
I will read every page of this manuscript.

280
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,132
Mr. Kim is okay though, right?

281
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:47,617
He will stay in my room for now.

282
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,157
Sanchez.

283
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:59,957
I remember seeing you at
the dinner the other day.

284
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,268
Yes. What brings you here?

285
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:04,552
I have a situation,

286
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:07,338
so I'll be staying in
Mr. Ku's room for a while.

287
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:08,667
I see.

288
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:12,038
Then does he also work at the hotel?

289
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:14,778
He's the Grim Reaper.

290
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:20,117
He's not an easy man to
meet if you're alive.

291
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:21,477
Say hello.

292
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:28,812
But he's not here because he
has business with me, right?

293
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:31,957
No. I'm here to console
an old friend of mine.

294
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,493
The Grim Reaper bought me some beer.

295
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,263
Would you like to join us?

296
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:45,108
No, I'm good. Please go ahead.

297
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:47,033
Please allow me to stay for a while.

298
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,108
Sure.

299
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:49,848
- Homeowner.
- Yes?

300
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,902
As I didn't have any food for beer,
I picked dates in your yard.

301
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,548
If we meet in the future,

302
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,518
I'll repay you for them.

303
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:03,387
Sure.

304
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,253
I have peanuts. Do you want
me to bring some peanuts?

305
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,598
Excuse me.

306
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:14,298
I didn't know that's what
had happened to Kim Si Ik.

307
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:16,137
It's unfortunate,

308
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,392
but I don't want to go against
500-year-old resentment...

309
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:20,437
to publish the book.

310
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:22,348
I will get rid of it.

311
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:25,248
It would be a shame to
destroy it like this.

312
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:27,842
My manager read every page of the novel.

313
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:29,687
He told me the story was quite fascinating.

314
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:33,882
If I were to overlook the
perverted scholar part,

315
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:38,013
you turned the scholar into a
pretty enticing character.

316
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:40,783
The noble-minded scholar who
did not get involved...

317
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:42,397
in the conflict between two major factions.

318
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:45,463
A romantic scholar who
would write to his wife...

319
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,667
who was waiting in his hometown
once every month stood out.

320
00:20:48,763 --> 00:20:51,493
I did my research. That's what he did.

321
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:54,033
I'll tell you what. "Kim Si Ik decided..."

322
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,372
"not to join the social
cliques to gain power."

323
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:57,372
"As an outsider of the group,"

324
00:20:57,372 --> 00:21:00,147
"he indulged himself in
perverted, erotic stories."

325
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,647
Let's change this part.

326
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,673
"The existing stories which were
written in the Korean alphabet..."

327
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,358
"with unknown writers..."

328
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:08,818
"were actually written by
the scholar, Kim Si Ik."

329
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:11,612
You won't be able to write
this as a historical book,

330
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:14,253
but it would make a very
fascinating theme for a novel.

331
00:21:14,322 --> 00:21:15,598
You're right.

332
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:18,122
"Shin Yun Bok was a woman."

333
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:19,538
There's a book with that theme too.

334
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:22,068
In novels, everything is possible.

335
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:23,463
Let's go with that then.

336
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,503
The most romantic scholar
in the Joseon Dynasty...

337
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:28,033
and the best storyteller who
was as noble as a crane.

338
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:29,207
Kim Si Ik.

339
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:33,548
"Crane"? This title just crossed my mind.

340
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:36,842
This beautiful novel will
follow my masterpiece,

341
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:40,018
"War of Cranes". It's
called "Song of a Crane".

342
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:44,957
"Song of a Crane". Let's sing that song.

343
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:54,437
Sir, write a great story.

344
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:04,578
What just happened?

345
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:06,848
"Song of a Crane"!

346
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:09,142
You must start the song.
What are you doing?

347
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:11,647
This is a popular symptom of
people who died from overworking.

348
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:15,187
I forgot to mention that he
passes out within 30 seconds...

349
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:17,227
upon grabbing his pen.

350
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:19,953
What? If he keeps passing out...

351
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:21,183
every 30 seconds,

352
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:23,028
when will he finish his novel?

353
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:25,937
We must get help from another writer.

354
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,498
What? Another writer? Who?

355
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:33,033
We have a novelist who wanted
to work hard, but couldn't...

356
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,377
before he died.

357
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,173
Sir, from what I've observed so far,

358
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:41,217
your writing is superb.

359
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:43,642
But you haven't decided...

360
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:47,117
on what to write about yet.

361
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:50,288
We have a great topic as well
as an excellent teacher.

362
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:51,528
Will you...

363
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:53,858
complete a novel?

364
00:22:57,693 --> 00:23:01,897
Does that mean I'll remain as a
character in a fictional story?

365
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,963
On the records, Kim Si Ik
is known as a scholar...

366
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:07,437
who got disqualified for
writing vulgar stories.

367
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:09,078
There's only one line.

368
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,717
That will not disappear even
if you wait for 500 years.

369
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:15,477
Is that so?

370
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:18,913
But it's not fictional...

371
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,488
that you were an affectionate
husband and noble scholar.

372
00:23:21,713 --> 00:23:24,127
Remaining in this world in a novel...

373
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:26,258
is not a bad deal for me.

374
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:27,858
Is that so?

375
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:31,127
Besides, it's a novel.

376
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:34,392
Since we're at it, let's
say that he was tall...

377
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:36,292
and very handsome.

378
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,568
How will they know?

379
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:40,538
Was there anyone you thought you resembled?

380
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:41,963
There's a guy...

381
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:45,233
whom I thought to resemble me.

382
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,617
Okay. Who is it?

383
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:51,318
Young people call him Mr. Hip.

384
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:53,657
So Ji Sub?

385
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:56,588
Are you telling me that
you resemble So Ji Sub?

386
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:58,588
Come on, you...

387
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:03,967
You definitely look like him!

388
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:05,568
Yes. You look just like him.

389
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,493
I resemble him even more from this side.

390
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:09,263
Goodness, you're right.

391
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:10,792
Turn around a bit more.

392
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:13,137
Keep turning.

393
00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:14,602
Yes, that's it.

394
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:17,947
The back of your hair is
pitch black just like his.

395
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:21,003
Goodness, Mr. Kim.

396
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:23,518
You're a hip, handsome guy.

397
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:46,538
I didn't know he could do martial arts.

398
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:48,008
He sounds pretty cool.

399
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,377
Gosh, the writer romanticized
the guy too much.

400
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,348
This will be a hit.

401
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:57,917
Ms. Jang. Mr. Ku.

402
00:24:58,273 --> 00:25:00,058
The last part is complete.

403
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:02,058
Let's see.

404
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:12,367
It's good.

405
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,008
Editor-in-Chief Kim.

406
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:22,848
There's a draft of a book I
received from a rookie writer.

407
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:26,417
Check the second shelf of the
bookcase in my writing room.

408
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:31,848
The story is about a scholar
Kim Si Ik in Joseon Dynasty...

409
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:35,887
and the author's name is Bae Sung Hoon.

410
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:39,227
Yes, of course.

411
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:41,683
Right.

412
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:46,768
(Song of a Crane)

413
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:51,437
(Song of a Crane)

414
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:05,488
The books have been published...

415
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:08,717
and our two writers left
with smiles on their faces.

416
00:26:09,082 --> 00:26:12,488
I made this cocktail as a
token of my gratitude,

417
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:14,528
so please enjoy.

418
00:26:23,963 --> 00:26:26,038
I said I'm not a fan of Tears.

419
00:26:26,332 --> 00:26:29,203
Still, it's for a special
occasion this time,

420
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:30,578
so please drink up.

421
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,447
What's the meaning behind it this time?

422
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:37,288
They are tears of regretful parting.

423
00:26:47,283 --> 00:26:52,098
I, Kim Si Ik, a scholar of Joseon,
have washed away my shame.

424
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:55,798
With these tears that symbolize
my reluctance to leave,

425
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,707
I will now head to the afterlife.

426
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:02,778
Mr. Kim...

427
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:05,447
We will...

428
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:08,578
wash down our tears with this drink...

429
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:12,518
and say goodbye.

430
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,157
Thank you for everything.

431
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,818
I thank you for all your hard work
and apologize for leaving first.

432
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,288
Take care, Mr. Kim.

433
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:05,637
It's been 70 years, but
you're still like a baby.

434
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:18,788
Goodbye, Mr. Kim.

435
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:38,108
I'll get going.

436
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:06,598
(The Sanzu River)

437
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:13,377
Goodbye.

438
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,467
Ms. Jang.

439
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:44,467
Thank you for preserving my name...

440
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,203
and letting me be remembered...

441
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:48,377
as a scholar as mysterious as a crane.

442
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:52,917
These are the tears I give
to you as my gratitude.

443
00:29:53,473 --> 00:29:55,748
I hope for nothing more...

444
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:58,947
than the cold and icy moon of yours...

445
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,387
to set down in warmth.

446
00:30:04,253 --> 00:30:06,028
(To Ms. Jang)

447
00:30:23,832 --> 00:30:25,477
This tastes awful.

448
00:31:14,552 --> 00:31:16,028
Why don't you come to the hotel these days?

449
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:19,798
Why would I when it'll soon be gone?

450
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,523
I came to check if Hyun Mi had died...

451
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:25,707
because that would mean
you'd soon be leaving too.

452
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:29,808
Well, Mr. Kim left.

453
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:37,447
See? You're sad because he left too.

454
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:40,217
That's how I'll feel if you go as well.

455
00:31:40,713 --> 00:31:42,687
Please say that you'll stay.

456
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:45,657
It's sad...

457
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:47,957
that he's no longer with us,

458
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:52,598
but we sent him off with nothing but joy.

459
00:31:56,023 --> 00:31:57,637
Because nothing is sadder...

460
00:31:58,632 --> 00:32:00,078
than to stay in this world.

461
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:03,177
What's sad about being with me?

462
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:04,947
Look at me and my sister.

463
00:32:05,872 --> 00:32:08,778
Is that what you want for us?

464
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,657
Fine, leave then.

465
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,858
I can't stay and watch
you cross over though.

466
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:25,897
Kim Yu Na's parents is telling
me to go and study abroad,

467
00:32:26,463 --> 00:32:28,998
so I'll go. It's perfect, right?

468
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:31,838
You can go to the afterlife,

469
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:33,907
and I'll go abroad.

470
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,038
Let's just leave our graves behind here...

471
00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:39,477
and say our farewell.

472
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,807
Thank you.

473
00:33:13,302 --> 00:33:14,448
Excuse me.

474
00:33:19,882 --> 00:33:22,858
I've seen you watching
from outside the pharmacy.

475
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:26,158
Are you perhaps a relative
of my baby's father?

476
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,358
I was once...

477
00:33:29,822 --> 00:33:32,167
a daughter-in-law of the
Myeongju Yoon family.

478
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:39,638
My baby will never be of...

479
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:41,707
the Myeongju Yoon family.

480
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,778
It will take my surname instead.

481
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:46,847
If it's a son,

482
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:50,187
he'll be the sole heir who'll
carry on the family line.

483
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:53,618
And a daughter will equally
be the sole heir too.

484
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:55,543
They don't carry on the family line though.

485
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:58,283
Once she marries, she'll become a member...

486
00:33:58,283 --> 00:33:59,953
of her husband's family and...

487
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:01,627
Are you from Joseon or something?

488
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,127
No one thinks like that
in this day and age.

489
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:07,397
If the grandparents want to see my baby,

490
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:08,937
then I'll grant visitations.

491
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:12,037
However, whether it's a boy or a girl,

492
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:14,138
this baby will just be...

493
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,238
my child.

494
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:40,537
What's wrong?

495
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:42,437
Why...

496
00:34:43,763 --> 00:34:45,368
did I never think of that...

497
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:48,238
for my daughter?

498
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,408
I feel so sorry for her.

499
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:01,758
This child...

500
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:06,557
The child who is inside your womb...

501
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,028
I hope the child is born healthy,

502
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:12,097
and that he lives a good life.

503
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:28,147
Look.

504
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:29,548
This.

505
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:32,488
Which one should I post?

506
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:33,712
This one is good.

507
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:35,118
This one? Okay.

508
00:35:36,652 --> 00:35:39,482
You take so many photos.
Do you have any followers?

509
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:42,798
Of course. Hyun Joong, Yu Na, and Sanchez.

510
00:35:43,493 --> 00:35:44,568
That's all?

511
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:47,468
Your boiled egg looks much better.

512
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:50,393
You were taking so many pictures.

513
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:52,638
I thought you had about
a million followers.

514
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:56,548
You haven't even pressed "like" once.
You have no right to say that.

515
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:58,278
I don't do social media.

516
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,618
- Famous manager Ferguson said...
- Forget it.

517
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:04,287
I'm sure he said something great.

518
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:07,557
But that's what he thinks. I will...

519
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:12,957
What is it now?

520
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:16,127
"Like"...

521
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:19,468
He pressed "like".

522
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:22,568
Who? Sanchez?

523
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:26,838
Kim Joon Hyun.

524
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,377
Kim Joon Hyun did it.

525
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:33,477
Look at this. He pressed "like"
for the picture I posted...

526
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:35,448
about thistle rice.

527
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:38,818
(Like, Kim Joon Hyun, Follow)

528
00:36:39,013 --> 00:36:40,287
He really did.

529
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,643
You only have three followers.

530
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:44,988
How did he find your post and press "like"?

531
00:36:45,112 --> 00:36:48,522
I... I don't wish for anything more.

532
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:51,198
I have been recognized
by the master gourmet.

533
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:56,462
Since when did you like
Kim Joon Hyun so much?

534
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:57,608
What?

535
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:04,178
From the first time I saw him,

536
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,048
I liked everything about him.

537
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:08,818
He looks like someone I know.

538
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:12,988
I was going through hard times
because of my undesirable hobby.

539
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:16,218
Suddenly a young guy appeared and
saved me with the game of go.

540
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:19,028
He also recommended I go on gourmet trips.

541
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:22,798
He looks exactly like Kim Joon Hyun.

542
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:25,298
That's me.

543
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:29,468
- What are you talking about?
- I went to the lodge 200 years ago.

544
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:30,707
To get Moon Tree flower,
and I told you that.

545
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:33,537
It was me who won the go game
and drew you the gourmet map.

546
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:35,302
It was me.

547
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:36,772
Don't be ridiculous.

548
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:40,043
I remember clearly. He had a
big build like Kim Joon Hyun.

549
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:42,278
He was very nice and kind.

550
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:46,287
Even if you exaggerate,
you can even be his half.

551
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:47,718
What are you trying to do?

552
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,428
That's the way Ma Go changed your memories.

553
00:37:57,752 --> 00:38:02,198
Now I realize that we did visit
so many delicious places.

554
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:06,307
They were all good.

555
00:38:13,072 --> 00:38:16,818
Lastly, there is something you have to eat.

556
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:45,807
You have to...

557
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:48,118
eat that later.

558
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:53,488
You have to.

559
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,057
Let's eat. Naengmyeon is getting cold.

560
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:06,798
Okay. Let's eat before it gets cold.

561
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:12,937
Do you want mustard?

562
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:15,232
Kim Joon Hyun said the vinegar...

563
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:16,647
is what you must have with
Pyongyang naengmyeon.

564
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:19,778
Wasn't that Baek Jong Won?

565
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:22,072
It could be.

566
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,172
You're 1,300 years old for sure.

567
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:26,088
You are confused about what
your favorite guy said.

568
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:28,287
- How much?
- Just a little.

569
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:33,997
It looks delicious.

570
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:36,227
Aren't you adding any?

571
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:39,368
With Pyongyang naengmyeon, you
have to taste the broth first.

572
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:00,957
Of the staffers, you will
be the only one left.

573
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,827
Most of the guests are gone too.

574
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,358
Thanks for all your work.

575
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,097
- We will be going.
- Okay.

576
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:15,267
Ms. Choi.

577
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:25,707
I have to go to get Hyun Mi.

578
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:28,118
Tae Seok contacted me.

579
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:33,247
Bring your sister here.

580
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:35,787
I'll tell Ms. Jang.

581
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,917
Hyun Mi, I am here.

582
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:04,287
Hyun Joong.

583
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:20,097
Hyun Mi.

584
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:21,997
Hyun Joong.

585
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:34,278
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

586
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:40,187
Let's go.

587
00:41:58,862 --> 00:41:59,968
Yu Na.

588
00:42:36,663 --> 00:42:39,178
You are Hyun Joong's sister, Hyun Mi.

589
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:43,318
Thanks to your kind brother, you'll
leave without losing your way.

590
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:46,488
What about Yu Na?

591
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:49,618
Does she know you are leaving?

592
00:42:50,013 --> 00:42:52,358
I saw her at the hospital.

593
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,807
Could you give this to her?

594
00:43:08,732 --> 00:43:09,877
And...

595
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:11,778
Please tell her...

596
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:15,377
that each second and minute
of time left to her...

597
00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:18,118
is all so precious...

598
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,787
so she should be a good student...

599
00:43:22,243 --> 00:43:23,388
and be happy.

600
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:56,457
Ma'am.

601
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:01,127
Ma'am.

602
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:04,267
I'd be happy to give all
the time I have left.

603
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:06,528
Please grant me a favor.

604
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:29,457
Hyun Joong.

605
00:44:46,902 --> 00:44:48,207
Take this with you.

606
00:44:51,973 --> 00:44:54,218
You left flowers on my grave too.

607
00:44:55,572 --> 00:44:57,488
I got these to give to you.

608
00:44:58,313 --> 00:45:00,118
I asked Ma Go...

609
00:45:00,442 --> 00:45:03,187
and I put myself in huge
debt to get this for you.

610
00:45:04,052 --> 00:45:06,152
She told me that I have to
live a really good life...

611
00:45:06,152 --> 00:45:09,428
in order to repay her for the
favor she's done for me.

612
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:12,698
So you don't need to worry about me.

613
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:17,167
Thank you.

614
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:21,707
I won't worry.

615
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:34,158
Bye, Hyun Joong.

616
00:45:37,453 --> 00:45:38,528
Goodbye.

617
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:24,862
Why are you suddenly
meeting Mi Ra's parents?

618
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:26,138
It's like you guys are
planning to get married.

619
00:46:26,362 --> 00:46:27,537
We're...

620
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:29,937
going to get married this winter.

621
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:34,603
Then that's going to be a
really important event.

622
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:38,347
It's weird that you'd want to meet
her parents at a pizza restaurant.

623
00:46:38,743 --> 00:46:40,017
We chose this place because of you.

624
00:46:40,683 --> 00:46:43,588
You have no idea how much
my parents trust you.

625
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:45,353
Back when they came to to
the States to take me back,

626
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:47,223
all of my friends helped me hide from them,

627
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:48,658
but you told them where I was.

628
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:50,897
You won a lot of brownie points for that.

629
00:46:50,922 --> 00:46:52,468
They think you're a very honest friend.

630
00:46:52,752 --> 00:46:57,207
Well, it's nice to hear that your
parents think I'm trustworthy.

631
00:46:57,293 --> 00:46:59,592
But I still don't get why
you'd want me to be here...

632
00:46:59,592 --> 00:47:01,333
when you introduce him to your parents.

633
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:05,072
If my parents end up not liking Yeong Su,

634
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,502
you should help me convince them.

635
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:08,043
Why? It's your marriage.

636
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:09,877
And I'm not even his brother.

637
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:13,017
I don't have a family to introduce her to,

638
00:47:13,112 --> 00:47:14,988
so she must be really worried.

639
00:47:15,313 --> 00:47:17,827
Sanchez, can you be his older brother?

640
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:20,013
You should tell them what
a great guy Yeong Su is.

641
00:47:20,013 --> 00:47:21,453
It's like marketing. You
know what I mean, right?

642
00:47:21,453 --> 00:47:23,997
Actually, just tell them that I'm pregnant.

643
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,493
I'm not a gynecologist.

644
00:47:26,493 --> 00:47:28,163
I'm just an owner of a pizza restaurant.

645
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:29,738
You're being really weird.

646
00:47:30,493 --> 00:47:34,508
Mi Ra, you shouldn't lie
to your parents like that.

647
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,377
If they happen to disapprove of me,

648
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:38,577
I'll do my best to convince them.

649
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:42,017
I don't want you to feel lonely.

650
00:47:42,973 --> 00:47:44,718
I can't wait to become your family.

651
00:47:45,712 --> 00:47:46,818
Mi Ra.

652
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,798
I guess they won't have any problems
getting married this winter.

653
00:48:02,962 --> 00:48:05,793
We're so different when it comes
to choosing a refrigerator.

654
00:48:05,793 --> 00:48:07,862
It's better to have a bigger freezer.

655
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:10,477
There are so many things
to store in the freezer.

656
00:48:10,572 --> 00:48:12,933
You never eat anything
in the freezer anyway.

657
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,272
Let's just buy one that has a
big refrigerating space...

658
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:16,647
so we can eat fresh food.

659
00:48:17,842 --> 00:48:18,948
Honey.

660
00:48:20,172 --> 00:48:21,687
Do you choose me or the
refrigerating space?

661
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:25,588
Your love for me should be equal
to the size of the freezer.

662
00:48:26,982 --> 00:48:28,798
I love you as much as the
size of the North Pole.

663
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:31,767
So let's get a fridge that has
a lot of refrigerating space.

664
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:33,822
- Done.
- Just forget it.

665
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:35,397
I'm going to go take a
look at the furniture.

666
00:48:43,802 --> 00:48:45,077
Stop right there.

667
00:48:47,442 --> 00:48:48,747
Ms. Jang?

668
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:50,477
You're getting married,

669
00:48:50,813 --> 00:48:51,948
Ms. Lee?

670
00:48:52,442 --> 00:48:54,057
Did Chan Seong tell you?

671
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:56,283
Where is he? Is he here with you?

672
00:48:56,283 --> 00:48:57,957
He went to get some milk tea,

673
00:48:58,183 --> 00:48:59,258
Ms. Lee.

674
00:49:00,382 --> 00:49:02,298
I asked if you're getting married.

675
00:49:03,683 --> 00:49:06,397
Yes, we're getting married this winter.

676
00:49:06,922 --> 00:49:08,893
I'll give you an invitation
once we finish printing them.

677
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:11,238
I'd like to give you a gift first.

678
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:12,692
A gift for me?

679
00:49:12,692 --> 00:49:15,408
I wanted to give you...

680
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:17,138
an unforgettable gift.

681
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:19,778
Look.

682
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,258
Song Hwa.

683
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:36,557
Song Hwa.

684
00:49:37,453 --> 00:49:38,968
You'd better be good to Yeon Woo.

685
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:42,638
If you ever make him cry,

686
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:45,408
I'll turn your life upside
down just like that TV.

687
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:54,218
Do you like it?

688
00:49:57,543 --> 00:49:58,572
Yes.

689
00:49:58,572 --> 00:50:01,143
I'll get you this TV as a wedding gift.

690
00:50:01,183 --> 00:50:02,842
I hope you look at it...

691
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:06,127
and always remember what I just said.

692
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:15,798
What did you say to Mi Ra?

693
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:17,533
I just wished her...

694
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:20,138
a happy life with her husband
as they watch TV together.

695
00:50:27,302 --> 00:50:29,103
You gave Mi Ra a wedding gift?

696
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:30,218
Yes.

697
00:50:30,873 --> 00:50:32,847
I heard they're getting married in winter.

698
00:50:33,172 --> 00:50:35,057
I won't be able to buy
them anything in winter...

699
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:37,758
since I won't be here anymore.

700
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:50,037
Ms. Choi's leaving today.

701
00:50:58,103 --> 00:50:59,647
The full moon will be here soon.

702
00:51:04,172 --> 00:51:06,088
Your Guest House of the Moon...

703
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:08,218
will only exist...

704
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,057
up until the next full moon.

705
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:19,127
Your hands are cold.

706
00:51:20,022 --> 00:51:21,468
Should I get you a warm drink?

707
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:23,037
No.

708
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:25,108
It's nice. It feels like winter.

709
00:51:26,092 --> 00:51:28,533
But why did you get her a TV?

710
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:30,948
I noticed that the TV
could flip upside down.

711
00:51:31,902 --> 00:51:33,147
What about that?

712
00:51:33,373 --> 00:51:34,747
You don't need to know.

713
00:51:35,902 --> 00:51:37,017
You remember...

714
00:51:37,672 --> 00:51:38,917
Yeon Woo, right?

715
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:40,917
Who's Yeon Woo?

716
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:45,528
He's no longer the person
who loves you the most.

717
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:49,658
I know.

718
00:51:50,853 --> 00:51:52,167
It's Ms. Choi now.

719
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:14,218
The rooms...

720
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,917
are all empty now.

721
00:52:40,802 --> 00:52:43,647
Ms. Jang, I'll be off now.

722
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:47,957
Thank you for letting me
stay all these years...

723
00:52:49,183 --> 00:52:50,417
and protecting me.

724
00:52:51,513 --> 00:52:53,057
Thanks to you,

725
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,397
I was able to learn a big lesson...

726
00:52:57,223 --> 00:52:58,997
at a very important moment.

727
00:53:01,663 --> 00:53:02,868
Thank you.

728
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:10,537
Mr. Ku.

729
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:15,048
I was the one who suggested that
we should make you enter Room 13.

730
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:18,247
I always felt guilty about that.

731
00:53:19,672 --> 00:53:20,957
I'm sorry.

732
00:53:21,313 --> 00:53:22,557
It's okay.

733
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,158
If I didn't enter Room 13 that day,

734
00:53:27,013 --> 00:53:29,152
I wouldn't have been able
to obtain that one second.

735
00:53:29,223 --> 00:53:31,453
Even if you ever get to
obtain an entire lifetime,

736
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:34,422
don't ever let anyone see you
wearing your tiger print suit.

737
00:53:34,493 --> 00:53:36,198
It'll make you lose everything.

738
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:38,738
I'll keep that in mind.

739
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:41,238
Ms. Jang.

740
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:43,908
Now that we're about to say goodbye,

741
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:48,778
it suddenly reminds me of the day
I first came to Man Weol Lodge.

742
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,118
Where do you think you're doing?

743
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,968
Are you stealing that knife...

744
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:07,597
so you can kill everyone in that family?

745
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:14,508
My daughter...

746
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,178
The man who killed his own daughter...

747
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:21,448
just welcomed a new child.

748
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:24,178
You won't be able to kill
anyone with that knife.

749
00:54:27,982 --> 00:54:31,928
If you take this, you'll be able
to kill at least a few people.

750
00:54:33,453 --> 00:54:36,028
After that, you'll get captured
and disappear into thin air...

751
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:37,897
like you always wanted.

752
00:54:42,263 --> 00:54:44,663
But the person you actually want to kill...

753
00:54:44,663 --> 00:54:46,738
is yourself for having failed to protect...

754
00:54:47,462 --> 00:54:48,678
your precious daughter.

755
00:54:50,802 --> 00:54:52,933
You'll get to live a new
life if you stay here...

756
00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:56,077
and head to your afterlife, but
I know you don't want that.

757
00:54:56,272 --> 00:54:58,517
You already hate yourself so much.

758
00:54:59,043 --> 00:55:00,147
So...

759
00:55:01,143 --> 00:55:02,917
I'm sure you'd want to throw it
away even if you have a chance.

760
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:12,568
In a way, you may be...

761
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:15,738
the most suitable employee at this place...

762
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:20,738
since you are longing
for a perpetual death.

763
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:23,638
Do you long for the same thing?

764
00:55:27,172 --> 00:55:28,847
The deity must have chained me here...

765
00:55:30,072 --> 00:55:32,187
because that's what they saw in me.

766
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:38,588
It started that day.

767
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:42,827
As I leaned on you while
holding my grudge and waited,

768
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:45,327
I wished...

769
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:48,368
that you wouldn't change.

770
00:55:55,933 --> 00:55:57,632
Given that we were embracing the fiery pit,

771
00:55:57,632 --> 00:56:01,778
what a surprise that we are leaving
this world in a decent form.

772
00:56:02,703 --> 00:56:03,847
I'm glad for that.

773
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:08,187
As it's a happy occasion, let's not cry.

774
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:10,917
I will go with a smile.

775
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:12,758
Bye.

776
00:56:21,322 --> 00:56:22,468
Ms. Choi.

777
00:56:25,393 --> 00:56:26,667
Can I...

778
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:29,908
hug you?

779
00:56:59,132 --> 00:57:00,908
I wasn't going to cry.

780
00:57:03,103 --> 00:57:04,807
Why are you making me cry?

781
00:57:30,123 --> 00:57:32,767
There were many times when
my heart broke for you.

782
00:57:33,962 --> 00:57:35,437
I wanted...

783
00:57:37,103 --> 00:57:38,948
to hug you at least once like this.

784
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:43,517
Ms. Choi,

785
00:57:44,973 --> 00:57:47,287
you have comforted me on many occasions.

786
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:51,727
Thank you.

787
00:58:40,663 --> 00:58:48,147
(The Sanzu River)

788
00:58:53,342 --> 00:58:54,517
How much time...

789
00:58:55,482 --> 00:58:56,787
do we have left?

790
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:00,258
Today,

791
00:59:01,283 --> 00:59:03,028
around the time of a full moon,

792
00:59:03,183 --> 00:59:06,528
all the energy at the
hotel will be collected.

793
00:59:07,493 --> 00:59:09,738
Everything will disappear.

794
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:12,968
And Jang Man Weol must leave.

795
00:59:14,033 --> 00:59:15,678
I've been wanting to ask you...

796
00:59:16,263 --> 00:59:17,338
why...

797
00:59:18,703 --> 00:59:19,908
you chose me.

798
00:59:20,902 --> 00:59:23,778
Why did you choose me?

799
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:31,988
I guess that the flower
that dreams of the moon...

800
00:59:32,382 --> 00:59:36,298
hasn't shown you the last dream yet.

801
01:00:12,092 --> 01:00:13,368
I'm all alone now...

802
01:00:17,623 --> 01:00:18,838
just like how I started.

803
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:15,022
Ms. Jang, I wasn't dozing off.

804
01:01:15,022 --> 01:01:17,557
I just closed my eyes for a
second, and my legs went weak.

805
01:01:19,322 --> 01:01:21,097
That was a lie. I'm sorry.

806
01:01:23,022 --> 01:01:25,207
We have a guest coming in. You
should go back to your office.

807
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:28,707
Welcome.

808
01:01:29,203 --> 01:01:31,207
How long has it been since you passed away?

809
01:01:31,802 --> 01:01:34,877
Let me escort you to your room.
This way, please.

810
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:11,103
Ms. Jang, the guest in Room 603...

811
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:13,247
was supposed to take the bus
to the afterlife today,

812
01:02:13,342 --> 01:02:14,957
but the guest wants to
postpone it until tomorrow.

813
01:02:16,183 --> 01:02:20,358
And these are steamed buns requested
by the guest in Room 1120.

814
01:02:21,013 --> 01:02:23,727
The guest really misses the
steamed buns from childhood.

815
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:25,528
I'm going to bring these up.

816
01:02:46,272 --> 01:02:49,342
Ms. Jang, I made a new cocktail.

817
01:02:49,342 --> 01:02:50,557
Would you like to taste it?

818
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:54,258
Why don't you smell it at least?
Isn't this a pretty color?

819
01:02:54,783 --> 01:02:57,457
Come on, I didn't wash rags in this.

820
01:02:57,552 --> 01:02:59,022
Besides, let's be honest while we're at it.

821
01:02:59,022 --> 01:03:00,528
Have you ever washed a rag?

822
01:03:01,393 --> 01:03:02,592
Don't go. Stay there.

823
01:03:02,592 --> 01:03:05,008
I'll go wash the rag.
Let's compare the two.

824
01:03:05,293 --> 01:03:06,437
Stay right there.

825
01:04:56,942 --> 01:04:59,488
To send off one last guest,

826
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:03,488
you came.

827
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:21,977
Chan Seong.

828
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,008
I keep feeling sleepy.

829
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:29,178
I feel like I'm falling asleep.

830
01:05:31,712 --> 01:05:35,658
Am I this sleepy so that I can
leave as if I'm dreaming?

831
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:51,537
I'll stay by your side
even if you fall asleep.

832
01:06:31,772 --> 01:06:32,877
I've crossed...

833
01:06:34,672 --> 01:06:36,278
the long passage of time...

834
01:06:37,143 --> 01:06:38,287
and met you there,

835
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,658
embracing the flower...

836
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:45,287
that is dreaming of the moon.

837
01:06:51,893 --> 01:06:53,198
Your name means "full moon".

838
01:06:54,123 --> 01:06:55,267
It's pretty.

839
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:59,738
There's a place called the
Guest House of the Moon.

840
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:33,293
You're still here.

841
01:07:33,293 --> 01:07:34,837
Because this place still exists.

842
01:07:35,262 --> 01:07:36,437
How can I help you?

843
01:07:36,663 --> 01:07:41,078
A long time ago, I lent
a pair of scissors...

844
01:07:41,272 --> 01:07:44,517
to a bride who visited the hotel.
Do you remember?

845
01:07:46,373 --> 01:07:49,788
You said letting go requires a bigger love.

846
01:07:50,182 --> 01:07:51,927
You lent it to her to
help her do just that.

847
01:07:52,182 --> 01:07:53,458
That's right.

848
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:58,597
The thing is, I forgot
to get it back from her.

849
01:07:58,652 --> 01:08:00,068
I have it.

850
01:08:01,053 --> 01:08:02,597
My gosh!

851
01:08:03,293 --> 01:08:04,868
Thank goodness.

852
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:13,748
I should repay you for finding
this precious pair of scissors.

853
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:15,972
You deities never show
up when I need you to,

854
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:17,847
but you always return all favors.

855
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:19,418
What can I do for you?

856
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:24,512
Shall I cut the ties
between you and the one...

857
01:08:24,512 --> 01:08:25,858
who broke your heart?

858
01:08:27,883 --> 01:08:29,998
Are we still connected?

859
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:32,767
Can you see it?

860
01:08:32,953 --> 01:08:35,238
Are there still ties left to cut?

861
01:08:35,522 --> 01:08:37,337
Well, that's...

862
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:41,807
I cannot answer that.

863
01:08:45,102 --> 01:08:46,208
Forget it, then.

864
01:08:49,243 --> 01:08:50,418
There's something I want.

865
01:08:51,442 --> 01:08:53,217
I want to travel back in time.

866
01:08:54,072 --> 01:08:56,543
- That's...
- I know you can do it.

867
01:08:56,543 --> 01:08:57,858
You made me do it when it was needed.

868
01:08:59,213 --> 01:09:00,887
That's true, but...

869
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,658
It's fine even if it's for a short moment.

870
01:09:03,652 --> 01:09:04,727
Help me...

871
01:09:05,692 --> 01:09:07,297
so that I can see winter with her.

872
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:17,038
It's snowing.

873
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:26,448
Winter is really here.

874
01:10:28,072 --> 01:10:30,918
Am I still dreaming?

875
01:10:31,772 --> 01:10:35,658
We can spend this winter
together as you have hoped.

876
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,297
Where did this come from?

877
01:10:44,982 --> 01:10:47,467
Maybe from a time in our shared past...

878
01:10:48,053 --> 01:10:49,698
or from a moment we'll share in our future.

879
01:10:50,993 --> 01:10:52,267
I'm not sure which one it is.

880
01:10:53,493 --> 01:10:54,608
It's just winter...

881
01:10:56,062 --> 01:10:58,378
from one of the moments we've
shared or will spend together.

882
01:11:01,472 --> 01:11:02,618
Chan Seong.

883
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:06,147
I saw you in my dream.

884
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:20,528
Man Weol. The moon.

885
01:11:24,623 --> 01:11:25,807
Your name means "full moon".

886
01:11:28,093 --> 01:11:29,238
It's pretty.

887
01:11:37,102 --> 01:11:41,217
We actually met again...

888
01:11:42,612 --> 01:11:44,618
after the long passage of time.

889
01:11:50,283 --> 01:11:54,568
Then did we see this snow
together sometime in the past?

890
01:11:58,062 --> 01:12:00,708
I hope we'll see this snow
together sometime in our future.

891
01:12:06,003 --> 01:12:07,177
Really?

892
01:12:11,472 --> 01:12:13,647
Now, the snow looks even prettier.

893
01:13:25,049 --> 01:13:28,365
Are you going alone
without the Grim Reaper?

894
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:32,634
I was the owner of this
place for all those years.

895
01:13:34,059 --> 01:13:37,445
I will go on my own.

896
01:13:40,299 --> 01:13:41,515
You're brave.

897
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:49,084
Chan Seong.

898
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:54,225
I've pondered...

899
01:13:57,089 --> 01:13:59,065
countless times what I should tell you...

900
01:14:01,559 --> 01:14:03,235
if this moment ever came.

901
01:14:07,799 --> 01:14:09,004
"I'm sorry."

902
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,775
"Thank you."

903
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:15,315
"Have a good life."

904
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,884
I came up with a lot of
cool stuff to tell you.

905
01:14:24,879 --> 01:14:26,954
Now that it's time, my mind went blank.

906
01:14:30,349 --> 01:14:31,494
I just...

907
01:14:35,259 --> 01:14:37,605
I keep wanting to stay with you.

908
01:14:41,929 --> 01:14:43,874
I keep wanting to see you.

909
01:14:48,299 --> 01:14:50,815
And I don't want to leave you behind here.

910
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,225
I'm the one who can't stay strong.

911
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:04,219
When I'm the weak one,

912
01:15:04,219 --> 01:15:06,065
I pretended to be strong in front of you.

913
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:09,865
I even made it impossible for you...

914
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,605
to stop me from leaving.

915
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:23,914
I'm sorry.

916
01:15:41,389 --> 01:15:42,605
It was right here.

917
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,874
You told me not to be
lonely when I saw you off.

918
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:49,504
Was it all for an act?

919
01:15:49,929 --> 01:15:53,214
Back then, I didn't know
I'd like you this much.

920
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,084
I...

921
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,754
I also didn't know I would
fall in love once again...

922
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:04,185
like a fool.

923
01:16:18,959 --> 01:16:22,275
I've never thought about...

924
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:25,445
the future before.

925
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:30,214
But the only thing I can tell you now...

926
01:16:31,709 --> 01:16:33,284
is this.

927
01:16:41,519 --> 01:16:42,594
Let's...

928
01:16:44,019 --> 01:16:46,134
meet in our next lives...

929
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,805
no matter what.

930
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,475
Okay?

931
01:16:56,929 --> 01:16:58,044
Yes?

932
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,325
Chan Seong.

933
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,964
You looked into me,

934
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,634
took care of me,

935
01:17:21,759 --> 01:17:23,034
and protected me.

936
01:17:26,629 --> 01:17:27,874
And I thank you for that.

937
01:17:33,269 --> 01:17:34,544
Goodbye.

938
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,584
Goodbye, Man Weol.

939
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,584
(The Sanzu River)

940
01:21:01,009 --> 01:21:04,025
My dear moon disappeared
after swallowing up...

941
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:05,994
my night and dream.

942
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:08,954
Bye.

943
01:21:17,889 --> 01:21:19,704
Feeling sad and disappointed...

944
01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:23,044
is only natural when
witnessing disappearances.

945
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:26,540
When a flower withers away,

946
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,975
just like it dreams of new blossom,

947
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:33,784
you'll live, meet,

948
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:36,384
and love again.

949
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,395
I hope...

950
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,594
that is the answer you
two, an arrogant, foolish,

951
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,765
and self-pitying,

952
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:49,634
yet beautiful lovers, have chosen.

953
01:23:44,809 --> 01:23:49,655
Merry Christmas!

954
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,185
It's cold.

955
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:53,055
Chan Seong.

956
01:23:55,719 --> 01:23:58,025
Chan Seong. It's so freezing.

957
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,690
Hey, it's gotten really cold.

958
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:02,435
New York's just as cold as Seoul, so
don't forget your winter clothes.

959
01:24:03,259 --> 01:24:05,959
Can you send my things once I settle down?

960
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:08,775
Sure. Take what you can and I'll
bring the rest when I visit.

961
01:24:09,099 --> 01:24:10,374
How about lunch tomorrow?

962
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:13,244
Actually, I have plans.

963
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:42,504
- Have you been well, Yu Na?
- Yes.

964
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,530
How did you do on your exam?
Do you have a major in mind?

965
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:47,115
Hotel management.

966
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,615
I'm going to become a hotelier too.

967
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:52,145
You must've gotten a good score then.

968
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,315
I probably will next year.

969
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:58,080
Seeing spirits and all...

970
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,594
interfered with my studying, you see.

971
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:03,124
Thanks to the medicine you gave me though,

972
01:25:03,519 --> 01:25:05,424
I don't see them anymore.

973
01:25:05,849 --> 01:25:08,395
It made me focus on studying.

974
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,830
I'm glad to hear that.

975
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:12,305
Did you also take that
medicine you gave me?

976
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:16,945
You don't see the spirits now, right?

977
01:25:36,519 --> 01:25:38,395
Would the tiger have seen
all that it wanted...

978
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:40,594
after returning to the painting?

979
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,490
He almost lived a dream...

980
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,305
by seeing what others couldn't,

981
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,744
which made him lucky.

982
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,065
The memories of a secretive world...

983
01:26:17,629 --> 01:26:19,504
others don't know about.

984
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:24,945
It is where you are.

985
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:28,914
And I...

986
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:32,884
still remember my promise to you.

987
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:44,685
("Existence and Time")

988
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:15,185
("Existence and Time")

989
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:34,105
You're early.

990
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,275
I thought you'd be late.

991
01:28:38,129 --> 01:28:39,544
I hurried over...

992
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,615
so that you wouldn't wait.

993
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:47,784
Some day...

994
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,124
Some day...

995
01:28:53,179 --> 01:28:57,025
If we reunite in some
life far down the road...

996
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:04,004
When that day comes, I hope
to always be with you.

997
01:29:09,059 --> 01:29:13,374
We will dream together holding
each other in our gazes,

998
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,384
embrace each other, and laugh together...

999
01:29:17,309 --> 01:29:18,844
as we...

1000
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:23,325
live happily ever after side by side.

1001
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:58,525
(Thank you for watching Hotel Del Luna.)

1002
01:30:32,049 --> 01:30:35,954
(Hotel Del Luna)

1003
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:07,994
I'm about to make an
important announcement,

1004
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,025
so where is everyone?

1005
01:31:10,349 --> 01:31:13,565
Is the sixth still living in Joseon?

1006
01:31:14,019 --> 01:31:15,395
Unbelievable.

1007
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:19,830
Why is it that all 12 of us
are never able to congregate?

1008
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:21,834
It's not like you're that busy.

1009
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,044
You can address those who
are not here separately.

1010
01:31:26,599 --> 01:31:27,914
So what's this announcement?

1011
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:33,015
I have chosen a surprising new owner...

1012
01:31:33,309 --> 01:31:37,784
for the Guest House of the Moon.

1013
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:41,379
Wandering souls...

1014
01:31:41,379 --> 01:31:43,794
that have nowhere else to go...

1015
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:47,565
must have a place to stay in
order to tell their stories.

1016
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,405
So what's the name of the new hotel?

1017
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:54,475
Oh, that. Well, it's...

1018
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,244
What was it again?

1019
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:02,945
Wait. What's wrong with me?

1020
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:04,985
Why can't I remember?

1021
01:33:13,309 --> 01:33:14,555
The moon has ascended.

1022
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:17,624
Let's open our doors.
