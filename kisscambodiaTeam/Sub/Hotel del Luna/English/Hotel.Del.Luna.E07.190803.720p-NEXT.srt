00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:13,418
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:28,191
Boss, what are you doing out here?

3
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:32,618
This place has the nicest view of the moon.

4
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,604
Princess Song Hwa is here to see you.

5
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:32,848
Why are you leaving?

6
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:34,685
Didn't you come to the castle to see me?

7
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,112
No.

8
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:39,317
I came to steal.

9
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:41,463
A clumsy man is keeping guard,

10
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,266
so I thought it'd be a
great night to steal.

11
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:48,077
I thought I managed to run
into someone I missed.

12
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,270
But I guess I just ran into a thief.

13
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:56,467
What did you steal?

14
00:01:57,913 --> 00:02:00,942
This belongs to someone very precious.

15
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:06,240
I guess you came to see me yourself
because I didn't show up...

16
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:07,749
while you were drinking.

17
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:09,573
Forget it.

18
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,262
It seemed like you were busy
trying to seduce that lady.

19
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,282
You should get going.

20
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:20,384
You saw that?

21
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:25,050
But did it really seem like
I was the one seducing her?

22
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,010
She was the one seducing me.

23
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:32,114
You're one lucky guy. You even get
drinks from someone so noble.

24
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:35,177
I like this better.

25
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:37,445
And it's mine too.

26
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,814
I'm going...

27
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:43,845
to confiscate this.

28
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:48,381
It seems like you already
stole what you were here for.

29
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,425
So you should go back.

30
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,702
The guards are very alert
due to the rebel forces,

31
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:57,824
so it's very dangerous.

32
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:01,914
I'll pay for the bottle
the next time we meet.

33
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:50,615
At this rate, the tree will
soon be covered with flowers.

34
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:57,203
Chan Seong will put on airs
again when he sees this.

35
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,625
He's trying to scare me.

36
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:45,885
Are you enjoying this? I'm hot, aren't I?

37
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:07,422
Are you enjoying this?

38
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:26,874
Out of the way!

39
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:30,348
My gosh.

40
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:44,120
Hey, what was that guy
doing in the ladies' room?

41
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,873
I don't know. He must be a pervert.

42
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:47,494
"The ladies' room"?

43
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,084
I definitely got the chills.

44
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:03,574
I wonder why.

45
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,007
Is this possessed or something?

46
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:26,545
You're a ghost who's living
inside a human's body.

47
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,317
Did you just do that?

48
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,225
You should be in the afterlife.

49
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:46,233
This is the punishment for
corrupting the order of this world.

50
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,763
You must cease to exist immediately.

51
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:00,912
She didn't do that.

52
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:04,983
She is just a spirit...

53
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:07,777
Man Weol has decided to keep alive.

54
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:10,898
She is not an evil spirit
that has harmed humans.

55
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:20,762
Why has a lowly spirit taken over...

56
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,032
a body and going around like this?

57
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:24,303
The owner of the body...

58
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:26,821
has died due to the foolish
choice of her parents.

59
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:30,477
Man Weol let her spirit
live in an empty body.

60
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:33,193
Strictly speaking, she has
not harmed any human.

61
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:40,352
Man Weol has done a peculiar thing again.

62
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,778
Hurry up and leave here.

63
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:53,273
A human was harmed here just now.

64
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:54,902
It's a ghost I have been looking for also.

65
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:57,075
It has harmed a human,
so it is an evil spirit.

66
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:59,688
Get rid of it as soon as you catch it.

67
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:01,070
The other Ma Go has told me...

68
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:04,267
to find it and put it
back where it used to be.

69
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,338
Hotel Del Luna again?

70
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,014
It was a guest there.

71
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:10,813
When ghosts are wandering around,
you should capture all of them.

72
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:14,253
Then take them to the other world
instead of letting them have a rest.

73
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,783
Is the path to the other
world an expressway?

74
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,423
Why do they need a rest area?

75
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,022
Why did she have to create such a thing...

76
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:23,358
and entrust it to an evil
spirit like Jang Man Weol?

77
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,953
Strictly speaking, she
is not an evil spirit.

78
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,202
And...

79
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:30,926
she will also go to the other world soon.

80
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:32,064
So I was told.

81
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,443
I heard the one who will guide
her to the other world...

82
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:36,208
has been sent there.

83
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,843
They want to...

84
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:44,340
send Man Weol so easily to the other world?

85
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:49,260
Her soul can't go to the
other world so easily.

86
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:52,240
Her ill-fated relationship of
this life will be repeated.

87
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:57,535
She will hurt humans again,

88
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:01,352
and she will be sent to the
afterlife as an evil spirit.

89
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm glad you're leaving
here after a good rest.

90
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:16,158
If you had found your
wife who died with you,

91
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:18,239
you could have departed together.

92
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:21,457
I hope you will reunite
with her in the afterlife.

93
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:25,204
The platform for the afterlife is this way.
I'll take you there.

94
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,659
Honey?

95
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:35,699
Honey.

96
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,048
What are you doing here?

97
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:39,271
I'm here because I'm dead.

98
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:42,445
Do you know how much I looked
for you as soon as I died?

99
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,418
You're dead too?

100
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,528
I thought you were saved.

101
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:49,174
What... who is that guy?

102
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,515
Are you having an affair with that
young guy as soon as you died?

103
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:53,579
Be careful what you say!

104
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:56,215
It's because he died early. He
is three years older than you!

105
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,319
Sweetheart.

106
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,931
- "Sweetheart"?
- What?

107
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:02,661
Who are you?

108
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:04,657
Who are you?

109
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,205
Don't you dare touch him!

110
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,705
He is my first love!

111
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,167
Are you crazy?

112
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:12,668
You can't do this.

113
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:13,717
Yes, I'm crazy.

114
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:15,418
Don't you dare touch him,
and just go your way.

115
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:16,469
I'm going to kill you!

116
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,757
He is already dead.

117
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:20,878
You don't need to kill him.

118
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,013
Let me go. I will kill him!

119
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:29,888
Mr. Ku!

120
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,049
I'll kill you.

121
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,504
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

122
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,492
Let him go.

123
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:54,058
In our hotel, we provide
all the services...

124
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:55,455
our guests desire.

125
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,757
You are already dead.

126
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,919
It is not difficult for you to die again.

127
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,981
Kill her as much as you
want until you feel better.

128
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:05,560
Now...

129
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:07,834
what do you want to kill her with?

130
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:09,888
Please choose.

131
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,848
Sir, stab and pierce here.

132
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:17,658
Ma'am, you can't just stand still.

133
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,168
Chop him properly.

134
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,105
This way please.

135
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:25,274
Now, there will a lot of blood
and fleshes everywhere.

136
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:26,610
Everyone take a step back.

137
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,958
You are all dead.

138
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,425
But you can inflict deadly pain
on the other person's soul.

139
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:38,637
Please hack away the time you lived
together to your heart's content.

140
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:41,507
Slash it, tear it,

141
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:42,629
and destroy it.

142
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:46,710
We will do our best to help
you vent out your grudges.

143
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,723
What are you doing? When someone fights,

144
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,977
you should try to stop them and
persuade them to live happily.

145
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,374
What do you think you're doing?

146
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,985
How can you live happily?

147
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,383
You are already dead.

148
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,845
You don't even have one second to live.

149
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:04,353
Just vent out your grudges.

150
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:07,357
Whether you hack each
other, or bathe in blood,

151
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:10,122
enjoy to your hearts' content. Bye.

152
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:19,327
- That's enough.
- Stop fighting.

153
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:22,400
Stop now.

154
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:25,441
Stay still.

155
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:27,175
Take them away.

156
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:43,393
They were lovebirds when they were alive.
Such a pity.

157
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:46,467
Her first love, whom she truly loved, died.

158
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,977
She married some random
guy, out of despair.

159
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,165
Untimely union took place
in front of death's door.

160
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:55,908
Remember the last time when the
guests who had debt problems...

161
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,234
met here and caused a great commotion?

162
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,178
They have no use of money after death.

163
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,548
But they fought like cats and dogs.

164
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,918
Whether it's big or small,
they had resentment.

165
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:06,028
Fighting is a way of releasing resentment.

166
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,453
Here is patbingsu.

167
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,825
I'll be going to release the
resentment of the wife.

168
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:18,198
She wants to have the patbingsu
that she had with her first love...

169
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,002
on their first date.

170
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,538
What is it?

171
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:37,487
It's soju and toasted laver you
enjoyed when you were alive.

172
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:40,547
I heard from your wife that she
always prepared them for you.

173
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:43,111
She's so mean.

174
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,025
It's a fickle question to
ask in this situation...

175
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:52,401
but don't you have anyone in your heart?

176
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:56,893
I don't. For me, my wife was my first love.

177
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,375
Feels like she betrayed me.

178
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,677
You are already dead.

179
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,747
I'm glad the guests have calmed down.

180
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:13,981
You were hit, weren't you? You have
to be careful of angry ghosts.

181
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:15,658
It didn't hurt that much.

182
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:18,483
That's not important. You
were hit by an evil grudge.

183
00:14:19,097 --> 00:14:21,719
- "Grudge"?
- The grudge of that guest...

184
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:24,624
has hit you.

185
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:27,822
It could have been dangerous.

186
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:32,014
But Ms. Jang was watching
it, so you'll be fine.

187
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,203
Ms. Jang?

188
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:50,328
She probably came because of the commotion.

189
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:53,627
Whether the guests fight
or have a bloody battle,

190
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,739
she hardly ever cares about it.

191
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:57,727
But she stepped up today.

192
00:14:57,727 --> 00:15:00,318
I think she did that because she
was worried you'd be hit again.

193
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:02,061
Well...

194
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:05,844
I don't get beaten up by others.

195
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,948
Since you were hit by a ghost,

196
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:11,121
you should sprinkle some salt
to ward off evil influence.

197
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:12,338
Like this.

198
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,242
She told me she would protect me.

199
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:21,786
She really did protect me.

200
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,280
But it's a little...

201
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,355
embarrassing.

202
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:39,005
(Hotel Del Luna)

203
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,838
It's the ocean.

204
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:50,748
The ocean looks beautiful.

205
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,936
I'm a little sad now.

206
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:58,064
The ocean looks...

207
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:00,261
more beautiful now...

208
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,919
than the one before.

209
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:32,618
Ms. Jang.

210
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,028
I came to check something.

211
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,833
If you're going to nag, do it later.

212
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:39,235
My nail looks great for once.

213
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:41,839
If this gets ruined, I'll kill you.

214
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,008
Goodness.

215
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:47,068
I can't believe you got beaten
up by a spirit like a loser.

216
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,078
That's the color of the blue sea.

217
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,567
Yes, they're pretty, aren't they?

218
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:57,067
They are. Very sadly.

219
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:03,230
Is this the reason...

220
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:08,379
why the sea looked sad?
Because there was no yacht?

221
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:10,509
Goodness, it got here?

222
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,867
It was sent from Norway, so I
thought it would take a while.

223
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,948
But it got here quickly. Give it to me.

224
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,260
Are you going to buy that?

225
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:21,534
I sold all of my cars. I
could use at least a yacht.

226
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:23,647
You don't have any place
to go in that yacht.

227
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:25,218
Of course, I have places to go.

228
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,779
What's that thing called?

229
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,187
Right, "The Fishermen and the City".

230
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:32,216
They go around the country
on a boat catching fish.

231
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:35,457
Don't worry. I have many
places to go in a yacht.

232
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:37,701
What about the money? Can you afford it?

233
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,957
That's the problem.

234
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:44,885
That painting of Baekdu tiger.
Is no one willing to buy that?

235
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,804
Try to sell it for a quarter of the price.

236
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,508
You can't get a yacht.

237
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:49,768
If you want to go fishing,

238
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,707
I'll take you to a fishing
hole in Wolmi Island.

239
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:52,838
We can get there in a car.

240
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,177
You sold all of my cars.

241
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:55,647
We have two of them left.

242
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:57,586
What? You said I still have three.

243
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:01,127
Right, three of them. I got confused.

244
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,676
Gosh, you scared me.

245
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:04,670
I'm so relieved.

246
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:05,938
Aren't you glad?

247
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,282
Then let's drive to Wolmi Island.
I'll find a great restaurant too.

248
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:10,948
I will...

249
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:13,490
cancel this request myself.

250
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,114
Everything got ruined
in the perfect timing.

251
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:29,907
Blue and Wolmi Island
don't really go together.

252
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:34,269
Wolmi Island is famous for
the ride, Ghost Pang Pang.

253
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:37,803
I'll switch to a color that
stands out a bit more.

254
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:40,938
Wolmi Island.

255
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:59,345
(Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you.)

256
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:06,710
She told me to sprinkle salt, so
seasoned salt should be fine, right?

257
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:19,680
Chan Seong, what are you up to?

258
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:21,750
Hey.

259
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,568
You didn't go to the store yet?

260
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,434
I'm about to leave. What's that?

261
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:28,407
Oh, salt.

262
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,907
What are you doing with that?
Did something awful happen?

263
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:33,661
I heard it's great to sprinkle
salt to prevent evil influence.

264
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:36,565
"Evil influence"? You aren't
talking about Mi Ra, are you?

265
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,136
Did Mi Ra steal your credit card again?

266
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,767
Did she borrow money under your name?

267
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:45,101
Yes, Mi Ra did that to me long ago.

268
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,718
I just remembered how angry I was.

269
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:48,857
Hey, forget the seasoned salt.

270
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,765
There's Himalayan pink salt.
Do you want it?

271
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:53,039
I don't need to use such
good salt to do this.

272
00:19:53,228 --> 00:19:54,726
Seasoned salt should be enough.

273
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,616
Give it to me. I'll cover
every single inch.

274
00:19:58,127 --> 00:19:59,157
Okay.

275
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,508
Hey, Sanchez. You're
seasoning me a bit too much.

276
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:08,038
You aren't making kimchi right now.

277
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:11,073
It's stuck. It won't come out.

278
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:12,799
Really?

279
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,676
Will Man Weol buy the yacht?

280
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,058
You set her up with the
yacht company in Norway?

281
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:23,357
I uploaded a picture of my
yacht on my social media,

282
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:26,097
she saw that and asked me where
I got it, so I told her.

283
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:28,768
She was going to get
something that expensive?

284
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:30,397
She's the owner of your hotel.

285
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,667
She can afford that much.

286
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,799
I was going to let her
join our yacht club too.

287
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,407
Your yacht club? The wealthy
people's social club?

288
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:39,877
It's going to help her
with her business too.

289
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:41,642
She's not dating anyone, is she?

290
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:44,278
Why do you ask?

291
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:45,748
I want to set her up
with one of our members.

292
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,917
If it's a yacht club, you
should go ride on a yacht.

293
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,387
Why are you setting people up?

294
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:52,117
People meet partners for
their businesses...

295
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,718
and their lives in such clubs.

296
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,625
That's where I met Veronica.

297
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,049
What do you think about him?

298
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,987
Don't you think he's a good match for her?

299
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:03,127
He's way too thin.

300
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,611
- He is?
- Ms. Jang likes...

301
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:09,607
someone like Kim Joon Hyun.
A type like Kim Joon Hyun.

302
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,678
People who can eat five dumplings at once.

303
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:14,734
Really? In that case, what about him?
He's okay, right?

304
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,078
He looks way too young.

305
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,218
He's well over 30.

306
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:24,447
Ms. Jang is older than you think.

307
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:27,039
No matter what you expect,
she's older than that.

308
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:28,258
He's way too young.

309
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:30,573
In that case, who could be the best?

310
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,728
Sanchez, Ms. Jang has no
money to buy a yacht.

311
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:35,867
She doesn't qualify to
be a part of the club.

312
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:39,068
So don't set her up with them. Don't do it.

313
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:41,468
In that case, she can join our
tennis club or golf club...

314
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,238
instead of the yacht club, or...

315
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:44,493
Sanchez.

316
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,269
Since when were you into sports?

317
00:21:51,947 --> 00:21:53,446
You're such a sportsman.

318
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:59,230
But Ms. Jang isn't interested in sports.
Leave her alone.

319
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:07,093
Where's the Himalayan pink salt?

320
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:08,523
Over there.

321
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:11,970
He must like her.

322
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,857
Goodness, he made a mess here.

323
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,494
Gosh, this is sweet. Hey, this is sugar.

324
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,508
Did you sprinkle sugar on yourself?

325
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,924
Man, you'll get cockroach in here.

326
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:50,738
This is the punishment for
corrupting the order of this world.

327
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:52,615
You must cease to exist immediately.

328
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,219
She has grown really weak.

329
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:11,802
I'm going to take over her body.

330
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:13,783
Hey. Hey!

331
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:25,130
No! Stop!

332
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:26,627
No!

333
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,429
Hey.

334
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:33,542
Come here.

335
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,675
Is she okay?

336
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,558
Did she go insane?

337
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:39,788
Did she go crazy?

338
00:23:39,788 --> 00:23:40,788
What are we going to do?

339
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:42,187
Should we call the teacher?

340
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,657
Hey, we should call 911.

341
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,597
Hey, report this.

342
00:23:45,597 --> 00:23:47,261
Should we talk to her?

343
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:49,268
Maybe she really sees ghosts.

344
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:51,674
- Can you please step aside?
- Oh, no.

345
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:03,699
Stop it.

346
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:06,405
No. No way.

347
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,433
Mi Na, it's me.

348
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,255
You can come out now.

349
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,478
It's okay.

350
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:47,739
Let's go.

351
00:24:56,298 --> 00:24:58,369
Is there a place where she
can lie down and rest?

352
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,275
The nurse's office is at
the end of the hallway.

353
00:25:00,437 --> 00:25:01,591
Thanks.

354
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:34,799
Something must've happened to her.

355
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:48,151
It was the fourth Ma Go that
hurt our intern, wasn't it?

356
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:49,915
The fourth one in the black dress.

357
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:51,984
Don't dare to number the deities.

358
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,422
Though they look different,
they're one with greater plans.

359
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,444
Don't you think it's lame to say
that they have greater plans...

360
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,136
when they don't even appear in
the way humans want them to?

361
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,561
What Ma Go wanted...

362
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,285
was the vengeful ghost that
stayed as a guest at the hotel.

363
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:09,858
If Ma Go finds it, will she get rid of it?

364
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:12,560
Another Ma Go wants to bring it to rest.

365
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,073
The greater plans of the deities
are always so confusing.

366
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:19,462
Everything you've seen...

367
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:21,642
is all the same after all.

368
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:26,651
The first one that wants me to die...

369
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:28,357
and the fourth one that wants...

370
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:29,887
to destroy me once I
become an evil spirit...

371
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,840
You're right, they're all deities.

372
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:35,777
But who do you think is stronger?

373
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:38,268
The 1st one, or the 4th one?

374
00:26:38,268 --> 00:26:39,389
Don't dare...

375
00:26:40,338 --> 00:26:42,001
to number the deities.

376
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:44,900
Say what you want.

377
00:26:45,707 --> 00:26:48,329
Whoever is stronger,
they only have one goal.

378
00:26:49,347 --> 00:26:52,581
Anyway, I will have to leave here.

379
00:27:01,657 --> 00:27:03,697
- What's that?
- What I want.

380
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,838
(Group Chat)

381
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:17,519
Yu Na felt something from the cellphone.

382
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,224
I think the guest in Room
13 harmed a human...

383
00:27:20,478 --> 00:27:23,945
by spreading a video through the network.

384
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,018
We'll only know when we watch the video.

385
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,647
But to summon the spirit,

386
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:34,035
we'll need to use a human as bait.

387
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,652
Who will we get to open it?

388
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:38,711
No one comes to my mind.

389
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:42,446
Isn't there just one person
here who we can use as bait?

390
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:45,390
Get Chan Seong.

391
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:54,261
No.

392
00:27:56,748 --> 00:27:58,481
Based on what's being
said in the group chat,

393
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:00,759
I'm sure it's sex tape
filmed without consent.

394
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,617
Filming such content is a criminal offense,

395
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:04,117
so is watching it.

396
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,988
I'll never watch anything like this, ever.

397
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:19,321
What a great man. What a smart man you are.

398
00:28:21,697 --> 00:28:25,002
But you have to be brave.
We have to find a ghost.

399
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,338
With this?

400
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,796
That belongs to the guest
that stayed in Room 13.

401
00:28:29,947 --> 00:28:32,395
We have to open it to find the spirit.

402
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:33,917
Then you're saying that the
guest has become vengeful...

403
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:37,355
after being involved in an incident
like the video in this phone?

404
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:41,671
The video can be inappropriate,
or it may be terrifying.

405
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:43,579
Are you up for it?

406
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,248
(The video that went viral online?
I haven't watched it yet.)

407
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:15,611
I see an empty room.

408
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:17,708
There's nothing.

409
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:25,404
Yu Na said that she felt
something when the phone rang.

410
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:26,962
This is where she was.

411
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,829
Here.

412
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:41,453
I can still feel the
spite of the ghost here.

413
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:43,713
She created this room.

414
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:46,604
So you're saying that this wasn't
an illegally filmed content?

415
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:48,108
No,

416
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:52,436
this is just a room that's built
with the spite of a spirit.

417
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,029
There must be a few more like this.

418
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:57,397
Yu Na said that she felt something eerie...

419
00:29:57,397 --> 00:29:59,038
even before the man played the video.

420
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:01,568
She sent the video only to her targets.

421
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:04,494
Then there must be a next one.

422
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,702
Where could she be right now?

423
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,508
Probably she has sent a video of a room...

424
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:10,139
that looks just like
this to the next target.

425
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,347
And she must be waiting for
a man to play the video,

426
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:13,908
then she will kill the man.

427
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:31,197
Get off the phone when you're with Mi Ran.

428
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:34,299
It's for work. I have to
send something to a client.

429
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:45,114
(Group Chat)

430
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,241
Honey.

431
00:31:22,818 --> 00:31:24,348
Honey!

432
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,817
It has been five years
since my sister died,

433
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:37,279
but the video is still found online.

434
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:39,867
You must be quite familiar...

435
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,122
if you've been looking into the
case of victims of such videos.

436
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,474
There's no way we can get the
videos off the Internet.

437
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:45,489
Right.

438
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,278
Did those that distributed
the video get punished?

439
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:50,429
Punished?

440
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:54,638
All they had to do was pay
some fines when Ga Young died.

441
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,128
Is this man related to the incident?

442
00:32:03,627 --> 00:32:05,260
He studied with my sister in college.

443
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:08,998
The video was being shared in
the group chat for students.

444
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:10,253
That's where the video was leaked.

445
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:22,555
People at school that she saw every day...

446
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,297
watched the video together.

447
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:32,068
- Look at that.
- Amazing.

448
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:36,528
Do you remember who watched the video?

449
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:37,957
How can I forget?

450
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,691
I remember the names of every single one.

451
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:42,517
Had just one of them
told us about the video,

452
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,331
we would've prevented it from
spreading all over online.

453
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:45,921
Then maybe my sister...

454
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,261
wouldn't have died.

455
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,115
My sister locked herself in
her room like a lunatic...

456
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:57,365
and looked all over online to see
if she could find any more...

457
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,248
videos of herself. She was slowly dying.

458
00:33:00,248 --> 00:33:01,641
(The Queen of Mechanical Engineering
Will Show You What She's Got.)

459
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,149
As a spirit,

460
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,579
she must be in peace free from pains.
Right?

461
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,500
I truly...

462
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:29,031
hope so as well.

463
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,968
The man that filmed the
video and sold it...

464
00:33:54,968 --> 00:33:56,875
was also a member of the group chat.

465
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:04,130
What's funny...

466
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,718
is that the man now owns a
video-sharing platform,

467
00:34:06,718 --> 00:34:08,483
earning loads of money and
living his best life.

468
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:23,537
He really is living his best life.
So good that I want to kill him.

469
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,446
Don't get so mad. It'll drain your energy.

470
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,800
This is delicious. Try some.

471
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:33,127
No thanks.

472
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:36,665
The last one is always the best one.

473
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:40,983
See? The vengeful spirit left
the best one for the last too.

474
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,328
That's why I'm sure she'll come for him.

475
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,448
All we need to do is just to
take the phone to our hotel...

476
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:47,192
before the video is sent to his cellphone.

477
00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:49,627
Really?

478
00:34:49,627 --> 00:34:52,137
Do you think she will really leave
the last target here and follow us?

479
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:57,599
I can't believe he's so well off
after doing such terrible things.

480
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:00,266
Life is unfair.

481
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,095
That's why I don't like living.

482
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,967
As I said, the last one
is always the best one.

483
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:20,461
You're the general manager
of Hotel Del Luna?

484
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:22,649
Del Luna.

485
00:35:24,258 --> 00:35:26,093
It must be new.

486
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:29,010
No, it's been around for a very long time.

487
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:32,838
Are you here to upload an
advertisement on our website?

488
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:33,889
No.

489
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,606
We're here on behalf of our guest.

490
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:38,133
She desperately...

491
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,010
wishes to meet you.

492
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:42,299
Me?

493
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:46,468
Who is she? Why does she want to meet me?

494
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,071
She's someone...

495
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,289
who holds a lot of resentment toward you.

496
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:52,938
Toward me?

497
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:58,010
I never did anything for anyone
to feel that way toward me.

498
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:03,891
What are you doing?

499
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:07,511
You have a really nice yacht.

500
00:36:08,238 --> 00:36:10,073
I'm also planning to buy one like yours.

501
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:12,438
She's the hotel owner.

502
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:18,448
My gosh, you've traveled to
so many incredible places.

503
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:20,488
I should've gone to these
places before I had died.

504
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:24,073
That's enough.

505
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:27,511
It's rude to take photos of
someone's private space...

506
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:28,940
without their permission.

507
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:30,909
Really?

508
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:37,830
What... What was that?

509
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,340
You have a wedgie.

510
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,408
Hey.

511
00:36:43,408 --> 00:36:45,307
How much does it cost to upload...

512
00:36:45,307 --> 00:36:48,877
an illicit photo like this on your website?

513
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:51,418
10 cents? 20 cents?

514
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:55,079
I wonder how many of these
photos need to get uploaded...

515
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:58,549
for you to be able to buy a yacht
and travel to all those places?

516
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:02,676
- About a million?
- Are you digging into something?

517
00:37:03,428 --> 00:37:05,732
Are you guys reporters? Or cops?

518
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,493
The hotel was just a lie, wasn't it?

519
00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:12,568
No wonder I had never heard of it.

520
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:14,781
I guess we should invite you one day...

521
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:16,570
in order to show you that it wasn't a lie.

522
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,138
Get out of here immediately...

523
00:37:20,877 --> 00:37:22,336
before I call the guards.

524
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:30,711
Whenever...

525
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:33,191
you see our hotel,

526
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:37,083
please feel free to come inside.

527
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:40,848
Let's go.

528
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:44,598
(Always do your best. The deity
will take care of the rest.)

529
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,883
"Always do your best."

530
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,381
"The deity will take care of the rest."

531
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:55,084
Seriously? You believe this kind of stuff?

532
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:59,953
I'm a very religious man.

533
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:06,413
If the deity gave you this kind
of life even after what you did,

534
00:38:08,818 --> 00:38:10,592
it just shows how
unreasonable that deity is.

535
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,202
It's his cell phone.

536
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,548
Good job, Chan Seong.

537
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:39,048
We need to get to the hotel before
the video is sent to the phone.

538
00:38:39,048 --> 00:38:40,210
We should hurry.

539
00:38:45,988 --> 00:38:48,914
Chan Seong did his best
regardless of how weak he is.

540
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:52,359
I wonder what the deity will do to him.

541
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:07,833
It's been ages. Why isn't
the video file here yet?

542
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:09,783
Is the cell phone out of battery?

543
00:39:09,888 --> 00:39:11,928
The Wi-Fi here works just fine.

544
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:15,574
The others definitely got the
video through their cell phones.

545
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:18,878
There are other routes...

546
00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:22,370
to send video files other
than just cell phones.

547
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,402
Did you check the CCTV footages?

548
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,008
Those people who came in the afternoon...

549
00:39:33,008 --> 00:39:34,976
definitely stole my cell phone.

550
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:38,673
The CCTV footage during that time
all got deleted for some reason.

551
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:41,098
Are you kidding me?

552
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,894
We have so many CCTVs.

553
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:46,745
You'd better find it no matter what.

554
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,308
Yes, sir.

555
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:16,236
I guess she can send the video
file through other routes.

556
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:18,239
I should go back there.

557
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:20,803
Chan Seong, your job is done here.

558
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,231
The rest will be taken care of.

559
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:27,973
What do you mean? By whom?

560
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:30,899
Ma Go will show up there.

561
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:36,693
I'm curious to know in
what form she'll appear.

562
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,143
I wonder if she'll be merciful...

563
00:40:39,913 --> 00:40:41,207
or cruel.

564
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:50,228
(CEO, Jung Eun Seok)

565
00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:04,519
(Here's the video you've been waiting for.)

566
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:16,072
What's this?

567
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,314
It's not the CCTV footage of my office.

568
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:20,843
What is this?

569
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:36,825
My gosh, what is this?

570
00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:50,774
What?

571
00:41:56,152 --> 00:41:57,214
Did someone hack into our system?

572
00:41:58,793 --> 00:42:01,036
The security system must be a mess.

573
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:42,553
Look at me.

574
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:52,834
Who are you?

575
00:42:56,112 --> 00:42:57,449
I'll kill you.

576
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:03,179
You're an evil spirit
that has harmed humans.

577
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:09,543
You shall cease to exist here and now.

578
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:51,422
As a spirit,

579
00:45:51,822 --> 00:45:54,852
she must be in peace free from pains.
Right?

580
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:35,660
Why won't the deities come
in the form humans want?

581
00:47:42,472 --> 00:47:45,737
A glass to comfort the spirit who has gone.

582
00:47:46,873 --> 00:47:49,342
I think Mr. Ku is heartbroken.

583
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:52,583
He had his chin up high after
sending off a few customers,

584
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,113
but this incident gave him a burn.

585
00:47:57,452 --> 00:47:59,257
Gosh, that's hot.

586
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:05,146
It's hot.

587
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:07,575
He's hurt because he was sincere.

588
00:48:07,632 --> 00:48:09,836
Mr. Ku is a good man.

589
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:12,494
I feel bad about disliking him.

590
00:48:25,342 --> 00:48:28,138
Nothing would have changed even
if you had arrived there earlier.

591
00:48:28,913 --> 00:48:31,065
It's what the almighty decided.

592
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:36,550
Could the same happen...

593
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:39,594
to those of you here too?

594
00:48:40,893 --> 00:48:42,219
Do you mean ceasing to exist?

595
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,584
Yes.

596
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,873
We're all spirits.

597
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:52,568
If we stay behind in this world
instead of going to the afterlife,

598
00:48:53,143 --> 00:48:54,979
there's always a chance the
same could happen to us.

599
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:58,405
If it's dangerous,

600
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:01,112
why are you still here?

601
00:49:01,782 --> 00:49:04,914
Did you have a sad and
painful death just like her?

602
00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:08,043
Is it the same for all of you?

603
00:49:08,052 --> 00:49:11,051
Mr. Kim and Ms. Choi too?

604
00:49:21,402 --> 00:49:22,760
But...

605
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:26,339
we won't run out there and make trouble.

606
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:28,737
Don't worry.

00:49:49,337 --> 00:49:54,170

609
00:50:14,727 --> 00:50:15,849
Go mail this out.

610
00:50:19,428 --> 00:50:20,518
What is this?

611
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:22,189
An invitation.

612
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:24,898
There's someone we promised
to invite, remember?

613
00:50:25,937 --> 00:50:27,406
Are you going to invite him?

614
00:50:27,738 --> 00:50:29,410
But our guest is already gone.

615
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:32,362
We failed to be hospitable
to one of our guests.

616
00:50:32,647 --> 00:50:36,973
That's why we should do what
she wanted to do in her place.

617
00:50:38,388 --> 00:50:39,876
We'll do the best we can.

Whenever you see our hotel,

622
00:51:13,347 --> 00:51:16,173
please feel free to come inside.

623
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:19,952
How unlucky.

Turn right.

629

631
00:52:45,307 --> 00:52:46,368

632

00:52:59,227 --> 00:53:00,624
Straight.

635
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:03,227
Is it really this way?

636
00:53:03,227 --> 00:53:05,982
I said, go straight. Straight.

637
00:53:06,997 --> 00:53:08,017
Stop!

638
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:18,828
What is this?

639
00:53:28,818 --> 00:53:30,287
What is this place?

00:53:35,327 --> 00:53:36,653

642
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:01,046
Welcome, sir.

643
00:54:01,258 --> 00:54:02,950
You received an invitation, didn't you?

644
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:05,787
Ms. Jang is waiting for you.

645
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:07,450
This way.

646
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:19,128
What?

647
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:20,759
It's you.

648
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:27,289
Welcome. We prepared a
room for you, Mr. Jung.

649
00:54:28,218 --> 00:54:30,666
So this hotel really exists.

650
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:33,241
How did you do this?

651
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:36,318
Did you hack into my car?

652
00:54:40,388 --> 00:54:42,571
You came here with our owner's invitation.

653
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:48,259
Please follow me.

654
00:55:09,488 --> 00:55:12,211
This is the room. Like
I told you last time,

655
00:55:12,557 --> 00:55:14,802
it's the room where the person
who looked for you stayed.

656
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:24,826
You said no one has a grudge against you.
Do you remember something now?

657
00:55:27,338 --> 00:55:29,754
I need to check and see why
you're doing this to me.

658
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,148
This is...

659
00:55:58,368 --> 00:55:59,592
Do you know where this is?

660
00:56:02,178 --> 00:56:03,503
It's my old room.

661
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:07,071
Do you also remember what
you did in this room?

662
00:56:58,068 --> 00:57:00,241
Why is this room here now?

663
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:02,227
What is this place?

664
00:57:02,537 --> 00:57:05,872
A hotel right between this
world and the other world.

665
00:57:06,807 --> 00:57:08,745
A hotel for spirits.

666
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:11,807
Stop joking around.

667
00:57:12,278 --> 00:57:13,941
There's no such thing.

668
00:57:43,077 --> 00:57:45,455
- Was that a dream?
- It wasn't.

669
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:49,100
Who are you?

670
00:57:51,347 --> 00:57:53,082
I invited you to the hotel.

671
00:57:54,088 --> 00:57:55,444
So that wasn't a dream?

672
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:58,096
It's not a place you can come in a dream.

673
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:00,052
You can come only when you're dead.

674
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,032
Wait, I'm... I'm dead?

675
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:04,999
No, you aren't dead.

676
00:58:06,097 --> 00:58:07,903
I wanted to ask a question,

677
00:58:08,437 --> 00:58:10,298
so I had to bring your soul here.

678
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:12,714
You're standing in the boundary
between life and death right now.

679
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:15,129
What?

680
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:40,536
Why are you in such a hurry?

681
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,638
I told you that I had a question.

682
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:44,443
What? What do you want to know?

683
00:58:46,008 --> 00:58:48,456
Do you now remember after
you've been to that room?

684
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:54,556
Our guest who made a visit to you.

685
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:56,944
Do you remember...

686
00:58:58,088 --> 00:58:59,311
who that woman is?

687
00:59:02,158 --> 00:59:03,239
That woman...

688
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:05,113
I will kill you.

689
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:13,196
Who is that woman?

690
00:59:13,327 --> 00:59:14,520
You killed her.

691
00:59:14,897 --> 00:59:17,009
- I never killed anyone.
- You did.

692
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:19,508
You stripped her naked
and kicked her outside,

693
00:59:19,508 --> 00:59:21,446
so she was stabbed by
everyone's eyes and got killed.

694
00:59:23,178 --> 00:59:24,300
You have to remember.

695
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:36,651
I have no idea. I don't know who she is.

696
00:59:36,818 --> 00:59:38,623
It's what you did. Why don't you know?

697
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:40,010
Try harder!

698
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:45,670
Yes, it's something I did.

699
00:59:46,428 --> 00:59:49,355
But I have no idea who that
woman is among the others.

700
01:00:24,238 --> 01:00:25,431
It was a dream.

701
01:00:26,307 --> 01:00:27,430
It was.

702
01:00:32,577 --> 01:00:34,139
Gosh, I thought I really died.

703
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:41,324
He didn't tell you a good answer.
Why did you send him back?

704
01:00:44,588 --> 01:00:46,975
That's not what I was curious about.

705
01:00:49,097 --> 01:00:52,770
I tried my best to show
that he's the worst.

706
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:56,369
Now, what will the deity do?

707
01:01:04,307 --> 01:01:06,694
I remember now. Yoon Ga Young.

708
01:01:13,187 --> 01:01:15,737
Right. I heard she committed suicide.

709
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:18,053
I remember that now.

710
01:02:19,287 --> 01:02:22,388
The victim of the train accident
at Gyeongbu Line this morning...

711
01:02:22,388 --> 01:02:24,158
was identified as CEO Jung Eun Seok﻿...

712
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:25,993
of World Disk, a web hard service company.

713
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,827
Jung was under investigation
by the police...

714
01:02:28,827 --> 01:02:31,826
for distributing illegal pornography
and embezzling company funds.

715
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:35,298
The circumstances of the
accident are still unknown.

716
01:02:35,298 --> 01:02:37,097
The police are...

717
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:40,307
investigating the gang members for
a connection with the porn videos,

718
01:02:40,307 --> 01:02:42,108
but the investigation is
still facing a dead end...

719
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:43,877
because they could not find
any feasible connections.

720
01:02:43,877 --> 01:02:46,778
The navigator and the
recorder in Jung's car...

721
01:02:46,778 --> 01:02:49,917
I guess there is a deity, after all.

722
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:51,618
The investigation will not be easy.

723
01:02:51,618 --> 01:02:54,658
No other human lives were
lost in this accident.

724
01:02:54,658 --> 01:02:57,388
Those who were on the
train that got hurt...

725
01:02:57,388 --> 01:03:01,335
at the time of the accident are
being treated at a nearby hospital.

726
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:07,599
I'm feeling better now.

727
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:09,631
I got hospitalized because I
didn't want to go to school.

728
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:12,568
Tell your friends that you
got scared by a bug...

729
01:03:12,568 --> 01:03:13,832
and go back to school.

730
01:03:15,108 --> 01:03:18,412
If you like school that much,
you should come with me.

731
01:03:18,977 --> 01:03:22,414
I mean, you can just show yourself
to people like you did before.

732
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:24,176
I can't do that for long.

733
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:26,341
Especially during the day.

734
01:03:27,858 --> 01:03:29,521
Then do you want to go out with me now?

735
01:03:30,118 --> 01:03:31,310
I'll buy you something delicious.

736
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:33,849
My brother.

737
01:03:35,497 --> 01:03:36,619
My brother.

738
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:40,161
Your brother is right here.

739
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:20,310
That old man is the
founder of this hospital.

740
01:04:20,868 --> 01:04:23,051
He's acquainted with Yu Na's
dad, so I even said hi to him.

741
01:04:24,377 --> 01:04:26,147
Do you know what's uncanny?

742
01:04:26,147 --> 01:04:28,289
He has the same name as you.

743
01:04:28,818 --> 01:04:29,939
His name is Ji Hyun Joong.

744
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:34,940
Hyun Joong.

745
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:39,764
What is it? Do your legs hurt?

746
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:44,644
Do you want me to piggyback you?

747
01:04:51,037 --> 01:04:53,894
How much do you like me?

748
01:04:54,167 --> 01:04:55,433
This much.

749
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:57,108
That's so little.

750
01:04:57,908 --> 01:04:59,376
This much.

751
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,504
That much? As many as your loose teeth?

752
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:14,592
Ji Hyun Joong. Ji Hyun Joong.

753
01:05:18,627 --> 01:05:22,003
I'm sorry. I wasn't calling you.

754
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:24,394
I'm sorry.

755
01:05:25,638 --> 01:05:26,728
Ji Hyun...

756
01:05:27,608 --> 01:05:29,616
Joong... What is this?

757
01:05:31,747 --> 01:05:34,839
He always disappears
without saying a thing.

758
01:05:41,287 --> 01:05:45,265
Hyun Joong's little sister
is getting quite old now.

759
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:48,752
I heard she lost her vision and
that her health deteriorated.

760
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:52,830
She'll soon be here to see Hyun Joong off.

761
01:06:02,138 --> 01:06:04,657
Will both of them get on the
bus to the afterlife today?

762
01:06:04,908 --> 01:06:08,111
You go first. I'll go after you.

763
01:06:08,517 --> 01:06:11,240
I'll leave first. You can come later.

764
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:15,358
I got to live with my first
love all of my life.

765
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:18,347
So you should make your first
love come true here too.

766
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:20,385
You can leave after resolving your regrets.

767
01:06:22,397 --> 01:06:24,744
Thank you for everything. Take care.

768
01:06:30,637 --> 01:06:33,697
This is the way to the platform.

769
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,019
You look upset.

770
01:06:57,658 --> 01:06:59,840
My sister is upset too.

771
01:07:00,028 --> 01:07:02,792
You tested us.

772
01:07:04,568 --> 01:07:06,036
We would've welcomed it...

773
01:07:06,238 --> 01:07:08,247
if you came looking like
this in front of our guest.

774
01:07:08,337 --> 01:07:10,959
If we show up in the form they want,

775
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:14,032
they never put in the effort.

776
01:07:17,347 --> 01:07:19,837
You must be doing a good job.

777
01:07:20,347 --> 01:07:22,632
I think the flower will bloom.

778
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:30,041
You should look after it well...

779
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:32,912
so you can see her off.

780
01:07:35,368 --> 01:07:36,489
Isn't it beautiful?

781
01:07:41,408 --> 01:07:42,835
The ocean looks beautiful.

782
01:07:44,748 --> 01:07:45,869
You're right.

783
01:07:49,818 --> 01:07:50,868
I'm a little sad now.

784
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:55,140
It's beautiful.

785
01:07:56,717 --> 01:07:57,840
I'm a little sad now.

786
01:08:09,698 --> 01:08:12,637
The funds that Jung Eun
Seok concealed were found.

787
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:15,007
It was discovered at a sunflower field...

788
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,466
near Jung's hometown.

789
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,547
About 4 million dollars
in 50-dollar bills...

790
01:08:18,547 --> 01:08:19,948
This is why...

791
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:21,885
he asked us if we're reporters
or police officers.

792
01:08:21,977 --> 01:08:25,007
He was trying to hide his nasty background.

793
01:08:25,887 --> 01:08:29,284
By the way, the owner of that field
must be someone stupid like you.

794
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:31,757
If he finds four million dollars,

795
01:08:31,757 --> 01:08:34,797
he should keep it. Why would you report it?

796
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:36,869
My goodness.

797
01:08:38,467 --> 01:08:41,763
This must be why he had a picture
of a sunflower field in his office.

798
01:08:42,267 --> 01:08:43,318
What?

799
01:08:43,998 --> 01:08:46,486
Don't you remember? You
took a picture of it.

800
01:08:47,368 --> 01:08:49,988
That's why he acted so sensitive
when you took those pictures.

801
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,258
Pictures?

802
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,169
That's enough.

803
01:09:04,357 --> 01:09:06,118
(Police say illegal pornography...)

804
01:09:08,797 --> 01:09:10,022
No way.

805
01:09:10,858 --> 01:09:12,908
A field of money was right before my eyes,

806
01:09:13,427 --> 01:09:15,070
and I had no idea.

807
01:09:15,337 --> 01:09:18,193
That's what I should've asked him.

808
01:09:19,538 --> 01:09:21,139
My sunflower field.

809
01:09:21,207 --> 01:09:23,243
(Police plans to investigate
connection to Jung Eun Seok's death)

810
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,663
My four million dollars!

811
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:27,213
How is that your money?

812
01:09:27,683 --> 01:09:29,590
Don't make a ridiculous claim of ownership.

813
01:09:32,263 --> 01:09:33,343
My money...

814
01:09:39,062 --> 01:09:41,378
Chan Seong borrowed my yacht to go out.

815
01:09:41,603 --> 01:09:43,265
He went to comfort his boss who's angry.

816
01:09:44,232 --> 01:09:47,405
Chan Seong is riding a yacht
with the owner of the hotel?

817
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:50,513
Is he entertaining his boss?

818
01:09:50,513 --> 01:09:53,164
I wouldn't call it entertaining.
It's more like a date.

819
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:01,766
I lost four million dollars
right in front of my eyes.

820
01:10:02,353 --> 01:10:04,944
I'm in no mood to ride
someone else's yacht.

821
01:10:05,763 --> 01:10:08,593
Like I said, that money
doesn't belong to you.

822
01:10:08,593 --> 01:10:11,316
How can you say that just because
you have a picture of it?

823
01:10:12,133 --> 01:10:13,183
Forget it.

824
01:10:13,803 --> 01:10:16,730
Can't you just comfort me...

825
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:18,977
even if you don't mean it?

826
01:10:19,043 --> 01:10:21,286
The least you could say is,

827
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:23,013
"Would you like me to buy you a yacht?"

828
01:10:23,013 --> 01:10:24,196
Why are you getting on my nerves?

829
01:10:24,982 --> 01:10:27,390
I'll buy you a yacht then.

830
01:10:36,622 --> 01:10:39,448
Here. Now that you have
a picture, it's yours.

831
01:10:43,062 --> 01:10:46,103
You'd be a thief if you want
something that's not yours.

832
01:10:46,103 --> 01:10:48,111
I am a thief.

833
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,628
Didn't you see in your dream?

834
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,984
Was your gang all thieves?

835
01:10:52,702 --> 01:10:56,079
The man who married you looked
like he had a higher status.

836
01:10:56,312 --> 01:10:58,690
Married? Me?

837
01:11:04,152 --> 01:11:06,325
I saw you wearing a red bridal dress.

838
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:12,293
Since it looked fancy, I
assumed you married someone...

839
01:11:12,293 --> 01:11:13,619
with some nobleman.

840
01:11:15,293 --> 01:11:16,354
I was...

841
01:11:17,293 --> 01:11:18,966
wearing someone else's dress.

842
01:11:33,343 --> 01:11:34,404
Ku Chan Seong.

843
01:11:36,912 --> 01:11:38,513
I was a bad person.

844
01:11:39,322 --> 01:11:40,852
I'm still bad now,

845
01:11:41,522 --> 01:11:43,358
but I was a lot worse before.

846
01:11:44,992 --> 01:11:46,593
You can see into me,

847
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:49,526
so you'll soon be able to find out...

848
01:11:51,093 --> 01:11:52,428
how horrible I was.

849
01:12:07,612 --> 01:12:08,673
What is it?

850
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:11,643
Where?

851
01:13:05,003 --> 01:13:06,196
Chan Seong.

852
01:13:07,043 --> 01:13:08,093
Hey, Mi Ra.

853
01:14:31,492 --> 01:14:35,205
(Hotel Del Luna)

854
01:14:35,862 --> 01:14:38,093
Are there more secrets in
this hotel I'm not aware of?

855
01:14:38,093 --> 01:14:41,948
Ms. Jang can never leave this hotel.

856
01:14:41,973 --> 01:14:43,298
Let's do good things together.

857
01:14:43,372 --> 01:14:46,158
It's better to see and eat
good things together.

858
01:14:46,503 --> 01:14:48,307
What I have is torture.

859
01:14:48,372 --> 01:14:51,636
It's not that wonderful
to be tortured together.

860
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:53,083
Just let her pass by.

861
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:55,883
How can I just let her pass by?

862
01:14:55,883 --> 01:14:56,883
Don't do it.

863
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:58,482
Run away, Chan Seong.

864
01:14:58,482 --> 01:15:01,379
I don't care if this is
your prison or your fence.

865
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,243
I will stay here with you.
