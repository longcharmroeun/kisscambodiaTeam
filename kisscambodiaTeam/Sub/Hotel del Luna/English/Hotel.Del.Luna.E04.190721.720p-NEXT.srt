1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,504
I'm sure you have things
you miss in the old times...

2
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:22,520
that you cannot go back to.

3
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,563
I think I saw that.

4
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:31,204
I told you that I saw you in a dream.

5
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:32,971
In a dream?

6
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:35,522
You were smiling underneath a huge tree.

7
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:38,491
When someone said they'd build you a house,

8
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:40,339
you said mean things just as you do now,

9
00:00:40,903 --> 00:00:42,085
but you were happy.

10
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:48,248
The man who taught you how to
write your name, Man Weol.

11
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:51,679
Is that the person you miss the most...

12
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:53,934
over your long stay here?

13
00:00:57,112 --> 00:00:58,510
Why do you see...

14
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:02,245
such things?

15
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:04,482
Why do I see you?

16
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:07,099
I'm scared that I may
have to pay the price.

17
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:13,174
What is it that you've
failed to figure out?

18
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:14,883
Do you think I'm here...

19
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:17,258
to help you find out...

20
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:21,114
what you've failed to
figure out on your own?

21
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:29,181
You didn't die.

22
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:32,241
I told you that you are
tied to the Moon Tree,

23
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:35,710
and the flow of life and
death has stopped for you.

24
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:40,858
The leaves sprout, and the
flowers blossom and fall.

25
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:44,554
Your time will start flowing once again.

26
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,093
The tree just changed.

27
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:51,882
You're right.

28
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,662
You might actually turn out to be...

29
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:57,977
someone a lot more special
than I had expected.

30
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:18,462
I can't just leave like this.

31
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:21,361
What about my dog, Soon Dol?

32
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:23,811
There's nothing you can do
when it comes to death.

33
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,871
Gosh, I can't go!

34
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:27,534
I can't go!

35
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,371
Soon Dol, bark.

36
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:36,401
You need to bark to live.

37
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,550
If you don't, you'll die.

38
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,045
My goodness, come on.

39
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:47,378
Bark! You need to bark!

40
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,962
It's been a week, and he still won't budge.

41
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:56,423
It's because he still has
something he's holding onto.

42
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:00,405
At times like this, it's not a bad
idea to help him out a little.

43
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:08,907
Soon Dol, you need to leave.

44
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:12,533
Go outside! Hurry up and go!

45
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,620
Will you please go outside?

46
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:18,365
Just leave him. He won't
wander for too long.

47
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:21,521
He'll find his way to Man Weol Lodge.

48
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:24,685
It's called Hotel Del Luna
now, not Man Weol Lodge.

49
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:26,045
Yes, I forgot.

50
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,872
Man Weol Lodge, Man Weol
Inn, and Hotel Del Luna.

51
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:30,925
The name of that place
changes so frequently,

52
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:34,689
but the owner of the place
hasn't changed at all.

53
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:37,141
She hasn't changed for over 1,000 years.

54
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:39,433
She has no hope.

55
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,268
That's why I sent someone there.

56
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:47,020
Are you going to change the owner?

57
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:50,682
Man Weol's very stubborn,

58
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:53,682
so I just sent her some help.

59
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:02,331
Why did the tree change?

60
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:05,207
Why do you think? It's because of you.

61
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,956
It's because of me?

62
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:09,606
The old memories that dried-up already...

63
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:12,309
crawled out again because of you.

64
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,535
What did I do?

65
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:18,080
All I did was tell you about
the dream I had of you.

66
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:20,313
Seeing ghosts is part of my job,

67
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,623
but dreams have nothing to do with my job.

68
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,081
I don't want to be treated unfairly...

69
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,459
for something I never even asked for.

70
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,823
You're going to get treated unfairly...

71
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:32,052
because you've already provoked me.

72
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:37,435
The tree turned ugly because of you.

73
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,672
I get that you're twisted,
but don't distort the truth.

74
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:42,661
The tree is alive and healthy.

75
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:43,693
That is...

76
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,258
the problem.

77
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,385
You just saved something that
shouldn't have been saved.

78
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:53,276
Seeing that you're so angry,

79
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:56,537
I guess my dream really
was about your past.

80
00:05:57,953 --> 00:06:00,125
Are you embarrassed that I saw your past?

81
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:03,143
Yes.

82
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,775
I'm extremely embarrassed right now.

83
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:10,126
So I must check what's going on.

84
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:18,895
What are you doing?

85
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:26,896
This is wrong.

86
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:28,534
Stay still.

87
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:33,334
Stop it.

88
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,298
Chan Seong, let's sleep.

89
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,574
Ms. Jang.

90
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:40,997
You need to sleep in order
to have that dream.

91
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:43,708
I need to check for myself if
you really saw me in a dream...

92
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:46,914
or if you're deceiving me
based on all the rumors...

93
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,831
you heard in this hotel.

94
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,116
Chan Seong, go to sleep.

95
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,071
I can't fall asleep like this.

96
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:57,380
And I can't guarantee that
I'll have that dream again...

97
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,041
even if I do fall asleep.

98
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,694
Then sleep next to me until
you do have that dream.

99
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:05,552
I don't want to sleep next to you.

100
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:08,071
Be quiet and go to sleep
while I'm being nice.

101
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,998
Fine. I'll sleep.

102
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:15,521
You can sleep next to me or watch me sleep.

103
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:16,645
Do whatever you want.

104
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:21,161
I'm going to kill you if it
turns out that you lied to me.

105
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:22,865
You just want it to be a lie...

106
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:25,133
because you don't like
that I saw your past.

107
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:28,302
I'm no longer going to tell you...

108
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:30,108
what I see in my dreams
since you hate it so much.

109
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:31,671
You can kill me or let me live.
Do whatever you please.

110
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,006
Forget it. I'm not going
to sleep next to you.

111
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:09,549
Do the memories that I
revived pain you that much?

112
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:14,351
Because of that man? Because
you keep thinking about him?

113
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:17,279
Shut your mouth unless you want
to turn all green like the tree.

114
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:18,747
Who is that man?

115
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:21,612
Why do you ask?

116
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:23,714
Do you think it might be you?

117
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:28,863
I did wonder that.

118
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:32,364
What I saw could be a memory from
my past life that I don't remember.

119
00:08:34,703 --> 00:08:36,915
There's no way you're him.

120
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,063
Why do you say that?

121
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:41,498
You've been on my mind ever
since I had that dream.

122
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:46,744
You and I might go back a long way.

123
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:04,594
You're not him.

124
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:07,336
I feel nothing.

125
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:10,669
If you were him, I definitely
wouldn't feel this way.

126
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:15,507
That's a huge relief.

127
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:19,944
I kept wondering, "What if I'm
the man she liked in the past?"

128
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:21,176
It's been bothering me a lot.

129
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,722
You didn't have feelings for him?

130
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:28,761
You seemed to like him. A lot.

131
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:29,916
Ku Chan Seong.

132
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,392
If you keep spewing useless nonsense,

133
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:36,054
you'll have to pay for it.

134
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:37,272
Pay for it? How?

135
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:40,131
What? Are you not going to pay me?
I signed the contract though!

136
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:41,326
Ku Chan Seong!

137
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:44,797
Starting today,

138
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:47,868
I want you to deal with all the ghosts.

139
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,560
When did you pass away?

140
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:31,250
I guess you were lost for some time.
I'll help you with your check-in.

141
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,922
I'll make sure you can use our
beauty and hair services first.

142
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:35,861
This way, please. Let's take the elevator.

143
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,682
What's going on? Is Ms. Jang still angry...

144
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,518
even after drinking a
whole case of champagne?

145
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:00,208
I must've upset her somehow.
I think she's livid now.

146
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:06,614
Well, what kind of sin did
Ms. Jang commit in the past?

147
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:09,878
Does it have something to
do with a love affair?

148
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,231
I'm not sure.

149
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:15,630
Have you heard anything about a
man she's perhaps waiting for?

150
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,158
No, nothing.

151
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:19,453
Really?

152
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:29,584
Is she not waiting for him?

153
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,003
Mr. Ku.

154
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,215
Are you concerned about
what she's thinking?

155
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:35,822
No, not at all.

156
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:37,621
She's not waiting for her
1st and 2nd choices.

157
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,851
Who cares if you were third in line?
You're here now.

158
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:40,944
Mr. Ji.

159
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:44,192
I don't care at all about
what Ms. Jang thinks.

160
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:46,070
Also, I wasn't third in line.

161
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:49,775
I was the zeroth choice.
I beat everyone else.

162
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:52,272
The zeroth choice? Sure, sure.

163
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:54,180
- I'm serious.
- Okay, you were the zeroth choice.

164
00:11:57,913 --> 00:12:01,451
It's all useless though. She
said she feels nothing.

165
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,850
What's this spooky feeling?

166
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,992
I think a number of customers are coming.

167
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:09,775
Will you be all right?

168
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:16,344
No, it's too much.

169
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:22,101
When our customers first arrive,
they're often broken and ripped.

170
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:24,622
Sometimes, they have
something tagging along.

171
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:27,966
But all the customers you'll see
here are groomed, so you'll be fine.

172
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:35,669
I'm now experienced enough
to handle this much.

173
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:39,779
Can I get a refill on this coffee?

174
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:43,081
Oh, we've run out of coffee beans.

175
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:45,397
Please give us a moment.
We'll bring it to your seat.

176
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,062
How do you procure the
things that the customers...

177
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,328
eat and drink here?

178
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:57,566
You can't get things
delivered from a store.

179
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:59,504
We get them from the afterlife.

180
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:02,001
When we treat our customers
well at our hotel...

181
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,642
and help them ascend to the afterlife,

182
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:05,274
we get compensated for our work.

183
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,841
You mean, the spirits pay you?

184
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:10,127
They leave good energy behind.

185
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:13,152
And that energy makes the
flowers in our garden bloom.

186
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:14,522
The less regrets they take with them,

187
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:16,287
the more beautiful the flowers are.

188
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:20,552
When our garden is filled with
flowers, Ma Go takes them...

189
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:24,306
and sends us the supplies
that we need in return.

190
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:28,932
Then why does Ms. Jang...

191
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,248
need to earn money through the spirits?

192
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:37,078
It's all for her lavish lifestyle.

193
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:39,672
She spends all the money on
her expensive champagnes,

194
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:42,468
clothes, jewelry, and cars.

195
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:45,103
How could someone who's being
punished have such attitude?

196
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:51,291
You said she's being punished.

197
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:54,843
Someone told me that I'm
arrogant and foolish.

198
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,618
Although I don't agree with it.

199
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:11,174
I saw you in a dream.

200
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:17,590
The leaves sprout, and the
flowers blossom and fall.

201
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:21,348
The time of life and death
will flow once again.

202
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:27,358
That wicked old hag is
pulling a silly trick on me.

203
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:33,539
The man who taught you how to
write your name, Man Weol.

204
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:36,542
Is that the person you miss the most...

205
00:14:37,903 --> 00:14:38,923
over your long stay here?

206
00:14:53,982 --> 00:14:55,277
Goodness.

207
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,392
A slave ran away!

208
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:00,086
- Are you serious?
- Find him.

209
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:02,690
Who ran away?

210
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:24,865
He's not here. Search outside.

211
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,611
I heard the market,

212
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:34,572
where slaves from Goguryeo
are traded, was attacked.

213
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:37,265
I had a feeling it might be you and
your people, so I came to check.

214
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:40,360
Thank goodness I'm nimble.

215
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:42,051
I almost got killed by your dagger.

216
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:48,076
No, I saved you because I'm nimble.

217
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:51,562
I'm much obliged,

218
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,325
but what will you do about this?

219
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,302
My face is very precious.

220
00:16:57,303 --> 00:16:58,568
How will you pay for this?

221
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:00,263
Too bad.

222
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:03,427
The young lady at the Yeongju
Castle adores your face.

223
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,541
With what will you seduce her from now on?

224
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:12,876
Do you think she only adores my face?

225
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:18,552
Don't be such a baby.

226
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:21,555
Let go. Let go of me.

227
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,226
I said, let go!

228
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,271
Shut it! Get him over here at once.
What are you waiting for?

229
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:27,332
Get up!

230
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,750
You scoundrels... Let go!

231
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,311
Let go.

232
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:32,332
Yeon Woo.

233
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:34,502
Yeon Woo.

234
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:39,062
Let go. Yeon Woo. It's Yeon Woo!

235
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:41,843
Shut your mouth!

236
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,848
If you get out, you'll get caught too.

237
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:50,714
I give you my word. I'll
be sure to save him...

238
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:52,319
and bring him to you.

239
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:54,284
I promise.

240
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:23,784
Yeon Woo.

241
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:28,354
Easy, easy.

242
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:38,394
Yeon Woo!

243
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:47,876
Are you all right?

244
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,674
I'm okay.

245
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:06,958
You have been waiting for that person...

246
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,208
over this long period of time.

247
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:22,973
It is...

248
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:26,688
too green and too gaudy.

249
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:31,756
This looks ridiculous.

250
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:09,984
Yeon Woo.

251
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:12,662
One of their names is Yeon Woo.

252
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,975
He was in Jang Man Weol's gang.

253
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,561
Are you selling those flowers?

254
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:39,092
How much is it? I'd like to buy one.

255
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:41,390
No, that's fine.

256
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:43,980
I already gave yours.

257
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:55,851
Your dad almost died, trying
to pluck a flower for you.

258
00:20:56,782 --> 00:21:00,761
Because of that incident, he never
stole and lived a diligent life.

259
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,056
And he also raised a great son like you.

260
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:10,182
Flowers! Flowers are for birthdays.

261
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:11,354
Flowers.

262
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:14,488
Weren't you the lady...

263
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:19,099
So how is it? How's working at the hotel?

264
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:22,045
Did you set this up?

265
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:26,385
All I did was open a path.

266
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:29,708
Are you telling me that it wasn't a
coincidence he went to the hotel?

267
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:33,649
I planted a tree, you know.

268
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:37,781
Gosh, that tree has been
growing spiky branches...

269
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:40,546
and unwelcoming to the others.

270
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:45,173
I want you to take good care of the tree.

271
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:49,152
Okay? If you have a hard
time looking after the tree,

272
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:51,460
you can come find me.

273
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,235
(Daehwa)

274
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:09,485
(Anguk Station)

275
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:58,659
(Sanzu River Bound)

276
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:14,033
Excuse me.

277
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:16,345
Hold on.

278
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:23,616
Sir.

279
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:31,539
Soon Dol, you brat. You shouldn't be here.

280
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,596
This isn't a place where
you can join me. Okay?

281
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:37,809
You... Goodness.

282
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:41,976
Where I'm headed is no place
for you to follow me.

283
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:51,103
He died all alone. It looks
like it's been a few days.

284
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,973
The door was open. Why
didn't the dog go out?

285
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:55,384
That's strange.

286
00:23:57,923 --> 00:24:01,053
You shouldn't follow me there.

287
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:04,970
My goodness, you poor thing. Goodness.

288
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:09,348
Okay. Let's go there together, okay?
We'll go together.

289
00:24:26,193 --> 00:24:28,162
Ma Go plucks the flowers...

290
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:30,610
and hands them out to the people
who are headed to their afterlife.

291
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:34,031
And spirits who left with
Ma Go's farewells...

292
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:35,900
will go to a good place.

293
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:38,524
That lady earlier...

294
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:41,457
is Ma Go?

295
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,924
(Medicine Shop: Gyeongdong
Market, 11-28 Medicine Alley)

296
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:38,655
What's that?

297
00:25:44,562 --> 00:25:46,571
Chan Seong, come on out!

298
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:48,724
Chan Seong!

299
00:25:56,643 --> 00:25:58,897
Chan Seong, here. I bought
the most amazing bread.

300
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:02,221
There was a ghost sighting at
a bakery I regularly go to.

301
00:26:02,222 --> 00:26:05,008
A ghost kneaded the dough for this
bread, so I waited to buy it.

302
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:08,092
Sanchez, don't say stuff like that.

303
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:10,265
I don't want to hear about
ghosts even at my own home.

304
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:12,592
Hey, what if the ghost followed me home...

305
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:13,989
because a ghost made this?

306
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:20,692
Why are you here? Why are you here again?

307
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:23,890
Chan Seong, what are you doing?
You're scaring me.

308
00:26:24,802 --> 00:26:27,056
There's no ghost here. It's just bread.

309
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:28,737
Did you follow him here?

310
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:33,506
Did you follow the bread?

311
00:26:36,222 --> 00:26:39,021
Chan Seong, I apologize for my silly story.

312
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:40,451
Let's just eat the bread. Okay?

313
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:41,985
I'm good. You should eat it.

314
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:44,125
I think I have to go back to work.

315
00:26:45,732 --> 00:26:49,915
Chan Seong. Hey, if you act like
that, how can I eat this bread?

316
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,581
Mr. Ku brought back a guest
that left the hotel.

317
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:23,021
She left the hotel, went to
a bakery, and made bread.

318
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:25,036
She shouldn't have done
something like that.

319
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:26,402
She's the one that was supposed...

320
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:28,922
to leave in a limousine today, right?

321
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,942
Yes, Mr. Ku went to Ms. Jang
to get her signature...

322
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:34,115
for changing the limousine reservation.

323
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,582
Did she want to have bread
before leaving this world?

324
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,112
She can't even eat bread
from this world anyway.

325
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:41,481
She should have called for room service.

326
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:43,422
Why did she go to a bakery?

327
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:44,582
Hyun Joong, can't you pay...

328
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,633
better attention to the
guests coming and leaving?

329
00:27:46,992 --> 00:27:48,797
Do you want to get on the
bus to the afterlife?

330
00:27:49,393 --> 00:27:51,291
Come on, I had a big group
of guests yesterday,

331
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,271
so I was swamped.

332
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:54,817
Do your job right.

333
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:06,063
That was mean.

334
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:09,838
Wasn't it? How can she
tell me to take the bus.

335
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,717
Yes, that was a harsh thing to say.

336
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:13,514
Why is she so on edge like that?

337
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:16,118
Oh, it will be the 25th soon.

338
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:19,979
It's that day already. We'll pass
through it safely, won't we?

339
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:21,152
We have to.

340
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:23,642
If what happened 42 years
ago happens again,

341
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,212
Seo Hee will be dragged to
the afterlife for sure.

342
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:41,919
A ghost can't go around this
world stirring up trouble.

343
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:44,372
She hasn't done anything major,

344
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,723
so tell her to keep the reservation
and go to the other world.

345
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:48,178
I want to change that reservation.

346
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:50,352
Please sign here.

347
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,373
(Confirmation of Reservation Change)

348
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:55,555
There's someone she really wants to see.

349
00:28:57,322 --> 00:28:59,230
There is no ghost who doesn't
have someone they want to see.

350
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:03,472
She never saw the person
when she was alive.

351
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,128
That's why she wants to see him or her.

352
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:07,432
She was blind when she was alive.

353
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:10,197
How can she want to see a person
when she has never seen them?

354
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:11,942
She doesn't even know the name.

355
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:14,114
Why is she looking for someone
she doesn't even know?

356
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:16,555
Forget it and go. Stop annoying me.

357
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:18,708
She says her hands remember.

358
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:20,955
If she holds the hands,
she can feel who it is.

359
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,016
That's some nonsense a ghost is spewing.

360
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,467
Go away. Go!

361
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:33,122
Are you also talking nonsense?

362
00:29:34,593 --> 00:29:36,336
You said you can tell by your feelings.

363
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:38,334
That I'm definitely not that man.

364
00:29:40,972 --> 00:29:42,370
Then you don't know either.

365
00:29:44,603 --> 00:29:45,664
You are...

366
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:52,789
definitely not him.

367
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,815
I'm right then, so you should sign this.

368
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:05,153
Darn.

369
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:33,757
(Jang Man Weol)

370
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:41,099
I'll find the person she wants
to see and send her off.

371
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,702
She is the first guest I brought.

372
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:44,824
So I want to send her off nicely.

373
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:56,550
Don't try to get money off her.

374
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:57,968
She doesn't have any.

375
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:02,162
Why are you doing something
that won't get you money?

376
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:04,700
You're being used by that ghost.

377
00:31:05,222 --> 00:31:06,652
You're so weakhearted.

378
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:08,253
You're an easy target for ghosts.

379
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:10,743
You're right.

380
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:13,438
If I'd been tougher and held out,
I wouldn't have ended up here.

381
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,402
I regret that I am a frail human...

382
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:17,555
that you like so much.

383
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,113
- Are you being sarcastic?
- I'm saying it's my fate.

384
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,746
I don't regret bringing you in...

385
00:31:25,143 --> 00:31:26,642
and complicating your life.

386
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:32,362
Do you really think you did that?

387
00:31:34,153 --> 00:31:35,855
You know what people say, "You
complicate your own life".

388
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:38,281
Maybe it wasn't like that
you dragged me here.

389
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:39,521
And maybe I was the one
who pushed myself...

390
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,746
into the place I felt drawn to.

391
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:43,884
Drink this.

392
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:46,439
You should drink as much water as
alcohol, so you won't feel dry.

393
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:52,629
I'll bring some bread when I come back.

394
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:54,837
The place we're visiting
is a famous bakery.

395
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:58,428
It's the place that comedian
Kim Joon Hyun visited.

396
00:32:00,242 --> 00:32:01,412
Try the "One Bite" game.

397
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:03,932
Why are you being nice?
You're making me nervous.

398
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,541
Are you giving me poison nicely?

399
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,745
I want to try and take care of you.

400
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,786
If I give you water and bread,

401
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:12,352
who knows?

402
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:15,106
Leaves have sprouted from the dry
tree, maybe flowers might bloom.

403
00:32:17,123 --> 00:32:18,162
Don't.

404
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:20,814
Do you think I'm some seedling that
sprouts when you give it water?

405
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,790
I'm an old tree that has been
dry for over a thousand years.

406
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,071
The tree has leaves now. I
think it will be worthwhile.

407
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,756
- This is so itchy.
- Am I bothering you?

408
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:34,688
You said you didn't feel anything.
I guess that's not true.

409
00:32:41,052 --> 00:32:42,551
That stupid...

410
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:44,652
Hey, Chan Seong.

411
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:48,506
Don't do this. Don't come here anymore.

412
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:50,396
Why? I have work to do.

413
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:52,018
You don't have to come here.

414
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:54,253
I'll let you go.

415
00:32:54,663 --> 00:32:56,090
I have nowhere to go now.

416
00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:58,243
I left the last hotel
like that because of you.

417
00:32:58,262 --> 00:32:59,932
Now I have a terrible
reputation and I can't go back.

418
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,768
There are other hotels that Forbes likes.

419
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,628
They liked me when they
didn't know I can see ghosts.

420
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:06,195
Not anymore.

421
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:09,029
And you have no one else except for me.

422
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:11,811
You were the third on the line.

423
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:13,821
There were 1st and 2nd on the line,
and they are better than you.

424
00:33:14,113 --> 00:33:15,550
Oh, them!

425
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:18,502
They're so tough and
strong you can't use them.

426
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:21,714
You need an easy target for ghosts like me.

427
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:23,689
Someone who can resolve
their grudges and stuff.

428
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:25,972
Here, I'm the zeroth pick.

429
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:29,253
Chan Seong.

430
00:33:30,363 --> 00:33:33,260
If you keep doing this, I
really won't like you.

431
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:35,310
Having you like me because
I didn't bother you.

432
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:37,540
Having you not like me
because I bothered you.

433
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:39,733
I prefer the latter.

434
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:42,826
I'll accompany the guest outside.

435
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:52,944
He will keep on irritating me?

436
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:57,043
He thinks I'm a joke because
the tree has leaves now.

437
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:37,560
What kind of bread are you looking for?

438
00:34:39,402 --> 00:34:42,259
The bread that you're baking now...

439
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:45,384
smells so nice.

440
00:34:56,183 --> 00:34:57,509
It's chestnut bread.

441
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:06,531
It's warm, right?

442
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:07,787
And fluffy.

443
00:35:08,632 --> 00:35:10,437
I just baked it.

444
00:35:11,032 --> 00:35:14,031
Every time I went there,
he held my hand warmly.

445
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:17,457
My heart was thumping so hard, I
was afraid he'd know how I felt.

446
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:19,581
I never even talked to him properly.

447
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:30,087
You don't know his face or his name.

448
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:32,762
But you will know for sure
when you hold his hand, right?

449
00:35:35,963 --> 00:35:37,361
If you approach him with those hands,

450
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:39,167
you will only make him scared
and fail to hold his hands.

451
00:35:43,963 --> 00:35:45,604
Shall I tell them the
situation and find out?

452
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:51,945
Okay, I will lend my body to you.

453
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:09,033
Wow, the bread here is the best.

454
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:12,084
Thank you.

455
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:16,929
You made the bread with this hand.
It's a great hand.

456
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:19,422
Well...

457
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:29,905
It's not him.

458
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:34,541
Can you recommend a cake?

459
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:37,581
What about this strawberry cake?
The chocolate cake looks good too.

460
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:42,791
You had cheesecake, also.

461
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,713
They're all delicious.

462
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:52,277
There's only one left, so it must be him.

463
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:55,834
Can I save points here?

464
00:36:56,203 --> 00:36:57,804
Yes, do you have our membership card?

465
00:36:58,703 --> 00:37:01,293
- I didn't bring it.
- Tell me your phone number.

466
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:06,119
0, 1, 0...

467
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:09,802
What?

468
00:37:14,722 --> 00:37:15,814
What are you doing?

469
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:19,822
- This guy has been acting strange.
- What are you doing?

470
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,083
Well, I...

471
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:24,783
Chan Seong.

472
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,724
What are you doing?

473
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:28,393
Sanchez.

474
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:31,344
I'm sorry. I'll keep him in check.

475
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:34,233
I'm sorry.

476
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:36,204
Take care.

477
00:37:41,382 --> 00:37:42,381
What did you tell them?

478
00:37:42,382 --> 00:37:45,239
I told them you weren't a weirdo.
I asked them to just trust me.

479
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:47,227
They said you should never
come back to buy bread.

480
00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:50,316
I'm sorry, Sanchez.

481
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:53,315
Why did you do that?

482
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:54,892
You said you were going to
the hotel in the morning.

483
00:37:54,893 --> 00:37:56,062
What are you doing here?

484
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:58,031
A guest asked me to look for someone there.

485
00:37:58,032 --> 00:37:59,071
Oh, my goodness.

486
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:00,801
You could've just asked for the name...

487
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:03,801
instead of kneading the
hands of all the employees.

488
00:38:04,873 --> 00:38:06,269
I had my reasons.

489
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:10,189
You should've asked me for help.

490
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:12,273
I'm a regular customer here.

491
00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:17,051
Do you remember every
employee who worked here?

492
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:18,174
Of course, you jerk.

493
00:38:20,692 --> 00:38:21,743
Let go.

494
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:29,131
Am I the only one who sees...

495
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,070
these green things?

496
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:32,323
The leaves...

497
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,428
have started to sprout.

498
00:38:35,532 --> 00:38:37,772
Isn't it a grand sight? Let's take a photo.

499
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,628
We shouldn't be marveling but lamenting.

500
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:43,487
It's a sign that the hotel will meet chaos.

501
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:44,741
Why is that?

502
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:47,651
Jang Man Weol is being punished
being tied to this tree.

503
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:48,982
Such changes to the tree...

504
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:50,554
must mean that her punishment
is coming to an end.

505
00:38:50,722 --> 00:38:52,622
What's so wrong with that?

506
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:54,591
Think about what will
happen after she leaves.

507
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:57,421
We're still here because of
her, so what will happen to us?

508
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,401
We'll have to take the
bus to the afterlife.

509
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:01,814
No way.

510
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:03,502
I can't leave yet.

511
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:04,889
Same here.

512
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:06,937
Why did this suddenly happen?

513
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:08,426
What changed?

514
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:12,772
We have a new general manager.

515
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:21,709
I guess Mr. Ku has
something to do with this.

516
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:33,857
The person you're looking
for is working here now.

517
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:36,631
Hello, here's the coffee you ordered.

518
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:37,724
That's him.

519
00:39:38,032 --> 00:39:40,631
Please know that it tastes better stirred.

520
00:39:40,632 --> 00:39:41,755
Thank you.

521
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:45,935
Would you like to hold his hand?

522
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:53,835
Excuse me.

523
00:39:54,552 --> 00:39:55,551
Yes?

524
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:58,644
Hello, I was a regular customer
of the bakery you worked at.

525
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:02,664
Oh, I see.

526
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:05,603
I hope you come by here often too.

527
00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:41,854
It's warm, right?

528
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:43,587
And fluffy.

529
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,412
I just baked it.

530
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:15,874
Spend some time here and
come back to the hotel.

531
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:34,204
Do you feel proud?

532
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:42,044
It was worth it.

533
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:46,217
Is this a new car?

534
00:41:46,563 --> 00:41:49,490
Yes, isn't it sweet?

535
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:52,073
The tacky brown color is not fit for a car.

536
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,272
One that's bright is better.

537
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:56,002
So you went and bought one?

538
00:41:56,003 --> 00:41:58,145
No, but I call dibs.

539
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:02,957
Count me out if you're off
to buy one right now.

540
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:05,542
I'd rather get some sleep.

541
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:06,706
Sure, let's sleep.

542
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:09,172
Sorry?

543
00:42:09,753 --> 00:42:10,821
Let's sleep together.

544
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:13,199
I'm going to see how you dream this time.

545
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:14,622
Saying you'd like to sleep with me...

546
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:17,478
is something inappropriate
for a boss to say.

547
00:42:17,623 --> 00:42:18,962
I'll only let it slide this once.

548
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:20,563
Would you rather get a bite to eat?

549
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:23,301
I never said I wouldn't sleep.
I'm just not sleeping with you.

550
00:42:23,302 --> 00:42:24,361
That's not what I said.

551
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:25,901
I only asked you out for a meal.

552
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:28,484
Do you realize that you're
not making any sense?

553
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,264
You said you'd look after me.

554
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:32,542
Seeing that I sleep and eat
well is how you do it.

555
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:33,633
Ku Chan Seong.

556
00:42:34,643 --> 00:42:35,663
Look after me.

557
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:44,275
What would you like to eat?

558
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:02,642
This place has been
trending on social media.

559
00:43:02,902 --> 00:43:04,168
I wanted to try the food.

560
00:43:04,472 --> 00:43:05,626
You knew, right?

561
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:08,609
You knew that this is my friend's place.

562
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:10,813
Will you believe me if I say no?

563
00:43:10,882 --> 00:43:12,473
Why ask if you're not going to?

564
00:43:12,913 --> 00:43:14,011
What's good here?

565
00:43:14,012 --> 00:43:16,603
Why ask if you won't even order it?

566
00:43:17,152 --> 00:43:18,172
You know me well.

567
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:21,441
I'll have this.

568
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:24,205
You'll have this. I want to try them both.

569
00:43:25,362 --> 00:43:26,454
Chan Seong!

570
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:32,202
Sanchez is my roommate.

571
00:43:32,203 --> 00:43:33,571
He gets scared easily,

572
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:35,673
so don't mention anything about ghosts.

573
00:43:36,773 --> 00:43:39,833
You must've lied to Sanchez about
working at a normal hotel.

574
00:43:41,643 --> 00:43:42,805
Hi, Sanchez.

575
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:44,841
Did you find the man you were looking for?

576
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:46,035
Yes, thanks to you.

577
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:49,695
So this is my colleague.

578
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,761
She must be a hotelier too.

579
00:43:52,953 --> 00:43:54,013
It's truly impressive.

580
00:43:54,552 --> 00:43:56,321
We'll order number 2 and number 15.

581
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:57,893
Sure thing. Let's see.

582
00:43:58,463 --> 00:43:59,922
It's a hard place to work at, isn't it?

583
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:04,396
Chan Seong's been stressed out ever
since he started to work there.

584
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:07,924
Your boss is a maniac, right?

585
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,502
That lady...

586
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:10,900
What was her name again?

587
00:44:11,203 --> 00:44:13,150
- Jang Man Weol.
- Yes, Jang Man Weol.

588
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:15,786
I remember because the name is a hot mess.

589
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:18,142
Anyway, from what I hear,

590
00:44:18,143 --> 00:44:21,345
employees must badmouth their bosses
to lead a comfortable work life.

591
00:44:21,382 --> 00:44:23,182
I'll place a pizza here...

592
00:44:23,183 --> 00:44:24,988
instead of that boss' head,

593
00:44:25,222 --> 00:44:28,314
so enjoy your meal while ripping her apart.

594
00:44:28,353 --> 00:44:30,025
Rip, bite, and chew, all right?

595
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:40,127
It'll take more than one pizza
to vent all your anger.

596
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,026
Order another one.

597
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:45,772
I never called you a maniac.

598
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:48,323
I only said you were hard to reason with.

599
00:44:48,413 --> 00:44:49,741
What's so wrong about it?

600
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:52,364
Don't we all get a little crazy sometimes?

601
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,754
Anyway, this reminds me...

602
00:44:57,483 --> 00:45:00,859
of the loaf of bread you
promised to get me.

603
00:45:03,722 --> 00:45:05,221
How did it go at the bakery?

604
00:45:06,032 --> 00:45:07,113
It all went well.

605
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:09,548
Her hands guided her to the right place.

606
00:45:10,532 --> 00:45:11,624
Is that so?

607
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:15,381
The memories that the ghosts has...

608
00:45:17,103 --> 00:45:18,367
can be scrambled.

609
00:45:19,713 --> 00:45:22,017
Floating around so for long...

610
00:45:22,442 --> 00:45:25,095
makes them forget what's important.

611
00:45:31,882 --> 00:45:34,269
Sometimes, they only remember...

612
00:45:34,992 --> 00:45:36,247
what they want to remember.

613
00:46:12,862 --> 00:46:14,934
You said that she only remembers his hands.

614
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,467
How beautiful of a memory.

615
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:24,071
Still, it lacks impact.

616
00:46:24,972 --> 00:46:26,952
She lived a decently long life,

617
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:29,281
so why would she remember
a pair of hands...

618
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,846
that picked up a few
pieces of bread for her?

619
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,480
What are you getting at?

620
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:39,759
Important memories to a ghost...

621
00:46:40,453 --> 00:46:41,646
are mostly similar.

622
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:44,785
The memories of when they die.

623
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:31,534
Help me.

624
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:36,528
Chan Seong.

625
00:49:37,402 --> 00:49:38,994
Come to my hotel once you die.

626
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:20,613
Darn it. What's your problem?

627
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,989
If you do this, you'll turn
to ashes and disappear.

628
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,623
Don't leave in vain like that.

629
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,985
I'll make sure he gets
punished for what he did.

630
00:50:43,231 --> 00:50:44,627
I promise!

631
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:49,879
You found the guy who committed
a hit-and-run six months ago?

632
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:52,828
So you caught him yourself
and brought him here?

633
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,900
Yes, he hit a blind woman that
was crossing the street...

634
00:51:55,901 --> 00:51:58,287
with his motorcycle and ran away.

635
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:02,760
Oh, really? Gosh, you're incredible.

636
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:07,249
"He hit a blind woman that
was crossing the street..."

637
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:44,017
You're the first guest I'm
sending away at this hotel.

638
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:47,573
I heard you go to a nice place
if you receive that flower.

639
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,215
Thank you.

640
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:54,125
The memory I had of his
hand was a horrible one.

641
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:57,170
But I was a fool to remember it...

642
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:59,230
as a warm and heart-fluttering memory.

643
00:52:59,231 --> 00:53:01,790
That's probably the kind
of person you were.

644
00:53:02,441 --> 00:53:05,266
You were probably the kind of person...

645
00:53:06,211 --> 00:53:08,110
who always tried to
remember happy memories...

646
00:53:08,111 --> 00:53:10,763
over big tragedies regardless of how
small those happy memories were.

647
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:24,871
Sir.

648
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,525
Would you like some more coffee?

649
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:05,083
Isn't this place huge?

650
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:13,825
There's a sandy beach if you go outside.

651
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,627
Your son will love it.

652
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,392
Thank you. Let's go have fun in the water.

653
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,633
Come on.

654
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,710
Do you want me to carry you?

655
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:29,373
There we go.

656
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:33,377
The father and son came
together due to a car accident.

657
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:41,801
Yoo Wol, stop!

658
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,368
Yoo Wol, no!

659
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:02,904
He still hasn't come to his
senses even after what he saw.

660
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:08,514
Ms. Jang.

661
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,498
We saw the tree in the garden.

662
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,295
Everyone's feeling very nervous.

663
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,179
The tree's been dead for over 1,000 years.

664
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,079
Why did it suddenly come back to life?

665
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,905
Ma Go told me that someone
will come and help me leave.

666
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:35,619
I guess that person's here.

667
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,895
Is that person Mr. Ku?

668
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,219
Yes.

669
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,219
What did Mr. Ku say?

670
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,750
He told me that he'll take care of me...

671
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:45,816
and that he'll try to make flowers
bloom along with the leaves.

672
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:48,684
I guess I'll be gone...

673
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,969
once the flowers fall.

674
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,377
Then what about us? What's
going to happen to us?

675
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:55,829
How would I know?

676
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:57,803
That's up to you.

677
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:01,040
We can give up all together
and move onto the afterlife.

678
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:03,440
Or you can roam around this
world as vengeful spirits...

679
00:57:03,441 --> 00:57:04,705
and turn into ashes.

680
00:57:05,751 --> 00:57:06,801
Suit yourself.

681
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,398
We must stay at the hotel a little longer.

682
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,657
And you can't leave just yet either.

683
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:16,219
We should let go of Mr. Ku.
Besides, he was our third pick,

684
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,301
and we have the fourth candidate ready.

685
00:57:20,091 --> 00:57:22,549
Hey. Right? Isn't that true?

686
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,800
Don't distract me and go away.

687
00:57:28,341 --> 00:57:30,310
- I'm sorry.
- We won't distract you.

688
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:33,139
- What's gotten into her?
- What's her deal?

689
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,354
- Let's just go.
- She's unbelievable.

690
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:42,049
A spirit has taken up her body.

691
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,132
And she's bold too. She's the perfect fit.

692
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,852
We had another candidate.

693
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:51,389
I helped her steal the body,

694
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,063
so I can definitely use that against her.

695
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,733
Besides, her family is loaded too.

696
00:57:56,131 --> 00:57:57,456
Let's let go of Mr. Ku.

697
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:00,224
He won't leave.

698
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,799
I told him to leave, but he said no.

699
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,911
Ku Chan Seong can see ghosts now.

700
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,239
And he's settling in too.

701
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,077
Even if I kick him out
with his eyes carved out,

702
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:10,383
he'll see ghosts and the hotel.

703
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,674
Ma Go will be able to take away
his ability to see the ghosts.

704
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:16,250
You think that old hag will do me a favor?

705
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:17,822
She's the one who sent him to me.

706
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,520
We can't kill a human,

707
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:22,254
but if we let him be, we'll
have to get on the bus.

708
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,504
There's a way to fix this
without killing him.

709
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,552
Room 13 at our hotel...

710
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:31,910
is occupied right now.

711
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:36,827
The guest in Room 13?

712
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:57,132
The guest in Room 13 hates even
the sound of a human's breath.

713
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:01,847
If a human sees the guest in Room 13,

714
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:04,023
the human will go crazy.

715
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:07,130
Are you suggesting that we make him go mad?

716
00:59:11,611 --> 00:59:12,631
Yes.

717
00:59:13,611 --> 00:59:16,568
If he goes crazy and roams
around like a madman,

718
00:59:17,311 --> 00:59:19,422
he won't be able to come here
even though he sees ghosts.

719
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:22,520
This world would isolate such
people without our involvement.

720
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:24,019
Mental institution.

721
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:27,134
Ms. Jang, do you approve of this?

722
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,399
Where is Ku Chan Seong now?

723
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:21,443
This punk keeps making my garden
look hideous more and more now.

724
01:00:30,328 --> 01:00:33,051
No one told you to chase around a
ghost without getting any sleep.

725
01:00:33,498 --> 01:00:35,813
You don't even have much
time left as a sane man.

726
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:38,384
It looks like you'll waste
your precious time sleeping.

727
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:46,729
What a shame.

728
01:00:47,348 --> 01:00:48,603
But it's all your fault.

729
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,029
Well, I really liked you,

730
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:53,448
but I hate that you can look into me.

731
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:14,599
Why are you smiling?

732
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:16,912
Did you come here, so we
could sleep together?

733
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:19,040
Are you happy now that
you watched me sleep?

734
01:01:20,919 --> 01:01:23,397
- You saw me in your dream again?
- Are you curious?

735
01:01:25,118 --> 01:01:26,618
Sit down. I'll tell you...

736
01:01:27,259 --> 01:01:28,718
what you were like in my dream.

737
01:01:34,498 --> 01:01:35,927
This is what I hate.

738
01:01:36,828 --> 01:01:39,960
I should be telling you to shut up,
or I will rip your mouth open,

739
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,523
but I thought about
sitting down next to you.

740
01:01:43,598 --> 01:01:45,403
I hate my thought in that split second.

741
01:01:48,408 --> 01:01:50,448
You held out for over 1,000 years,
but you let go for a second.

742
01:01:51,348 --> 01:01:52,878
This must be an incredible gain on my side.

743
01:01:53,408 --> 01:01:56,407
Yes, this change means a lot to me,

744
01:01:57,419 --> 01:01:59,662
and you'll have to pay for it.

745
01:02:00,419 --> 01:02:02,601
You agreed that you're the one
who complicated your own life.

746
01:02:03,189 --> 01:02:05,810
Whatever happens to you,
it's all your fault.

747
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:11,575
If something happens to me,
I'm sure you'll protect me.

748
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:18,706
You said you were going to
protect me as I'm a weak human.

749
01:02:22,808 --> 01:02:24,686
You were the one who
stopped the motorcycle.

750
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:29,003
No, I couldn't care less even
if you died in the crash.

751
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:31,277
I know that it was you.

752
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:33,178
I jumped in because I trusted you.

753
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:34,887
I said, it wasn't me.

754
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:37,541
I trust that you will protect me.

755
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:42,084
So please protect me if
something happens to me.

756
01:02:43,698 --> 01:02:45,228
I will stay right next to you.

757
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:49,895
I'm going to kick you out.

758
01:04:25,868 --> 01:04:27,195
Did it come from the dream?

759
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,270
That split second from Jang Man Weol?

760
01:04:44,419 --> 01:04:45,469
Mr. Ku.

761
01:04:45,919 --> 01:04:48,132
I need your help with a guest.

762
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:50,900
Okay. Which room is the guest in?

763
01:04:52,629 --> 01:04:56,372
It's the long-term stay guest
in Room 13 at our hotel.

764
01:05:04,408 --> 01:05:06,815
Burn this incense stick in Room 13.

765
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:08,802
Okay, I'll do that.

766
01:05:10,379 --> 01:05:11,837
The guest is very picky.

767
01:05:12,248 --> 01:05:13,839
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

768
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:19,635
I'm getting used to seeing ghosts now.

769
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:21,079
Don't worry.

770
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,260
I'm sorry.

771
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:41,031
It feels as if I have given
up on my virtue as a scholar.

772
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:42,862
I'm ashamed.

773
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:45,779
I liked him. He was like a good friend.

774
01:06:11,308 --> 01:06:14,267
Mr. Ku is...

775
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:17,693
on his way to Room 13 now.

776
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:04,006
Where is the guest?

777
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,269
Ku Chan Seong.

778
01:10:59,128 --> 01:11:00,148
You shouldn't look.

779
01:11:05,168 --> 01:11:06,494
Don't let her hear your breathing.

780
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:14,936
But I hear...

781
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:16,630
Don't listen.

782
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:22,772
What's the matter?

783
01:13:23,739 --> 01:13:27,686
(Hotel Del Luna)

784
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:30,886
Chan Seong isn't going anywhere.
I'll keep him by my side.

785
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:33,007
You sent me to that room
on purpose, didn't you?

786
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,682
I'm missing the other one of this earring.

787
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:36,748
You'll go bankrupt at this rate.

788
01:13:36,749 --> 01:13:38,830
Be kind and cut down on your spending.

789
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:42,618
She was forced into a marriage
that she didn't want.

790
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:43,818
Is this the front desk?

791
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,858
Ma'am, you can't do this to our employees.

792
01:13:45,859 --> 01:13:48,143
- It's okay with me.
- Well...

793
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:49,860
I want you to accept this.

794
01:13:49,899 --> 01:13:52,009
You'll actually marry her?

795
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:53,793
Ms. Jang Man Weol.

796
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:55,564
Ku Chan Seong, do you love me?
