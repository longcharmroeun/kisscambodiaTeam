00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:13,764
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:15,656
You know what this is, don't you?

3
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,183
It looks like a medicine.

4
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,568
I thought it was strange why Ma Go
would suddenly give this to me.

5
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:22,370
You're the one who asked her
to give it to me, right?

6
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:24,905
Think the way you want.

7
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,307
Chan Seong.

8
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:31,012
I'll pray for your safety.

9
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,846
No.

10
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:41,935
I will get in danger to make
you feel uncomfortable.

11
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:44,684
What?

12
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:51,845
Chan Seong! Do you know
how precious that is?

13
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:55,514
Do you know how much I
had to beg to get that?

14
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,665
Ms. Jang!

15
00:00:57,923 --> 00:00:59,742
No place is safe for me anymore.

16
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,963
I will keep getting on your
nerves and get in danger.

17
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:06,104
You must...

18
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,418
keep protecting me.

19
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:23,799
Does this medicine belong to you?

20
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:33,868
It's yours, isn't it?

21
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:38,862
Why would you pick it up and
give it back to me now?

22
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:42,392
I thought you dropped it, so I
brought it back to thank you.

23
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:45,545
Thank you.

24
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:48,899
You brought back something
that's very precious.

25
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,866
You may go ahead and rest.

26
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,548
Isn't this something that will
help you get rid of your fears?

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,733
Well, yes.

28
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:03,507
Then I hope you take it and feel at ease.

29
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,405
See?

30
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:15,053
Even the spirit says you
should take the medicine.

31
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:17,961
He's very slow-witted.

32
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:21,259
He's giving you advice as someone
who ran away and found peace.

33
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:22,984
Eat it.

34
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:27,159
You must've forgotten something.

35
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:28,743
If you get attacked by a spirit
that holds a deep grudge,

36
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:30,128
you could even die.

37
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,571
You almost died recently because of me.

38
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:37,048
Don't bother getting yourself in
trouble and just live peacefully.

39
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:39,165
Eat it.

40
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:40,704
If I eat that,

41
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:44,776
I won't be able to see you anymore.

42
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,679
You also must've forgotten something.

43
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,150
I can see through you.

44
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,128
If I don't take care of you,

45
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,206
you'll only end up becoming more spiteful.

46
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:15,071
I'd rather get myself in trouble...

47
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,509
and stop you from ending up that way.

48
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:19,936
I...

49
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,607
I can't let that...

50
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:25,746
happen to you.

51
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,155
So...

52
00:03:36,943 --> 00:03:40,417
I'm going to stay beside you
and keep an eye on you.

53
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,137
Mr. Ku Chan Seong?

54
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:48,166
What is it this time?

55
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:53,526
What brings you to my father's villa?

56
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:05,277
You asked my father for a
favor back when he was alive?

57
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:09,679
Yes, he let me borrow the
pond in his botanical garden.

58
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:13,950
Did you set free a pet fish or something?

59
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,840
It's something very special. It'll
give out a lot of good energy.

60
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:21,363
My father spoke to me about you a
couple of times before he passed.

61
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,170
He told me that you helped him out a lot.

62
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,164
We're here to take care of his belongings.

63
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:28,405
I see.

64
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,517
(Baekgu)

65
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,547
This is mine.

66
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:39,406
I spent a lot of time with him
here back when I was young.

67
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:41,814
- Mom.
- Yes?

68
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,440
Look what I found in this book.

69
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:49,778
My goodness, when was this?

70
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,272
My father looks so young in this photo.

71
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:56,768
I miss him so much.

72
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,463
You can write him a letter...

73
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:01,422
if there's anything you'd
like to say to him.

74
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,494
The hotel I work at provides...

75
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:06,191
a special service where you can
send letters to the ones you miss.

76
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:24,084
I thought you would've left already,
but I guess you waited for me.

77
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:26,198
I don't like driving.

78
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:32,623
If you don't like driving, why
did you buy so many cars?

79
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:33,876
Because they're pretty.

80
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,834
I'm going to buy every single car you sold.

81
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:38,863
With what money?

82
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:40,774
You told me that you're willing
to go through trouble,

83
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,451
so let me be a little
cheap while I'm at it.

84
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:43,988
Give me the painting of Mount Baekdu.

85
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,244
Do you think I'll give that to you?
That was my severance pay.

86
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:53,041
I just dropped it at your place.
It's mine, so give it back.

87
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:57,475
There's a famous restaurant
nearby that once aired on TV.

88
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,296
Let's go there.

89
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:01,306
A famous restaurant?

90
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:05,588
It's must be baffling to hear me
talk about food in this situation.

91
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:07,684
You must be feeling furious.

92
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:09,949
That's exactly how I felt.

93
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,274
Let's go.

94
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:23,308
If we don't get to the restaurant
before it closes because of you,

95
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,507
that painting of Mount Baekdu...

96
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:29,829
will never be yours.

97
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:48,117
Your favorite celebrity, Kim
Joon Hyun, came here as well.

98
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,587
You should take a photo.

99
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:57,063
("The Guys Who Died After Eating")

100
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:02,800
(I'll visit every famous
restaurant in this country.)

101
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:09,830
There aren't any cold
noodle restaurants nearby.

102
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:11,537
And there aren't any
shopping malls here either.

103
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,580
Why don't you just come
back to Myeong-dong?

104
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,233
This place is too far away from my house.

105
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,557
Just work at the previous
hotel you used to work at.

106
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,547
The owner of that hotel...

107
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,325
seemed very fond of you earlier.

108
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:26,583
I'm just interested in being
liked by my current boss.

109
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:28,626
And in order to make that happen,

110
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,925
I'm going to challenge myself.

111
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:38,154
Promise that you'll reinstate
me if I eat this in one bite.

112
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:40,567
Are you serious?

113
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:45,433
Kim Joon Hyun can eat the
entire thing in one bite.

114
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:47,138
You're no match for him.

115
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:50,384
You'll never be able to do it.

116
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,049
Just give me my job back if I succeed.

117
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,496
Don't even bother.

118
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:07,870
I don't watch Kim Joon Hyun's
shows anymore.

119
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:13,680
You used to like him so much.
You gave up on him as well?

120
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:14,904
Yes.

121
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:17,382
So if you succeed,

122
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:20,451
you should become a comedian instead
of coming back to my hotel.

123
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:27,194
- Is it that easy to give up?
- No, not really.

124
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,610
He's on almost every single TV channel.

125
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,810
I hope the food here
tastes really horrible...

126
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:40,498
so that I'll never be reminded of it again.

127
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:12,400
("The Guys Who Died After Eating")

128
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:45,636
I told you to park the car and go.
Why do you keep following me?

129
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,413
I should make it hard for
you to give up on me...

130
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:49,271
by always being around you.

131
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,214
But right now, I'm here
to meet the chairman.

132
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:56,041
His granddaughter asked
me to give this to him.

133
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:57,576
I'll give it to him.

134
00:09:57,693 --> 00:09:59,814
No, how can I trust you?

135
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,014
I'll give it to him myself.

136
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,961
I'm the owner of this hotel,
and you recently got fired.

137
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:06,745
Ms. Jang.

138
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:11,162
Mr. Ku, I see you also came to work.

139
00:10:11,203 --> 00:10:14,031
He's not the general manager here.
He's just visiting.

140
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:15,761
Go ahead and meet the chairman.

141
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:18,798
I have something urgent to tell you.

142
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:39,933
Are you saying the guests you
guys brought were all murdered?

143
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,604
Yes, there were no graves.

144
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:43,594
We saw them buried in the woods.

145
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,943
I called the police from a payphone.

146
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,631
It was on the news.

147
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,283
Everyone is talking about that...

148
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,384
a number of corpses have been found
and how it might be a serial murder.

149
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:01,817
Judging from what the guests are saying,

150
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:04,563
it seems to be true that they were
all killed by the same person.

151
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,594
They all said it was someone
they had never seen before,

152
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:08,933
but they all agree that it was a young man.

153
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,106
It's that guy.

154
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:13,365
I'm sure the killer is
the owner of that car.

155
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:19,703
I jotted down the license plate number.

156
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:21,593
- Let's find him and...
- Don't get involved.

157
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:25,144
Hyun Joong already called the police,

158
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,484
and the fact that the bodies
were found has been on the news.

159
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:30,584
Since the killer is alive,
the police can catch him.

160
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:34,754
All we have to do is take good
care of the dead victims...

161
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:36,511
until they can see that
and ascend at peace.

162
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:40,292
Make sure to install a television
if they want to watch the news.

163
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:42,464
Give them access to our Wi-Fi network...

164
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:43,878
so that they can search the web.

165
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:45,445
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:58,095
It's okay.

167
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,928
The police will catch him.

168
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:02,313
Hyun Joong, you called the police,

169
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:06,394
so the cops must be so confused now.

170
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:11,216
The call was made from this payphone,

171
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:15,676
but no one was caught on that
security camera over there.

172
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:18,044
Was it a ghost?

173
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:20,249
It's so odd.

174
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,823
Ghosts don't exist.

175
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,906
What's odder to me is how
payphones like this still exist.

176
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,158
Do you have any change?

177
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:35,999
Oh, yes. Just a second, please.

178
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:39,866
Here you go.

179
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:43,469
Thank you.

180
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:46,675
I'll give you this in return.

181
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,073
It's all right.

182
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,295
Gosh, no. If you lose this,

183
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,167
you'll stay a bachelor.

184
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:04,413
You will never get married,
for the rest of your life.

185
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:06,908
Forever.

186
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,943
You won't even be able to date anyone.

187
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:13,517
Don't ever lose it.

188
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:18,806
Hey.

189
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,293
Right, yes.

190
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:22,849
Wait, ma'am.

191
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,616
What was that about?

192
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:35,784
You will never get married,
for the rest of your life.

193
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:39,175
Forever.

194
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,094
(Dear Grandfather whom I miss dearly)

195
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:52,841
(I'm so happy I can write
you a letter like this.)

196
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:55,933
Your granddaughter is very sad...

197
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:58,563
about not being by your
side in your final moments.

198
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:01,129
She was studying abroad at the time.

199
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:02,918
I get to see her like this.

200
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:04,888
I owe it all to you.

201
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:08,768
I guess you rode your motorcycle earlier.
That suits you.

202
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:11,326
You think so?

203
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:13,583
I never got to do this when I was alive,

204
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,199
thinking it'd be frowned upon.

205
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,553
Thanks to you, I get to enjoy this as well.

206
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:20,008
I'm glad to see you happy.

207
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,888
Isn't my granddaughter so pretty?

208
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,575
Yes, she is.

209
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,203
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Pardon me?

210
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:41,375
My granddaughter doesn't
have a boyfriend yet.

211
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,543
Her name is Jung Ji Eun. She's 25.

212
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:47,847
She's just been studying, so
she can't pick out good guys.

213
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:52,594
I wanted to find a nice,
hard-working guy for her.

214
00:14:55,994 --> 00:14:57,407
Oh, I see.

215
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,659
I'm sure she'll meet a wonderful man.
Don't worry.

216
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:04,256
I'll be off, then.

217
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,237
Chan Seong doesn't have a girlfriend.

218
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:20,544
You seemed curious about
that nice, hard-working guy.

219
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,564
Is that so?

220
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:26,490
Then shall I tell you
more about Chan Seong?

221
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:37,064
Shall I tell Chan Seong to take
care of this since he's here?

222
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:38,476
Forget it.

223
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,603
Ms. Jang. Ms. Jang, there you are.

224
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,833
What is it?

225
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,844
I curried favor with Chairman Wang...

226
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,474
as per your order.

227
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:48,736
Good. So have you found out anything?

228
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,614
He entrusted me with taking
care of something...

229
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:53,300
that is still bothering him very much.

230
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:57,283
Look at you. Well done, Mr. Kim.

231
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,224
You sure aced the civil service exam.

232
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,517
Once again, you proved to
be such a useful asset.

233
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,735
Chairman Wang...

234
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:06,216
has a granddaughter whom
he absolutely adores.

235
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:09,693
He's still upset that he couldn't
find a nice guy for her,

236
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,683
so I promised him I'll hook
her up with a nice guy.

237
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:13,104
You'll find a guy for her!

238
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,803
Great. If all goes well,
he'll buy you a nice suit.

239
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:19,308
He's a chairman, for goodness' sake.
He won't be that petty.

240
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:20,774
You're absolutely right.

241
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:23,114
You'll find a nice guy
for his granddaughter.

242
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:26,014
He'll have to take care of
this for us at the very least.

243
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:27,630
You have nothing to worry about now.

244
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:28,984
I knew it.

245
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:32,994
You're the ace of our
hotel, without a doubt.

246
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:37,261
And Chairman Wang really
likes the guy I recommended.

247
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:39,524
My gosh, Mr. Kim.

248
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:42,163
I'm sure all the work at the
bar keeps you busy enough.

249
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:44,688
When did you have time to go out,
meet people, and recommend someone?

250
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:48,872
I don't have time to meet new people.
I only know one guy.

251
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:51,385
What?

252
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,890
I recommended Ku Chan Seong.

253
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:59,333
You mean the general manager of our hotel,

254
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:01,570
Ku Chan Seong?

255
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:03,975
He's no longer our general manager.

256
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:05,883
I know it's been bothering you as well.

257
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:07,823
Let's marry him off to that rich family.

258
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,681
He won't ignore us if he marries
into that rich family thanks to us.

259
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:13,489
We'll get money from Chairman
Wang and Chan Seong.

260
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:14,877
We'll kill 2 birds with 1 stone.

261
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:17,809
Did he leave already?

262
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,994
I have to give him the
granddaughter's number.

263
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,946
Just trust me.

264
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:26,085
Where did he go?

265
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:31,647
That dunderhead.

266
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:37,353
Did Mr. Ku leave?

267
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:39,273
No, I didn't see him leaving.

268
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:42,725
That means he's still here.
All right, catch you later.

269
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:48,384
(Ms. Jang Man Weol, I love you.)

270
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,881
She still has this.

271
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:10,176
- You're still here.
- I will leave soon.

272
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,706
Mr. Ku. Mr. Ku?

273
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:15,954
What is going on?

274
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:17,943
Is he in Ms. Jang's office?

275
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:22,005
Mr. Ku!

276
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:24,704
He's not here.

277
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,504
What's the matter?

278
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,625
I have to... My gosh.

279
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,153
Would he be in the garden?

280
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,895
What's with him? Goodness.

281
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:43,571
Must we stay like this?

282
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:48,168
Why do we have to do this?

283
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:50,166
You don't like money, right?

284
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:52,041
You prefer humble things...

285
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,777
over fancy things.

286
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,077
You love that tacky brown...

287
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:58,660
I mean, you like dull colors like brown.

288
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,363
Right?

289
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:02,174
Is this your way of pressuring me...

290
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,851
because I'm refusing to give you
the painting of Mount Baekdu?

291
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:08,157
So you actually are.

292
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,305
You are greedy for money.

293
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:13,813
Yes, I am.

294
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:15,184
I want to make a lot of money.

295
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,113
Is being money-grubbing
something to brag about?

296
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,941
Is that what they taught you at Harvard?

297
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:23,024
Yes, MBA programs teach you
how you can earn money.

298
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:24,293
Okay, you show-off.

299
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,093
You money-grubbing Harvard fraud.

300
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,234
- What...
- I hope you become filthy rich.

301
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,677
Then own a hotel!

302
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:31,244
Get out!

303
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:33,915
Why...

304
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:45,811
She's so mad at me for not
giving her the painting.

305
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,373
Ms. Jang.

306
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,677
I'll give you back the
painting of Mount Baekdu.

307
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:04,104
And as for the medicine,
you should keep it.

308
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:09,055
Let's leave a way...

309
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,619
for me to run away...

310
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:16,552
and for you to abandon me to be safe.

311
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,578
I'll wait for your call to
reinstate me back at the hotel.

312
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,206
And the meal we had today.

313
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,866
It was delicious.

314
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,833
Let's...

315
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,243
go and have another meal there.

316
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,110
My wife hasn't been home for a few days.

317
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,798
That's why I'm calling you.

318
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:36,047
If she calls you, please
tell her that I'm sorry.

319
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,474
Please tell her to come back home.

320
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,563
Thank you.

321
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,941
Gosh.

322
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,582
No!

323
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,053
Honey!

324
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,683
Oh, no!

325
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:03,639
What happened to you? What is this? Honey.

326
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,103
What happened to you? Honey.

327
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,491
What...

328
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,550
What is this? Why...

329
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,571
Wait. Why...

330
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,416
It's just like the tip.
There's a body here.

331
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:23,191
You're under arrest for murdering
your wife, Lee Do Yeon.

332
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:26,001
- I didn't kill her.
- You have the right...

333
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:27,779
to remain silent. And you have
the right to an attorney.

334
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:32,031
What about the shovel? Get the shovel.
The one with dirt on it.

335
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,805
There you go. That's it.

336
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,304
You ought to arrest a serial killer.

337
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,733
Bye.

338
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:04,743
Darn it.

339
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,261
Why do you hate Seol Ji Won so much?

340
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:12,467
Did something happen between
you and him in the States?

341
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:15,429
Not between just the two of us.
Among three people.

342
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,751
Chan Seong was involved too?

343
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:19,850
It was after you went back to Korea.

344
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,083
A Korean international student
committed suicide in Boston.

345
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,590
But there was a ridiculous rumor
she killed herself because of me.

346
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,491
What? Because of you?

347
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,931
No way. Who would believe that?

348
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,072
People did.

349
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,231
That ridiculous rumor was fluffed up.

350
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:37,907
Later, people said that I toyed with
a poor International student...

351
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,901
and made her do something
nasty with foreign friends.

352
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,891
I became a rich piece of trash.

353
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,793
Afterward, on an online forum,
people started to bet...

354
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,641
whether I'd kill myself or not.

355
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:57,037
And the guy who set up the whole thing...

356
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,332
It's Seol Ji Won.

357
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,344
It's you, isn't it?

358
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,100
You're the one who spread
the rumor about Jae In.

359
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,300
I just said that...

360
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,846
I saw you invite her to the party
you had with rich European friends.

361
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:17,453
She...

362
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:20,481
She came to work as a waitress.

363
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:23,481
She said she needed money for her
tuition, so I got her a job.

364
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:25,339
She could have done something
else at the party.

365
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:33,393
Don't get so worked up because
no one will believe you.

366
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:36,760
Actually, everyone was fed up with
your righteous acts as a rich guy.

367
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,641
Keep your chin up.

368
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:47,972
I made a bet that you'd actually live.

369
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,619
What are you doing here? I've
been looking all over for you.

370
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:42,604
Let's go eat.

371
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:52,401
When I was in pure torment that
I almost thought about dying,

372
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,955
Chan Seong came to me.

373
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,211
That day, he took the box with the gun...

374
00:25:58,211 --> 00:25:59,481
and went to see Seol Ji Won.

375
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,814
After that, Seol Ji Won went
back to Korea all of a sudden.

376
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:05,240
What did Chan Seong do that day?

377
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,604
I don't know that either.

378
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:14,205
Well, anyway, after that, he always
found me to have a meal with me...

379
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:15,807
until the rumor died down.

380
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:18,483
That's how you two got so close.

381
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:26,855
Who threw these out?

382
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:29,088
You were supposed to throw
them out tomorrow, not today.

383
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,282
I'm sorry.

384
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,481
Chan Seong, I wrapped up some
pizza for you. Go wash up.

385
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:35,622
Thank you.

386
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,568
The recycling trash goes out on Saturday.

387
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,461
Don't tell Chan Seong that you met
Seol Ji Won at the meeting today.

388
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:50,761
I don't want Chan Seong to have
anything to do with that jerk.

389
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:52,549
Okay. I won't tell him.

390
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:00,534
It's my loss. There's no guy
better than Chan Seong.

391
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,043
I think Chan Seong makes
the best son-in-law.

392
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:14,120
I understand that you have a preference,

393
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,590
but you have already passed away.

394
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,991
How can you pass on your
message to your granddaughter?

395
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:22,090
That brings me to my next point.
I'd like to make...

396
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,788
a special request to your hotel.

397
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:28,431
The bartender told me all about it.

398
00:27:28,431 --> 00:27:31,100
I heard that your hotel provides
a dream call service...

399
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,999
where the dead can talk to
the living in their dreams.

400
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,681
I heard that I could pay you
with the money from this world.

401
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:45,115
I just remembered an asset
I forgot to take care of.

402
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,672
Grandpa.

403
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,458
You received my photo?

404
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,032
I really like the guy
who gave me this photo.

405
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,823
Mr. Ku Chan Seong?

406
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:50,892
That's right.

407
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:56,137
I really hope that young man
can be your husband forever.

408
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:58,940
Let me tell you about the guy.

409
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,315
Your time is up.

410
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,901
It was very expensive to make this call,

411
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:08,618
but it lasted only for a few seconds.

412
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,821
Then, why don't you make another call?

413
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:15,590
The rule says you can
only make a call a day.

414
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:18,335
You must think about other guests too.

415
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,876
But I think you told her
all the important parts.

416
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,694
Ms. Jang, will Mr. Ku...

417
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:38,821
marry into the wealthy family?

418
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,491
Kids these days rarely
listen to old people.

419
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,030
She never listened to
her grandfather anyway,

420
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,819
so why would she listen
to him after his passing?

421
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:56,238
My grandfather came to me
in my dream last night.

422
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,603
He told me that he received my photo.

423
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:01,378
Really? You must've been happy.

424
00:30:04,491 --> 00:30:05,632
Also,

425
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,011
he told me something else.

426
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,651
I really hope that young man
can be your husband forever.

427
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,491
Here you go.

428
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,975
Could you please clean this for us?

429
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,632
Thank you.

430
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:40,172
Mr. Ku.

431
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,203
Have you eaten?

432
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,186
I'd like to talk more about my grandfather.

433
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,448
Sure, let's grab a bite to eat.

434
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:54,182
What do you like?

435
00:30:58,171 --> 00:30:59,453
Here he comes!

436
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:01,380
Did you really murder your wife?

437
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,251
Why did you kill the
others that were buried?

438
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:04,911
Are there any more victims?

439
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:07,120
What was the reason behind these murders?

440
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,790
- Is there an accomplice?
- Are there any more victims?

441
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,074
- Please say a few words.
- Any words?

442
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,820
- Over here!
- Sir!

443
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,261
(Man Arrested for Murdering His Wife)

444
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:17,372
That's not right.

445
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,093
The guy had a smaller build.

446
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,641
What guy?

447
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,836
I don't think this man is the killer.

448
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,007
All we have to do is locate the car 0963.

449
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:37,692
"0963"?

450
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:39,738
Did you memorize the license plate number?

451
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:41,232
Yes.

452
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:43,090
Forget it like you forget English words.

453
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,263
Darn.

454
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:50,630
My friend owns the place, and
the food is quite tasty.

455
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,630
It's Mr. Ku.

456
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,873
Sanchez!

457
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,010
- How have you been?
- And you?

458
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,546
- Do you know Sanchez?
- We're in the same yacht club.

459
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,121
- It's been a while.
- Really?

460
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:01,474
- Long time no see.
- What a coincidence.

461
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,182
- I should visit sometime.
- You won't be allowed in.

462
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:06,631
That's not true.

463
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:08,760
You could if you had a hotel of your own.

464
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,376
I was going to talk...

465
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:13,562
about the car with Mr. Ku,
but he seems busy.

466
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:17,131
Actually, he doesn't work
at the hotel anymore.

467
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,312
What?

468
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,070
He'll soon marry into a rich family.

469
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,263
I'll use my experience as
general manager around here...

470
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,531
to greet customers and help with inventory.

471
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:28,040
- That's nice.
- I can talk to customers too.

472
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,318
(Ku Chan Seong)

473
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:38,043
I'll wait for your call to
reinstate me back at the hotel.

474
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,725
Ms. Jang!

475
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,607
They met, they met

476
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,616
The blind date happened.

477
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:54,992
What? They met?

478
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,603
I saw Mr. Ku meeting Chairman
Wang's granddaughter.

479
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,980
I haven't seen him smile so widely before.

480
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:05,833
Of course.

481
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,852
Who knew he had such ambition?

482
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,601
I'm not sure about that.

483
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:24,201
He's always been the friendly type.

484
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,888
You should see for yourself then.

485
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,757
They agreed to meet tomorrow as well.

486
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:30,432
Mr. Ku invited her over to his house.

487
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:32,934
That means she's going to meet Mr.
Ku's father.

488
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,701
Mr. Ku's father passed away, remember?

489
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,235
Do you know about his mother?

490
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,137
Is his mother still alive?

491
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,834
How should I know?

492
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,681
You're always bitter when this comes up.

493
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:49,931
Anyway, wouldn't it be great if
this leads to Ku Chan Seong...

494
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:51,446
getting his own family?

495
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:54,024
You know how warm he's been to our guests.

496
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:58,109
This must be the work of good karma.
And I'm so happy for him.

497
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,793
Is that so?

498
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,793
May he be of luck then.

499
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,252
Are you cleaning because
Ji Eun is coming tomorrow?

500
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:27,890
Yes, it should be clean.

501
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,608
Dating someone else will help
him forget about Man Weol.

502
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,532
Still, he plays it big.

503
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,912
He only goes for a woman who
has a hotel of her own.

504
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:23,445
There's a book here that's
haunted by a ghost.

505
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,303
That's ridiculous.

506
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,884
My cousin's a librarian
here, and she told me.

507
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:30,300
The ghost that donated it...

508
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,816
comes along whenever you pull it out.

509
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:33,343
Sounds like fun.

510
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:36,259
Where's the book? Let's
post it on social media.

511
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,493
- This way?
- Yes.

512
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,931
Okay, I'm filming.

513
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:53,703
- Pull it out.
- Got it.

514
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,061
It won't come out. I'm not kidding!

515
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:03,051
- Come on already.
- It really must be haunted.

516
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,952
What's wrong?

517
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,135
Sol? Are you all right?

518
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:20,962
Sol?

519
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,681
Hey! Are you all right?

520
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,065
("Existence and Time")

521
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,425
Are you all right? Sol, wake up!

522
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,750
Come on. Please.

523
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:35,775
Wake up.

524
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:41,471
If Ku Chan Seong hasn't taken the medicine,

525
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:43,924
then he'll still be able to see
the spirits that have separated.

526
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,534
It's the curse of being able to see it.

527
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,540
I hear you made two incompatible
souls cross their paths.

528
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,452
It's always fun to make enemies
of previous lives meet again.

529
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:58,909
They're drawn to each other
because of leftover feelings.

530
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:02,676
My goodness.

531
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,376
How pretty!

532
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,143
- Are you getting in?
- Yes.

533
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,121
Excuse me.

534
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,393
Is this yours?

535
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,031
Thank you.

536
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:06,931
Look.

537
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,021
Just look at this.

538
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,021
This is all because of your pen.

539
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:12,760
This outfit is brand new, you know.

540
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,690
I'm terribly sorry. What can I do?

541
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,074
You can pay for the dry-cleaning.

542
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,358
I'm busy today, so give
me your number instead.

543
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,812
Sorry?

544
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,383
Hold on.

545
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,052
This ink is black.

546
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,881
You're right. It's very black...

547
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,464
even though it's pink on the outside.

548
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,332
Whatever then.

549
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,301
Excuse me.

550
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,931
This pen is important to me,

551
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:52,647
so let me pay for the cleaning
for getting it back to me.

552
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,583
May I have your number?

553
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,852
Sure thing.

554
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:22,986
So this is the library
Chairman Wang established.

555
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,900
Yes, this must be why my
grandfather came to me...

556
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,618
in my dream.

557
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:37,550
I wanted this would happen
the moment I met you too.

558
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,770
My grandfather will be happy.

559
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,863
Shall we go?

560
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,245
Are you happy now?

561
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,900
They make a nice couple.

562
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,152
Then, as you promised,

563
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:03,159
I will keep that money.

564
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,684
You can keep watching them here.

565
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,827
You are so pretty.

566
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:47,181
You are like a princess.

567
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,363
Really?

568
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,369
- I hardly recognize you.
- Thanks.

569
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,867
How is your mother?

570
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,990
She is healthy and doing well.

571
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,521
- Good. I need to visit her.
- Yes.

572
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,349
This is Ku Chan Seong.

573
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,403
Hello.

574
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:03,478
Nice to meet you. I am Ku Chan Seong.

575
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,622
Ms. Jang.

576
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:20,123
Why are you here?

577
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,331
Chairman Wang wanted to
see his granddaughter.

578
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,951
He paid a high price for dream call,

579
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,481
so this is a special service for him.

580
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:27,035
You can ignore this and go.

581
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,320
Since you are here, why don't
you look around the library?

582
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,275
There are many good books...

583
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,190
and good pictures here.

584
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,676
Forget it.

585
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,044
I'm going back.

586
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,647
Come on. Take a look around the library.

587
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:42,787
There's a nice picture here.

588
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,926
I sold this.

589
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:55,851
If we waited for the Chairman's
memorial hall to be established,

590
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:57,668
you'd probably collapse first.

591
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:02,553
So his granddaughter and I
decided to hang it here.

592
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,465
I came here to sell this.
What did you come to sell?

593
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,656
What kind of a deal did you make
with the chairman without me?

594
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,689
What is this "dream call fee"?

595
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,553
You don't need to know.

596
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,258
There are many good pictures here?

597
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,198
Why don't we look at them?

598
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:29,270
How much did you rip off from the chairman?

599
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,705
Just a little.

600
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:34,690
Actually, that's the
chairman's picture too.

601
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,913
I feel a bit like committing fraud.

602
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:39,858
You are a greedy, money-grubbing
Harvard fraud anyway.

603
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,572
A fraud?

604
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,951
You keep calling me that. Take it back.

605
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,424
- I don't want to.
- You don't want to?

606
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:50,006
That's not what matters.
Take back what you said.

607
00:42:52,141 --> 00:42:55,040
That guy called Chan Seong...

608
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,853
seemed nice.

609
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,259
Are you seeing him?

610
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,367
I wanted to.

611
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,809
He told me there is someone else.

612
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,162
The cafeteria of this
library is not bad at all.

613
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:25,281
Isn't it?

614
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,861
I came here often with my
father when I was young.

615
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,323
The food was also good then.

616
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,024
Did you live around here
when you were young?

617
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:35,010
Father wanted to send me to an
elementary school around here.

618
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,748
The rent in this neighborhood was so
high that we couldn't get a room.

619
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:39,464
But we came here often.

620
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:41,103
Because the food was cheap and tasty.

621
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,347
Did you only live with your
father from the start?

622
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,588
Yes. The reason why my
name is Chan Seong is...

623
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,396
that the only person who wanted
me to be born was my father.

624
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:55,137
He felt bad about that so
he named me Chan Seong.

625
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:58,970
But he didn't know Chinese
characters very well.

626
00:43:59,411 --> 00:44:00,987
And my name means a brilliant star.

627
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,769
The reason your father sold you...

628
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,237
was not because to save himself.

629
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:12,193
It was because of you.

630
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,336
Because you would be alone without him.

631
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:21,864
Of course I know that.
He was my only family.

632
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:32,098
If you are finished, let's
go and read some books.

633
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:33,653
Books?

634
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,860
I can't do that in this condition.

635
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:41,380
- Why?
- My clothes don't suit books.

636
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,251
What's that got to do with books?

637
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:45,574
It has everything to do with them.

638
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,251
I have to take a photo at the library...

639
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,907
to post it on my social media.

640
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:52,090
What I'm wearing isn't appropriate.

641
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,373
Oh, dear.

642
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,891
Have some coffee and wait for me.

643
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:57,516
I'll get changed and come right back.

644
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,951
There's no need for that. Sit down.

645
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:02,591
I didn't mean to go to read books.

646
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,061
I want us to find the
ghost attached to a book.

647
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:12,510
There is a rumor that there
is a ghost around here.

648
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,328
The director of the
library is very worried.

649
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:17,077
If there really is a ghost, we
should take it to the hotel.

650
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:19,612
There is a book with a ghost?

651
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,891
Yes.

652
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:23,486
The rumor is that the ghost
donated the book before.

653
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,521
She was an elementary school
principal and she died not long ago.

654
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,130
Her family donated her books.

655
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,818
The book must have been precious to her.

656
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,471
I don't know.

657
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:35,271
Most people easily throw away
things they used to care about.

658
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:37,725
They protect things they want
to hide with their life.

659
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,300
That ghost must have got nervous
when so many people came...

660
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,359
to borrow the book because of the rumor.

661
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,358
What's there to hide in the book?

662
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,569
It's probably her emergency money.

663
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,463
Gosh.

664
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,370
She speeds up only when
it has to do with money.

665
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:00,190
You're the human so take out the book.
Then the ghost will come.

666
00:46:03,101 --> 00:46:04,677
"Existence and Time".

667
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,836
Nobody would want to read this book.

668
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:10,101
I read it.

669
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,670
I'm sure you did.

670
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,267
Since you're such a smarty
pants Ku Chan Seong.

671
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,330
You're so great.

672
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,678
I read it to show off.

673
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:21,891
But it was difficult to understand.

674
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:25,253
I've been living for over a thousand
years, trying to pass away time.

675
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:29,156
Even I don't know what
is existence or time.

676
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,617
You've only lived for about 30
years, so how could you know?

677
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,467
Let's see what this book
tells about the time.

678
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:40,422
The ghost might not appear if I'm here.

679
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,014
I'll be near the bookshelf in the back.

680
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,934
You can see me?

681
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,478
Yes, I can see you.

682
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:08,848
What are you doing here?

683
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,750
I don't want anyone to read this book.

684
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,900
Is there something you
cherish in this book?

685
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:18,355
Or is it something you want to hide?

686
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,362
Can you get rid of
something inside the book?

687
00:47:24,311 --> 00:47:25,492
I will help you.

688
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,436
To do that, I have to take out the book.

689
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,376
It's the past I have been hiding.

690
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,521
My family must not find out about it.

691
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,153
Please get rid of it.

692
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:48,543
The lady we just saw...

693
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:53,446
I think she's my mother.

694
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,127
I haven't seen her since I was very young.

695
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:10,498
I didn't even know she passed away.

696
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,485
I didn't know my father
sent these photos to her.

697
00:49:20,161 --> 00:49:21,978
(Chan Seong and I are going to the US.)

698
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:26,885
It wasn't something she cherished.

699
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:29,916
It was something she wanted to hide.

700
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,423
I guess...

701
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,027
she really didn't want me to be born.

702
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,191
You volunteered to go through trouble.

703
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,260
That's why you ended up
finding out about this.

704
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:09,229
It's just useless and upsetting.

705
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,058
What? Am I wrong?

706
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:15,780
Are you going to say you felt
happy to see your mother?

707
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,478
Do you want to take her to the hotel
so you could be a filial son?

708
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,365
Do you think I'd want to do that?

709
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,971
Good.

710
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,411
Give me that. Let me put it back.

711
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:29,800
We'll just let that ghost
stay there forever.

712
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,972
That's not...

713
00:50:31,931 --> 00:50:33,315
what I want either.

714
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,049
Then what do you want?

715
00:50:36,331 --> 00:50:38,900
You ended up going through this
because I made you see ghosts,

716
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,471
so I should at least do something for you.

717
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:41,722
I'm just sad...

718
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,471
that I'm not able to feel happy
even after I got to meet my mom...

719
00:50:48,851 --> 00:50:50,134
for the first time.

720
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,339
Just let me grieve.

721
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,094
Forget it. Just go.

722
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:59,112
Did something happen? Why
do you look so upset?

723
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,701
Well...

724
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:04,013
I just feel a little sad.

725
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,660
I'm glad you're here. I'll cheer you up.

726
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,680
Let's go. I'll buy you a drink.

727
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:19,359
Hey, you lost a button.

728
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:21,287
Where did you lose it?

729
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,201
You're making me feel sorry for you.

730
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:45,946
Was she trying to console me?

731
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:50,184
Sanchez.

732
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,371
Hey, Mi Ra. I was just getting
ready to leave with Chan Seong.

733
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:54,987
What? Chan Seong's here?

734
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,141
I don't think you can join us today.

735
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:00,951
You'll have to eat alone.

736
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:04,280
I have company. Someone will
be here to eat with me.

737
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,532
- Really?
- Yes.

738
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:17,282
Gosh, this place is nice.

739
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,425
What's going on?

740
00:54:04,454 --> 00:54:06,776
Chan Seong, say hello. He's Park Yeong Su.

741
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:24,403
I helped him find something
that means a lot to him.

742
00:54:24,403 --> 00:54:25,686
So he came to treat me to a meal.

743
00:54:29,314 --> 00:54:30,526
He died...

744
00:54:31,383 --> 00:54:32,758
because of you.

745
00:54:33,414 --> 00:54:34,565
What?

746
00:54:36,454 --> 00:54:39,124
I know, right? His looks are to die for.

747
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:40,335
My gosh, Mi Ra.

748
00:54:41,954 --> 00:54:43,842
He's a cop.

749
00:54:45,693 --> 00:54:47,612
I heard you're going to leave with Sanchez.

750
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:49,077
See you later.

751
00:54:58,243 --> 00:55:00,697
What's wrong? Do you know him?

752
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:03,326
No, I don't know him.

753
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:05,626
But Ms. Jang does.

754
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:07,866
Man Weol?

755
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,670
Does he know her too?

756
00:55:10,984 --> 00:55:12,570
No, he probably doesn't.

757
00:55:16,124 --> 00:55:19,729
Sanchez, I don't think I can drink today.
I'm sorry.

758
00:55:20,564 --> 00:55:21,675
It's okay.

759
00:55:30,743 --> 00:55:33,975
Tell me if Chan Seong ever told you
anything personal about his life.

760
00:55:34,343 --> 00:55:36,914
Does he have any relatives
that he keeps in touch with?

761
00:55:36,914 --> 00:55:39,468
What about his friends? Who else is
he friends with other than Sanchez?

762
00:55:45,084 --> 00:55:47,354
No one knows anything? Seriously?

763
00:55:47,354 --> 00:55:49,817
Mr. Ku always stuck by your side...

764
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:53,093
I mean, he always spent time with you.

765
00:55:53,093 --> 00:55:54,244
Don't you know anything, Ms. Jang?

766
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,234
It's natural that I don't
know since I'm his boss.

767
00:55:57,234 --> 00:55:59,384
But you guys should know since
you guys are his colleagues.

768
00:55:59,504 --> 00:56:02,908
How can you be so indifferent
about your colleague?

769
00:56:06,644 --> 00:56:07,826
Mr. Kim.

770
00:56:07,943 --> 00:56:09,673
You even recommended him to
the chairman's granddaughter.

771
00:56:09,673 --> 00:56:10,943
And yet you know nothing?

772
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:14,454
I only recommended him
because he has a kind heart.

773
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,281
Hyun Joong, weren't you
pretty close to him?

774
00:56:17,484 --> 00:56:20,321
Well, from what I remember,

775
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:22,668
Mr. Ku...

776
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:26,242
likes the color brown.

777
00:56:26,294 --> 00:56:27,747
Even I know that.

778
00:56:32,363 --> 00:56:34,222
The Grim Reaper's here.

779
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:36,420
Will you stop nagging at them?

780
00:56:37,073 --> 00:56:38,921
You don't seem to know anything either.

781
00:56:38,943 --> 00:56:41,599
What about you? Do you know anything?

782
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:42,988
You saw him very often.

783
00:56:46,914 --> 00:56:49,843
I get that you guys are ghosts,

784
00:56:49,984 --> 00:56:52,175
but you're all so cold-hearted.

785
00:56:54,723 --> 00:56:57,894
Ms. Jang, why don't you
just ask him yourself?

786
00:56:57,894 --> 00:56:59,783
He's here.

787
00:57:20,613 --> 00:57:22,604
I thought you'd be sad for a long time.

788
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,899
I guess you're okay already.

789
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:28,167
I'm not okay yet.

790
00:57:32,524 --> 00:57:34,049
But I came because of you.

791
00:57:36,193 --> 00:57:37,345
Because of me?

792
00:57:39,403 --> 00:57:40,746
I think...

793
00:57:42,204 --> 00:57:44,526
I disclosed the reason behind
your existence and time.

794
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:52,107
I met someone from your painful memory.

795
00:58:04,464 --> 00:58:10,665
(Beomcheon Central Police Station)

796
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:31,503
He used to be a thief.

797
00:58:34,693 --> 00:58:36,208
But now, he's a cop.

798
00:58:46,504 --> 00:58:48,625
You're living a good life again.

799
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:54,526
I'm glad.

800
00:58:57,644 --> 00:58:59,057
What a relief.

801
00:59:13,024 --> 00:59:14,205
Do you want to...

802
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:16,707
go closer and talk to him?

803
00:59:19,464 --> 00:59:20,615
No.

804
00:59:21,734 --> 00:59:22,946
I'm nobody.

805
00:59:24,274 --> 00:59:26,223
He was like a family to you.

806
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,227
Will you be okay?

807
00:59:30,684 --> 00:59:32,159
I won't be okay.

808
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:35,696
It's a bit sad.

809
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:39,137
I brought a connection...

810
00:59:42,193 --> 00:59:43,911
from your past again.

811
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:53,474
Thank you.

812
00:59:54,774 --> 00:59:55,986
Chan Seong.

813
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,938
- Let me see.
- Gosh. No.

814
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:19,723
The serial murder case.

815
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:21,643
You got the analysis report on
the dirt from the shovel, right?

816
01:01:22,093 --> 01:01:23,265
Pardon?

817
01:01:23,273 --> 01:01:24,574
Yes, it's the same
component from the soil...

818
01:01:24,574 --> 01:01:25,914
where the bodies were found.

819
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:27,054
Right?

820
01:01:27,114 --> 01:01:29,941
But why does that suspect keep
denying that he killed them?

821
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:31,699
This is giving me a headache.

822
01:01:32,253 --> 01:01:33,496
But the thing is...

823
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:36,677
he doesn't have any motives
other than his wife's murder.

824
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,075
He's a typical psychopath.

825
01:01:40,724 --> 01:01:41,936
A murder fanatic.

826
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:06,495
The end.

827
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:43,923
(Standard Packaged Moving)

828
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:47,761
So there's a problem with the stuff
the truck was carrying that day.

829
01:02:48,193 --> 01:02:50,082
Everything arrived without a problem.

830
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:55,082
Check the name of the
reservation one more time.

831
01:02:55,434 --> 01:02:58,373
The reservation with the
truck, 3465, was made under...

832
01:02:58,373 --> 01:02:59,687
Ku Chan Seong.

833
01:03:03,074 --> 01:03:06,043
- Who?
- Isn't this Mr. Ku Chan Seong?

834
01:03:09,543 --> 01:03:10,694
Ku Chan Seong?

835
01:03:13,454 --> 01:03:14,666
No way.

836
01:03:22,994 --> 01:03:24,246
Ku Chan Seong.

837
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:26,305
Ku Chan Seong.

838
01:03:27,233 --> 01:03:28,981
Why am I running into you here?

839
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:53,605
Chan Seong.

840
01:03:54,923 --> 01:03:56,479
Are you staying home today again?

841
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:01,188
- Yes.
- You're not going to the hotel?

842
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,024
You kept going there and
said you'd be reinstated.

843
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,850
I have unfinished business here.

844
01:04:06,534 --> 01:04:07,755
I don't think...

845
01:04:08,443 --> 01:04:11,170
I can take care of the hotel
guests if I go in this state.

846
01:04:31,164 --> 01:04:32,750
("Existence and Time")

847
01:04:40,204 --> 01:04:43,375
Will I find an answer once I'm
done with this difficult book?

848
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:45,128
A way to comfort a guy...

849
01:04:46,313 --> 01:04:49,314
whose existence and time he had spent...

850
01:04:50,213 --> 01:04:51,425
have completely been rejected.

851
01:04:59,224 --> 01:05:02,192
Are you worried that the secret
you've been hiding would be exposed?

852
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:05,476
Don't worry.

853
01:05:06,463 --> 01:05:08,958
Your son doesn't want that.

854
01:05:12,904 --> 01:05:14,318
He's sad.

855
01:05:16,304 --> 01:05:17,757
And I want to comfort him.

856
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:21,296
I need you.

857
01:05:23,983 --> 01:05:25,166
I will...

858
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:28,040
escort you to my hotel.

859
01:05:37,963 --> 01:05:39,105
Reinstated.

860
01:05:39,594 --> 01:05:42,058
Come to the hotel. Take Line Four.

861
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:46,640
A guest you must send off is waiting.

862
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:49,621
A guest I must send off?

863
01:06:29,414 --> 01:06:31,909
Mr. Ku, congratulations
on your reinstatement.

864
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,830
You came back to Myeong-dong.

865
01:06:34,084 --> 01:06:36,407
I like this place way more
than the other place.

866
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:48,749
I look forward to working with you.

867
01:07:02,313 --> 01:07:04,584
I thought he would marry
into a rich family.

868
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,877
He came back to this hotel of ghosts.

869
01:07:07,183 --> 01:07:08,941
How could a man have no ambition?

870
01:07:09,223 --> 01:07:11,647
Ms. Jang needs Mr. Ku.

871
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:14,819
Ambitious men aren't popular among ladies.

872
01:07:15,693 --> 01:07:17,137
You're so behind the times.

873
01:07:17,593 --> 01:07:21,674
Besides, I told you to stop
talking like a dinosaur.

874
01:07:27,074 --> 01:07:28,719
I changed the way I talk a lot.

875
01:07:29,803 --> 01:07:31,257
Right? Gosh.

876
01:07:54,063 --> 01:07:55,448
I'm sorry for having kept you waiting.

877
01:07:59,904 --> 01:08:01,388
Thank you for coming.

878
01:08:06,574 --> 01:08:08,028
May I keep...

879
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:11,601
the photos from the book?

880
01:08:15,454 --> 01:08:16,767
Could you?

881
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:19,505
I'm very...

882
01:08:22,393 --> 01:08:23,606
sorry.

883
01:09:22,053 --> 01:09:23,295
Goodbye.

884
01:09:26,723 --> 01:09:27,874
Mother.

885
01:10:19,313 --> 01:10:20,657
Did you see her off?

886
01:10:22,983 --> 01:10:24,124
Yes.

887
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:28,653
I'm sorry I took the liberty
of bringing her here.

888
01:10:31,324 --> 01:10:34,525
Thank you for bringing her here.

889
01:10:36,093 --> 01:10:37,204
Also...

890
01:10:38,494 --> 01:10:39,777
for telling me to return.

891
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:46,736
It's embarrassing for me to say this,
but let's get things straight.

892
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,825
You didn't return because I told you to.

893
01:10:50,343 --> 01:10:51,485
You did it for me.

894
01:10:56,714 --> 01:11:00,047
I could've fed you the medicine
so you could never return,

895
01:11:01,983 --> 01:11:03,599
but I didn't do that.

896
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:12,511
I thought you returned as you pleased...

897
01:11:13,964 --> 01:11:16,761
every time I gave you a chance to run away.

898
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,258
But in fact,

899
01:11:23,303 --> 01:11:25,767
I was hoping you'd return.

900
01:11:30,584 --> 01:11:34,017
I'm glad to hear you admit that
I wasn't the only clingy one,

901
01:11:34,683 --> 01:11:35,834
wanting to return.

902
01:11:45,693 --> 01:11:46,804
Chan Seong.

903
01:11:48,933 --> 01:11:50,347
I'm going to use you.

904
01:11:54,103 --> 01:11:55,993
You brought both that woman and Yeon Woo...

905
01:11:57,244 --> 01:11:58,729
to me,

906
01:12:00,874 --> 01:12:02,157
which means...

907
01:12:04,813 --> 01:12:06,066
you'll bring him too.

908
01:12:10,723 --> 01:12:12,239
Yes, probably.

909
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:14,110
I'm certain that it'll happen.

910
01:12:16,294 --> 01:12:17,435
And...

911
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,582
I will never let him...

912
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:24,129
pass by unscathed.

913
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:26,520
That's why you'll use me?

914
01:12:26,534 --> 01:12:29,332
That's right. I'll be vicious and cunning.

915
01:12:30,074 --> 01:12:31,357
And you may end up...

916
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,922
being used, abused, and
wrecked because of me.

917
01:12:36,114 --> 01:12:37,295
Are you...

918
01:12:39,053 --> 01:12:40,214
threatening me again to run away...

919
01:12:40,214 --> 01:12:41,396
No.

920
01:12:44,124 --> 01:12:45,335
Don't run away.

921
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:50,610
You've already made up your mind...

922
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:54,756
to be a bother and expose
yourself to danger.

923
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,820
Knowing that such danger...

924
01:12:59,603 --> 01:13:01,664
could lead to death,

925
01:13:04,273 --> 01:13:05,556
stay by my side.

926
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:10,695
Even if...

927
01:13:12,883 --> 01:13:14,600
I go berserk, do crazy things,

928
01:13:16,084 --> 01:13:17,912
and vanish one day,

929
01:13:22,223 --> 01:13:23,941
please stay by my side.

930
01:13:28,563 --> 01:13:29,674
No.

931
01:13:38,643 --> 01:13:40,795
I won't let you vanish.

932
01:13:52,654 --> 01:13:53,835
Trust me.

933
01:16:57,943 --> 01:17:01,752
(Hotel Del Luna)

934
01:17:02,843 --> 01:17:05,914
It must be pretty heartbreaking
to miss someone you can't see.

935
01:17:06,183 --> 01:17:09,719
I'm going easy on you because you're frail.

936
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:14,246
You probably saw the flowers.
Why aren't you saying anything?

937
01:17:15,393 --> 01:17:18,596
We have to leave before Ms. Jang does,

938
01:17:18,664 --> 01:17:20,482
so let's prepare ourselves mentally.

939
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:24,695
They look so pretty now.
Why must they wilt?

940
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:26,415
It's sad.

941
01:17:26,704 --> 01:17:27,987
Flowers bloom...

942
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:30,562
to wilt.
