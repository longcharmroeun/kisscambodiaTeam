00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,059
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,509
- My gosh, look at that.
- It's beautiful.

3
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:39,453
Chung Myung, is that you?

4
00:01:58,203 --> 00:01:59,943
You look happy,

5
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:02,613
Princess Song Hwa.

6
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:23,893
Why are you here?

7
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:25,734
Why do you think?

8
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:29,673
Do you think I came here to
congratulate your wedding?

9
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:33,944
I shouldn't have shown you mercy back then.

10
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:37,583
The big smile you had
on your face earlier...

11
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,183
was very beautiful.

12
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:43,514
What a waste.

13
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,324
The groom will never get the
chance to see it again.

14
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,393
I'll greet him in your place,

15
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:54,493
I'm not sure if that will
look beautiful though.

16
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:37,703
Chan Seong.

17
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,504
Hey, Mi Ra.

18
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:48,384
She's my friend. I wonder
how she knew I'd be here.

19
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:50,583
Chan Seong.

20
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:55,023
You brought her here.

21
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:59,094
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable.

22
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,634
This is why you came.

23
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:07,104
They had no intention of letting me go...

24
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:10,534
in the first place.

25
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:12,544
Ms. Jang.

26
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:14,673
Is there something wrong?

27
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,313
She's smiling again...

28
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:26,053
right in front of me.

29
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,763
Gosh, Mi Ra!

30
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:02,123
Go look after her.

31
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,323
That is your job.

32
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:21,443
Here.

33
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:29,414
- Hey, Chan Seong.
- Yes, sorry.

34
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:31,584
- Hold my hand.
- Okay.

35
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:53,604
Here.

36
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:55,714
Thanks.

37
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:56,844
Well...

38
00:05:57,484 --> 00:05:59,613
I did come here to obstruct you,

39
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:02,013
but I didn't know I'd end
up doing it this way.

40
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:05,524
Drink this.

41
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:08,024
You drank seawater earlier.
It'll refresh you.

42
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,633
Was her name Jang Man Weol?

43
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,263
Your boss. Did she leave because of me?

44
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:20,604
Do you know her by any chance?

45
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:22,373
No, I've never seen her before.

46
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:24,133
Why do you ask? Did she say she knows me?

47
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:26,803
Did I see her at the hospital?

48
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:31,243
Anyway, I'm being such a nuisance.

49
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,614
By the way, that was not
intentional at all.

50
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:36,454
The wind blew suddenly as
if someone was pushing me.

51
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,784
My gosh, that was so scary.

52
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:48,334
Did she actually push you?

53
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:53,363
Nothing's been going my way. I
must be cursed or something.

54
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:55,433
Should I go see a shaman?

55
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:57,234
You need to sprinkle salt.

56
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:00,503
You must purify yourself when
evil spirits are bugging you.

57
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:03,444
Don't stay out until late
at night just in case,

58
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:04,583
and try not to be alone.

59
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,984
You sound just like my grandma right now.

60
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:09,553
She always used to say...

61
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,884
that I must be careful at all times...

62
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:12,683
because of my bad karma from my past lives.

63
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:15,923
She gave me this. She
said it'll protect me.

64
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:18,224
You still wear that bracelet?

65
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:20,823
You remember it.

66
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,234
Chan Seong, I think bad spirits
are following me around.

67
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:25,533
Stay with me at night.

68
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,904
I have to work at night.

69
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,473
I called a cab for you, so
just go home when it arrives.

70
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:31,504
I lost my purse though.

71
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:32,843
I've already paid for the cab ride.

72
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,714
I'll put it on your tab, so pay me back.

73
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:37,813
Don't forget that you're in debt,
which is even scarier than ghosts.

74
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:42,214
Gosh.

75
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:45,553
My gosh.

76
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:50,053
Chan Seong.

77
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:52,964
You brought her here.

78
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,464
This is why you came.

79
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:01,803
I wonder if she's okay.

80
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,794
(Lee Mi Ra)

81
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,234
"Lee Mi Ra".

82
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:12,373
His ex-girlfriend from
the US came by earlier.

83
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:21,113
What a cruel twist of fate.

84
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:24,824
Enough is enough, please.

85
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:26,824
(Delete 1 image.)

86
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:38,033
Gosh, how much longer will
you folks keep this up?

87
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:51,344
I have a lot on my mind right now.

88
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:54,814
Those ridiculous dance moves are
really getting on my nerves.

89
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:57,184
Enough, okay?

90
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,793
My gosh, nice!

91
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:14,334
Next news.

92
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:17,634
Ms. Park Heung Ja, the oldest
living person in the country...

93
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:18,903
You folks can...

94
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:22,273
take a break and start dancing
away again after I get off.

95
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:23,714
She was...

96
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:25,944
the only living person in the
country born in the 19th century.

97
00:10:26,313 --> 00:10:29,283
Ms. Park lived to be 120
and led a happy life...

98
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:32,754
with her children and
grandchildren, always offering...

99
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:35,193
positive words of wisdom
with a smile on her face.

100
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,523
She led a great life and
passed away with no regrets.

101
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,804
(In mourning)

102
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:52,373
You enjoyed a fortunate
life for over a century,

103
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,003
so you can leave with no regrets.

104
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,214
You're going to leave like this?

105
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:14,123
Your great-grandson's
wife is due very soon.

106
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:18,363
Wait a couple of months, and you can
meet your great-great-grandchild.

107
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,704
She lived for 120 years.

108
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:24,074
She has 8 children and 24 grandchildren.

109
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,543
It'd be foolishly greedy of her to
stay just to meet a grandkid...

110
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:28,273
of one of those grandchildren of hers.

111
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:32,113
Your great-great-grandchild
will be so adorable.

112
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:35,013
You'll be incredibly sad if you
don't get to meet this baby.

113
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:37,354
I said, she lived for 120 years.

114
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:40,954
You have nothing to be sad about.

115
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:55,734
Why stop a soul who is
ready to rest in peace?

116
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,474
I stopped her? No, her
great-great-grandkid did.

117
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,974
She's has witnessed three centuries...

118
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,413
and experienced everything humans
can possibly experience...

119
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,814
in one lifetime.

120
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,984
And because of you, that special soul...

121
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:11,153
will wander the living realm now.

122
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:14,554
They won't let such a special
soul wander the living realm.

123
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:19,293
Look, that nosy woman is already here.

124
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:42,984
Her children are great cooks.

125
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,184
They made delicious food
even for her funeral.

126
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:48,123
Hey, try some.

127
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:53,424
I can tell right away that
it came out of a package.

128
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:56,693
If you have to cook
yourself for the funeral,

129
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,633
your family will never be at peace.

130
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:04,773
I guess her family's motto
is to take the easy way.

131
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:07,944
This is why her family was so happy.

132
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:11,844
Did you interrupt...

133
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:14,344
that spirit's journey to the
afterlife just to see me?

134
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:17,584
I'm kind of regretting it.

135
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,554
She's too far.

136
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:22,324
I should have gone to her right away.

137
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,263
To that woman, Song Hwa.

138
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:33,033
No, in this life, she's Lee Mi Ra.

139
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:36,434
While you were shriveled up
and your time has stopped,

140
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:41,174
she came back to this life as a
human after living many lives.

141
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:45,513
You have met due to the
connection in your previous life.

142
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:47,143
Just let her pass by.

143
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:50,984
How could I just let her pass by me?

144
00:13:54,754 --> 00:13:58,094
To you, she may be an object
of an unfinished grudge.

145
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:00,464
To her,

146
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:04,133
you're a piece of her previous
life which she doesn't remember.

147
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,503
You wanted me to let her go.

148
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:13,003
That's why you made me meet
her through Chan Seong.

149
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:18,783
You cannot harm that girl.

150
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:27,184
Only then, I'll leave
this world peacefully...

151
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:32,964
just like Warmhearted Ma Go wants.

152
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:46,174
To give you some relief,

153
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,743
I'll go back to the hotel without
causing trouble and stay there.

154
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:01,123
Drop me off on your way.

155
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:04,354
Or you can take me to the Sanzu River.

156
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:18,344
Will...

157
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:21,844
he come too?

158
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:52,974
For a flower to blossom, she
needs to feel the wind...

159
00:15:53,374 --> 00:15:54,974
and face the rain too.

160
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:06,224
Do you know where Ms. Jang is?

161
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:09,693
She hasn't come back yet.

162
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,523
Did anything happen on your outing?

163
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:14,023
She got mad all of a
sudden and disappeared.

164
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:16,033
Ms. Jang sudden change of mood...

165
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,604
isn't special. It happens all the time.

166
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,474
When she gets mad, she usually
goes shopping or to a restaurant.

167
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:24,533
She's probably at a department store
or at a famous restaurant now.

168
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,374
She can't probably do that because
she reached her credit card limit.

169
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,714
Then, she must be livid.

170
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:32,043
I should stay away from her today.

171
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:34,813
When she gets livid, does
she vanish into thin air...

172
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:36,183
and not come back to the hotel?

173
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:37,513
That never happens.

174
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,884
Ms. Jang has to come back to the hotel.

175
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:42,153
No matter how far she runs away,
the hotel will chase after her.

176
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:44,554
The hotel will chase after her?

177
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:51,464
Is there a secret about the
hotel I still don't know about?

178
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:53,334
If Ms. Jang didn't tell you,

179
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:55,204
- you don't...
- I don't have to know?

180
00:16:57,273 --> 00:17:00,743
I'm not here to stay just
temporarily anymore.

181
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,743
If all the hotel staff knows what it is,

182
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:05,484
I must know too.

183
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:12,024
You said that it was a punishment
that she must stay in this hotel.

184
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:15,053
Does her punishment follow after
her when she runs away from it?

185
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:16,424
That's right.

186
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:21,523
Ms. Jang can never stay out of this hotel.

187
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,484
She can't go to the afterlife.

188
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:51,124
And she can't live in this world either.

189
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:55,533
At first, it looked like she
tried several times to run away.

190
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,063
But it never worked.

191
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:05,904
Ms. Jang is the Moon Tree.

192
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:09,414
The energy of the Moon Tree
is creating this space.

193
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:16,013
Wherever she goes, the Moon
Tree will put down roots there.

194
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:19,624
And there stands Guest House of the Moon.

195
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:40,204
When she stays away from the
hotel for more than a day,

196
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:43,743
the Moon Tree follows her to where she is.

197
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:46,144
That's why she must return.

198
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:49,384
It's impossible for her to escape from it.

199
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:53,984
That means...

200
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:56,793
she's been locked up in this hotel.

201
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:03,793
Why was she tied down
here, so she can't leave?

202
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:07,534
I heard that she almost
became an evil spirit,

203
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:10,304
but Ma Go brought her here and
tied her down to this place.

204
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:13,243
You've seen what happened...

205
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:16,243
to the vengeful spirit who
harmed humans in this life.

206
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:28,593
To Ms. Jang, this may be her
prison, but it's also a fence.

207
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:32,164
It's safe for her to stay here.

208
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:46,444
Here.

209
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:48,173
Thank you.

210
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:50,074
You got lucky. No one took your bag.

211
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:51,543
Thank you.

212
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,823
How did this end up on the bus?

213
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:02,694
Wait.

214
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:06,924
My photo is missing.

215
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:12,864
Amusement park.

216
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,734
It looks like Lee Mi Ra was happy.

217
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:28,184
Chan Seong?

218
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:50,573
Mr. Ku told me to prepare this.

219
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:56,513
He was quite worried when
you didn't come back...

220
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:58,614
after you disappeared without a word.

221
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:03,313
I met someone,

222
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,124
so I needed some time to think.

223
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:07,624
As he was worried,

224
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:12,394
I told him why you had no choice
but to come back to the hotel.

225
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:17,934
You did?

226
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:20,704
Where's Chan Seong now?

227
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,984
Is she okay?

228
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:45,464
Your friend.

229
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:47,823
I made her fall into the water.

230
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,734
Did she drown?

231
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:52,503
She's fine.

232
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:54,033
Too bad.

233
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:06,343
Why aren't you asking me...

234
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:10,354
why I made her fall into the water...

235
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:12,353
and what I saw in her face?

236
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:14,783
You should ask me millions of
questions, scold me, and stop me.

237
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:18,424
If I try to stop you, will that work?

238
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:25,634
I really don't know.

239
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:29,103
You call yourself a bad person.

240
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:32,644
And seeing how you're stuck
here for over 1,000 years,

241
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:34,243
I guess it's not something
to take lightly of.

242
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:39,614
When I saw you in my dream,

243
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:42,184
you were just in love.

244
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:50,454
So what did you do earlier?

245
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:52,763
What?

246
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:56,434
Where did you go after ditching me?

247
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,234
There's nothing much for you to
do with a maxed-out credit card.

248
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:03,003
I don't need you or my credit card...

249
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,603
to have fun, you know.

250
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:06,743
I attended a dance party...

251
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,674
and ate nice food at a feast.

252
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:12,183
A dance party?

253
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:16,214
Yes, the dancers had such majestic lines.

254
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:20,583
And you went there alone?

255
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:23,353
You could've invited me. Unbelievable.

256
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:26,664
If you were there,

257
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:28,993
it would've been a sight.

258
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,364
Well, anything that's
entertaining, we'll do together.

259
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:38,904
It's always better to
share nice experiences.

260
00:23:42,074 --> 00:23:45,614
The view is much better
now that I have company.

261
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:13,144
Whatever it is you're going to do,

262
00:24:14,274 --> 00:24:15,573
just don't forget this.

263
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:20,743
I don't care if this place is
a prison or a fence to you.

264
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:23,583
I will...

265
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,724
be here with you.

266
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:14,062
Doctor.

267
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:23,763
Sir, it's raining.

268
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:30,602
I'm always happy whenever it rains...

269
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:32,602
because I'll be with you.

270
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:37,143
I'm not your doctor, miss.

271
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:40,913
Please stay with me until the song ends.

272
00:26:49,823 --> 00:26:53,352
At the shore of the blue sea

273
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:58,163
You took my shaking hand

274
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:01,862
With twinkling eyes

275
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:07,272
Please wait

276
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,372
Honey?

277
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:20,052
Honey. Honey?

278
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,183
Honey!

279
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,032
- Did you just get in?
- Yes.

280
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:45,072
What's that?

281
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:48,042
You're the one who said
she should stay with us.

282
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:50,882
Me? To whom?

283
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:52,243
Me.

284
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:57,122
What are you doing here?

285
00:27:57,782 --> 00:27:59,853
I was scared to be alone.

286
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:01,792
You have no idea what happened to me.

287
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:03,522
What happened?

288
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:06,963
I found the purse I had
lost on an express bus...

289
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:10,163
when I never got on one.

290
00:28:10,462 --> 00:28:14,532
Hold on. Does this mean that
it got on the bus itself?

291
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:16,203
My gosh!

292
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:18,302
Stop it, both of you.

293
00:28:18,472 --> 00:28:20,473
When I'm home, I'd like a
rest from the supernatural.

294
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,683
But this can't be explained scientifically.

295
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:26,382
Someone must've taken your
purse and left it on the bus.

296
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:30,022
Yes, that's more of a possibility.

297
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:33,522
Didn't you lose anything?
Money or credit cards?

298
00:28:33,623 --> 00:28:35,253
I never carried around any.

299
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:38,193
That being said, can I borrow some money?

300
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:42,362
Sanchez!

301
00:28:45,002 --> 00:28:46,802
I'll let her stay here
for now, just in case.

302
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:52,342
You're opening the hotel's
amusement park again?

303
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:54,472
Yes, someone seems to have
had some fond memories...

304
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:56,282
of an amusement park.

305
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,602
Whoever it is, he or she
will have fun here.

306
00:29:17,732 --> 00:29:19,102
So when will that guest arrive?

307
00:29:20,702 --> 00:29:21,872
I'll invite her soon.

308
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:25,003
Escort her with care.

309
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:26,243
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:29,743
So where did you send Mr. Kim and Ms. Choi?

311
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:31,983
To seek out some land.

312
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,823
It's eerie here and full
of negative energy.

313
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,123
There aren't any buildings
in the way either.

314
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:45,223
I like this place.

315
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:46,833
There aren't any shopping
malls or restaurants...

316
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,763
within a 15-minute drive.

317
00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:50,503
Ms. Jang won't like it.

318
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:51,833
Let's leave...

319
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,032
and head over to the sauna building next.

320
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:58,042
Why is she suddenly looking to buy land?

321
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:01,243
From what it seems, she can barely
pay off her credit card bills.

322
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:04,042
She'll have to sell the land she has.

323
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:08,853
No way. Ms. Jang loves that site.

324
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:10,083
A department store and
naengmyeon restaurant...

325
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,423
are in walking distance.

326
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:15,353
Maybe because Chan Seong is
being too tight with money,

327
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:17,893
and that might have sparked a sudden
interest in selling the place.

328
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:21,393
She chose that site after
much consideration.

329
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:23,632
There's no way she'd sell the place.
Let's go.

330
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:26,632
Eunseong Sauna.

331
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:27,903
(Eunseong Sauna)

332
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:34,313
You're very quick to master
new features on devices.

333
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:36,612
You get the hang of it after
clicking here and there.

334
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,553
It's difficult since I'm
from the Joseon Dynasty.

335
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:41,413
I am too.

336
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:43,383
You should correct how you speak first.

337
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,792
Until when will you use archaic phrases?

338
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:53,433
I'll try doing so.

339
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:55,532
Wait for me.

340
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:57,003
Hold up.

341
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:58,632
Thank you for the tour!

342
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:05,403
Thank you.

343
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,213
We'll contact you after
talking to our boss.

344
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,963
The hotel opened up an amusement park?

345
00:31:23,663 --> 00:31:25,463
Yes, you should check it out.

346
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:30,562
It'll be fun to go there with my boyfriend.

347
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:32,102
Did you get a boyfriend?

348
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:36,473
Rumors of me having one
is all over the school.

349
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:38,873
Is that so? Good for you.

350
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:41,073
You have friends now, so
keep up with your studies,

351
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:43,143
and show up to classes on time.

352
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:44,442
Whatever!

353
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:46,212
Did staying at school...

354
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:47,453
fail to prevent you from
becoming a total idiot?

355
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:50,582
What's wrong with telling you
to study hard at school?

356
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:52,253
It would be nice to study hard...

357
00:31:52,522 --> 00:31:55,862
and become a cool doctor just like Mr.
Ku's girlfriend.

358
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:58,863
Ms. Jang told me to keep an eye on her.

359
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:00,362
And also to find out what
people think of her.

360
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,092
Can I eat a lot of onion?

361
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:04,333
- Eat as much as you like.
- Let's have lots of onion together.

362
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,302
- Okay.
- Add a lot of onion please.

363
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,532
She likes onions.

364
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:18,413
Onion starts with an "o".

365
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:19,753
"Onion".

366
00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:25,022
Stop showing off, rich boy.

367
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:30,193
(Onion)

368
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:35,133
Ms. Jang is kinder than I thought.

369
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,763
She is taking care of humans around Mr.
Ku as well.

370
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:39,933
Do you really think she is being kind?

371
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:43,243
Can you be kind to my boyfriend?

372
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,372
Why? Is your boyfriend mean?

373
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:49,612
Right.

374
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:52,882
My boyfriend is so mean and a total idiot.

375
00:32:57,383 --> 00:32:59,052
Is Dr. Han all right?

376
00:32:59,252 --> 00:33:01,123
- He isn't.
- I see.

377
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:02,522
He scares me to death every night.

378
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:05,992
Yesterday, he sang in his study.

379
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:07,092
What?

380
00:33:14,802 --> 00:33:17,072
- You want to go in?
- Yes.

381
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:19,313
Then I will have something
to report to Ms. Jang.

382
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:20,512
Listen to this.

383
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:22,842
Shall I say, the cute next door neighbor...

384
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:24,513
has come to borrow a screwdriver?

385
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:27,382
No, don't you have other ideas?

386
00:33:29,152 --> 00:33:30,552
There's something strange in this house.

387
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:31,652
What is it?

388
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:36,293
That's not a human, right?

389
00:33:42,193 --> 00:33:45,432
I loaned the Qing Dynasty
ceramic in my house to Mi Ra.

390
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:47,572
Actually she asked me to lend it
to her after she already took it.

391
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:48,973
Anyway, I loaned it to her.

392
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:51,502
After she sells it and uses all
the money, you won't get it back.

393
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,012
I'll get it back for you.

394
00:33:53,012 --> 00:33:55,513
It's okay. If she doesn't pay
me back, I'll seize her salary.

395
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,243
You can't do it, but I can.

396
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:01,583
I should have seized her
salary or something...

397
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:03,822
for all the money she took from me.

398
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:08,822
You said you'd stay a short period
of time at your present hotel.

399
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:11,693
Veronica's father recently...

400
00:34:11,693 --> 00:34:13,793
took over a hotel in Sydney.

401
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:16,132
Two of my father's
restaurants will open there.

402
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:17,262
It's a five-star hotel.

403
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:18,902
Would you like to work there?

404
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:22,942
I don't have the intention
of moving from this hotel.

405
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:26,443
Is there a special reason...

406
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:28,273
why you have to stay at Man Weol's hotel?

407
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:32,583
You have a good career background,
and you enjoy showing off.

408
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,913
But it's a nameless hotel without
even a proper name card.

409
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:38,382
You are always working overtime there.

410
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:40,552
I think that's very strange.

411
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:45,563
Sanchez, do you think I'd
work at an average hotel?

412
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:50,703
My hotel has facilities
that are world-class.

413
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:53,032
The guests are so special.

414
00:34:53,032 --> 00:34:54,333
You can't even imagine
how special they are.

415
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,672
There is only one shortcoming.

416
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:58,842
And that is I can't boast about it.

417
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:03,083
I see.

418
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,413
I thought you were enduring
working in that crappy hotel...

419
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:06,853
because you have feelings for Man Weol.

420
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:08,013
What?

421
00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:11,422
I got you right on the spot.

422
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:19,123
You look like a pushover but you are cold.

423
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:21,732
- You seem slow but you are sharp.
- Yes.

424
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,802
Right. I look like a pizza place owner.

425
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:26,773
But I'm a millionaire, right?

426
00:35:27,032 --> 00:35:29,643
Veronica is now fully in love
with that side of myself.

427
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:32,543
- I'll get you more soda.
- Okay.

428
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,683
(Lee Mi Ra)

429
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:45,182
Did you sell Sanchez's ceramic?

430
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:46,293
Chan Seong.

431
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:49,692
Is there an available room
in your hotel right now?

432
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:01,833
I can't take a photo of
a ghost with my phone.

433
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,482
I can't take a picture of you either.

434
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:14,652
You can, if I let myself be
seen like I did at your school.

435
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:17,223
- Although I can't do it for long.
- Do it now.

436
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:20,422
Come on, let yourself be seen.

437
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:24,692
There you are.

438
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:26,192
I'm taking the picture now.

439
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:29,462
What are you guys doing here?

440
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:32,502
Mr. Ku?

441
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:33,732
What are you doing here?

442
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:37,672
We followed your doctor girlfriend.

443
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:38,842
Mi Ra?

444
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:40,013
Why?

445
00:36:40,472 --> 00:36:41,773
I told them to.

446
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:52,583
Do you want to attach a ghost
to Mi Ra to torment her?

447
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,052
I thought you didn't care.

448
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:55,993
But it seems you're worried I
might do something to her.

449
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:58,023
Are you here to stand guard
over your girlfriend's house?

450
00:36:58,623 --> 00:37:01,263
This is not her house.
It's her friend's house.

451
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:04,703
Mi Ra is staying with me.

452
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:07,802
At Sanchez's?

453
00:37:10,873 --> 00:37:12,273
So you're living together.

454
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:14,572
Are you going to keep following her?

455
00:37:14,643 --> 00:37:16,342
Do I have to keep guard?

456
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:19,282
I just wanted to know
what a good life she has.

457
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:22,652
Where are you going?

458
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:24,253
You have to take the ghost.

459
00:37:24,253 --> 00:37:26,123
I didn't put it there.

460
00:37:26,253 --> 00:37:28,793
I didn't even know you
were living with her.

461
00:37:28,992 --> 00:37:31,523
If I had known, I would've
released 108 ghosts.

462
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:32,893
No matter.

463
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:34,632
It means there is a ghost in this house.

464
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:36,632
Let's take her to the hotel.

465
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:39,632
Ms. Jang.

466
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:42,472
Ms. Jang.

467
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:45,502
You only call me that when
you want something from me.

468
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:51,782
I heard from Mi Ra.

469
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,382
That you keep hearing strange noises...

470
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:56,682
and see strange things.

471
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,353
You want to stay at a
hotel for a while, right?

472
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:01,192
My parents gave me this house
which they had lived in.

473
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:04,192
This house is old so that could
be the problem for the noises.

474
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:06,692
I told him everything.

475
00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:08,763
You told me you can't even
sleep after you moved in.

476
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,933
We could have just gone to your hotel.
You didn't have to come.

477
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,032
I came to see how the guests were doing.

478
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:19,302
We don't accept average guests.

479
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:22,672
Is that why your boss is with you?

480
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:24,643
Yes.

481
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:27,752
You can only come to our hotel when
you have Ms. Jang's invitation.

482
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:29,853
You have many doctors in your family.

483
00:38:30,782 --> 00:38:33,393
Your hotel must run on
some sort of membership.

484
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,692
We just need an ordinary hotel.

485
00:38:37,893 --> 00:38:39,163
Then you do that.

486
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,263
Excuse me.

487
00:38:42,293 --> 00:38:44,532
Ms. Jang.

488
00:38:44,862 --> 00:38:46,273
We have to take the guest to the hotel.

489
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:47,473
Forget.

490
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:49,773
Do I have to take care of
the ghost in this house?

491
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:51,643
It's the house of my friend's friend.

492
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:55,313
I don't like your friend, I don't
like you who is her friend.

493
00:39:03,483 --> 00:39:05,922
- Is this the sound?
- Do you hear it too?

494
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:08,652
We are not crazy, right?

495
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:12,063
We have a special service in our hotel.

496
00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:14,192
You should get the service.

497
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:29,313
Her name is Gyeong Ah and she
is dressed in retro style.

498
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:30,882
She is waiting for a doctor.

499
00:39:31,512 --> 00:39:34,953
Could she be looking for the
dead father of this house?

500
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:36,583
Maybe.

501
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,623
If she sees you, she can run away.

502
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:40,293
I will go in first.

503
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:43,393
Aren't you scared?

504
00:39:44,893 --> 00:39:46,123
I have you.

505
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,982
Gyeong Ah?

506
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:13,993
Min?

507
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:20,393
Min.

508
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:25,902
I'm all right.

509
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:29,632
Min, you came back.

510
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,942
Min.

511
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:33,873
Who is Min?

512
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,362
I'm sorry for hurting you.

513
00:40:53,463 --> 00:40:55,192
But my heart...

514
00:40:55,762 --> 00:40:57,632
already belongs to you.

515
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:02,032
So, Min and the doctor
are different people.

516
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:05,973
Are you sick?

517
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:10,583
Min, I don't have a lot of time.

518
00:41:10,983 --> 00:41:12,882
I can't share that time with you.

519
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:16,052
But I'll allow you to bid farewell to me.

520
00:41:22,753 --> 00:41:25,422
Gyeong Ah, is this your diary?

521
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:29,063
Sook Hui, stop it.

522
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:31,833
Don't touch my things.

523
00:41:32,603 --> 00:41:34,132
I must be Sook Hui.

524
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:38,172
It's not my fault you
couldn't win Min's heart.

525
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:40,543
Stop your mean jealousy.

526
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:44,942
What are all these postcards and letters?

527
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:52,752
Min, you ask her.

528
00:41:56,592 --> 00:41:59,322
Gyeong Ah, what are all these postcards?

529
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:05,733
I'm very weak, so I can't go outside.

530
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:06,932
And I don't have any friends.

531
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:08,972
So I sent my story to a radio station,

532
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:11,302
and all these people sent me
postcards wishing me well.

533
00:42:16,443 --> 00:42:18,083
"I hope you recover soon."

534
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,982
"I also wish you good
luck with your romance."

535
00:42:20,182 --> 00:42:21,882
"From Hui, an avid listener
in Ssangmun-dong..."

536
00:42:21,882 --> 00:42:24,953
"who's also lovestruck just like you."

537
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:27,252
This is actually real.

538
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:31,422
Hyuk must be here.

539
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,203
There must be someone named Hyuk.

540
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:43,873
Judging from the look on her face,
Hyuk must like her as well.

541
00:42:45,603 --> 00:42:50,543
So that means Hyuk, Min, and the
doctor all like Gyeong Ah...

542
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:51,983
except for Sook Hui.

543
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:54,453
I guess Sook Hui is the only villain here.

544
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:56,423
I'll continue to pretend like I'm Min.

545
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:58,282
And we should take her to the hotel.

546
00:42:59,353 --> 00:43:02,052
Gyeong Ah can't be a guest at our hotel...

547
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:07,092
because she isn't the
spirit of a human being.

548
00:43:22,512 --> 00:43:24,112
Does that mean she's not a ghost?

549
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:28,183
Didn't you feel something weird
when she hugged you earlier?

550
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,322
Come to think of it, I
didn't feel cold at all.

551
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:34,453
I always felt a chill every time
I touched a ghost at our hotel.

552
00:43:34,722 --> 00:43:36,192
But that wasn't the case with Gyeong Ah.

553
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:39,023
That's an imaginary sprit
that was created by someone.

554
00:43:39,963 --> 00:43:41,263
"An imaginary spirit"?

555
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:42,893
It's imaginary.

556
00:43:44,362 --> 00:43:48,232
Gyeong Ah was created in
someone's imagination.

557
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,672
Someone created her?

558
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,373
She had an incurable illness,

559
00:43:54,373 --> 00:43:56,983
was loved by Hyuk and Min,

560
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:59,413
and she even had a love
affair with a doctor.

561
00:43:59,782 --> 00:44:02,913
The diary is real, and someone did
send a story to the radio station.

562
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:05,282
But the problem is that
it wasn't Gyeong Ah.

563
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:07,993
It was done by the person who created her.

564
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:11,592
Who could that be?

565
00:44:11,592 --> 00:44:14,532
If we find that person, we
can get rid of Gyeong Ah.

566
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:17,432
Who is this delusional person...

567
00:44:17,432 --> 00:44:19,333
that's so immersed in this sad love story?

568
00:44:20,003 --> 00:44:21,333
What's wrong with you guys?

569
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,603
- Mother, they're here to help us.
- Please leave.

570
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:26,103
- What's going on?
- Mother, wait.

571
00:44:29,882 --> 00:44:32,382
What are you doing in my study?

572
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,752
Everything here belongs to me.

573
00:44:38,222 --> 00:44:39,382
I see.

574
00:44:45,322 --> 00:44:47,462
May I ask your name, ma'am?

575
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:49,763
Lee Bok Hui.

576
00:44:52,362 --> 00:44:53,973
You should wait downstairs.

577
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:04,882
Do you know a lady named Gyeong Ah?

578
00:45:13,722 --> 00:45:16,453
I'm Gyeong Ah.

579
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:30,973
I married my husband...

580
00:45:31,873 --> 00:45:34,543
when I was 22 through an arranged marriage.

581
00:45:36,242 --> 00:45:38,243
I never got to date anyone.

582
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:40,953
And that's when...

583
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:45,723
I created Gyeong Ah.

584
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:49,923
I was so happy to be able to experience...

585
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:53,263
a pure, affectionate, and
passionate love as Gyeong Ah,

586
00:45:54,032 --> 00:45:57,962
just like my favorite movie character.

587
00:45:58,003 --> 00:46:02,232
Your strong imaginary spirit still exists.

588
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:05,103
It's like an old movie.

589
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:07,942
I see.

590
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:10,982
You don't seem startled.

591
00:46:11,043 --> 00:46:14,282
If you live for this long, you
don't get startled that easily.

592
00:46:14,282 --> 00:46:15,282
On top of that,

593
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:18,052
I was once a delusional patient
who created Gyeong Ah.

594
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:22,552
Gyeong Ah called me Min.

595
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:24,163
You look just like him.

596
00:46:24,693 --> 00:46:27,592
She actually liked Min the most.

597
00:46:29,793 --> 00:46:31,563
What about the doctor?

598
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:34,373
She must've been a huge flirt.

599
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:39,072
Do I need to get rid of Gyeong Ah?

600
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:42,143
Your son and wife are having
a hard time because of her.

601
00:46:45,043 --> 00:46:46,282
I see.

602
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:51,422
I was able to forget about
Gyeong Ah thanks to my son.

603
00:47:13,512 --> 00:47:16,943
She got married to a stranger
whom she didn't love.

604
00:47:16,943 --> 00:47:18,183
It must've been hard for her.

605
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:21,052
Whether it was imaginary or delusional,

606
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,723
I'm sure it still helped her
cope with her situation.

607
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,692
She changed her reality by
creating an imaginary spirit?

608
00:47:32,123 --> 00:47:33,462
That's a good idea.

609
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:38,963
She asked us to join her for dinner.
What should we do?

610
00:47:38,963 --> 00:47:41,273
She said goodbye to Gyeong
Ah, so she must feel lonely.

611
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:43,543
So you should stay and
console her over dinner.

612
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:45,502
Sook Hui is a villain,
so she's going to leave.

613
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,172
Okay, then.

614
00:47:53,112 --> 00:47:54,453
It's burning beautifully.

615
00:47:56,853 --> 00:47:57,982
You're right.

616
00:48:01,123 --> 00:48:02,322
It's beautiful.

617
00:48:09,163 --> 00:48:12,632
Ma'am, you don't need to
prepare too many dishes.

618
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:16,842
Min, just wait here quietly.

619
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:22,072
Excuse me.

620
00:48:22,673 --> 00:48:24,342
Did Mi Ra leave?

621
00:48:24,342 --> 00:48:26,313
Yes, she probably went
back to the hospital.

622
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:30,853
By the way, thank you for
inviting us to the hotel.

623
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:32,282
What?

624
00:48:32,282 --> 00:48:35,853
Your boss gave us invitations to the hotel.

625
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:37,663
Invitations?

626
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:39,962
We'll make sure we visit. I can't wait.

627
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:45,103
By any chance, did she give an
invitation to Mi Ra as well?

628
00:48:54,173 --> 00:48:56,342
I didn't know there was a hotel here.

629
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,112
Chan Seong is working
at an incredible hotel.

630
00:49:12,646 --> 00:49:14,056
Welcome.

631
00:49:14,056 --> 00:49:15,716
Ms. Jang is waiting for you.

632
00:49:15,857 --> 00:49:17,226
Oh, thank you.

633
00:49:17,226 --> 00:49:18,386
This way.

634
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,263
Please follow me.

635
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:37,064
Ms. Jang prepared something
very special for you.

636
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:38,164
Let me take you there.

637
00:49:38,263 --> 00:49:40,064
The hotel is amazing.

638
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,093
Welcome.

639
00:50:07,864 --> 00:50:11,033
Welcome to Hotel Del Luna.

640
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:13,464
Thank you for inviting me.

641
00:50:14,603 --> 00:50:15,834
The pleasure's mine.

642
00:50:16,103 --> 00:50:17,303
I just couldn't...

643
00:50:18,603 --> 00:50:22,174
let you pass by.

644
00:50:26,614 --> 00:50:28,143
This place is really nice.

645
00:50:32,054 --> 00:50:34,324
But why is this place empty?

646
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:36,853
It's not empty.

647
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:39,353
You just can't see anything...

648
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:42,163
because of that.

649
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:50,433
This?

650
00:50:50,574 --> 00:50:52,533
You can't see them because of that.

651
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:56,274
Earlier, you couldn't hear anything either.

652
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,614
- Is this the sound?
- We're not crazy, right?

653
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:17,194
If I take this off, will I
be able to see other things?

654
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:28,973
Why don't you let me hold onto it?

655
00:53:08,574 --> 00:53:09,774
Do you like it?

656
00:53:10,944 --> 00:53:14,314
Yes, I love amusement parks.

657
00:53:14,683 --> 00:53:16,683
Is that so? I thought so too.

658
00:53:19,554 --> 00:53:20,984
You seemed happy in the photo.

659
00:53:27,123 --> 00:53:28,493
You found this.

660
00:53:29,264 --> 00:53:30,424
Thank you.

661
00:53:31,494 --> 00:53:33,094
When I was young,

662
00:53:34,063 --> 00:53:36,904
I went to the amusement park with
my family and took this photo.

663
00:53:37,574 --> 00:53:38,674
That's right.

664
00:53:44,614 --> 00:53:48,384
You from that day are standing over there.

665
00:53:53,453 --> 00:53:55,524
That's my parents and my sister.

666
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:58,493
I'm happy.

667
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:00,254
I hate...

668
00:54:01,023 --> 00:54:03,064
that you are...

669
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:05,464
happy.

670
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,333
That's why...

671
00:54:10,904 --> 00:54:13,634
I'm going to breathe sadness into you.

672
00:54:16,273 --> 00:54:18,473
And that will be your present.

673
00:54:56,614 --> 00:54:57,714
Hello.

674
00:55:02,224 --> 00:55:04,794
You don't have a happy family.

675
00:55:05,494 --> 00:55:08,223
Your mother made you stand up and
said this to you all the time.

676
00:55:10,964 --> 00:55:14,333
"You should have never been born.
I regret giving birth to you."

677
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:16,763
Your dad got angry whenever he saw you.

678
00:55:16,933 --> 00:55:19,803
"Nothing is working out all
because of you, you witch."

679
00:55:21,244 --> 00:55:23,444
After your annoying sister had been born,

680
00:55:23,643 --> 00:55:25,743
your parents loved only her.

681
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:30,384
Look at this. On the day when
you came to the amusement park,

682
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:33,953
your family left you here and went home.

683
00:55:38,494 --> 00:55:41,393
It was the saddest day of your life.

684
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:53,333
Mom. Dad. Don't abandon me.

685
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:12,694
All right. Go.

686
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:17,433
Go to her and fill every day of her life...

687
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:21,634
with sad memories of a girl who
should've never been born.

688
00:57:43,944 --> 00:57:45,384
Thank you, Chan Seong.

689
00:57:46,784 --> 00:57:48,283
Thanks to you, I got to meet her.

690
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:51,654
And thanks to you, I've found a great way.

691
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:54,223
And...

692
00:57:56,094 --> 00:57:57,694
I was able to soften my grudge a bit.

693
00:57:58,393 --> 00:57:59,564
Don't do it.

694
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,433
I already did.

695
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:05,074
This...

696
00:58:05,974 --> 00:58:07,503
is way stronger than...

697
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:10,044
the imaginary spirit Bok Hui created.

698
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:13,274
That's because I created this.

699
00:58:18,313 --> 00:58:19,853
That's a curse.

700
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:47,044
- Stop it.
- You can't stand it?

701
00:58:48,714 --> 00:58:50,743
Run away from me, Chan Seong.

702
00:58:51,284 --> 00:58:52,413
I'll let you go.

703
00:58:57,453 --> 00:58:58,594
I won't.

704
00:59:00,253 --> 00:59:01,424
Protect me.

705
00:59:31,893 --> 00:59:34,094
Chan Seong, let her go.

706
00:59:56,983 --> 00:59:58,614
Whatever it is you're going to do,

707
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:00,714
just don't forget this.

708
01:00:02,353 --> 01:00:05,493
I don't care if this place is
a prison or a fence to you.

709
01:00:07,623 --> 01:00:08,794
I will...

710
01:00:09,793 --> 01:00:11,033
be here with you.

711
01:00:26,413 --> 01:00:27,614
Aren't you scared?

712
01:00:30,014 --> 01:00:31,254
I have you.

713
01:01:03,844 --> 01:01:05,114
You woke up.

714
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:07,853
Who are you?

715
01:01:07,853 --> 01:01:10,023
Ms. Jang asked me to take you home...

716
01:01:10,023 --> 01:01:11,524
because you're too drunk.

717
01:01:11,594 --> 01:01:13,123
I'm drunk?

718
01:01:13,123 --> 01:01:15,524
Yes. The hospital is in
Myeongnyun-dong, right?

719
01:01:15,793 --> 01:01:17,833
- Sir, let's get going.
- Sure.

720
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:17,993
Everything will be okay now.

721
01:02:21,393 --> 01:02:23,123
You ruined everything.

722
01:02:38,174 --> 01:02:39,643
I'm not sure.

723
01:02:40,614 --> 01:02:42,344
When I saw you in my dream,

724
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:45,484
you were just in love.

725
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:54,794
This is the last time we can
admire scenery like this together.

726
01:02:55,324 --> 01:02:56,493
We're leaving.

727
01:02:57,893 --> 01:03:00,033
Are you planning to join the rebellion?

728
01:03:02,233 --> 01:03:04,163
They wish to re-found this
country facing demise.

729
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:07,033
It's much better than
living as a thief here...

730
01:03:08,273 --> 01:03:09,444
and getting caught and killed eventually.

731
01:03:10,304 --> 01:03:11,473
Come to the palace.

732
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,344
I can keep you safe.

733
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:29,864
Are you telling me to desert
my people and go to you?

734
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:36,634
I cannot.

735
01:03:38,674 --> 01:03:40,373
Then shall I go to you?

736
01:03:51,483 --> 01:03:54,984
If you beg me to come with you,
I will risk my life and do so.

737
01:03:58,694 --> 01:03:59,853
Don't.

738
01:04:01,893 --> 01:04:03,623
There is no way...

739
01:04:05,364 --> 01:04:06,493
we can be together.

740
01:04:15,304 --> 01:04:16,444
Right.

741
01:04:20,574 --> 01:04:22,583
I suppose I won't need
to come here ever again.

742
01:04:28,023 --> 01:04:29,754
You were a great drinking buddy,

743
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:33,024
so I will miss you.

744
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:05,614
Everyone's ready. When should we leave?

745
01:06:06,214 --> 01:06:07,614
He was here.

746
01:06:08,554 --> 01:06:09,884
He's probably there now.

747
01:06:11,324 --> 01:06:13,223
Let me go see him for one last time.

748
01:06:14,324 --> 01:06:15,424
Man Weol.

749
01:06:16,924 --> 01:06:18,093
Will you come back?

750
01:06:18,363 --> 01:06:21,293
Yes. Of course I'll be back.

751
01:06:32,514 --> 01:06:33,973
You don't need to come back.

752
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:36,543
I'll be fine either way,

753
01:06:37,113 --> 01:06:38,553
so do as you wish.

754
01:06:39,153 --> 01:06:40,284
No, I will come back.

755
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:43,084
Let me see him just once more.

756
01:06:44,993 --> 01:06:46,253
Wait for me.

757
01:07:53,993 --> 01:07:57,064
All of your people will die because of you.

758
01:09:15,274 --> 01:09:17,074
Thanks to you, I made a great contribution.

759
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:32,723
You were the one who took me there,

760
01:09:34,623 --> 01:09:37,164
and you also helped me buy some time.

761
01:09:38,793 --> 01:09:40,164
Hence, I will spare your life.

762
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:42,834
I will kill you.

763
01:09:44,003 --> 01:09:45,803
I will kill you...

764
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,673
at all costs.

765
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:52,173
If you wish to kill me,

766
01:09:54,413 --> 01:09:56,183
you will have to stay alive.

767
01:11:24,764 --> 01:11:25,933
Yeon Woo.

768
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:27,374
Yeon Woo.

769
01:11:28,203 --> 01:11:30,303
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo!

770
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:33,914
No, Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo.

771
01:11:34,984 --> 01:11:36,143
Let go of me!

772
01:11:37,714 --> 01:11:41,213
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo.

773
01:11:41,283 --> 01:11:43,883
Yeon Woo. Yeon Woo.

774
01:11:44,924 --> 01:11:46,154
Yeon Woo!

775
01:11:47,894 --> 01:11:49,324
Yeon Woo.

776
01:11:52,193 --> 01:11:53,364
Yeon Woo.

777
01:12:38,344 --> 01:12:41,174
Since you helped the general
make a great contribution,

778
01:12:41,174 --> 01:12:43,183
I will show mercy on you.

779
01:13:49,644 --> 01:13:51,314
I will kill you...

780
01:13:52,184 --> 01:13:53,654
at all costs.

781
01:15:10,394 --> 01:15:11,494
Chan Seong.

782
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,374
Are you all right?

783
01:15:21,503 --> 01:15:22,644
What happened?

784
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:24,603
Man Weol brought you home.

785
01:15:25,243 --> 01:15:27,113
And you've been sleeping for several days.

786
01:15:27,113 --> 01:15:29,443
"Several days"? What do you mean?

787
01:15:29,443 --> 01:15:31,343
You've been sleeping for
three days straight.

788
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:41,093
Why is that painting here?

789
01:15:41,693 --> 01:15:43,194
Man Weol left it here.

790
01:15:44,493 --> 01:15:45,533
That...

791
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:47,664
She said it was taking up
space, so she left it here.

792
01:15:48,604 --> 01:15:50,303
By the way, is she going somewhere?

793
01:16:40,884 --> 01:16:44,553
Wherever she goes, the Moon
Tree will put down roots there.

794
01:16:44,984 --> 01:16:47,853
And there stands Guest House of the Moon.

795
01:16:51,094 --> 01:16:52,334
She's gone.

796
01:17:31,663 --> 01:17:35,944
When you see me off, don't feel lonely.

797
01:17:53,493 --> 01:17:54,723
Whether...

798
01:17:57,524 --> 01:17:59,293
this place is a fence...

799
01:18:00,293 --> 01:18:01,664
or prison for me,

800
01:18:05,774 --> 01:18:07,704
what I have is torture.

801
01:18:12,543 --> 01:18:14,513
It's not that wonderful...

802
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:20,183
to be tortured together.

803
01:18:32,094 --> 01:18:33,334
Goodbye.

804
01:18:36,304 --> 01:18:37,603
Chan Seong.
