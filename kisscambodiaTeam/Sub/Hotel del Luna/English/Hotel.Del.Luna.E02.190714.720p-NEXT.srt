1
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:50,090
I gave you the chance to run away,
but you gave that up.

2
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:53,895
If you run away now,

3
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,427
I'll kill you.

4
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:03,274
(Episode 2)

5
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,405
Did you kill the old man
that attacked you earlier?

6
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:39,925
What is this?

7
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:48,407
What was that?

8
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,328
The leftover ashes of the
dead soul that just burned.

9
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:53,086
Was he a ghost?

10
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,976
I told you that a few of them
tend to look like humans.

11
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,336
But you told me that they're not dangerous.

12
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,364
If you get attacked by those
who hold deep grudges,

13
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:03,660
you could end up getting killed.

14
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:06,065
You should learn to differentiate them.

15
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:08,673
But you told me that it's
hard to tell them apart.

16
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,974
That's why you need to look closely.

17
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,434
I get scared...

18
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:14,397
if I look too closely.

19
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:17,748
What are you scared of?
I'm right by your side.

20
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:21,206
Hey.

21
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,176
Can you...

22
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:28,415
Can you get that for me?

23
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,333
It'll be dangerous for me to get too close.

24
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,055
Hurry.

25
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:43,627
Then why don't you start
referring to me as your boss?

26
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:45,980
You're not my boss.

27
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:48,155
I told you that I don't
want to work at your hotel.

28
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,310
I guess you're not that scared yet.

29
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:02,278
Hey, if we just leave that there,

30
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:04,329
wouldn't it be dangerous
to the people passing by?

31
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:07,138
That piece of trash will
soon get collected.

32
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,705
- By whom?
- The Grim Reaper.

33
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:14,399
You're going to wear that again?

34
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:17,254
Why?

35
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,196
Is it dangerous?

36
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,141
I only recently bought it.

37
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:23,246
Can't I just wipe it and wear it again?

38
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,189
Throw it away. Let's go get
you a new pair of shoes.

39
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,248
What about my luggage bag?

40
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:00,999
Let's see.

41
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,662
They look nice. Wear these.

42
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,947
No, they're not my type.

43
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:11,224
They're way better than
the tacky brown shoes...

44
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:12,550
you were wearing earlier.

45
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:16,423
Don't ever wear stuff like that.
I hate the color brown.

46
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,933
Then did you tell me to throw
that shoe away because...

47
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,403
Because they were tacky and brown.

48
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:23,957
Not because it was dangerous?

49
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,840
I never told you that it was dangerous.

50
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:31,283
If you don't like them, wear these.

51
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:34,775
No.

52
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:38,651
I'm going to choose exactly
the same one as earlier.

53
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,946
Just wear them. The store's
going to close soon.

54
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,275
Forget it.

55
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:48,133
- Thank you for coming to our store.
- My gosh.

56
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,359
My goodness.

57
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:52,664
I didn't even get to buy my shoes...

58
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,704
because you were being so fussy.

59
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:56,074
If we had more time,

60
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:58,420
I would never have bought a
pair of shoes like these.

61
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:00,476
Well, that's too bad.

62
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,752
Every place has a closing time.

63
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:06,873
I bought you new shoes, so
start working from tomorrow.

64
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:08,253
Let's get the facts straight.

65
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:09,954
You picked whatever you wanted,

66
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:11,179
and I'm the one who bought them.

67
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:13,221
And I'm not going to work at your hotel.

68
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:15,900
What are you going to
make me do there anyway?

69
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,574
You'll be consoling the ones...

70
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:31,787
who closed the doors with frustration.

71
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:33,974
Closed what doors?

72
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:36,932
Closed the doors to their lives.

73
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:51,014
Death.

74
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,565
Mr. Kim Byung Kyu.

75
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,507
I've come to escort you.

76
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:44,659
You've departed on a long journey.

77
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:51,831
I hope you safely cross the Sanzu River.

78
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:01,190
When people end their lives,
most of them cross the bridge...

79
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,737
that's on top of the Sanzu River...

80
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,319
and go to another world.

81
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:11,004
But some souls fail to
find their way there.

82
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:13,357
You also saw them.

83
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,718
Those who foolishly stay in this world...

84
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:22,038
even when their lives here have ended.

85
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,619
Just like how you're standing here...

86
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:33,025
even when the department
store has already closed?

87
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:35,677
Good metaphor.

88
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:37,775
You understood it very well.

89
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:39,890
Those who come to my hotel...

90
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:43,429
are souls who got lost on
their way to the afterlife.

91
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:50,851
So you're saying your hotel
guests are all ghosts.

92
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,047
And that's why you made me see them.

93
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:56,767
Come to Hotel Del Luna.

94
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:59,377
You'll be safe if you stay by my side.

95
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,564
The most dangerous thing you can do...

96
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:13,258
is to try and run away
without my permission.

97
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,015
Don't do it.

98
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:25,624
Chan Seong, wear your new shoes tomorrow...

99
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:29,032
and get on subway line four.

100
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:33,966
Man Weol.

101
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:39,246
I told you to refer to me as your boss.
Call me "Ms. Jang".

102
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:40,544
What about you?

103
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:42,751
Where do you stand?

104
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:46,049
Is your door not shut yet?

105
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,847
Or are you one of the ones hanging
around after the door is shut?

106
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:02,217
You're not a normal human being like me.

107
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:04,311
I can tell that much from
what I experienced today.

108
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:08,148
You said ones with a strong vengeful
determination can kill people.

109
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:11,253
You said you will kill me.

110
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,488
Does that make you a vengeful ghost too?

111
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,319
The one...

112
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:21,404
standing right beside you now
is probably a vengeful ghost.

113
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,237
You shut your mouth right away.

114
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:32,150
I knew it. You're totally my cup of tea.

115
00:10:35,144 --> 00:10:36,196
Gosh, I'm...

116
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,321
A vengeful ghost?

117
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:15,054
- Here's your food.
- Here you go. I'll give you more.

118
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,441
Let's eat. Come here.

119
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:18,804
Come on.

120
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:38,208
Kitties, eat more.

121
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:41,766
Yun Seo.

122
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:43,897
Yun Seo.

123
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,342
Meow.

124
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:20,558
A big cat. You're a giant cat.

125
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:29,446
Yun Seo.

126
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:32,324
What were you staring at?

127
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,568
Meow. I saw a giant cat.

128
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:38,569
I was so worried about you.

129
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:50,925
Is this alive or dead?

130
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:55,964
It hasn't grown a single leaf or
flower for over a millennium.

131
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:57,913
Does it mean it's dead?

132
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,098
Where do you stand?

133
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,222
Is your door not shut yet?

134
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:06,946
Or are you one of the ones hanging
around after the door is shut?

135
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:10,226
It is still alive.

136
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:12,657
You said...

137
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,752
that this tree is like your second self.

138
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:22,138
Right, so can we say that I am alive?

139
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:28,150
I prepared a great bottle
of champagne for you.

140
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:29,582
Would you like some now?

141
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:34,047
Sure, not just a bottle though.
I want a whole crate.

142
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:40,988
Someone's here.

143
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:46,683
A very special guest is here.

144
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,199
I should go welcome the guest.

145
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,714
Ma'am, wasn't that a tiger?

146
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:23,099
It's dangerous...

147
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:26,797
for a soul of a sacred creature
to be wandering like that.

148
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:29,006
Did you kick out the tiger?

149
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,856
Can't you do your job better?

150
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:36,013
You should've sensed it
and welcomed the guest.

151
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:38,113
I've been working here for almost 60 years,

152
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:39,824
but I've never seen a
tiger coming as a guest.

153
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:40,978
Do your job properly.

154
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:45,095
A ton of ghosts want to work here
to stay in the living realm.

155
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:48,023
If you have complaints, just get
on the bus to the afterlife.

156
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:49,064
I won't stop you.

157
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:52,297
I got Ku Chan Seong involved because
I'm bad at my job, you know.

158
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:55,228
I'm not that competent,
but I'm quite lucky.

159
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:57,212
Did you die young because you're so lucky?

160
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:01,114
Gosh, she's so mean.

161
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:04,471
Ma'am, I'll work harder! Please?

162
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:07,049
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

163
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:11,752
Hey, when did you get here?

164
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:14,214
Didn't you say you were going somewhere?

165
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:17,493
I was so stoked when you told
me you'd stay at my place,

166
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:19,362
so I was disappointed thinking
you were leaving again.

167
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:20,964
Hey, let's have a party to celebrate.

168
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:24,095
What do you want to drink? Beer,
hard liquor, or soju. Pick one.

169
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:27,958
Why are you all quiet?

170
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:30,995
Chan Seong.

171
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,737
Hey, Chan Seong.

172
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:38,150
You're not even answering me.
Let's have beer, then.

173
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:45,413
Does that make you a vengeful ghost too?

174
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:51,800
Was that too mean?

175
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,609
I saw a glamorous sign flashing,

176
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:34,179
and it was covered in ivy on the outside.

177
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:36,267
It was a fabulous-looking hotel.

178
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,904
"Hotel Del Luna".

179
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:43,776
It looks more average than I expected.

180
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:02,792
Is it closed during the day?

181
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:04,488
- Welcome.
- Gosh!

182
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:07,687
I scared you, didn't I?

183
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,537
You're not dead.

184
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:16,039
- Right.
- Look at our rates and decide.

185
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:21,939
(Room Rates)

186
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:25,623
Your rooms are ridiculously expensive.

187
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:27,288
Yes. They're very expensive, aren't they?

188
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:29,841
But we must abide by our rules,
so no discount is allowed.

189
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,354
Are you saying you don't
want me as a guest?

190
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:35,563
For that amount of money, you can
stay at the five-star hotel nearby.

191
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,514
I would've done that if I
had come here as a guest,

192
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:40,631
but I'm not here as a guest.

193
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:46,729
"Dear Ku..."

194
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,113
You're the new manager, Mr. Ku Chan Seong.

195
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:53,643
I haven't accepted the position.
I'm just visiting.

196
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,153
Ms. Jang is waiting for you.

197
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:57,124
You can go up this way, Mr. Manager.

198
00:17:58,315 --> 00:17:59,683
I'm not a manager.

199
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,592
Okay, sure. This way, please.

200
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:38,595
Are there no guests at the moment?

201
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:40,494
All the rooms are occupied.

202
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,677
It's quiet because most of them are asleep.

203
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,804
Unlike what I heard, it's
actually pretty average.

204
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,034
I heard there's a fancy outdoor pool...

205
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:48,604
as well as a sky lounge on a high floor.

206
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,104
We take pride in those two facilities.

207
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:53,751
- So you actually have them?
- Would you like to take a look,

208
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:55,113
Mr. Manager?

209
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:56,778
No, thanks. I don't need to see them.

210
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:00,081
And I told you I'm not the
manager of this hotel.

211
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:01,920
Then shall I call you Chan Seong?

212
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,013
Mr. Ku.

213
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:09,966
Ms. Jang is waiting for you.

214
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:22,403
You can think that it's
around 3am here now...

215
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:24,475
for a regular hotel.

216
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:26,402
He said all the rooms are occupied.

217
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:28,873
Does that mean they're
all occupied by ghosts?

218
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,689
I'm human...

219
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,767
just like you.

220
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:12,780
She's been alive...

221
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:15,718
ever since then...

222
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,655
until now?

223
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,108
She'll be here soon.

224
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,425
Excuse me.

225
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,443
Have you been working here for a long time?

226
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:38,799
I started working here
ever since I turned 40.

227
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:40,750
So it's been over 30 years.

228
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:42,917
What? 30 years?

229
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:46,287
I'm the only person who ages in this hotel.

230
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:51,480
And now, you'll be...

231
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:54,477
taking over my job.

232
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:03,858
30 years?

233
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:08,590
Does that mean I need to be
here until I become that old?

234
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:14,105
Why are you so late?

235
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:19,888
You're not wearing the shoes I
picked out for you yesterday.

236
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:24,824
Those shoes are too flashy...

237
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,375
to wear at the hotel I currently work at.

238
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:30,755
I'm only here for a while.
I need to go to work soon.

239
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:34,182
The girl wearing sunglasses
must've given you a break.

240
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:37,588
You made her stay right next to me?

241
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:40,291
You made her follow me around when
I didn't even do anything to her?

242
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:41,527
Oh, that.

243
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,733
She's hovering around the person
she's had a connection with.

244
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:46,344
Once they form a connection,

245
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:48,761
the connection automatically lasts forever.

246
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:50,956
Do you think I'm a wireless
router or something?

247
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:53,480
That's a great metaphor.

248
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:56,918
You understand things very well. I'm
starting to like you even more.

249
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:58,963
I don't want you to like me.

250
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,524
And I hate seeing those ghosts.

251
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:01,687
You need to see them.

252
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:03,693
And you'd better get used to it.

253
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:07,642
Those ghosts will be
your guests from now on.

254
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:11,473
Is this a new kind of
religion or something?

255
00:22:11,474 --> 00:22:14,744
Is this a house owned by a
shaman who takes care of ghosts?

256
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:15,937
It's a hotel.

257
00:22:16,644 --> 00:22:18,755
It's even registered at the
Jung-gu borough office.

258
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,844
(Jung-gu Borough Office, Seoul City)

259
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:22,589
(Business Registration, Hotel Del Luna)

260
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:25,754
I searched the web all night
to find the hotel website.

261
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:27,183
But I couldn't find...

262
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:29,794
a single website or post
regarding Hotel Del Luna.

263
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:32,855
Of course, you couldn't
find a hotel website.

264
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:35,919
I told you that this
hotel isn't for humans.

265
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,598
You told me that this place
consoles ghosts, right?

266
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,834
Then what kind of services do
you provide for your guests?

267
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:46,069
Exorcism?

268
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:47,427
We don't perform an exorcism.

269
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:49,808
We comfort them.

270
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:10,471
Miss, I brought room service for you.

271
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:20,398
Eat everything you couldn't
eat while you were alive.

272
00:23:21,474 --> 00:23:24,167
We have all kinds of food you want.

273
00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:48,455
Sir.

274
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,811
Do you feel warm now?

275
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:01,179
I'll burn the firewood for you...

276
00:24:01,414 --> 00:24:03,454
until you become warm.

277
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:18,800
You're even reading the
original copies now.

278
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:22,112
You'll soon end up reading every
single book in this room.

279
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:24,037
Study as much as you want.

280
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:29,973
I'll get whatever book you want to read.

281
00:24:29,974 --> 00:24:31,983
Thank you.

282
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:37,797
Hotel Del Luna is a place where
souls who used to be humans...

283
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:41,254
come to rest and do things
that they failed to fulfill...

284
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,856
while they were alive.

285
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:47,920
In other words, it's a chance
to recharge themselves.

286
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,163
That stuff isn't just for humans.

287
00:24:51,164 --> 00:24:54,703
Ghosts need to do it too in
order to leave with no regrets.

288
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:57,334
The guests are ghosts,

289
00:24:57,335 --> 00:24:59,044
so the manager should be a ghost as well.

290
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,473
Why do you need someone who's human?

291
00:25:00,474 --> 00:25:03,473
Because there are things
that only humans can do.

292
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:06,383
Register our business at the
borough office, pay taxes,

293
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:08,864
receive hygiene inspection, and so on.

294
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:10,686
There are so many things you have to do.

295
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:13,193
I want to deal with this
like a normal human being.

296
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:19,881
This is the money I saved
up so I could pay you back.

297
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:22,863
It's the money you lent my
dad including interest.

298
00:25:22,864 --> 00:25:24,262
Take this and let me leave.

299
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,303
You saved up quite a lot.

300
00:25:39,644 --> 00:25:42,469
You're very diligent and clever.

301
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:45,693
I guess I won't need to
worry about losing money.

302
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:48,905
I'll take it since you offered it to me.

303
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:54,242
Then that means we're even.

304
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:57,094
I'll be off now.

305
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:58,155
Okay.

306
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,953
I was actually waiting for you
so we could leave together.

307
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:02,903
- Let's go.
- I didn't plan on...

308
00:26:02,904 --> 00:26:05,173
leaving with you.

309
00:26:05,174 --> 00:26:06,878
You're going to leave by yourself?

310
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:08,326
Yes.

311
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:10,736
Okay, then.

312
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:12,808
Go ahead.

313
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,845
The third floor, please.

314
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:51,234
Okay.

315
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:28,677
Why?

316
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:32,691
Why am I still seeing ghosts?

317
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:36,185
I paid you back, so I shouldn't
be seeing them anymore.

318
00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:38,272
You just paid back what you owe me.

319
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,540
And what I gave you was a birthday gift.

320
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:42,225
You should...

321
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,373
cherish it.

322
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:45,874
Are you kidding me?

323
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,373
How... How do you expect me
to live a normal life...

324
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:50,613
when I can see ghosts?

325
00:27:50,614 --> 00:27:53,705
Then I guess you have no
choice but to work here.

326
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:57,640
Return my eyes back to normal.

327
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:02,284
I'm going to head out. What do you say?

328
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:03,621
Are you going to come with me?

329
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:06,417
Stay here if you don't want to go.

330
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:09,368
Let's continue our conversation...

331
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:12,458
once we're out of here.

332
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:34,554
The new guy looks very weakhearted.
I'm starting to get worried.

333
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:37,247
He looks very courageous to me.

334
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:45,326
I was more scared of
Ms. Jang than the ghosts.

335
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:46,655
But...

336
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,703
he seems to have no trouble
talking to Ms. Jang.

337
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:53,203
That's because he doesn't
know why Ms. Jang...

338
00:28:53,204 --> 00:28:54,602
is the owner of this place.

339
00:28:55,845 --> 00:28:56,895
Hurry.

340
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:00,844
Out of all the ghosts here,

341
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:03,200
she's the scariest and the most awful.

342
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:20,703
- This is your car, right?
- Today,

343
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:21,928
I'm going to drive this one.

344
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,314
Do you own all these cars?

345
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:31,673
I already told you that all
our guests are ghosts.

346
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:33,317
Do you think they drove here?

347
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,638
You have a lot of fancy cars.

348
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:54,034
You thought I was a vengeful ghost,

349
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:55,774
but do I seem like a human to you
after seeing all of my cars?

350
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:56,826
I guess you earn...

351
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:01,251
a lot of money while
comforting the dead souls.

352
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:04,943
You hate that you're seeing ghosts,

353
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:06,749
but you like fancy things
like this car, don't you?

354
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:08,668
Don't you want to work for me?

355
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:10,854
I can't possibly understand how
you can accumulate wealth...

356
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:13,303
by comforting them in a supernatural sense.

357
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,782
You began to take an interest in
the hotel's profit structure.

358
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,371
I should have shown you my cars
first instead of the ghosts.

359
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:20,916
I'm not interested.

360
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:26,203
Why are you laughing?

361
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:28,072
I find it funny that a
ghost puts on a seatbelt.

362
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:31,508
I will drive you to your destination.

363
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:33,230
But you must fix my eyes.

364
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:35,837
Why are you snickering?

365
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:37,395
I just...

366
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:40,265
find it funny that you believe
that I'm going to fix your eyes.

367
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:42,009
We had a deal.

368
00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:43,814
If you don't fix my eyes,
I can't go to work.

369
00:30:43,815 --> 00:30:45,014
Right, you can't go to
work at the other hotel...

370
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:46,656
because you need to take
care of something else now.

371
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:49,518
Where are we going now?

372
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:54,550
To catch a tiger.

373
00:30:56,464 --> 00:30:57,618
You're kidding, right?

374
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:18,905
This was...

375
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:21,847
the tiger's life.

376
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:25,606
Can a tiger stay at your hotel?

377
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:27,548
It's a mystical creature, so yes.

378
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:32,064
This was the last Baekdu tiger...

379
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:33,840
which was captured on the Korean Peninsula

380
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:36,304
I remember watching the news
about receiving a tiger...

381
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:37,905
from North Korea as a gift.

382
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:40,804
The tiger neither got along
with other tigers...

383
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:41,997
nor mated with others.

384
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,008
The tiger stayed alone
until the last moment.

385
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:46,708
The tiger is dead,

386
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:51,496
but they made it look like it's alive...

387
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:54,649
and on display here.

388
00:31:59,224 --> 00:32:00,551
I'm not dead.

389
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:02,190
I still haven't died.

390
00:32:02,995 --> 00:32:04,218
I'm just here.

391
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:59,382
Sir, did you have the same nightmare again?

392
00:33:18,505 --> 00:33:21,972
The chairman of my hotel brought
the tiger from North Korea.

393
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:23,443
When he visited North
Korea a long time ago,

394
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:25,005
he received the tiger as a
token of their friendship.

395
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,065
Is that so?

396
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:32,036
But you said you were
looking for the tiger.

397
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:33,855
Why did you come to a red
bean porridge restaurant?

398
00:33:34,624 --> 00:33:36,223
Is this restaurant relevant to the tiger?

399
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:38,264
Red bean porridge is tigers' favorite food.

400
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:40,363
Isn't that only natural for me...

401
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:42,231
to be reminded of red bean porridge
when I think about tigers?

402
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:47,602
I don't get how this is a
natural thought process.

403
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:52,140
You just wanted to have red
bean porridge, didn't you?

404
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:54,621
This restaurant was on "The
Guys Who Died After Eating".

405
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:57,290
- Kim Joon Hyun...
- Him again.

406
00:33:57,474 --> 00:34:00,402
He ate 5 balls of glutinous
rice cake in 1 bite.

407
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:03,808
That guy. He's not an ordinary man.

408
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:06,709
How many can you eat in one bite?

409
00:34:07,285 --> 00:34:08,958
I told you I had to go to work.

410
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:11,754
I don't have time to lounge
around and eat this right now.

411
00:34:11,755 --> 00:34:13,968
You must lounge around while eating this.

412
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,424
If you eat this in a hurry,

413
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:17,199
the hot glutinous rice cake will
burn the roof of your mouth.

414
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:19,678
I gave you the money. Since
you accepted the money,

415
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:21,830
please fix my eyes.

416
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:27,395
A long time ago,

417
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:31,104
do you know why the rice cake
seller was eaten by a tiger?

418
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:36,013
The seller gave away the rice
cake when the tiger said that...

419
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:37,544
the rice cake could save the seller's life.

420
00:34:38,215 --> 00:34:39,652
That's why the seller was eaten alive.

421
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:41,688
The seller should have negotiated first.

422
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:49,191
Does that mean I would have to live
with the woman with sunglasses?

423
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,533
No, bring her to my hotel.

424
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:53,912
She can stay here for a few days.
Then, I can send her away on a bus.

425
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,033
Well, if she lived a good life,

426
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:57,503
she could go in a limousine.

(The Sanzu River)

428
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:09,095
(Realm of the Living, Realm of the Dead)

429
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:31,243
I heard that there will be a
new manager at the hotel.

430
00:35:31,934 --> 00:35:35,474
Yes, I will retire soon.

431
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:38,971
I plan to go on a lot of fishing trips.

432
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:40,265
You don't...

433
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:43,126
have that much time on your hands.

434
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:49,465
Does that mean a vehicle
will be sent out for my use?

435
00:35:55,894 --> 00:35:57,874
I must get things in order.

436
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:07,132
I won't work at your hotel.

437
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:10,473
I've been offered a job from
3 of the top 100 hotels...

438
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:12,381
listed on "Forbes".

439
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:16,484
A position at Hotel Del Luna
doesn't require managers...

440
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:18,525
with the Harvard MBA.

441
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:20,410
You don't need an MBA.

442
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:22,782
You can see ghosts now.

443
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:25,347
You're the perfect fit for my hotel.

444
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:27,519
What was that? "Forbes"?

445
00:36:27,795 --> 00:36:29,593
I'm sure they wanted to hire you...

446
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:31,573
when they didn't know you could see ghosts.

447
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,234
If you don't work at our hotel,

448
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,203
the only job you can have
is becoming a shaman.

449
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:38,573
You can become a comedian if you know...

450
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:40,136
how to eat the bread in one bite.

451
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:44,191
- Will you perform an exorcism?
- I can get used to it.

452
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:46,073
Once I get used to seeing ghosts,

453
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:47,441
I can get used to ignoring them.

454
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:49,066
Is that so?

455
00:36:50,115 --> 00:36:52,124
Shall we check if you can...

456
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:54,446
ignore them?

457
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:23,840
Go get the coffee.

458
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:27,518
Just like you said, if you
can ignore all of them...

459
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:29,832
and bring the coffee
without spilling a drop,

460
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:32,116
I will believe you.

461
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,029
You can barely bring a cup of coffee.

462
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:09,624
Do you think those posh
hotels will want you?

463
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:22,195
But when will the new
manager start working?

464
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:23,899
Once he starts here,

465
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:26,758
will you leave the hotel
right away, Mr. No?

466
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,073
He's been stuck here for a long time now.

467
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:30,809
Now, you'll get to live your life.

468
00:39:30,914 --> 00:39:32,044
Come visit us from time to time.

469
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:34,258
Tell us what's going on in
the realm of the living.

470
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:37,000
What good will that do
for us, the dead souls?

471
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:39,210
Have fun...

472
00:39:39,514 --> 00:39:42,412
and come back much later.

473
00:39:43,295 --> 00:39:46,456
You should work on emptying
all your sorrows...

474
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:50,032
and walk over to the afterlife
for a new beginning.

475
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:55,391
I hoped to see you all
pass during my time here,

476
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:57,865
but that was only wishful thinking.

477
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:02,615
Without you, who will help
manage her bad temper?

478
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:05,013
The new manager doesn't
seem trustworthy yet.

479
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:06,167
Where is everyone?

480
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:19,376
I was saying goodbye to
everyone before I leave.

481
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:24,433
Kim Seon Bi, you passed the
State Exam during your time.

482
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:25,556
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:28,207
- Just so you know...
- Zip it.

484
00:40:28,335 --> 00:40:31,363
Isn't that better than the
modern day Harvard MBA?

485
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:34,104
The MBA doesn't even hold a candle to it.

486
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:35,104
Ms. Choi.

487
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:37,214
You said you lived in a mansion, correct?

488
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:38,296
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:41,413
I had countless employees.

490
00:40:41,414 --> 00:40:44,354
- And you?
- I attended the top school...

491
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,424
in all of Gyeongseong.

492
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:48,683
- Right?
- Before you all died,

493
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:51,408
you were way better off than Ku Chan Seong.

494
00:40:51,695 --> 00:40:55,092
He thinks he's something because
of that joke of a Forbes list.

495
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:56,386
Darn!

496
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:05,973
Ms. Jang, just like last time,

497
00:41:05,974 --> 00:41:09,779
I'm afraid I'll have to check
into the hospital for a few days.

498
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:12,136
Are you not feeling well?

499
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:15,888
When will that Ku Chan Seong be here?

500
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:17,953
He claimed he can endure it, so I let him.

501
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:19,614
He'll crack in a few days though.

502
00:41:20,784 --> 00:41:22,589
He's just too weak, you see.

503
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:26,546
I've hired another living
human to take your spot,

504
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:28,021
so I said you could live.

505
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:31,807
Enjoy your last moments as
a living human being...

506
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:34,026
and move on.

507
00:41:48,945 --> 00:41:51,055
He's been serving her for decades.

508
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:54,040
Would it have killed her
to seem more concerned?

509
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:11,441
I look forward to working with you.

510
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,027
I look forward to working with you.

Mr. Ku!

517
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:29,024
That's right. My clients
are VIPs from abroad,

518
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,508
not ghosts.

519
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:46,033
I have to say we have
been fortunate enough...

520
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:49,299
to have an experienced manager
sign with us recently.

521
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:53,756
He's right there actually. Let
me introduce him to you all.

Mr. Ku?

523
00:43:58,775 --> 00:43:59,937
Don't make a sound.

524
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:03,722
If I keep quiet, she'll leave
me alone just like before.

525

Please say hello.

526
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:11,694
What do I do? We already locked eyes,

527
00:44:11,695 --> 00:44:13,020
so I can't simply turn around.

528
00:44:13,494 --> 00:44:14,493
If I make a sound though,

529
00:44:14,494 --> 00:44:16,780
this ghost will take her
shades off and come at me.

530
00:44:18,764 --> 00:44:19,957
Mr. Ku?

531
00:44:20,704 --> 00:44:23,254
How can I not answer my boss though?

532
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:27,203
I don't think I can ignore the ghost
if it takes off her sunglasses.

533
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:30,065
So...

534
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:32,265
I'll...

535
00:44:59,105 --> 00:45:00,196
What was that?

536
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:02,901
I thought you were going to ignore it?

537
00:45:03,545 --> 00:45:05,176
Instead, you splashed into the water.

538
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:08,742
What about the next time?

539
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,451
Will you jump off the roof?

540
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:17,804
Then I'll stay at your hotel as a guest.

541
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:19,550
I won't go a day before then.

542
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:21,627
I'll ignore whatever I see.

543
00:45:24,394 --> 00:45:25,414
What's this?

544
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:29,504
You couldn't possibly ignore this.

545
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:31,697
You're curious as to...

546
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:35,060
what happened to this last Baekdu tiger.

547
00:45:37,115 --> 00:45:38,237
What happened to him?

548
00:45:41,885 --> 00:45:42,966
Let's find out.

549
00:45:58,965 --> 00:45:59,985
Ring the bell.

550
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:03,562
This is insane.

551
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:05,373
He is the chairman of the hotel I work for.

552
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:06,404
It doesn't make sense...

553
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:08,174
that an employee who he
doesn't know would visit him.

554
00:46:08,175 --> 00:46:09,195
Why not?

555
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:12,534
You said yourself that
you were scouted, right?

556
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:15,437
Where's your pride?

557
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:18,484
Let me call his secretary and...

558
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:20,015
receive permission to... Hey!

559
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:29,833
It's the first time an employee has
come to see me in my sick bed.

560
00:46:29,865 --> 00:46:31,464
I heard you were ill, sir.

561
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:34,564
I wanted to show my respect, so
I apologize for the intrusion.

562
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:35,860
Don't be.

563
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:38,571
Anyway, is she your wife?

564
00:46:42,445 --> 00:46:45,607
Yes, she wanted to show her respect too.

565
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:48,047
Well, you seem to be a couple in love.

566
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:52,759
I've been ill recently, so I
haven't been able to outside.

567
00:46:53,255 --> 00:46:56,488
There was no one to talk
to either, so this is fun.

568
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:11,446
She must be looking for the bathroom.

569
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:14,477
This looks expensive.

570
00:47:15,545 --> 00:47:16,565
Is it authentic?

571
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:24,264
She lived abroad for so long...

572
00:47:24,514 --> 00:47:26,085
that she speaks casually with everyone.

573
00:47:26,954 --> 00:47:28,791
Is that so?

574
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:30,776
Honey.

575
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:32,744
Honey?

576
00:47:35,324 --> 00:47:37,027
You should sit back down.

577
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,090
Sit down, please.

578
00:47:39,994 --> 00:47:41,055
Please.

579
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:43,545
You must know about paintings.

580
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:45,756
This is one...

581
00:47:46,204 --> 00:47:49,305
from a famous North Korean painter.

582
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:52,474
When I visited the North, it
was given to me as a gift...

583
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:54,549
along with the Baekdu tiger.

584
00:47:54,615 --> 00:47:57,308
We saw the tiger on display, sir.

585
00:47:57,954 --> 00:47:59,689
So that tiger...

586
00:48:02,324 --> 00:48:06,232
I brought him here from North Korea,

587
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:09,956
but it didn't mate while it lived here...

588
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:13,189
and ended up dying as a lonesome soul.

589
00:48:14,034 --> 00:48:17,197
Because there's no need to leave
anything meaningful here.

590
00:48:18,974 --> 00:48:21,148
Anything that is meaningful to him...

591
00:48:21,945 --> 00:48:24,117
lies in a place he can't go back to.

592
00:48:26,045 --> 00:48:28,360
That's why I feel sorry for him.

593
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:32,081
I keep seeing the tiger in my dreams.

594
00:48:33,755 --> 00:48:36,070
The one who brought him
here, should return him.

595
00:48:36,385 --> 00:48:38,654
The taxidermy tiger has become...

596
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,328
a symbol of our exchange.

597
00:48:41,124 --> 00:48:43,439
It's not up to me to get rid of it...

598
00:48:44,094 --> 00:48:45,768
or send it back.

599
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:37,308
The time I've spent in this life...

600
00:49:39,085 --> 00:49:42,318
Only this photo will be the proof for that.

601
00:49:44,195 --> 00:49:47,325
Will she remember a mere human being...

602
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:49,561
who's just passing by here?

603
00:49:59,974 --> 00:50:03,576
(Seafood and Grilled Clams)

604
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:16,165
The tiger was definitely
next to the chairman.

605
00:50:16,755 --> 00:50:18,694
Why did you let him get away
instead of catching him?

606
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:20,970
He didn't want to come with me.
I can't force him.

607
00:50:21,124 --> 00:50:24,602
It looks like he's waiting
until the chairman dies.

608
00:50:24,695 --> 00:50:26,979
Is the tiger making the chairman ill?

609
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:29,504
If that's the case, it's really dangerous.

610
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:31,073
We don't have time to
eat sashimi right now.

611
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:34,205
After looking at Mount
Baekdu, I'm craving sashimi.

612
00:50:34,974 --> 00:50:37,524
You looked at a mountain. Why
are you craving sashimi?

613
00:50:39,144 --> 00:50:41,384
The anthem goes, "Mount
Baekdu and the ocean".

614
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:42,742
They come as a set.

615
00:50:43,244 --> 00:50:44,913
It's only natural to crave seafood...

616
00:50:44,914 --> 00:50:46,854
after seeing Mount Baekdu.

617
00:50:46,855 --> 00:50:49,130
You just wanted to have sashimi.

618
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:52,194
I don't care what it is.

619
00:50:52,195 --> 00:50:54,847
A ghost is torturing a human.
We must go back.

620
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:56,015
Sure.

621
00:50:56,965 --> 00:50:58,730
You do have to go back there.

622
00:50:58,865 --> 00:51:01,894
Tell the chairman that you
can get rid of the tiger...

623
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:04,660
and get something in return.

624
00:51:06,635 --> 00:51:07,643
Get what in return?

625
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:09,716
The expensive artwork we saw earlier.

626
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:11,738
Get that.

627
00:51:12,374 --> 00:51:13,373
What?

628
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:15,730
He'll give it to you if you tell him
he's sick because of the tiger.

629
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:19,222
That old geezer is loaded.

630
00:51:21,885 --> 00:51:24,169
Now, I understand how you
make profits with your hotel.

631
00:51:25,025 --> 00:51:28,263
You extort money from people who
are suffering because of ghosts.

632
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:30,641
Is this in my job descriptions
as a human employee?

633
00:51:30,664 --> 00:51:31,716
That's right.

634
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:34,574
This will be your job from now on.

635
00:51:37,105 --> 00:51:39,246
I won't scam people like that.

636
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:50,221
Is this how you conned my dad too?

637
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:56,303
I saved your dad's life.

638
00:51:56,855 --> 00:51:58,793
And in exchange, I got you.

639
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,518
That's why I'm protecting you too.

640
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:04,199
Without me,

641
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:06,587
you'll be dead.

642
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:09,036
The vengeful ghost will torture me?

643
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:13,023
I think you've done that enough yourself.

644
00:52:21,244 --> 00:52:23,182
I've made good on my promise to you.

645
00:52:23,344 --> 00:52:25,453
(Seafood and Grilled Clams)

646
00:52:25,454 --> 00:52:27,769
I'm going back to my human life.

647
00:52:56,315 --> 00:52:58,214
Take off your sunglasses
if that's what you want.

648
00:52:58,215 --> 00:53:00,704
I even saw a tiger.
Nothing can scare me now!

649
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:03,027
I'm not scared of you now. Take them off!

650
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,505
I've been waiting and
wondering when you'd come.

651
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:33,916
You said you've worked there for 30 years.

652
00:53:34,355 --> 00:53:37,354
Did that woman keep you there for 30 years?

653
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:38,578
No.

654
00:53:39,454 --> 00:53:42,279
It was my decision to stay at the hotel.

655
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:44,893
You stayed your whole life
at a place like that?

656
00:53:44,894 --> 00:53:49,495
Hotel Del Luna was worth my time.

657
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:52,518
I don't understand its worth.

658
00:53:53,574 --> 00:53:54,973
I don't want to extort...

659
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:57,524
millions of dollars from the
chairman under her instruction.

660
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:00,243
And I don't think I can either.

661
00:54:00,244 --> 00:54:01,408
Hotel Del Luna...

662
00:54:01,644 --> 00:54:05,562
can't be explained by the
logic of the human world.

663
00:54:05,815 --> 00:54:09,527
The value of money and power
seems to differ at the hotel.

664
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:13,524
That's why I couldn't judge...

665
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:16,585
what Ms. Jang does for the hotel
by using my human standards.

666
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:21,603
I'm sure you hate the hotel...

667
00:54:22,534 --> 00:54:24,820
and don't want to face it right now.

668
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,764
I'm sure you want to avoid it.

669
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:31,823
However, if you gather
your courage and face it,

670
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:35,579
you might be able to find...

671
00:54:35,914 --> 00:54:38,607
the worth of the hotel just like I did.

672
00:54:41,755 --> 00:54:42,805
Chan Seong.

673
00:54:44,224 --> 00:54:45,316
What are you doing there alone?

674
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:47,820
I'm having a conversation.

675
00:54:48,394 --> 00:54:49,516
By yourself?

676
00:55:02,874 --> 00:55:04,476
He must be lonely.

677
00:55:14,184 --> 00:55:17,111
Through your job, you'll find out...

678
00:55:18,324 --> 00:55:21,589
a secret world that no one knows about.

679
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:25,736
Don't you think this will be fun?

680
00:55:59,394 --> 00:56:00,486
Hey.

681
00:56:07,074 --> 00:56:08,329
Mr. No.

682
00:56:16,445 --> 00:56:17,535
Ms. Jang.

683
00:56:18,284 --> 00:56:20,875
Mr. No is here as a guest.

684
00:56:36,505 --> 00:56:37,595
Ms. Jang.

685
00:56:38,934 --> 00:56:40,739
I spent my whole life here,

686
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:43,386
but it feels weird to come here as a guest.

687
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:45,095
Are you dead?

688
00:56:46,474 --> 00:56:47,708
I'm sorry.

689
00:56:47,715 --> 00:56:51,428
When I left the hotel, I've lost my life.

690
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:55,587
I finally let you go.

691
00:56:56,385 --> 00:56:58,741
You probably didn't have a chance
to live like a human being.

692
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:01,209
As I served my guests here,

693
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:05,339
I've spent a meaningful life.

694
00:57:07,065 --> 00:57:10,808
A long time ago, when I
tried to let myself go,

695
00:57:11,704 --> 00:57:13,744
I would have lived a short...

696
00:57:14,344 --> 00:57:18,527
and lame life if I hadn't met you that day.

697
00:57:19,844 --> 00:57:21,584
I was glad...

698
00:57:21,585 --> 00:57:25,053
that I could stay at Hotel Del Luna.

699
00:57:25,554 --> 00:57:26,779
Glad, my foot.

700
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:30,858
You've never made a family who
would put up an altar for you.

701
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:33,848
As I was the only one who
got older at this hotel,

702
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:38,635
you were my sister,

703
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:42,392
my daughter,

704
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:46,067
and my grandson.

705
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:52,090
I can leave without worries...

706
00:57:52,914 --> 00:57:54,546
now that you have a reliable replacement.

707
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:09,115
Since...

708
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:12,191
I can't die,

709
00:58:13,965 --> 00:58:16,107
I can't tell you that we'll meet again...

710
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:18,628
or something like that.

711
00:58:29,244 --> 00:58:30,571
I hope...

712
00:58:31,485 --> 00:58:34,545
that your time will start
running once again someday.

713
01:00:02,329 --> 01:00:05,288
I apologize for coming
back so late at night.

714
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,631
I needed to say something important.

715
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,131
Is it about the tiger?

716
01:00:11,139 --> 01:00:13,169
The woman you came by here earlier with.

717
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,627
Ms. Jang Man Weol came by to see me.

718
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:17,333
Did she tell you...

719
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:19,640
that the tiger was wandering around you?

720
01:00:22,179 --> 01:00:26,300
I brought him to a place where
he could never go back home.

721
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,352
I always felt bad about
keeping his soul here...

722
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,910
even after he had passed.

723
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,950
Come out.

724
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,085
Don't stay here stuck in that body...

725
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:42,290
and come out.

726
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:44,162
I'll help you leave.

727
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,084
As my punishment for
bringing the tiger here,

728
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:51,523
she said she had to take my painting.

729
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:54,474
I know it's hard to believe,

730
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,809
but the tiger exists.

731
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,457
I let her have the painting.

732
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,617
If I could atone from what I did,

733
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,241
I could give up even more than that.

734
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,508
The painting was of Mount Baekdu.

735
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,396
The mountain and the tiger...

736
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,563
are part of a set.

737
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:22,080
I wonder why I never thought of that.

738
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,999
Where you wish to go...

739
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,613
no longer exists in this world.

740
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,109
The man who brought you here...

741
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,599
provided a place for you to stay though.

742
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,501
Go...

743
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,103
and rest in peace.

744
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,720
Ma'am.

745
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:05,931
I know where you should go.

746
01:04:10,409 --> 01:04:11,602
I'll take you there.

747
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:27,019
I avoided you because I hated
having you on my tail.

748
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,202
I guess I never asked why you
were following me though.

749
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:36,824
I thought about it,

750
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:40,536
and maybe you can see now even
though you were never able to.

751
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:42,646
Forget about that fact that you can't...

752
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,465
and take another look.

753
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:04,383
See? Your eyes are back.

754
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,689
(The Four Seasons of Mount Baekdu)

755
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,889
Because there's no need to leave
anything meaningful here.

756
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:07,730
Anything that is meaningful to him...

757
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:10,700
lies in a place he can't go back to.

758
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,308
Did the tiger safely
return to Mount Baekdu?

759
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:23,138
(Did the tiger safely
return to Mount Baekdu?)

760
01:06:23,139 --> 01:06:24,379
I apologize for my misunderstanding.

761
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,573
(I apologize for my misunderstanding.)

762
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,089
That's right.

763
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,319
The chairman said that unresolved
issues sicken your heart.

764
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,718
(Did the tiger safely
return to Mount Baekdu?)

765
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:39,463
(I apologize for my misunderstanding.)

766
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,538
There. I kept my decency.

767
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:46,990
Please don't.

768
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,638
This shouldn't be touched.

769
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,291
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

770
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:17,283
Pretend that you didn't see it.

771
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,491
You can do this.

772
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:48,472
(From Ku Chan Seong)

773
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,795
She hasn't texted back yet.

774
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:21,151
Excuse me?

775
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:26,043
Is the pool still open?

776
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:31,035
Yes, ma'am. We're open even
during the nights these days.

777
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:32,791
It's this way.

778
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,545
Got it. Thank you.

779
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:02,129
If you get attacked by those
who hold deep grudges,

780
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,456
you could end up getting killed.

781
01:09:04,329 --> 01:09:06,033
You should learn to differentiate them.

782
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:04,765
The tiger has arrived
in Mount Baekdu safely,

783
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:09,262
and I'm here to forgive you.

784
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:13,613
Thank you.

785
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:35,282
I envy trees.

786
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:37,812
They don't have to wander around.

787
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,460
It must be nice to just put
down roots and settle down.

788
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,585
What? You'll build a house
for me with this tree?

789
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:50,265
Forget it. I don't plan on building
a house and living with you.

790
01:12:16,689 --> 01:12:17,882
You woke up.

791
01:12:18,289 --> 01:12:20,429
Ms. Jang is waiting for you, Mr. Manager.

792
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,857
I told you I'm not the manager...

793
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:30,804
It's your first time here at night, right?

794
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,758
This is what Hotel Del
Luna really looks like.

795
01:13:39,609 --> 01:13:42,159
Through your job, you'll find out...

796
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,787
a secret world that no one knows about.

797
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,720
Don't you think this will be fun?

798
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,154
Ms. Jang is here.

799
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:11,578
(Hotel Del Luna)

800
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,721
The heart beating inside a warm body.

801
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,238
This is what it feels like.

802
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:18,209
Did you cast a spell on me or something?

803
01:15:18,609 --> 01:15:20,476
Is that why I dreamt about you?

804
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:23,839
Ku Chan Seong. I thought
you were a weakling,

805
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:25,709
but you're actually very healthy.

806
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:28,677
Do you know what Ms. Jang was
like when she was alive?

807
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,019
It grew leaves.

808
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,818
Your time will start flowing again.

809
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:34,216
Let's get Mr. Ku out of the hotel.

810
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,658
If you walk around like a crazy person,

811
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:39,802
you may see ghosts but won't
be able to find this place.
