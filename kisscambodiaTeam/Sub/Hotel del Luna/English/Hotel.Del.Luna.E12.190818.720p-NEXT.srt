00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:12,578
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:16,418
What about the one that
helped you bloom the flowers?

3
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:20,447
What if you lose him?

4
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:26,357
Man Weol, you conceited and foolish thing.

5
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:29,028
Did you say you aren't afraid
to see the flowers wilt?

6
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:32,998
No.

7
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:36,193
Your flowers will begin to wilt...

8
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:38,168
when you become afraid.

9
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:49,848
Long time no see, Chan Seong.

10
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:02,458
Are you waiting for me to say,
"Why are you doing this to me?"

11
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:03,928
"I'm so scared."

12
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,422
And when I start shivering in fear...

13
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:08,762
and the flowers slowly start to drop,

14
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:11,938
is that when you'll drag
me to my afterlife?

15
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:13,637
I'm not surprised.

16
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:17,378
I already know how cheeky you guys can be.

17
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:22,917
There's no need to wait.

18
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,887
You should just bring him to me...

19
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,018
right now.

20
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:29,958
We can end this once and for all,

21
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:32,257
and I'll finally disappear...

22
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:36,727
which is exactly what
I've been wishing for...

23
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:39,727
during the endless years
that I had to endure.

24
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:43,337
Ku Chan Seong.

25
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,693
He will eventually bring him to you.

26
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,732
Why do you keep getting
Chan Seong involved?

27
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,777
I'm not the one who got
him involved in this.

28
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:55,378
It's the one that wants
you to leave in peace.

29
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:59,172
You've been enduring for
the past 1,000 years,

30
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:01,842
and all you wish is to cease to exist.

31
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:05,188
And the price that Chan Seong needs
to pay in return is very unfair.

32
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:07,727
It's neither evenhanded nor objective.

33
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:12,467
I tried to stop him.

34
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:14,367
He chose to stay by my side.

35
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:17,168
You wicked thing.

36
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,467
Yes, that's right.

37
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,533
I'm a wicked witch who made him stay...

38
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,403
even when I knew what he'd
end up going through.

39
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,307
Yes, you're right. You are very wicked.

40
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,377
Because of you,

41
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:30,418
he even had to encounter the
person that hurt him the most.

42
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:43,627
What more do you think...

43
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,497
he'll have to go through because of you?

44
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:56,008
You're shaking like a leaf.

45
00:02:57,063 --> 00:02:59,377
It's very amusing to watch.

46
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:25,538
You're Chan Seong, aren't you?

47
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,262
Don't you remember me?

48
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:29,638
I'm Seol Ji Won. We used to
study in Boston together.

49
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:32,508
Yes, Seol Ji Won.

50
00:03:33,702 --> 00:03:34,918
It was you.

51
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:37,172
What brings you here?

52
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:38,913
Did Sanchez tell you about me?

53
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:40,288
Or was it Mi Ra?

54
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:44,157
No, it was someone else.

55
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,288
She told me that she walked past you.

56
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:48,027
But I'm surprised to actually see you here.

57
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:50,768
Oh, really?

58
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,478
I'm sure you didn't come
here because you missed me.

59
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:05,078
So what brings you here?

60
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:10,078
I heard you came back to Korea
to get into law school.

61
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:11,518
Did you quit studying?

62
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,518
You told me your father is a judge.
Did he give up on you?

63
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:17,887
He didn't give up on me,
but he did pass away.

64
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,488
So I'm just doing what I want to do now.

65
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:22,627
And what exactly is that?

66
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:30,767
It must be wine.

67
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:37,707
Do you have a lot of good wine?

68
00:04:42,843 --> 00:04:44,048
Can I have a glass?

69
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:47,687
Okay, sure.

70
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:57,158
Was it him?

71
00:04:58,323 --> 00:04:59,728
Did he kill you?

72
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:24,588
What are you doing here?

73
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:34,557
What about you? What did you do here?

74
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:40,997
Is your pastime...

75
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:43,738
murdering people?

76
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,817
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message...

77
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:36,017
Why won't he pick up his phone?

78
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,752
I need to go back to Chan Seong's place.

79
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,197
You've been there many times already.

80
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:45,992
He'll come.

81
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:47,963
We said we'd meet up, but
he doesn't show up...

82
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,267
or take his call. This is weird.

83
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,417
I need to know where he
is to go and find him.

84
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,612
I'm sure there's a reason.

85
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:56,588
Why are you so restless?

86
00:08:09,662 --> 00:08:11,578
What about the one that
helped you bloom the flowers?

87
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:14,307
What if you lose him?

88
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:18,018
I heard something ominous.

89
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:25,388
I'm going to go find him.

90
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:26,917
Ms. Jang.

91
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:34,027
Why won't he pick up?

92
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:49,907
- Hello?
- What am I going to do?

93
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,777
What's wrong, Yu Na?

94
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:55,247
I think Mr. Ku got hurt.

95
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:58,617
What if he died?

96
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:00,387
What?

97
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,058
Mr. Third Choice is dead?

98
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:06,728
I think he died when he
went to catch the murderer.

99
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,897
Ms. Jang. Wait, Ms. Jang.

100
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,607
This is bad.

101
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:19,938
Mr. Ku is dead.

102
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:25,017
What?

103
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,458
Yu Na followed a car...

104
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:36,558
saying she wants to find the
murderer of the guests,

105
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:39,857
but Mr. Ku said it was
too dangerous for her...

106
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:41,527
and went over himself.

107
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:49,907
Stop talking nonsense.

108
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:54,078
Why would Chan Seong die?

109
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:56,877
Yu Na saw that he was being
taken in an ambulance.

110
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,728
Explain the situation.

111
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:50,668
What happened?

112
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:54,968
Stop crying!

113
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,948
Mr. Ku?

114
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,473
Ji Hyun Joong, you little jerk. Come here.

115
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:44,172
- Ms. Jang! Goodness, Ms. Jang!
- You jerk!

116
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:45,578
Ms. Jang!

117
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:48,987
- You said he...
- My goodness.

118
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,357
You didn't die. I'm so relieved.

119
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,777
Goodness.

120
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:20,818
You're alive.

121
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:27,257
I thought you came as a guest.

122
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:29,228
What? A guest...

123
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:37,828
You went there to meet the murderer alone,

124
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:40,462
we couldn't get a hold of you, then
we heard someone got badly wounded.

125
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:42,137
I thought it was you.

126
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:47,377
I didn't walk into danger knowing
things could get very dangerous.

127
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:50,348
I already had called a
police officer I knew.

128
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,448
Freeze.

129
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:03,027
Great job. Then who got hurt?

130
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:05,198
The culprit.

131
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:10,198
Seol Ji Won, you are under
emergency arrest for murder.

132
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:23,747
Put that down.

133
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:42,443
He's not in critical condition now,

134
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,018
so he will live to pay for what he did.

135
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:46,543
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

136
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:49,012
I was really shocked because I
thought you came as a guest.

137
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:50,882
I knew he wasn't a guest
as soon as I saw him.

138
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:53,252
No, you didn't. You cried.

139
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:55,022
I saw you wiping off your tears.

140
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:56,457
I had a runny nose.

141
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,298
Ms. Choi, I saw your legs shaking.

142
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:05,232
I'm sorry that I made everyone worried.

143
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:08,232
And thank you for your concern.

144
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:11,032
Our dead hearts skipped
a beat thanks to you.

145
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:12,577
That was thrilling.

146
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:15,673
Ms. Jang will begin to throw her fit,

147
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:17,142
so let's survive that too.

148
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:18,248
Okay.

149
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,288
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

150
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,398
Ms. Jang.

151
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:37,998
Where did she go?

152
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:43,837
I brought this because I knew a
few bottles wouldn't cut it.

153
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,148
Ms. Jang, where have you been?

154
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:54,173
Did you go shopping?

155
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:55,487
Chan Seong, sit down.

156
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,823
Did you go to the pharmacy?

157
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:11,668
Yes, we don't have anything
that can treat the living.

158
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:14,032
Did you clean out the entire pharmacy?

159
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,778
Just take a seat, will you?

160
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:17,408
Let me see you.

161
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,648
You're all wounded.

162
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:33,727
What do I have to put on you?

163
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:36,128
Let's put on the most expensive one.

164
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:47,567
- This stings.
- It hurts?

165
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:50,437
Darn it. I guess this
ointment isn't a good one.

166
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:51,908
Let me see.

167
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:58,213
Wait, this is the ointment
for constipation.

168
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,347
What?

169
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:03,717
Sorry. I applied the ointment
for anus on your face.

170
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:06,882
Come here.

171
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:08,257
No, that's okay.

172
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:11,283
If this heals the anus, I'm
sure it'll heal my face too.

173
00:17:11,283 --> 00:17:13,027
The anus and the face aren't the same.

174
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:14,898
Give it back. I'll apply another ointment.

175
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:20,668
Were you scared...

176
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:23,277
that I died and came to
the hotel as a guest?

177
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:31,148
How could you out of all people get
that mixed up and be surprised?

178
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,658
Because I was afraid.

179
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:43,428
Just like the world turned pitch-dark,

180
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:46,868
I was scared.

181
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:57,237
No matter how desperately I wanted
money, I've never made this mistake.

182
00:17:58,172 --> 00:17:59,747
You made me look like a fool.

183
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,578
All of my employees were watching too.

184
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,424
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

185
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,858
What is this? Darn it.

186
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:12,088
Wait here.

187
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,098
I'll go look for a guest who
was a pharmacist in this life.

188
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:20,523
It looked like you were
pretty shocked yourself.

189
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:22,237
Shouldn't you take some medicine?

190
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:25,537
Why? Do you have a relaxing
pill or something?

191
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:37,477
You were very scared.

192
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,158
Are you a pharmacist?

193
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:51,727
I'm supposed to take care of you.

194
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:14,088
Your flowers will begin to wilt...

195
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:16,457
when you become afraid.

196
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:27,267
I have good news too.

197
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:30,267
Your Yeon Woo...

198
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,308
Right. Detective Park Yeong
Su caught the culprit.

199
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:34,908
He'll probably get promoted.

200
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:47,287
I found all the drugs and syringes
he used to kill the victims.

201
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:51,358
I think he illegally smuggled in
the drugs while importing wine.

202
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:53,813
This must be the website, Helllo,
where people curse other people.

203
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,858
Did you find Seol Ji Won from the website?

204
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:57,797
Actually,

205
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:00,598
I received a tip.

206
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:05,037
Who?

207
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,568
You're the dead woman, Lee Do Yeon?

208
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:09,763
My husband isn't the culprit.

209
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:11,237
The murderer is right here.

210
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:15,447
- Stop prank-calling me.
- Blood. There's blood.

211
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:18,313
He collected a sample of
blood from his victims.

212
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:20,247
Please come here. It's dangerous here.

213
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:23,358
The lead that there were traces
that victims' blood was drawn...

214
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,287
was never disclosed to the public.

215
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:28,158
I came here because that bothered me.

216
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:31,558
I really found blood here.

217
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:33,828
He's really like a devil.

218
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:37,638
He collected the blood and displayed
it among his wine bottles.

219
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,068
But who do you think gave me that call?

220
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,707
There's no way a dead woman
could have called me.

221
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:46,878
That's really strange.

222
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,757
You can't let a ghost take
over your body like that.

223
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,888
Promise me. Don't you ever do
something like that without me.

224
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:04,398
The ghost just helped me call
it in and gather evidence.

225
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,467
Take them with you.

226
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:09,638
And go home and rest for the day.

227
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:13,308
I have a bigger bag for my medicine now.

228
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:17,007
- What's this?
- A massager.

229
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:20,972
Put it on your neck before going to sleep.
It'll be nice.

230
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:24,172
There are an eye patch and
a bottle of champagne.

231
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:27,343
Right. Caviar. This is really
expensive, just so you know.

232
00:21:27,343 --> 00:21:28,612
Take your time with it.

233
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:30,787
You gave me things that
are very valuable to you.

234
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:35,428
Take one of my cars since you have a lot...

235
00:21:37,323 --> 00:21:38,398
Forget it.

236
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:40,797
You should just keep driving one.

237
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,697
Really?

238
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:45,838
The red one. Can I take the red one?

239
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:47,108
What?

240
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:52,977
Why? Do you like red? You don't like red.

241
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,178
I do.

242
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:56,148
Is that so?

243
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:57,878
Really?

244
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:01,247
Sure.

245
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:04,717
You can drive the red car.

246
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:06,957
There's only one red car.

247
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:10,858
You can keep it.

248
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,267
Thank you.

249
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:18,608
This isn't the right key.

250
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:20,467
It's that one. Over there.

251
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:28,977
Here.

252
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:31,477
It's nice to have a near-death experience.

253
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:33,918
I'll just drive this one.

254
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:35,287
Are you kidding me?

255
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:36,513
I was testing you.

256
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:39,112
Red car versus me. I won.

257
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:41,553
You would've lost if it
was a new brown car.

258
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:43,753
I know that your favorite is the red one.

259
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:45,368
Since I beat the red car,
it means I beat them all.

260
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:49,868
I had no idea that you were
such a sly snake from Harvard.

261
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,608
I think I need to go to
the police a few times.

262
00:22:55,902 --> 00:22:59,108
To explain what had happened
without involving the ghost,

263
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:01,378
I really have to be a sly
snake from Harvard this time.

264
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,878
Anyway, Yeon Woo must be flustered.

265
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,217
He received two tips from ghosts.

266
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:10,658
He only has a big build.

267
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:14,088
He easily got scared and
found ghosts really scary.

268
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:15,858
Yeon Woo did?

269
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:18,997
You must've grown up with
him since you were young.

270
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,098
Yeon Woo's mother raised me.

271
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:26,568
When I was very young,

272
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,007
I was dying in the wilds.

273
00:23:30,763 --> 00:23:32,878
A merchant who was passing
by saved me, apparently.

274
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:36,247
And Yeon Woo's mom was
the one who took me in.

275
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:41,687
But she passed away not long after.

276
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:46,588
Yeon Woo and I were each
other's brother and sister.

277
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:48,058
That's how we lived.

278
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:55,697
He was dexterous, so he'd
make clothes for me too.

279
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:05,848
I think he's living a
good life as a cop now.

280
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:12,447
I don't think I've told
you about my past before.

281
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:14,517
You haven't.

282
00:24:18,952 --> 00:24:21,227
- Perhaps, it's the blooming flower.
- Its time must be up soon.

283
00:24:48,712 --> 00:24:49,918
I'll get going.

284
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:56,058
Hey.

285
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:17,477
Its time must be up soon.

286
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:40,207
Keep on taking good care of me...

287
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:42,108
and...

288
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:44,608
try to see me off...

289
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,648
just like Ma Go wants.

290
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:52,648
You must be doing a good job. I
think the flower will bloom.

291
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:55,687
You should look after it well,

292
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,658
so you can see her off.

293
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:03,257
Who is the last guest
you'll be sending off?

294
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,297
I will be your last guest
for you to send off.

295
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:08,568
When you see me off,

296
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:12,467
don't feel lonely.

297
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:48,759
When will he wake up?

298
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,967
Probably in a couple of hours.

299
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:15,790
- Has he come to?
- He will in a few hours.

300
00:27:20,154 --> 00:27:22,184
- Where did he go?
- He was here a second ago.

301
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:23,624
Don't just stand there. Look for him!

302
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:24,729
I'm sorry, sir!

303
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,259
Is your pastime...

304
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:52,590
murdering people?

305
00:27:54,414 --> 00:27:55,630
What are you talking about?

306
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:57,300
You killed...

307
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:59,429
a person.

308
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:03,870
- Says who?
- The person you killed...

309
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:06,340
is here with us.

310
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:10,610
You're insane.

311
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:14,649
Do you think that it's
over once people die?

312
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:21,620
Our souls remain.

313
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:27,560
Your seventh victim is here
with us at the moment.

314
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:32,469
And this...

315
00:28:35,124 --> 00:28:36,439
is her blood.

316
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,749
Must I find the other six
for you to believe me?

317
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:15,439
- Who are you?
- I didn't find them.

318
00:29:15,535 --> 00:29:17,065
Your victim did.

319
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,535
Don't lie to me. That's impossible.

320
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:20,949
You may not know this,

321
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,479
but she's been next to you this whole time.

322
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:35,699
She's also telling me
what you are hiding...

323
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:38,030
behind you.

324
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:03,620
So spirits exist?

325
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:11,100
Will you be here soon?

326
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:13,330
What time?

327
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:15,770
That's too late.

328
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:35,020
(Detective Park Yeong Su)

329
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,759
Yes, Detective Park.

330
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:42,030
Mr. Ku, we need you here
at the hospital now.

331
00:31:13,884 --> 00:31:14,959
You're here.

332
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,324
Just like I said earlier,

333
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,459
Seol Ji Won will only talk to you.

334
00:31:18,624 --> 00:31:19,830
Would that be all right?

335
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:23,300
Yes.

336
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:56,899
You're here.

337
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:03,439
Look at where I am thanks to you.

338
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:05,540
No, this is on you.

339
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:10,580
What put you here is the
victim whom you killed.

340
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:15,989
You said spirits existed.

341
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:19,560
Is someone aiding you right now as well?

342
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:24,860
Yes, a spirit is looking
over me even at this moment.

343
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:33,610
Is this the guy?

344
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,679
Should I just push him?

345
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:39,810
No, don't.

346
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:42,620
He must live and pay for his wrongdoings.

347
00:32:43,104 --> 00:32:44,144
Sure.

348
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:47,649
I don't want to go through an ordeal
because of some scumbag anyway.

349
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:49,159
- Of course.
- Hey!

350
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:52,489
What are you doing?

351
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:55,630
I was talking to my guardian about you.

352
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:01,830
Ku Chan Seong...

353
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:03,394
My life started to fall apart...

354
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:04,999
because of you, you know.

355
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:07,770
No, that was on you back then too.

356
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:21,390
Cute.

357
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:26,159
Do you have proof that I sent it?

358
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:29,359
Also, who will believe you?

359
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:31,584
You think you're something

360
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:33,199
just because you're smart, don't you?

361
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:35,429
You're full of yourself.

362
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:45,379
No one has to believe me...

363
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:47,379
except for one person.

364
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:52,549
The man who knew his
youngest son so well...

365
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:55,120
that he sent the son abroad.

366
00:33:56,845 --> 00:33:58,120
I'm talking about your
father who's a judge.

367
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:09,500
How about a bet?

368
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:13,909
Between a son who isn't reliable at all...

369
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:18,210
and a straight-A student of a
prestigious US university,

370
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:20,109
who will your father believe?

371
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:51,609
Before I tell your father about everything,

372
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:53,210
leave quietly.

373
00:34:58,104 --> 00:35:00,120
I should've just pulled
the trigger back then.

374
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:11,309
Do you...

375
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:14,019
know him personally?

376
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,490
Our ill-fated relationship goes way back.

377
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,220
I thought it had been severed,

378
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:22,289
but we met again.

379
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:25,729
Because of you,

380
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:29,300
he even had to encounter the
person that hurt him the most.

381
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:31,669
What more do you think...

382
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:34,470
he'll have to go through because of you?

383
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,479
What you did...

384
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:42,410
won't end with your death.

385
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:44,479
The only way to save your soul...

386
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:47,944
is to stay alive and pay for your sins.

387
00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:49,120
How are they my sins?

388
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,990
I just did what other
people asked me to do.

389
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:57,455
Do you have any idea how
enthusiastic people become...

390
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,899
when it comes to hating and cursing others?

391
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:03,370
Soccer players score goals
because that's what people want.

392
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,725
And I killed those people...

393
00:36:05,725 --> 00:36:08,399
because that's what people wanted,
so how is that my responsibility?

394
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:11,269
That's probably where people go
to express their filthy emotions.

395
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:13,234
But no one actually wants someone...

396
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:15,534
to put their filthy thoughts into action.

397
00:36:15,534 --> 00:36:16,950
Get down here, Ji Won!

398
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:24,820
I also uploaded a post to
express my hatred for you.

399
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:29,120
I hope it receives a lot of support.

400
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:14,700
I guess you're able to see me now.

401
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:16,999
He was right.

402
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:19,870
Death really wasn't the end.

403
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:21,700
Yes.

404
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:24,010
You're a ghost now.

405
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:32,050
Chan Seong probably didn't
want this to happen,

406
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,680
but I couldn't wait for you to
fall down the building and die.

407
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:40,419
I'm not allowed to harm
a living human being,

408
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:42,459
but when it comes to a
vengeful ghost like you,

409
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:45,090
that's not the case.

410
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:48,499
"A vengeful ghost"?

411
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,640
You deserve to be thrown
in a garbage truck.

412
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,979
I'll destroy you and turn you to ashes.

413
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:05,050
I hope you turn into trash
and head to your afterlife.

414
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:25,629
What was that?

415
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,439
What's protecting you?

416
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,109
My resentment is working.

417
00:39:32,694 --> 00:39:36,579
My hatred and curse are
making people go wild.

418
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:43,149
I will dedicate my life...

419
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:47,959
to cursing Ku Chan Seong,
the guy who ruined my life.

420
00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:51,189
(Complete)

421
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:52,899
(Your post has been uploaded.)

422
00:39:57,924 --> 00:39:59,565
(I hope he dies.)

423
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:02,269
(I curse him too.)

424
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:07,410
These people's ugly
thoughts and emotions...

425
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,180
must've given you a
hideous type of strength.

426
00:40:10,935 --> 00:40:13,220
Who are you to protect Chan Seong?

427
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:15,079
Shut it, you piece of trash.

428
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,350
You stink.

429
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:21,284
I'll get rid of this hideous power...

430
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:24,160
that's protecting you and
rip you into pieces.

431
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,859
You just wait.

432
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:31,169
I'm going to become even
more ugly and powerful.

433
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:59,015
I requested the Helllo website
to delete the post...

434
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:00,329
that Seol Ji Won uploaded.

435
00:41:00,884 --> 00:41:03,329
But we couldn't do
anything about the ones...

436
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:04,899
that already went viral on the web.

437
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:06,565
I'm sorry.

438
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,470
There's no need for you to apologize.

439
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:11,539
Is it okay if I go now?

440
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,180
Yes.

441
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:16,450
Excuse me, wait.

442
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,979
When you were at the wine bar,

443
00:41:20,775 --> 00:41:22,680
did you happen to be with
another woman by any chance?

444
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:25,490
The thing is,

445
00:41:26,344 --> 00:41:28,915
I got a call from the wine bar.

446
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:32,789
And the woman who called told me
that she's the late Lee Do Yeon.

447
00:41:34,154 --> 00:41:36,495
I know it doesn't make sense,
but I was just wondering...

448
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:37,669
It could've been her.

449
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,539
I believe that souls exist.

450
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:44,340
I also believe in reincarnation.

451
00:41:45,265 --> 00:41:47,740
Oh, reincarnation? I see.

452
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:51,979
You draw very well.

453
00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:55,079
You must be quite dexterous.

454
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:56,850
Thank you.

455
00:41:58,745 --> 00:41:59,859
I'll be off now.

456
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:17,340
Seol Ji Won...

457
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:19,680
died.

458
00:42:19,864 --> 00:42:20,979
I know.

459
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:22,709
I met his soul.

460
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:29,220
He has become a vengeful ghost, and
he holds resentment toward you.

461
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:33,220
Yes, I know. I read the post he uploaded.

462
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:36,660
I'm quite shocked at how
much support he got.

463
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:40,999
Darn it.

464
00:42:41,484 --> 00:42:44,269
I should've turned him to
ashes the moment he died.

465
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:47,140
I should've brought a gun
instead of a folding fan.

466
00:42:47,924 --> 00:42:49,709
Was he strong enough to escape from you?

467
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,669
I want to act like it's not a big deal,

468
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:53,840
but it is a big deal.

469
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:57,410
Chan Seong.

470
00:42:58,074 --> 00:42:59,919
Don't go home until we catch him.

471
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,649
Stay right by my side.

472
00:43:12,515 --> 00:43:15,499
Do you think Ms. Jang will ban
me from coming here again?

473
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:17,600
She probably forgot about it already.

474
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:20,665
Mr. Ku turned out to be okay,
so everything will be fine.

475
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,364
- Really?
- Of course.

476
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:24,395
But thanks to you, our hotel guests...

477
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:26,979
were able to reveal their wrongful deaths.

478
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:29,039
Good job, Yu Na.

479
00:43:30,404 --> 00:43:32,309
Gosh, what a relief.

480
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:37,590
We got a new guest last night, and
she asked if she could meet you.

481
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,519
What?

482
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:53,200
You're that woman.

483
00:43:57,364 --> 00:44:00,640
Thank you for following
me until the very end.

484
00:44:10,145 --> 00:44:13,260
(Jung Su Jung)

485
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,430
This is where I actually am.

486
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:22,030
But I was too scared to come here.
This is my first time.

487
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:24,870
I got murdered as well.

488
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,740
And I feel like I consoled myself...

489
00:44:29,395 --> 00:44:31,669
by helping out with the murder incident.

490
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,149
I secretly brought it
from the hotel garden.

491
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:42,620
Let's put this inside.

492
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:46,859
- Hyun Joong.
- Yes?

493
00:44:47,245 --> 00:44:50,729
Where are you buried?

494
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:53,030
Somewhere in the mountain.

495
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:56,059
I don't have a grave.

496
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:01,939
Then let's share this space together.

497
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:14,280
That's me.

498
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:18,120
I was just practicing drawing portraits.

499
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:31,129
This is our grave now.

500
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:33,269
Do you like it?

501
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:35,370
Don't you like it?

502
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,169
Well, then... Just forget it.

503
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:41,715
I already told you that I like you,

504
00:45:41,715 --> 00:45:43,060
but you ignored it.

505
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:44,849
I didn't ignore it.

506
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:48,479
Yu Na.

507
00:45:49,174 --> 00:45:50,820
Your boyfriend...

508
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,289
should be someone kind...

509
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:57,159
and alive.

510
00:45:57,415 --> 00:45:58,530
That's why...

511
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:11,610
I like you.

512
00:46:13,665 --> 00:46:15,679
Can't you just like me too?

513
00:46:42,825 --> 00:46:44,039
Chan Seong.

514
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:47,440
Wake up.

515
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:14,599
Why are you sleeping in
this uncomfortable place?

516
00:47:15,424 --> 00:47:17,794
The only rooms I can sleep
in at this hotel...

517
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,909
is Room 404 and yours.

518
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,634
If I end up in Incheon after
sleeping in Room 404,

519
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:24,035
I'll have a hard time coming back to work.

520
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:25,575
Who told you to sleep in Room 404?

521
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:27,220
I told you to sleep in my room.

522
00:47:27,504 --> 00:47:29,404
Do you know how quickly
you can fall asleep...

523
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:31,774
with that massager and sleep mask?

524
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:34,659
Do you think I'll be able to
fall asleep in your room...

525
00:47:34,944 --> 00:47:36,260
even if I had that massager?

526
00:47:38,915 --> 00:47:42,659
You're right. After all,
you are a healthy man.

527
00:47:44,955 --> 00:47:48,470
Gosh, humans need to sleep well.

528
00:47:48,964 --> 00:47:50,170
Too bad for you.

529
00:47:52,365 --> 00:47:53,539
Let's go, then.

530
00:47:54,064 --> 00:47:56,440
Let me sleep comfortably in your room.

531
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:59,650
I don't need that massager.
I'd rather have your arm.

532
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:01,979
If you let me use your arm as a pillow,

533
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:03,889
what use is a sleep mask?

534
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,720
You can stroke my hair.

535
00:48:06,575 --> 00:48:07,720
So that I can...

536
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:09,659
fall asleep.

537
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:12,190
What's wrong with you, you pervert?

538
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:16,300
Cool it down.

539
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,820
You cool it down. You're blushing.

540
00:48:36,645 --> 00:48:38,720
I feel so stiff. Maybe I
should try that massager.

541
00:48:41,245 --> 00:48:42,360
Gosh...

542
00:48:42,944 --> 00:48:45,829
I am not blushing...

543
00:48:47,254 --> 00:48:48,400
Chan Seong.

544
00:48:49,024 --> 00:48:51,329
Forget that massager.
Let's go get acupuncture.

545
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,495
- What?
- Let's get acupuncture...

546
00:48:53,495 --> 00:48:55,125
and cupping therapy to let some blood out.

547
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,539
I know a good oriental clinic.

548
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:01,179
There's a famous doctor who can
even bring a dead person back.

549
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:05,674
You did a great job, ma'am!

550
00:49:05,674 --> 00:49:06,880
(Hyosaeng Oriental Clinic)

551
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,774
Be sure to come in daily
to get acupuncture.

552
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:11,415
Doctor, your herbal
medicine is too expensive.

553
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,590
It's only because it's that effective.

554
00:49:14,645 --> 00:49:17,154
And I even gave you some
free samples as well!

555
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:18,260
Thank you.

556
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:22,599
You mean that doctor brought
back a dead person?

557
00:49:22,984 --> 00:49:26,030
He's keeping someone who should
have died three years ago alive.

558
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,725
He must be an amazing doctor.

559
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:30,070
Take care, ma'am.

560
00:49:32,365 --> 00:49:33,809
Was he Hua Tuo?

561
00:49:33,935 --> 00:49:35,265
I don't know.

562
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:36,935
Ma'am, don't hesitate.

563
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:38,875
Take it with your family members.

564
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,749
I'll give you ten percent off.

565
00:49:41,904 --> 00:49:42,904
I'll need to think about it.

566
00:49:42,904 --> 00:49:44,774
All right, ma'am.

567
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,249
Take care.

568
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:49,944
Keep recommending it to her.

569
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:51,490
He seems...

570
00:49:52,154 --> 00:49:54,959
a bit greedy, though, like someone I know.

571
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,700
You have a guest, honey.

572
00:49:59,754 --> 00:50:01,294
Thank you for coming.

573
00:50:01,294 --> 00:50:02,900
Please follow me.

574
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:06,395
You don't look too good.

575
00:50:06,395 --> 00:50:07,909
She must be his wife.

576
00:50:08,134 --> 00:50:09,334
They look alike.

577
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:13,010
Anyway, we have to take the patient
he's been keeping alive...

578
00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:14,404
back to our hotel.

579
00:50:14,404 --> 00:50:16,504
But isn't the patient still alive?

580
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:18,050
How are we supposed to
take them as a guest?

581
00:50:19,174 --> 00:50:20,420
By killing, of course.

582
00:50:21,015 --> 00:50:23,159
The Grim Reaper told me to
make sure to kill the patient.

583
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,130
You even run errands for the Grim Reaper?

584
00:50:28,055 --> 00:50:29,559
It's not an errand!

585
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:31,329
It's a deal.

586
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:34,440
I need you to take care of someone for me.

587
00:50:35,194 --> 00:50:37,365
I want your help.

588
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:39,769
If it's someone you can't
handle on your own,

589
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,179
It must be a difficult one.

590
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:44,510
He holds a deep grudge against,

591
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,079
so one of my people could get
hurt if I'm not cautious.

592
00:50:50,674 --> 00:50:53,389
Quietly bring him to me.

593
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,159
It's your request.

594
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:58,329
How can I reject it?

595
00:51:01,384 --> 00:51:05,269
But you'll need to do me a favor as well.

596
00:51:16,904 --> 00:51:18,209
Go on.

597
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,320
There's someone who's
been causing me trouble.

598
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:24,050
It's an unsolved case
that has disgraced me.

599
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:27,119
If you bring that person to Hotel Del Luna,

600
00:51:27,645 --> 00:51:29,090
I'll bring that vengeful spirit...

601
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,459
to you.

602
00:51:34,285 --> 00:51:35,360
Deal.

603
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,570
Is Seol Ji Won that dangerous?

604
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:45,740
The reason an ill-fated
spirit is haunting you...

605
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:47,880
may be my fault.

606
00:51:49,104 --> 00:51:50,610
Ma Go told me that...

607
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:53,820
you made the flowers bloom, so
you will have to pay a price.

608
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:56,619
The price I have to pay for
making the flowers bloom...

609
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,314
is having a vengeful spirit haunt me?

610
00:51:59,314 --> 00:52:02,214
I don't want you to have to pay the price,

611
00:52:02,214 --> 00:52:05,760
so I will take care of what I can.

612
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:09,800

- Here.
- Please come in.

Is my job to see how
good of a doctor he is?

617
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,050
Take this with you. Tell
him this is why you came.

618
00:52:33,544 --> 00:52:36,984
The hepatization slowed down
your stomach contractions,

619
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:40,884
which is why you have
indigestion and heartburn.

620
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:42,599
It must be due to stress.

621
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:46,895
Yes. I do have a lot on my mind lately.

622
00:52:46,895 --> 00:52:48,194
Is that so?

623
00:52:48,194 --> 00:52:50,935
You can get acupuncture
treatment and some medicine.

624
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:54,904
It's best if you take
my herbal medicine too.

625
00:52:54,904 --> 00:52:57,880
I don't need acupuncture or medicine.

626
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,479
The reason for my stress is money.

627
00:53:02,205 --> 00:53:03,280
That's why...

628
00:53:03,944 --> 00:53:05,944
I came here after seeing this.
I need the money.

This is your number, right?

632
00:53:16,854 --> 00:53:20,200
We were running short on time.
What a relief.

633
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:23,570
I need to check something.

634
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:33,110
Your palm lines look good.

635
00:53:34,004 --> 00:53:35,880
You have a good lifeline, too.

636
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:43,115
Give me 1cm of your lifeline.

637
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:44,659
If you sell me your lifeline,

638
00:53:46,254 --> 00:53:47,900
I will give you 50,000 dollars.

He buys other people's lifelines...

641
00:53:56,696 --> 00:53:59,142
and keeps a person who
should be dead alive?

642
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:01,882
I guess that doctor really is great.

643
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,437
Is it possible to buy other
people's lifelines with money?

644
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:07,747
Well, if it was a fair deal.

645
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:09,981
It's not like it was a
fraud, and he pays well.

646
00:54:10,676 --> 00:54:12,722
So that's why the Gream
Reaper couldn't do anything.

647
00:54:16,346 --> 00:54:19,857
The person who sold it wouldn't
have thought it was for real.

648
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,702
They would've thought it was easy money.

649
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,802
Only the buyer is desperate.

650
00:54:24,857 --> 00:54:27,842
I guess he uses it to make more money.

651
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:30,642
Do you think he sells it to wealthy people?

652
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:35,182
Important people, I suppose.

653
00:54:35,736 --> 00:54:38,477

654
00:54:38,477 --> 00:54:40,477
so let's feed you some meat. Let's go.

655
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,421
No, you're just craving meat.

656
00:54:43,276 --> 00:54:44,317
There's...

657
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:46,121
A restaurant Kim Joon Hyun
dined at around here.

658
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:49,421
I know, I know. Let's go.

659
00:54:57,696 --> 00:54:59,831
I got someone to sell his lifeline.

660
00:55:00,026 --> 00:55:02,842
I was very worried because the
one who promised me backed out.

661
00:55:04,696 --> 00:55:05,811
What a relief.

662
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,041
That means you have to spend...

663
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:10,782
all the money you've saved up so far.

664
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:15,521
Money isn't the problem.

665
00:55:15,707 --> 00:55:18,291
As long as I can save
him, that's all right.

666
00:55:19,046 --> 00:55:20,662
But you worked so hard to earn that money.

667
00:55:22,187 --> 00:55:23,932
The surgery is today.

668
00:55:25,057 --> 00:55:26,392
I must take a look.

670
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:02,702
You can get surgery today.

671
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:10,912
It's a boy?

672
00:56:11,866 --> 00:56:12,972
Yes.

673
00:56:13,196 --> 00:56:15,012
The life we must put an
end on and take away...

674
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,282
is the couple's son.

675
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:26,892
I didn't know Man Weol
could look so stunning.

676
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:29,546
Once the flowers fall off,

677
00:56:29,546 --> 00:56:32,092
will that be the end of the Moon Tree?

678
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:33,961
Yes.

679
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,932
That means the death of Man Weol...

680
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,572
whom I have chained to this tree.

681
00:56:41,997 --> 00:56:46,171
Man Weol will finally be
able to go to the afterlife.

682
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,311
It's been too long...

683
00:56:49,966 --> 00:56:52,182
for Man Weol who has
blossomed to the fullest...

684
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:58,092
and for that guy who had to remain...

685
00:56:59,676 --> 00:57:00,921
as a small light.

686
00:57:13,857 --> 00:57:17,041
He turned back when I was
accompanying him to the afterlife.

687
00:57:19,397 --> 00:57:21,612
He managed to stay here
for such a long time.

688
00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:47,671
You should...

689
00:57:49,196 --> 00:57:50,472
get going too.

690
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,662
Live your life as a traitor.

691
00:58:48,687 --> 00:58:50,262
That way, Man Weol can live.

692
00:59:18,256 --> 00:59:20,492
I let him be because you
told me not to take him.

693
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:23,156
It is quite impressive that...

694
00:59:23,156 --> 00:59:26,771
a spirit of a human can remain
for this long as a small light.

695
00:59:27,596 --> 00:59:29,972
It's a curse he cast upon himself.

696
00:59:30,796 --> 00:59:32,112
He's...

697
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:36,311
staying here as a small light
because of the promise...

698
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,412
he made to Man Weol.

Ms. Jang...

00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:44,552

order to lessen the burden...

701
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,552
on Ku Chan Seong for making
her flowers blossom.

702
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:51,662
It sounds like Man Weol doesn't know...

703
00:59:52,616 --> 00:59:56,132
the price Chan Seong has to pay yet.

704
00:59:58,196 --> 00:59:59,731
Once she finds out,

705
01:00:00,557 --> 01:00:02,572
she will be sad...

706
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,711
and scared.

Are you nervous that he
might take your lifeline?

709
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,311
I guess you must want to live a long life.

710

Don't worry. You'll live a long life.

his parents must have felt...

to have bought someone else's lifeline...

713

01:01:15,736 --> 01:01:17,711
I'm just protecting your lifeline.

716
01:01:22,506 --> 01:01:24,351
I'm sure they don't want
to let go of their son.

717
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:28,762
They must be desperate to hold onto him.

718
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,871
You're here already.

719
01:01:45,537 --> 01:01:46,941
Let's go to the treatment room.

720
01:01:54,776 --> 01:01:57,006
It will neither hurt nor harm you.

721
01:01:57,006 --> 01:01:58,722
I'll only cut off 1cm.

722
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:06,691
Are you cutting lifelines...

723
01:02:08,326 --> 01:02:09,802
to give to your child?

724
01:02:14,796 --> 01:02:18,512
Earlier today, I heard
that you have a sick son.

725
01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:29,021
My son was severely ill.

726
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:34,151
After hearing about the
lifeline surgery overseas,

727
01:02:34,446 --> 01:02:36,992
I tried it out because
I had nothing to lose.

728
01:02:39,216 --> 01:02:42,601
Like a miracle, my son lived.

729
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:45,972
Both of you are still young.

730
01:02:47,926 --> 01:02:49,441
It must've been quite an ordeal for you.

731
01:02:51,236 --> 01:02:52,541
My son is young,

732
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,311
but my wife and I look quite old.

733
01:02:57,676 --> 01:02:58,811
People think...

734
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,121
we are his grandparents.

735
01:04:02,636 --> 01:04:03,742
Hello?

736
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,052
("Demian")

737
01:04:07,846 --> 01:04:09,121
Were you reading a book?

738
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:12,542
That's a hard book.

739
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,312
It's not that hard.

740
01:04:15,637 --> 01:04:19,212
Right. I like it when
people brag because...

741
01:04:19,706 --> 01:04:20,882
they are indeed intelligent.

742
01:04:21,577 --> 01:04:22,781
I like you.

743
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:26,022
Ma'am, are you the Grim Reaper?

744
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:29,451
On the days I had surgery,

745
01:04:29,746 --> 01:04:33,062
I always saw a man dressed
in a black suit in my dream.

746
01:04:36,057 --> 01:04:40,002
He and I have totally different
themes for our black outfits.

747
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:41,801
He's just wearing black clothes.

748
01:04:42,097 --> 01:04:45,672
And I'm wearing midnight black
with a hint of dark blue.

749
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:50,212
Midnight black and black are the same.

750
01:04:50,697 --> 01:04:51,812
Really?

751
01:04:52,566 --> 01:04:53,681
Whatever.

752
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:56,781
I am here to do something
similar as he does.

753
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:01,551
I can't take you against your will.

754
01:05:02,376 --> 01:05:05,287
You're a smart boy, so you can hear me out,

755
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:07,022
think about it, and make a decision.

756
01:05:12,157 --> 01:05:13,632
You do know that...

757
01:05:14,287 --> 01:05:17,071
your mom and dad suddenly
aged a lot, don't you?

758
01:05:26,237 --> 01:05:28,181
Is it because of this?

759
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:33,152
Yes.

760
01:05:34,677 --> 01:05:36,321
What they've attached there is...

761
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:39,761
the lives of your mom and dad.

762
01:05:41,356 --> 01:05:43,092
You paid the price,

763
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:46,902
so your desperation to
save your child was heard.

764
01:05:47,557 --> 01:05:49,232
You didn't buy someone else's life.

765
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:52,442
You gave your lives to your child.

766
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:54,471
That's why you two have aged a lot quicker.

767
01:05:56,496 --> 01:05:59,482
I am not sure what you know,

768
01:05:59,867 --> 01:06:03,237
but if my son lives, I
don't care what it takes.

769
01:06:03,237 --> 01:06:06,752
Sadly, the child will have
to make the decision.

770
01:06:08,717 --> 01:06:10,292
Once he makes the decision,

771
01:06:12,617 --> 01:06:13,922
you must let him go.

772
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:43,852
Hyun Jin!

773
01:06:46,847 --> 01:06:49,387
- Wake up.
- Hyun Jin.

774
01:06:49,387 --> 01:06:51,962
What's wrong with him, honey?

775
01:06:52,027 --> 01:06:53,132
Hyun Jin.

776
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:55,326
Honey, what's wrong with him?

777
01:06:55,326 --> 01:06:58,701
No, not yet, honey. What's wrong with him?

778
01:06:58,727 --> 01:06:59,802
Honey.

779
01:07:00,397 --> 01:07:02,196
No. Hyun Jin, no.

780
01:07:02,196 --> 01:07:04,811
No, wake up. Hyun Jin!

781
01:08:04,257 --> 01:08:06,302
I'm glad you resolved this.

782
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,411
If you had arrived there any later,

783
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:11,212
I would have had to take
away all three of them.

784
01:08:12,107 --> 01:08:13,241
His parents...

785
01:08:14,536 --> 01:08:17,212
may have wanted that.

786
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:21,392
If I go with you,

787
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:25,392
it'll be more painful for my mom and dad.

788
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:29,832
That's not for you to worry about.

789
01:08:30,757 --> 01:08:32,262
It's for those who are left behind.

790
01:08:51,906 --> 01:08:53,121
But...

791
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:58,121
I'm really afraid of that.

792
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:22,512
"Afraid".

793
01:09:30,647 --> 01:09:31,892
Do not be afraid.

794
01:09:32,546 --> 01:09:35,792
I will find the vengeful
spirit just as I promised.

795
01:09:40,227 --> 01:09:41,332
Okay.

796
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:44,602
Find that in a hurry so that no
one won't be scared anymore.

797
01:10:01,977 --> 01:10:03,722
Even if it means I must give everything,

798
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:06,491
I still cannot let go of this.

799
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:19,597
After I, it's N, E, S, S, not Y.

800
01:10:19,597 --> 01:10:21,142
- Isn't this right?
- Come.

801
01:10:31,746 --> 01:10:34,347
- You did that on purpose, right?
- Pushing on that won't help.

802
01:10:34,347 --> 01:10:36,677
What does that look like to you?

803
01:10:36,677 --> 01:10:40,462
The intern and the reception
are dating at work.

804
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:42,191
My goodness.

805
01:10:42,517 --> 01:10:45,462
She just started here. I can't
believe they're dating already.

806
01:10:45,557 --> 01:10:47,201
They're young.

807
01:10:47,387 --> 01:10:49,802
A man and a woman are bound to hit
it off when they're together.

808
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,472
I guess it doesn't matter if
it's this world or the other.

809
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:54,042
Goodness.

810
01:10:55,196 --> 01:10:59,182
We've been together for 200 years,
but we're still very professional.

811
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:03,451
It wouldn't happen even after 2,000 years.

812
01:11:03,477 --> 01:11:05,576
You aren't my type.

813
01:11:05,576 --> 01:11:07,406
Not even in your dreams.

814
01:11:07,406 --> 01:11:09,792
My dream? I didn't dream anything.

815
01:11:10,477 --> 01:11:11,592
Hear me out before you go.

816
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,691
I don't like you either.

817
01:11:33,866 --> 01:11:35,012
You're back already?

818
01:11:36,706 --> 01:11:37,781
Yes.

819
01:11:52,227 --> 01:11:56,371
Did Sanchez go crazy after
he went to the funeral?

820
01:11:56,757 --> 01:11:57,832
What's with him?

821
01:12:02,996 --> 01:12:04,571
Actually, there's a story.

822
01:12:07,736 --> 01:12:09,151
How did the funeral go?

823
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,281
You should have stayed longer.

824
01:12:11,746 --> 01:12:12,981
I couldn't.

825
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:16,621
Veronica is still at your hotel.

826
01:12:20,746 --> 01:12:21,892
Am I right, Chan Seong?

827
01:12:23,717 --> 01:12:24,962
She's still there, isn't she?

828
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:31,172
He sounded so desperate,
so I couldn't tell him no.

829
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:34,326
He accepted that he cannot
come to the hotel...

830
01:12:34,326 --> 01:12:36,311
or see her even if he comes there.

831
01:12:38,706 --> 01:12:39,981
He thinks she's still here,

832
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:43,052
even though he cannot see her.

833
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:48,292
I'll have a talk with him,
so please just play along.

834
01:12:48,347 --> 01:12:49,691
Just until he gets better.

835
01:12:49,847 --> 01:12:51,422
When will he get better?

836
01:13:06,727 --> 01:13:09,441
Man Weol, thank you for
what you did last time.

837
01:13:11,906 --> 01:13:13,182
I said goodbye to her thanks to you.

838
01:13:16,777 --> 01:13:19,451
I'm making something that Veronica liked.

839
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:22,491
She loved it whenever I cooked for her.

840
01:13:23,116 --> 01:13:25,021
Can you bring it over?

841
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:29,432
Sure, let's do that.

842
01:13:32,586 --> 01:13:33,762
Chan Seong.

843
01:13:34,897 --> 01:13:37,371
You're really bad at acting.

844
01:13:38,196 --> 01:13:39,701
If you're going to do it, do it right.

845
01:13:43,996 --> 01:13:47,111
Sanchez, do you have anything
else other than pizza for her?

846
01:13:47,467 --> 01:13:51,722
You know, the shoes or jewelry
that Veronica used to like.

847
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:53,451
Oh, I can take a car too.

848
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:56,717
Can you really take it to her?

849
01:13:56,717 --> 01:13:59,821
Of course, bring everything.
I'll take anything for her.

850
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:02,857
Oh, there is a sea in my hotel.

851
01:14:02,857 --> 01:14:03,887
Do you want to give me the yacht too?

852
01:14:03,887 --> 01:14:07,231
It would be great if she plays
on that yacht at the hotel.

853
01:14:07,656 --> 01:14:09,432
- Ms. Jang.
- What?

854
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:13,701
I'm comforting him.

855
01:14:15,437 --> 01:14:17,911
If Sanchez doesn't get better soon,

856
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,811
I'll end up taking his fortune.

857
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,551
- Why are you doing this?
- It's because of you.

858
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:41,175
It's because you didn't tell him the truth.

859
01:14:41,175 --> 01:14:43,021
I'm trying to comfort him
because he's in pain.

860
01:14:43,415 --> 01:14:44,715
Do you find that silly?

861
01:14:44,715 --> 01:14:47,030
Yes, it's ridiculous to me.

862
01:14:47,856 --> 01:14:50,625
Parents who buy lifelines to
attach on their-almost dead son...

863
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:53,330
and your friend who's making
pizza for his dead girlfriend.

864
01:14:54,596 --> 01:14:56,000
They are all a nuisance.

865
01:15:01,266 --> 01:15:04,040
When I'm watching that, their
pathetic lives infuriate me.

866
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:06,381
Don't you dare turn into them.

867
01:15:11,476 --> 01:15:13,450
Why do you assume that I
won't be just like them?

868
01:15:16,116 --> 01:15:17,391
I don't want to let you go.

869
01:15:18,686 --> 01:15:19,856
I don't want to send you off.

870
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:22,101
The thought of not being able
to see you drives me crazy.

871
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:24,601
How...

872
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:29,471
How could you tell me to be okay?

873
01:15:37,736 --> 01:15:39,981
You're the one who must send me off.

874
01:15:41,575 --> 01:15:42,950
Tell me that you'll be okay.

875
01:15:54,186 --> 01:15:56,200
If you don't tell me you'll be okay,

876
01:15:58,285 --> 01:15:59,570
I'll be...

877
01:16:02,295 --> 01:16:03,641
too scared.

878
01:16:14,005 --> 01:16:15,150
A long time ago,

879
01:16:17,476 --> 01:16:19,721
I told you that I was afraid
of paying the price...

880
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:23,620
if I did stay by your
side and look after you.

881
01:16:28,986 --> 01:16:30,601
This must be what I have meant.

882
01:16:35,566 --> 01:16:37,471
Becoming a nuisance...

883
01:16:39,965 --> 01:16:41,811
that you despise.

884
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,120
Go.

885
01:16:52,715 --> 01:16:54,591
I'll go to my friend.

886
01:18:02,215 --> 01:18:03,391
She's not there anymore.

887
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:06,761
Veronica isn't there, is she?

888
01:18:58,465 --> 01:19:00,481
Your flowers will begin to wilt...

889
01:19:01,135 --> 01:19:03,221
when you become afraid.

890
01:19:46,056 --> 01:19:47,960
When I first met you,

891
01:19:51,085 --> 01:19:54,000
the flowers around here had
blossomed beautifully.

892
01:19:59,665 --> 01:20:01,540
Now, all of them are gone.

893
01:20:06,776 --> 01:20:07,910
That day,

894
01:20:09,075 --> 01:20:12,391
you were utterly scared
after seeing a ghost.

895
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:21,931
Today, I'm the scared one.

896
01:20:31,465 --> 01:20:32,671
The flowers...

897
01:20:37,406 --> 01:20:38,750
are falling off the tree.

898
01:20:52,785 --> 01:20:53,960
I see.

899
01:20:58,455 --> 01:21:00,801
The petals don't even remain in this world.

900
01:21:05,266 --> 01:21:07,540
They vanish even before
touching the ground.

901
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:17,381
My guess is that...

902
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:22,891
nothing will remain.

903
01:21:28,056 --> 01:21:29,261
Perhaps,

904
01:21:32,825 --> 01:21:34,971
the flowers falling off your tree...

905
01:21:38,066 --> 01:21:40,441
might be falling onto me...

906
01:21:42,665 --> 01:21:45,110
just like the first leaf did.

907
01:21:52,816 --> 01:21:54,421
And those petals have made a pile.

908
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:58,790
So it's gotten heavier...

909
01:22:01,085 --> 01:22:02,360
and painful to carry.

910
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:09,601
I'll consider shouldering the
pile as solely my responsibility.

911
01:22:17,505 --> 01:22:18,610
So...

912
01:22:23,276 --> 01:22:25,320
don't be afraid when you leave me behind.

913
01:22:38,925 --> 01:22:40,030
What I'm doing now...

914
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:44,341
is an act of love...

915
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,011
by a fragile human...

916
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:00,650
with all of his heart.

917
01:23:23,906 --> 01:23:26,381
It's heartbreaking if I remain
only as a flower petal...

918
01:23:29,075 --> 01:23:30,580
that's bound to vanish.
