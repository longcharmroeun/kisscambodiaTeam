00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,323
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:18,763
My gosh, are you that sleepy?

3
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,813
- Is it the intern?
- Yes.

4
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:34,483
Yu Na needs to get her homework done,

5
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,383
and I was waking her up because
she told me that she was sleepy.

6
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,083
Hyun Joong.

7
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,749
Does Yu Na know that you're
planning to leave...

8
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:49,724
with your younger sister after she dies?

9
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,163
No, she doesn't know that yet.

10
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,434
I only told her that I'm waiting for her.

11
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,934
I see.

12
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:10,943
- Welcome.
- Welcome, sir.

13
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,493
Do you remember how long
it's been since you died?

14
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,293
I can't remember for sure.

15
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,493
But it's been about two days.

16
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:24,564
- Then...
- Sir.

17
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:27,734
Let me escort you.

18
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,303
Come this way.

19
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,014
Sir.

20
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,353
Are you Yoon Seung Beom,

21
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:48,154
the eldest grandson of the
Myeongju Yoon family...

22
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,124
who used to live in Beomcheon City?

23
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:52,353
And you're 42 years old?

24
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,163
Yes, that's right.

25
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,564
You're still single, aren't you?

26
00:01:58,858 --> 00:01:59,993
Yes.

27
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:03,103
I wasn't able to get married.

28
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,833
I see.

29
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,173
Your family must be devastated...

30
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,513
since the succeeding grandson
of the family died...

31
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:20,184
without even having any children.

32
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:33,133
Ms. Choi.

33
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,103
I thought you were Ms. Jang for a second.

34
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,703
Why are you all dressed up?

35
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:41,103
Mr. Kim, I think I'll be
able to leave here soon.

36
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:43,974
I'm on my way to relieve my
200-year-long resentment.

37
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,113
Are you saying...

38
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:49,214
He's dead.

39
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,109
The very last son of that family died...

40
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,624
and came here as a guest.

41
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,953
The family tree...

42
00:02:56,848 --> 00:03:00,353
of that darn family has
finally come to an end.

43
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,088
I'm on my way to his funeral...

44
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:04,733
so I can witness the
Myeongju Yoon family...

45
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,263
shed tears of blood.

46
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,203
Ms. Choi.

47
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,934
You can't cause an incident...

48
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:15,344
like 42 years ago.

49
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,543
I went there because I
was furious, but now,

50
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,943
I'm going there because I'm happy.

51
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,823
Sanchez is still at the restaurant.

52
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,658
So all I need to do is face Sanchez...

53
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:40,834
and say that I'm sorry, right?

54
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:45,374
I can be so much more apologetic
with a shot of alcohol.

55
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:47,943
This is sparkling water.

56
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:51,274
Pretend it's champagne and drink it.

57
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:00,154
It's quite bubbly. Do you have soju?

58
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,684
Mix some soju in it. Let's
see if it's any good.

59
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,953
If it's good, you will drink this...

60
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:06,979
instead of champagne.

61
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,818
Taking away champagne and caviar from me...

62
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:12,733
is the same thing as taking away the
hot sauce and pickles for pizza.

63
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,203
The mention of pizza is making
me worry about Sanchez now.

64
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,173
All right. Fine. Let's go shopping.

65
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,559
Let's go before the
department store closes.

66
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,769
Why is this conversation
ending with shopping?

67
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:23,899
I'm supposed to apologize to him.

68
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,269
Instead of going there
empty-handed and saying,

69
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,944
"I'm sorry, Sanchez",

70
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,369
buying something beautiful...

71
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,113
and saying, "I'm sorry, Sanchez"...

72
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,884
will be completely different.

73
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,454
Just tell me you want to go shopping.

74
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,394
All you need to say to Sanchez...

75
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,519
is Veronica left this world
and you saw her off...

76
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,894
at the bridge to the afterlife.

77
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,194
"The bridge to the afterlife"?

78
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,189
How could I see her off at the bridge...

79
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,363
I haven't been to myself?

80
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,704
You've never been to the
bridge over the Sanzu River?

81
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:56,574
I wouldn't be here if I had been there.

82
00:04:57,369 --> 00:04:59,369
The moment you step foot on the bridge,

83
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:01,444
it's impossible to return from it.

84
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,809
Well, I can tell him that his girlfriend...

85
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:08,784
is crossing that bridge right about now.

86
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,353
She's still on the bridge?

87
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,154
Is the bridge that long?

88
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:17,293
Time runs at a different speed there.

89
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:21,094
The brief moment they cross the
bridge to be at the afterlife...

90
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,233
takes about 49 days in this world.

91
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,474
While the deceased cross the bridge,

92
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:28,344
they forget their memories
in this world one by one.

93
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:31,613
It's not that they are forced
to stay in the afterlife.

94
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:35,944
They don't come back because all
of their memories are gone.

95
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,884
I'm pretty sure Sanchez's girlfriend
is crossing the bridge right now...

96
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:46,094
and memories about him are
getting erased one by one.

97
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,163
It's a bitter story...

98
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,733
for those left behind.

99
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,043
Chan Seong.

100
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,214
I can promise you one thing.

101
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,183
I'm 1,300 years old.

102
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,353
And when I end up crossing that bridge,

103
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,654
a lot of my memories will disappear.

104
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,253
But I'll keep the memories
of you to the end.

105
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,834
Well, I can't promise that I'll
remember you in the afterlife.

106
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,503
But until I take my last
step on the bridge,

107
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,834
I'll remember you.

108
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,623
Okay.

109
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,264
I'm sure you can do it given
your experience of 1,300 years.

110
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:58,363
I'll believe in you.

111
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:07,603
But what will you remember me by?

112
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:13,069
You were worried on many accounts
that I might reincarnate...

113
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,274
as a dog or a pig.

114
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,968
You sold off all of my cars,
stopped me from buying yachts,

115
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,353
and took away my cards.

116
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:21,778
You made a ridiculous suggestion...

117
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:23,284
of changing sparkling water into champagne.

118
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,863
My gosh, I can only remember
these absurd incidents.

119
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,224
I've done a lot for you.

120
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:34,928
And I won't be able to forget
about especially your bragging.

121
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,858
I might remember the word, "Harvard",

122
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,034
instead of your name, "Ku Chan
Seong" in my last moment.

123
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:46,444
This is mine.

124
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:50,884
Yes, I was going to order it again
since you liked the fragrance.

125
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,353
The seller disappeared.

126
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,983
I brought it, so I can look into it.

127
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,123
All right. I thought you
stole it from the hotel.

128
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,154
That might be the case.

129
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,694
Look around to see if any of this
stuff is yours just in case.

130
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:06,964
Did you really steal from my hotel?

131
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,774
Look thoroughly if you see your stuff here.

132
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:27,753
It's right here. It's yours.

133
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,224
I'm going to stamp this
memory in your head.

134
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,434
I like it when you remember me by
Harvard, nasty manager, and such,

135
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:39,733
but...

136
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,964
don't forget a man who's
smiling at you now.

137
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:56,483
Yes.

138
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,314
Remember these moments.

139
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:10,564
It looks like Sanchez
will be coming home late.

140
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:13,294
We should go to him.

141
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,743
This is Hyun Joong.

142
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,523
Ever since a man came into
the hotel as our guest,

143
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:37,983
Ms. Choi didn't look so good.

144
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,393
I found out that the guest
was the last son...

145
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,194
of Ms. Choi's archenemy's family.

146
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:46,794
She went to that man's funeral?

147
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,194
Yes.

148
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,464
Mr. Kim was greatly worried too.

149
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,074
Ms. Jang.

150
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,003
A similar incident from 42
years ago won't happen, right?

151
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,513
What happened 42 years ago?

152
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,678
The maid supervisor, Choi Seo Hee,

153
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:08,383
left the hotel, almost became an
evil spirit, and ceased to exist.

154
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,879
That level-headed Ms. Choi?

155
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,224
Jerks from that darn family
messed with her daughter's grave,

156
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:17,224
which was her biggest grudge she held.

157
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,194
This is the site.

158
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:25,633
The grave of a girl who had passed
away on the 25th of this month...

159
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:28,298
will harm your family.

160
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:29,944
You must dig it out and get rid of it...

161
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:32,999
for your daughter-in-law to
give birth to a healthy baby...

162
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,613
who is in an inverted position now.

163
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:39,414
You're not supposed to mess
with an old grave of a girl.

164
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,408
My family's bloodline is about to run dry.

165
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,983
Dig out the grave.

166
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:01,903
Stop it.

167
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:07,044
Don't you dare touch my daughter's grave.

168
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,613
I curse all of your family...

169
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:16,623
to die.

170
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:22,064
I will make sure your
family tree ends here.

171
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,164
Die!

172
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,944
If she had faced Ma Go before the
Grim Reaper got a hold of her,

173
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,714
Ms. Choi would have ceased to exist.

174
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:46,914
That day, the Grim Reaper and
Ms. Jang worked out a nice deal,

175
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:49,278
so Ms. Choi didn't get
dragged to the afterlife...

176
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:51,184
and could continue to work at the hotel.

177
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:55,688
If I remember correctly, we gave the
flowers for 10 months for free.

178
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:56,763
12 months.

179
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,149
Right.

180
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,294
At the time, the flowers
didn't blossom in the garden.

181
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,129
The general manager before Ms. Hwang...

182
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,934
lost all of Ms. Jang's money.

183
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:06,574
We were the poorest then.

184
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,643
You know what Ms. Jang did?

185
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:13,974
Whenever I think about Ms. Jang
digging kudzu with a hoe...

186
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:17,444
Hey.

187
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,653
- Don't think about it.
- Okay.

188
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,778
The son who was born 42 years ago...

189
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,523
died without leaving behind a child.

190
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:26,448
Nothing will happen even if she meets
the people from that family...

191
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:27,653
at the funeral, right?

192
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,194
Her wish of 200 years would be fulfilled.

193
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,334
I doubt anything will happen.

194
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:36,863
Then, that means Ms. Choi will leave soon.

195
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:20,944
Are you finished?

196
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:23,914
The end has come to this family.

197
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:28,013
I'll now be able to leave
without any regrets.

198
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,603
You're here.

199
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:46,974
He's my baby's father.

200
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:51,373
I thought I should at least
come to say goodbye.

201
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,113
Didn't you say he was a bachelor?

202
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,184
I guess...

203
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:02,853
he left an offspring.

204
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:06,653
If the child in that
woman's stomach is a boy,

205
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,794
the name of Myeongju Yoon family...

206
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,164
will be carried on.

207
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,924
I'm sorry I left my post
unattended without informing you.

208
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,533
What happened?

209
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,834
A descendant of that family is still alive.

210
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:53,304
Ms. Choi...

211
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,633
Is there anyone inside?

212
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,003
A baby is dying. The door...

213
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,603
Please open the door!

214
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:32,844
Please open this door.

215
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:34,574
Please...

216
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,444
Please open the door.

217
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:41,353
No doctor will open their doors for you.

218
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,178
That baby must not live.

219
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,523
Mister...

220
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,023
Please save my child.

221
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,393
I checked with that guest named Mr. Yoon,

222
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,418
and a lover he broke up with
because of his parents...

223
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:23,493
is pregnant.

224
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,434
That's why he couldn't go
straight to the afterlife.

225
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:30,233
Ms. Choi must be disappointed.

226
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,334
I feel sorry for that man,

227
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,369
but no one can compare to Ms. Choi
who remains here for 200 years...

228
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,003
because of the sorrow of losing her child.

229
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,444
I know the flower is withering.

230
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:50,253
Can't it be stopped?

231
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:57,094
I think Ms. Choi is more
anxious than anyone.

232
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:04,903
I was really worried.

233
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:07,833
Did you think I'd harm someone?

234
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,803
I was worried you might get hurt.

235
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:14,843
It's not something you
should concern yourself.

236
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,553
Where did you get such a strange outfit?

237
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,253
It's a tiger.

238
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:31,793
Where did you find such a thing?

239
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,364
I got it as a gift, so I tried it on today.

240
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:35,904
What do you think?

241
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,503
You look funny. What on earth is that?

242
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,474
Hurry up and take it off.

243
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:45,343
I hear it's a brand name suit.

244
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,968
Who cares if it's a brand name suit?

245
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,938
You look like you are from the Serengeti.

246
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:51,839
Does it look that strange? I
guess I can't wear it out.

247
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,884
Of course not. Even our dead
guests will laugh at you.

248
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,478
Should I wear it when I see our guests off?

249
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,793
They can laugh on their way out.

250
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:04,924
Mr. Ku, you're bringing
down our hotel's class.

251
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,964
Right. Did the guest in room 403 leave yet?

252
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,733
I should see them off.

253
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,733
They mentioned that they want
to see you before they go.

254
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:16,003
Let's head to the platform.

255
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,343
You're not really going
to wear that, are you?

256
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:24,743
Let's go together, Ms. Choi.

257
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,154
Get away from me.

258
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:29,454
I think Mr. Ku decided to look funny...

259
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:33,493
to divert Ms. Choi and to help her relax.

260
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,394
He said he'd never wear it,

261
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,164
but he's using it like this.

262
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:39,918
Ms. Jang.

263
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,503
I looked into why my matchmaking
for Mr. Ku didn't work out,

264
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:46,003
and it turns out he has
someone he has his heart on.

265
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:50,474
Someone who won the heart of
such a man must be happy.

266
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:53,513
Yes. I'm happy.

267
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:55,813
Why are you happy?

268
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:02,379
Now that you know, don't do
something a crane would do.

269
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:05,149
I'm calling you a crane because you
hate being called a bird brain.

270
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:06,793
Don't act like a crane.

271
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,624
This must be a crane-like question,

272
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,394
but do you also feel...

273
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,063
You asked me if we can't stop
the flowers from falling.

274
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,763
That's not possible.

275
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,374
I wonder if it's because
I like him too much.

276
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,813
I just can't seem to stop it.

277
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,513
I feel sorry for you too, Mr. Kim.

278
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,654
A blossom falling because of love?

279
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,753
Should I give you a glass of Tears?

280
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:39,993
No.

281
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,224
I don't like it.

282
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,293
It tastes really bad.

283
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,674
She's someone consistently rude.

284
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,073
How did he change her?

285
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:07,553
Ku Chan Seong.

286
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:11,884
What is this? Why did you
get changed already?

287
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,354
I was going to save a
picture for the record.

288
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,323
Thanks to you, I was able to use it well.

289
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:20,789
However, I don't want to
leave a picture of it.

290
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,859
Why not? I thought it looked great on you.

291
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:27,559
I'll buy you a zebra-print suit next time.

292
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,704
Suit yourself. You can turn
me into a tiger or a zebra.

293
00:20:31,928 --> 00:20:33,174
You were really cool.

294
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,614
The tiger in front of Ms. Choi...

295
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,243
was cooler than the Baekdu tiger.

296
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:44,154
Ku Chan Seong, you're
an excellent hotelier.

297
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,364
I forgot...

298
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:54,018
that Ms. Choi is also a guest
who needs to be consoled...

299
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,533
in order for her to leave.

300
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:01,773
She's a long-term guest with
a deep-rooted resentment.

301
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:08,498
Her resentment which is
making her wait to see...

302
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:09,983
the end of the Yoon family...
might turn into a curse?

303
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:15,823
Just as she wanted, that
family is facing a problem.

304
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,493
I told you everything has a cost, right?

305
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,293
For making her feel so much sorrow,

306
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:25,563
they received a curse.

307
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,833
It's been 200 years already.

308
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,033
Time doesn't mean anything to the dead.

309
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:37,273
With such resentment, one
could spend 200 years,

310
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:39,914
500 years,

311
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,843
and even 1,000 years.

312
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,954
They wait for a long time...

313
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:26,654
not knowing when their
hearts will open up again.

314
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,023
I guess this could be
considered a curse too.

315
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,164
Are you...

316
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:39,104
still waiting for him to come?

317
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,773
Ku Chan Seong.

318
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,674
If he comes,

319
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,813
will you do what you did
for Ms. Choi for me too?

320
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,253
Will you become a tiger?

321
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,124
I told you to trust me.

322
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:01,253
Anything is possible...

323
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:04,894
since I'm yours.

324
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,263
Right.

325
00:23:11,629 --> 00:23:12,899
You wear that.

326
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:15,704
And we will go to eat
galbitang which tigers love.

327
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:17,674
You said tigers like red bean porridge.

328
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,938
- Who said that?
- You did.

329
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:21,214
That tigers love red bean porridge.

330
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:24,438
No tigers like red bean porridge.

331
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:25,614
Are they vegetarians?

332
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,914
You have to get them cow at least.

333
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:31,253
Let's go and eat galbitang.

334
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,424
Let's put this on.

335
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,664
I will not.

336
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,758
If you don't wear this,

337
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:45,773
I will take all your clothes off.

338
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,533
Do as you please.

339
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,243
But will you be able to handle it?

340
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,384
I don't think so.

341
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:04,954
Let's have galbitang tomorrow.

342
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,823
I have to go home and see Sanchez.

343
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:12,993
What are you doing?

344
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:15,164
None of your business.

345
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,674
They are flowers that wither
because of feelings of love.

346
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:29,343
There are still so many flowers.

347
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:31,914
It took more than a thousand
years for them to bloom.

348
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,654
I don't think they'll fall that easily.

349
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,884
Look, it's a firefly.

350
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,924
I could see it from time to
time after the tree changed.

351
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,593
See? Even a firefly comes now
the flowers have bloomed.

352
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:50,704
But can something like that come in here?

353
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:52,833
I don't know.

354
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,904
Since it's inside the
hotel, it can't be alive.

355
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:59,003
Is that what Mr. Ku was talking about?

356
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:02,684
- What?
- He asked me once.

357
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:05,914
If there could be a soul like a firefly.

358
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:10,354
Why is there only one? It must be lonely.

359
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:46,983
He spent all those years
unable to show himself.

360
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:50,624
He's always been with her
like a cloud of dust.

361
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:54,224
Now finally, he will be seen.

362
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,404
Since the flowers have bloomed,

363
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:07,934
I wonder if his story will be heard.

364
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:15,644
When things in one's heart are entangled,

365
00:27:15,908 --> 00:27:17,944
it's so hard to untangle them.

366
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,783
I will weave them properly this time.

367
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,681
I ate so much galbitang.

368
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:29,016
I feel so bloated.

369
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,826
You are making any excuses
just to come here and see her.

370
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,451
The baby she is carrying...

371
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:39,736
is the child of the family
Ms. Choi hates, right?

372
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,391
Right. She thought the
family tree would end.

373
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:44,105
But it continues persistently.

374
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:46,276
And that's the baby who
disappointed Ms. Choi.

375
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:49,476
If only that child disappears,

376
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,105
Ms. Choi's deep grievance will be resolved.

377
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,316
Do you really think so?

378
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:02,956
If the child disappears,

379
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:05,155
will that solve everything?

380
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:10,796
Shall I get rid of that baby right now?

381
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:15,665
The baby doesn't seem to be
in good condition anyway.

382
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,345
Are you all right?

383
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,185
My belly bunched up.

384
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:33,685
You should be careful. I will help you.

385
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:34,986
This.

386
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:40,195
She is Ms. Choi's enemy.

387
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,826
Why is he helping her?

388
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,665
What is this?

389
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,806
This is a nice car. I wanted to buy this.

390
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,675
Just because it's an expensive car,

391
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,901
it doesn't give you the
right to park anywhere.

392
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:02,576
I'm sorry.

393
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,246
Isn't she also Ma Go?

394
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,816
Oh, my! Ma Go!

395
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,411
- Ma Go!
- Man Weol!

396
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:13,050
It's been such a long time.

397
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,421
You used to come to my hotel
often when Moon Sook was there.

398
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,165
Why don't you come anymore?

399
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,695
We don't get a lot of money
because you don't come.

400
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:23,236
- Come more often.
- Where are you poking me?

401
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:26,236
I'm very busy.

402
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,435
I'm going to an opening now.

403
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,401
I don't know where the place is,

404
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,945
but there will be a success
thanks to your help.

405
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,915
Some young people have started
a computer business...

406
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,370
in a small office here.

407
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,155
- Computer business?
- Yes, computer business.

408
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,685
I think it's praiseworthy
so I'm cheering them on.

409
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,526
They are very lucky.

410
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,195
And who are you?

411
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:52,195
Is he the new manager?

412
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:55,796
Nice to meet you.

413
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,536
Take her hand quickly.
She'll bring you money.

414
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:03,875
My name is Ku Chan Seong.

415
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,746
You're holding it so hard.

416
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:10,945
You seem very nice. I think
we'll be meeting often.

417
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,486
Take good care of your guests.

418
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:16,786
Especially...

419
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:18,625
your first guest.

420
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:21,095
"My first guest"?

421
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,595
First guest is very important.

422
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:28,236
That's why I'm going as the
first guest to support them.

423
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:31,036
Man Weol.

424
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,175
Goodbye.

425
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,006
Have a good day. I opened many
champagnes thanks to you.

426
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,171
Right.

427
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,786
By the way, you're so pretty nowadays.

428
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,486
You will be rich.

429
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:54,921
She's a deity of wealth. She shook
your hand and said nice things.

430
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:58,026
Was that why you were
so excited to see her?

431
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:00,191
Of course. I get overly excited
whenever I meet good-looking guys...

432
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,466
and women with lots of money.

433
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,635
Then you should treat me differently now.

434
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,776
Since you'll be rich, I'll
treat you as a woman.

435
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,675
Let's go, sister.

436
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,216
First guest...

437
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:31,125
There is a guest that even Ms. Jang
and the staff don't know about.

438
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:33,865
Those who don't show their existence...

439
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,595
has the meaning of existence.

440
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,506
Letting them exist in the
way they want to exist...

441
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,306
is my answer to "the existence".

442
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:42,976
Just say you don't know.

443
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,276
Do you know where that murderer ghost is?

444
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:50,816
It is not easy to find a vengeful ghost.

445
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:52,615
You don't know that either.

446
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,216
The seven guests who
were murdered by him...

447
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:56,560
heard that we will be bring him in soon.

448
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,476
They're waiting for him,
refusing to get on the bus.

449
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:07,740
If it is delayed,

450
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,355
tell them that they'll get to ride
a limousine if things get delayed.

451
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:12,986
I guess that means it's
going to take some time.

452
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,926
Vengeful ghosts...

453
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:18,456
always hide themselves in darkness.

454
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:33,305
If something's dark even when
it's no place for a shadow,

455
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,805
that's where they'll be.

456
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,385
Don't be late for the movie.

457
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:45,256
If you're going to be late again,
don't come. Let's just break up.

458
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,956
If you think you're being watched
by someone from a dark space,

459
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:52,726
that's what it is.

460
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,185
Hello, Sanchez.

461
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,276
(Veronica)

462
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,136
I was so close to catching him.

463
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:49,205
He doesn't approach Ku Chan Seong
because you're always with him.

464
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,475
It seems like he's aiming for
Ku Chan Seong's acquaintances.

465
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,545
I'm sure I'll catch him soon,
but he should warn them...

466
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:56,386
just in case.

467
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,986
Mr. Kim, does Yu Na still
hang around with Hyung Joong?

468
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,685
She's with him even right now.

469
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:07,665
"My dearest".

470
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,021
"My dearest".

471
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:13,236
- That's good.
- Okay.

472
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,335
- I did well, didn't I?
- Yes, you did well.

473
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,506
I know, right?

474
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,986
My goodness.

475
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,045
Man Weol.

476
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:32,886
I heard you got hurt. I
brought you some medicine.

477
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:35,826
Thanks.

478
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:39,966
How did you know I got hurt? I
didn't even tell Chan Seong.

479
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,526
- I have an informant.
- Who?

480
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:45,466
The Grim Reaper.

481
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:50,506
I guess you also have connections
with the Grim Reaper.

482
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,406
I didn't know I was friends
with such an incredible being.

483
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,806
Light this up at home.

484
00:35:58,271 --> 00:36:01,145
Keep it nice and bright, and don't
go anywhere dark for a while.

485
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:02,711
I guess I didn't get hurt...

486
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:04,886
merely because of bad luck.

487
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:10,355
I've even been to your hotel,
so I guess I should trust you.

488
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,955
I'll do as you say.

489
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,625
Thank you.

490
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,236
I'm sorry.

491
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:25,676
I should've been nice to you
instead of being so sarcastic.

492
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,776
I didn't really think...

493
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:31,716
you'd be able to give
that pizza to Veronica.

494
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,946
I just wanted to believe that it could.

495
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,395
Sanchez, you're Chan Seong's
best friend, aren't you?

496
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:50,236
If...

497
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,636
If...

498
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:57,176
Chan Seong also goes through
the same thing you did,

499
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,105
I hope you'll be there to console him.

500
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,915
I'll be off now. There are a
lot of guests at the hotel.

501
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,751
You should light up the
incense in every room.

502
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:15,185
In every single room?

503
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,125
I guess I should tell Mi Ra to
light one up in her room as well.

504
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:23,335
I forgot she lived here.

505
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:27,736
Sanchez, is Mi Ra also acquainted...

506
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:29,565
with Seol Ji Won?

507
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,435
Yes, they met in the States.
Why do you ask?

508
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,946
Where is she right now?

509
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,840
Mi Ra has a boyfriend.

510
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,116
She went to the movie theater to
watch a movie with her boyfriend.

511
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:41,815
The movie theater?

512
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,211
She's just friends with Chan Seong now.

513
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:47,050
Mi Ra's boyfriend is really good-looking.

514
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,886
Would you like to see a photo?
Wait here for a second.

515
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:59,096
Movie theaters are really dark.

516
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,065
Why should I care?

517
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,276
Man Weol, look...

518
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,446
She's gone already.

519
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,986
I guess she doesn't walk
like normal people.

520
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,125
Mi Ra would've been in big trouble
if she didn't have a boyfriend.

521
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,891
Yeong Su, when are you planning to come?

522
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,596
The movie's going to start soon.

523
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:33,065
Will you stop with your excuses?

524
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:38,636
Okay, hurry up.

525
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:46,415
I guess that vengeful ghost
will take care of her for me.

526
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,565
What are you doing?

527
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,565
Where were you?

528
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,295
What?

529
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,705
I went to apologize to Sanchez.

530
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,900
You went by yourself? You
should've taken me with you.

531
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,435
I just wanted to get it over with.

532
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,346
- You've become a nice person.
- Not really.

533
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,846
Thank you for caring about my friend.

534
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:22,315
You really did become a nice person.

535
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,355
Chan Seong.

536
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:28,225
You made me bloom flowers.
You've changed a lot about me.

537
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:30,526
But you can't change my roots.

538
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,295
Don't even look forward to it.

539
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,650
Do I need to get in your way again?

540
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,636
No, I didn't do anything.

541
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,265
I'm not lying.

542
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:43,105
So if anything happens,
it's not because of me.

543
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,070
We have a lot of guests
today, so I'm quite busy.

544
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,105
I'll drop by after I'm done with work.
See you later.

545
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:00,256
Darn.

546
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,056
Ji Seon!

547
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,966
Sir, I noticed that you went outside.

548
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:48,565
- You can't just go outside...
- Please help me.

549
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,931
I heard the general manager
of this hotel is human...

550
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:53,605
and that he helps out with human affairs.

551
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,271
What's going on?

552
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:58,076
My girlfriend's sick right now,
but no one's there to help her.

553
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,145
If no one helps her, my
child will be in danger.

554
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:06,415
You should go back to your room.

555
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:08,156
I will...

556
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:11,256
take the general manager
there and help her out.

557
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,395
Thank you.

558
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,486
I'm not going to call Mr. Ku.

559
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,585
I'm going to watch their family tree end.

560
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,125
You can do whatever you want. I
don't intend on stopping you.

561
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,295
I guess it's finally
going to come to an end.

562
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,795
How about you witness...

563
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,806
how their family tree dies?

564
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,006
I know where she is.

565
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,506
You just need to go there and watch.

566
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:04,515
You don't need to do anything.

567
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,315
Someone said to me...

568
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,256
that seeing it...

569
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:16,955
won't resolve my resentment.

570
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:23,395
I want you to prove...

571
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,236
that they're wrong.

572
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:53,225
My baby...

573
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,105
My baby...

574
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,375
My baby.

575
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,276
My baby.

576
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,216
My baby...

577
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:23,225
My baby...

578
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:45,915
Please tell Mr. Ku...

579
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:49,986
that this woman is in danger.

580
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,371
Ms. Choi, the woman was transferred...

581
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:22,045
to a hospital quickly via an ambulance.

582
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,256
The mother and baby...

583
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:26,355
are both okay.

584
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:39,565
I was...

585
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:42,605
married to the eldest
son of the Yoon family.

586
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:46,975
I wasn't able to bear a
child until I was old.

587
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:52,446
The child I finally gave birth to...

588
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,545
was a girl.

589
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:14,705
No.

590
00:45:18,561 --> 00:45:20,875
My husband had to use
someone else's stomach...

591
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,406
to carry on the family name.

592
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,116
I had to leave my newborn
daughter behind...

593
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,245
to go pray at a famous temple...

594
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,355
hoping it's a son...

595
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,756
in that woman's stomach.

596
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:37,556
But...

597
00:45:38,621 --> 00:45:41,366
If the child in her stomach is a boy,

598
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:44,495
you need to get rid of the
girl that was born earlier.

599
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,461
That girl's fortune says...

600
00:45:46,461 --> 00:45:50,065
she'll obstruct the way of
all the men in this family.

601
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,306
If there is a girl with such
a fortune in the family,

602
00:45:53,561 --> 00:45:56,576
that family will never
give birth to any boys.

603
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:07,656
My baby didn't get any water for days.

604
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,081
They didn't change her diapers,

605
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:11,656
and she was neglected.

606
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:15,395
By the time I ran over
after hearing the news,

607
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,736
the child was close to death.

608
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,335
Excuse me, please open the door.

609
00:46:22,731 --> 00:46:24,475
My baby is dying.

610
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,136
Is there anyone inside?

611
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:30,245
Please open the door!

612
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,616
No doctor will open their doors for you.

613
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:35,716
That baby must not live.

614
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,915
Mister...

615
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:42,926
My child died,

616
00:46:43,451 --> 00:46:45,355
but I had no power.

617
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:47,190
There, there.

618
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:49,565
I was out of my mind.

619
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,636
Their family will dry up.

620
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:58,536
She used to always look proper.
What happened to her?

621
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:03,006
That Yoon family was too harsh on her.

622
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:05,446
How could they turn someone like that?

623
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:17,556
Don't touch her! Don't touch her!

624
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,256
Don't touch my baby!

625
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:22,596
Don't touch her!

626
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,935
Don't touch my baby!

627
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:39,645
The Yoon family...

628
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,286
will die out.

629
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,085
Even if I die,

630
00:47:45,981 --> 00:47:48,286
I'll watch that happen.

631
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:53,056
I'll make sure...

632
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,116
That's how I became determined.

633
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,355
But earlier, I wasn't able...

634
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,256
to watch that baby die until the end.

635
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,966
If the child disappears,
will that solve everything?

636
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,366
Do you really think so?

637
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,340
(Yeong Su)

638
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,145
I'm running a little late.
Start watching without me.

639
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,216
(Power off)

640
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:34,015
What you said was right.

641
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,955
I was wrong, so I'll tell you something.

642
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,495
Your friend...

643
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,835
Lee Mi Ra might be in danger.

644
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:56,732
Her phone is turned off.

645
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:58,572
This has to be the closest
theater from our house.

646
00:50:58,898 --> 00:51:01,313
Don't be dramatic.

647
00:51:01,497 --> 00:51:04,508
That vengeful ghost won't be
strong enough to kill someone.

648
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:06,767
At most, she'll get a burn...

649
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,512
or a cut.

650
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:11,123
Did you keep this away from me
so you could see Mi Ra get hurt?

651
00:51:11,307 --> 00:51:12,822
Then why are you telling me now?

652
00:51:17,787 --> 00:51:21,532
Did you change your mind
after watching Ms. Choi?

653
00:51:21,887 --> 00:51:24,563
Yes. My heart is shaking.

654
00:51:25,057 --> 00:51:26,203
Chan Seong.

655
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:29,203
Mi Ra.

656
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:31,302
What is this? Are you two
here to watch a movie?

657
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:32,898
What about you?

658
00:51:32,898 --> 00:51:35,212
How darn lucky.

659
00:51:35,937 --> 00:51:37,643
I got stood up.

660
00:51:37,738 --> 00:51:40,512
I felt too offended sitting
there alone, so I left.

661
00:51:40,707 --> 00:51:43,583
I guess he didn't come here.
Thank goodness.

662
00:51:43,637 --> 00:51:45,482
What are you saying?

663
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:47,747
I was mad because my
boyfriend didn't show up,

664
00:51:47,747 --> 00:51:51,462
then a pervert behind went, "hello".

665
00:51:55,218 --> 00:51:57,293
I guess he did come after all.

666
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:00,933
What about Yeong Su? Are
you sure he didn't come?

667
00:53:02,488 --> 00:53:04,603
Hello, Ku Chan Seong.

668
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:12,603
Are you looking for me?

669
00:53:16,468 --> 00:53:17,913
This is interesting.

670
00:53:19,037 --> 00:53:20,342
Keep on looking for me.

671
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:38,358
Yeon Woo.

672
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:39,833
Yeong Su!

673
00:53:43,198 --> 00:53:45,873
Yeong Su, are you okay? Try getting up.

674
00:53:46,028 --> 00:53:47,203
Yeong Su.

675
00:53:49,298 --> 00:53:50,572
Yeong Su.

676
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:53,683
Are you okay?

677
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:00,253
Are you okay, Yeong Su?

678
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:01,822
I'm fine.

679
00:54:02,178 --> 00:54:05,223
I work out on a regular basis,
so this is not a problem.

680
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:07,918
I'm glad nothing broke.

681
00:54:07,918 --> 00:54:10,532
I got a good rest thanks to you.
I'll get going now.

682
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:12,532
No.

683
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:16,333
You can rest a little longer. Relax.

684
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:18,842
This is Chan Seong's room.

685
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:21,313
This place is the cleanest in our place.

686
00:54:21,537 --> 00:54:23,367
Mi Ra, this is not "our" place.

687
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:25,367
That would mean your
room is extremely dirty.

688
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:27,568
Yeong Su, how are your teeth?

689
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:30,083
What about your tongue?
Did you not bite on it?

690
00:54:30,508 --> 00:54:32,052
I'm fine, Mi Ra.

691
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:35,353
Sanchez, go get some more ice water.

692
00:54:38,448 --> 00:54:39,563
Okay.

693
00:54:41,918 --> 00:54:43,362
Wait...

694
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,632
Should I check your face?

695
00:54:48,057 --> 00:54:49,898
- Let me see. Let me see.
- I told you, I'm fine.

696
00:54:49,898 --> 00:54:51,373
What about your back?

697
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,468
What is it? What's wrong?

698
00:54:53,468 --> 00:54:55,097
That part hurts the most.

699
00:54:55,097 --> 00:54:57,373
- Really? What about the other side?
- That side too.

700
00:55:05,948 --> 00:55:07,723
How are Yeon Woo and Song Hwa...

701
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:10,753
together?

702
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:12,988
He's not Yeon Woo. He's Park Yeong Su.

703
00:55:12,988 --> 00:55:14,563
And she's not Song Hwa. She's Lee Mi Ra.

704
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:18,433
The two of them are dating.

705
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:21,032
I met Yeong Su through Mi Ra.

706
00:55:24,568 --> 00:55:26,503
I thought it might make
things complicated for you,

707
00:55:27,668 --> 00:55:29,373
so I didn't bring it up on purpose.

708
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:31,712
Because they're the people you despise...

709
00:55:33,537 --> 00:55:35,083
and love.

710
00:55:45,517 --> 00:55:48,333
To you, it's a lingering grudge,

711
00:55:48,957 --> 00:55:50,293
but to her,

712
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:53,563
it's the past she can't even remember.

713
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:56,672
Just let them pass.

714
00:56:38,637 --> 00:56:40,043
Are you feeling confused?

715
00:56:42,307 --> 00:56:45,982
The person I loved the most and
hated the most are dating.

716
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:48,577
Even though we killed the
one we wished the most,

717
00:56:48,577 --> 00:56:50,422
that wouldn't relieve the resentment.

718
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:55,262
Were you not able...

719
00:56:57,057 --> 00:56:58,862
to kill him then?

720
00:57:02,398 --> 00:57:03,672
He died.

721
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:07,942
He died that day.

722
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,083
You survived.

723
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:24,853
I survived...

724
00:58:26,178 --> 00:58:28,793
to keep my promise to kill you.

725
00:58:32,017 --> 00:58:33,362
I'm proud of you,

726
00:58:34,818 --> 00:58:35,993
Man Weol.

727
00:58:44,997 --> 00:58:47,902
(Man Weol)

728
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:50,112
You memorized the letters well.

729
00:58:54,238 --> 00:58:55,882
Did Yeon Woo engrave it for you?

730
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:02,953
He was dexterous.

731
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:08,563
I guess the blade of this sword...

732
00:59:10,957 --> 00:59:12,703
carries Yeon Woo's grudges too.

733
00:59:17,028 --> 00:59:19,373
There are many who have
grudges against you.

734
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:23,672
You need to learn of them all,

735
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:26,842
and die in pain and misery.

736
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:34,623
Does that include us?

737
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:40,962
I'm just happy to see you again.

738
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:53,273
You'd welcome me as a beautiful bride,

739
00:59:56,068 --> 00:59:57,612
and I'd say that I missed you...

740
00:59:59,168 --> 01:00:00,913
while stroking your face.

741
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:07,353
Shut your mouth.

742
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:22,373
(Man Weol)

743
01:00:58,997 --> 01:01:00,203
This is...

744
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:05,083
the end for us.

745
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:59,362
I won't let your people survive.

746
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:03,273
I'm going to burn down this castle.

747
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,072
Our last moment together...

748
01:02:07,968 --> 01:02:09,243
is this.

749
01:02:12,468 --> 01:02:14,853
You have to die after seeing all of that.

750
01:02:20,548 --> 01:02:21,793
Man Weol.

751
01:02:24,377 --> 01:02:26,362
I'll keep you in my heart...

752
01:02:28,857 --> 01:02:30,893
and become the moon that never falls...

753
01:02:33,988 --> 01:02:35,103
to watch you from afar.

754
01:03:18,568 --> 01:03:21,782
(Man Weol)

755
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:39,162
That day, he died, and I lost my mind...

756
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:41,833
and killed a lot of people.

757
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:48,273
Then I put my people's
belongings in a casket...

758
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:51,313
and traveled to find
Guest House of the Moon.

759
01:03:55,738 --> 01:03:59,682
I killed whoever got in my way.

760
01:04:01,247 --> 01:04:03,693
When I finally arrived at
Guest House of the Moon,

761
01:04:04,747 --> 01:04:06,092
what I faced...

762
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:09,063
was myself covered in blood.

763
01:04:21,537 --> 01:04:24,173
I have sinned too much and
earned too much resentment.

764
01:04:27,607 --> 01:04:29,253
That's my rock bottom.

765
01:04:36,718 --> 01:04:37,822
I have...

766
01:04:40,218 --> 01:04:42,492
waited for the man for so long,

767
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:45,762
planning to cease to exist...

768
01:04:46,658 --> 01:04:48,632
after bringing him down with me...

769
01:04:49,497 --> 01:04:50,932
to the rock bottom.

770
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,552
But I'm here now.

771
01:05:08,247 --> 01:05:09,353
I...

772
01:05:10,477 --> 01:05:12,193
cannot make your painful memories...

773
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:14,923
be forgotten,

774
01:05:16,087 --> 01:05:17,793
but I want to get you out of them.

775
01:06:26,588 --> 01:06:29,502
Does this bus go to Myeong-dong, sir?

776
01:06:29,628 --> 01:06:30,872
Yes, it does.

777
01:06:31,257 --> 01:06:33,502
Are you alone? Where's your mom?

778
01:06:33,897 --> 01:06:35,273
I'm going to meet my mom.

779
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:38,943
Do you know of Hotel Del
Luna in Myeong-dong?

780
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,443
That's where my mom is.

781
01:06:53,017 --> 01:06:56,332
Ms. Choi!

782
01:07:01,028 --> 01:07:02,172
Are you leaving now?

783
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:05,028
How could you not even say a goodbye?

784
01:07:05,028 --> 01:07:07,103
We've been working together
for the last 200 years!

785
01:07:11,597 --> 01:07:12,682
I'm disappointed.

786
01:07:15,977 --> 01:07:17,052
I'm not leaving.

787
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:20,682
I was only cleaning the car
because I was asked to.

788
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:24,592
Is that right?

789
01:07:26,887 --> 01:07:30,832
Why does he always ask
you to clean the car?

790
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:32,163
I'm done.

791
01:07:35,727 --> 01:07:37,097
Are you not leaving then?

792
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:39,227
We don't even know if the
child is a boy or a girl.

793
01:07:39,227 --> 01:07:40,372
I have to see that first.

794
01:07:41,368 --> 01:07:43,913
Sorry, I guess I jumped to conclusions.

795
01:07:44,038 --> 01:07:45,313
Mr. Kim,

796
01:07:47,807 --> 01:07:51,007
please make me a glass of Tears.

797
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:52,082
A strong one, please.

798
01:07:52,177 --> 01:07:53,752
Okay. Let's go.

799
01:07:55,977 --> 01:07:58,422
- Did you cry?
- No.

800
01:07:58,887 --> 01:08:02,057
- That's a tear.
- I didn't cry, I'm telling you.

801
01:08:02,057 --> 01:08:03,592
- It looks like it.
- No.

802
01:08:04,187 --> 01:08:06,502
Be good when you have the chance to.

803
01:08:07,158 --> 01:08:08,332
Will do.

804
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:13,073
I hid a present for you in here.

805
01:08:13,227 --> 01:08:14,773
Find it. You have one chance.

806
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:16,472
How can I do that in one try?

807
01:08:17,137 --> 01:08:19,712
- I'll give you a hint.
- Sure.

808
01:08:21,507 --> 01:08:25,422
The room number is the same
as the day we first met.

809
01:08:26,408 --> 01:08:28,153
- The day we first met?
- Yes.

810
01:08:30,017 --> 01:08:32,092
How am I supposed to remember that?

811
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:35,363
How can you not?

812
01:08:37,288 --> 01:08:39,603
Do you not remember the date
of our first kiss either?

813
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:42,372
Don't say it out too loud.

814
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:45,502
Only spirits will hear us anyway.

815
01:08:45,868 --> 01:08:48,573
Think hard. When did we first meet?

816
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:54,082
It was when flowers were blooming,

817
01:08:55,177 --> 01:08:57,007
- so maybe June?
- June?

818
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,153
- No, that's not right.
- June?

819
01:08:59,477 --> 01:09:02,017
- Maybe May?
- Which day in May?

820
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:04,523
- May...
- Which day?

821
01:09:04,847 --> 01:09:08,088
It's not May 5, is it?

822
01:09:08,088 --> 01:09:09,357
May 5?

823
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:10,592
I know that's wrong.

824
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:22,142
It's a child.

825
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:25,072
We rarely see a child
walking in here alone.

826
01:09:29,407 --> 01:09:31,852
Are you here alone?

827
01:09:32,077 --> 01:09:34,222
Yes. I'm here to see my mom.

828
01:09:35,978 --> 01:09:38,392
Did you follow your mom here?

829
01:09:43,457 --> 01:09:45,703
Are you not cold?

830
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:51,072
He's alive.

831
01:09:59,207 --> 01:10:01,013
You saw this place in your dream, you say?

832
01:10:01,107 --> 01:10:03,553
Mom said that she's all good here.

833
01:10:05,478 --> 01:10:07,753
It's a side effect from a dream call.

834
01:10:08,678 --> 01:10:12,493
There's a living child in here,
looking for his dead mom.

835
01:10:12,817 --> 01:10:14,623
Mr. Ku, please make sure
that he returns home safely.

836
01:10:15,817 --> 01:10:17,892
Is his mom still here?

837
01:10:18,188 --> 01:10:20,602
She just left yesterday.

838
01:10:20,857 --> 01:10:23,432
Please talk to the child
and get him out of here.

839
01:10:30,867 --> 01:10:32,013
Where did he go?

840
01:10:38,907 --> 01:10:40,123
Where's the child?

841
01:10:40,247 --> 01:10:42,293
You were watching him.

842
01:10:42,478 --> 01:10:44,722
I brought some ice cream for him.

843
01:10:45,348 --> 01:10:47,993
We have to find him. Let's split.

844
01:10:48,888 --> 01:10:50,032
My goodness.

845
01:10:51,088 --> 01:10:52,163
Hey, kid.

846
01:10:52,888 --> 01:10:54,232
Where could he have gone?

847
01:10:54,827 --> 01:10:55,857
Hey, kid.

848
01:10:55,857 --> 01:10:56,972
Hey.

849
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:00,843
Hello?

850
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:04,243
Hey, kid.

851
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:11,112
Hello, have you seen a little child around?

852
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:14,982
The kid? I saw him heading to the platform.

853
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:17,923
What?

854
01:11:29,197 --> 01:11:30,373
Hold on!

855
01:11:55,588 --> 01:12:00,157
(The Sanzu River)

856
01:12:00,157 --> 01:12:04,732
(This world, the afterlife)

857
01:12:06,027 --> 01:12:08,602
What? There's a living kid here?

858
01:12:08,678 --> 01:12:11,662
Yes. He disappeared, so we're
looking for him right now.

859
01:12:12,318 --> 01:12:14,532
How could the front desk not catch him?

860
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,782
Was this tunnel always so long?

861
01:12:55,697 --> 01:12:57,303
Am I trapped?

862
01:13:08,478 --> 01:13:09,582
I found him!

863
01:13:10,108 --> 01:13:11,482
I found him.

864
01:13:12,478 --> 01:13:14,278
He was in front of the platform.

865
01:13:14,278 --> 01:13:16,063
We could've been in serious trouble.

866
01:13:16,947 --> 01:13:18,992
Bring Hyun Joong here...

867
01:13:19,218 --> 01:13:20,992
and tell Chan Seong to
drop him off at home.

868
01:13:24,587 --> 01:13:26,398
This isn't a place for you.

869
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:29,402
You could've ended up
in a very scary place.

870
01:13:29,528 --> 01:13:32,202
But I saw a man walking in there.

871
01:13:34,898 --> 01:13:37,313
What? What did you just say?

872
01:13:37,907 --> 01:13:39,108
Who did you see?

873
01:13:39,108 --> 01:13:41,282
The man in suits walked in.

874
01:13:41,638 --> 01:13:43,648
I was watching to see if he was coming out,

875
01:13:43,648 --> 01:13:45,152
but he didn't.

876
01:13:45,978 --> 01:13:48,093
I think Mr. Ku is in there.

877
01:13:48,218 --> 01:13:50,923
If a human gets lost in
there, he's trapped.

878
01:15:41,197 --> 01:15:42,332
Chan Seong!

879
01:15:44,327 --> 01:15:45,503
Chan Seong?

880
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:25,742
(The Sanzu River)

881
01:17:13,757 --> 01:17:14,832
Chan Seong!

882
01:17:30,407 --> 01:17:32,343
I thought you weren't coming back.

883
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:38,223
(The Sanzu River)

884
01:19:31,488 --> 01:19:35,973
(The Sanzu River)

885
01:19:41,738 --> 01:19:42,883
Who...

886
01:19:49,108 --> 01:19:50,322
are you?

887
01:20:41,697 --> 01:20:45,402
(Hotel Del Luna)

888
01:20:46,438 --> 01:20:49,098
When he's here, I was going to...

889
01:20:49,098 --> 01:20:50,942
destroy myself with him.

890
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:53,112
I can't do that anymore.

891
01:20:53,337 --> 01:20:57,122
I ended up falling in love again.
How ridiculous.

892
01:21:00,077 --> 01:21:01,348
Eat this.

893
01:21:01,348 --> 01:21:03,923
Eat this and become a vengeful spirit.

894
01:21:08,587 --> 01:21:09,902
Just die.

895
01:21:10,488 --> 01:21:12,402
I told you that she will protect me.
