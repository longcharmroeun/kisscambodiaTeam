00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:20,964
(Episode 1)

2
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:37,887
Where are you from?

3
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,505
This is the only place you can get a drink.

4
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:42,526
Are you from Muzu?

5
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,545
You don't exactly look like a Georan.

6
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:48,438
Are you from Malgal?

7
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:53,432
My goodness, I see you have a sword.
Are you a warrior?

8
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:58,932
The wine tastes horrible,

9
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,782
and you're very chatty.

10
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:14,628
Did someone die?

11
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,942
Or did you kill someone?

12
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:26,352
There are only two types of
people who pass by this place...

13
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,808
even in this horrible weather.

14
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,011
It's either a person who killed someone...

15
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:32,049
or a person who's on their way to die.

16
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:35,335
You've lived quite a long life
even with that useless...

17
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,151
and big mouth of yours.

18
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,390
Should I slice off your tongue...

19
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:43,391
so you can safely live for longer?

20
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:47,345
This old tongue of mine might
not be able to taste good wine,

21
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,835
but it knows how to say
things that can be of help.

22
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:54,361
It seems like you've been
wandering for a very long time.

23
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,670
Where are you trying to go?

24
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:01,234
I'm looking for a guest house.

25
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:03,277
I heard there's a guest house...

26
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:07,022
somewhere in this wilderness that
consoles the souls of the dead.

27
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:10,484
You must be looking for the
Guest House of the Moon.

28
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:14,703
Do you know that place?

29
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,943
I heard it's a guest house for the dead...

30
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:18,328
that still wander in this life.

31
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:19,956
Where is that place?

32
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:21,643
Where do I need to go?

33
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:25,118
You can't go there. Only the
dead are able to go there.

34
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:28,110
Just like those people standing over there.

35
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:38,941
How much chaos have you
brought in this coffin?

36
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:48,060
They're people who ended
up dying because of me.

37
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:52,352
And who else did you kill for
those who ended up dying?

38
00:04:56,884 --> 00:04:59,207
Shut your mouth. Just
tell me how to get there.

39
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:03,471
"Full moon"?

40
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:05,774
It's a moon that's filled
with so many grudges.

41
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:07,134
Tell me.

42
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:08,937
I'm trying to take responsibility...

43
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:11,777
for those whom I've killed.

44
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:14,123
You can't even take
responsibility of yourself.

45
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,162
You don't have the ability...

46
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:17,547
to take care of other people's lives.

47
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:19,551
I told you I'll slice off your tongue...

48
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,591
if you keep saying things
that are unnecessary.

49
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:24,587
Just tell me how to get there.

50
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,963
If that place can only
be found by the dead,

51
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:30,668
I'm even willing to kill myself.

52
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:32,767
What a poor soul.

53
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,352
You think you can compensate
everything by sacrificing your life.

54
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,273
But that's such a futile desire.

55
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,269
This is the only thing left...

56
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:42,808
that I can give.

57
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:48,916
The Guest House of the Moon...

58
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:53,497
is where the souls of the
dead gather together.

59
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:58,754
The dead souls that wander about all
end up there on their own will.

60
00:06:56,204 --> 00:07:00,042
They are also people whom
you've already killed.

61
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:27,606
Was this the place?

62
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,308
Did I kill everyone?

63
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,850
Did I become an evil spirit?

64
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,463
And come to the Guest House of
the Moon on my own two feet?

65
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:42,329
Arrogant and foolish.

66
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:46,109
You are a pitiful human who
has fallen into self-pity.

67
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:51,091
As you have found the place to pay
for your sins on your own two feet,

68
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:53,031
so now pay for your sins.

69
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:16,590
(Full Moon)

70
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:28,099
(Full Moon)

71
00:10:44,763 --> 00:10:47,631
(Guest House)

72
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:20,236
The Guest House of the Moon which
will be the shelter for the dead...

73
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:22,585
has found a new owner.

74
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:34,148
Why don't you come with me...

75
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:36,062
to a comfortable place?

76
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:39,984
(Hotel Del Luna)

77
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:45,586
(Year 1998)

78
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:56,404
Son.

79
00:12:57,363 --> 00:13:00,625
It was your birthday today and I
couldn't buy you jjajangmyeon.

80
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:03,225
It's all right. I'm not hungry.

81
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:17,329
Let's go buy jjajangmyeon with this.

82
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:22,183
- Mister.
- Hey, son.

83
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,345
- You dropped your money.
- Thank you.

84
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:28,995
My word, you're a good boy.

85
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:31,362
You have a wide forehead
and twinkling eyes.

86
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:33,354
You have a very auspicious face.

87
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,847
It's your birthday today?

88
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,762
Tell me the year and
hour that you were born.

89
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:39,157
Hey, lady. We're not buying flowers.
Go your way.

90
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:42,369
Oh, dear. Your early years were unlucky...

91
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:44,695
so you were born to a father like him.

92
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,313
But it's not an ill-fated relationship.

93
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:51,482
Having a hard life early on means
you're cleared for good fortune.

94
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:53,053
You are washing yourself of bad luck.

95
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:54,226
What? "Bad luck"?

96
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:56,774
How can you talk such rubbish
just to sell flowers to a kid?

97
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:59,252
Son, just wait. I'll earn lots of money...

98
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:00,364
and buy you your birthday present.

99
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:01,838
- Present?
- Flowers!

100
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:04,563
Flowers are for birthdays.

101
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:06,108
I'm not buying flowers.

102
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:08,180
Flowers are good too.

103
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:11,703
You can just pluck them for
me, instead of buying them.

104
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:14,203
So don't do dangerous
things just to make money.

105
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:15,719
My goodness.

106
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,692
You're too young to worry
about things like that.

107
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,637
- Look.
- Poke around the place.

108
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:31,903
Is there anything?

109
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:35,652
- Over there.
- Check there.

110
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:36,474
Ms. Jang, are you up?

111
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:40,747
It's the full moon, so I think
we will have many guests.

112
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:43,985
When the moon is bright, they can
see this place from far away.

113
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:47,921
So they will crawl in here
from all over the place.

114
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:51,729
I will light up the hotel sign.

115
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:53,845
Open the hotel for business.

116
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,856
I get into a bad mood
when I see the full moon.

117
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:58,921
And today it's getting worse.

118
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:01,324
Don't accept anyone who died a
particularly gruesome death.

119
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:03,742
We shouldn't pick guests.

120
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,926
Don't accept them.

121
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:06,993
They won't be in a rush,
since they're already dead.

122
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:11,154
I will take special care so
they won't get in your way.

123
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,506
That darn moon.

124
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:24,539
I'm so sick of it.

125
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:44,568
Stop right there! Stop!

126
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,444
My gosh.

127
00:19:10,604 --> 00:19:13,259
Gosh, I almost died.

128
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:40,245
What's that?

129
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:56,770
I wonder if I'll have to
pay just for going inside.

130
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:24,657
Are you here alone?

131
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,972
Do you remember how long
it's been since you died?

132
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:31,866
It's been about 10 days.

133
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,512
I guess that's the elevator.

134
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,475
My gosh, this place is huge.

135
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:23,125
I wonder if I'll have to
pay just for sitting here.

136
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,931
Are you okay? You don't look so well.

137
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:32,532
Where did you get so wet?

138
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:35,282
The Han River.

139
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:36,456
The Han River?

140
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,905
Did she play in the water
in the middle of the night?

141
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:45,022
Is this place expensive?

142
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:47,593
Do you think they'll make me pay
just for sitting in the lobby?

143
00:21:47,594 --> 00:21:50,392
I'm not sure. This is
also my first time here.

144
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:55,946
What happened...

145
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:58,245
to you?

146
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:00,627
I rolled down the stairs.

147
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:29,388
It's been a while since we last
had a ghost soaked in water.

148
00:22:29,503 --> 00:22:31,203
- A ghost soaked in water?
- Yes.

149
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:33,396
By any chance, does that ghost look filthy?

150
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:35,360
Well, a little...

151
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:37,673
Ms. Jang isn't feeling very well today.

152
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:40,643
We'll have to take her to her room
so that Ms. Jang doesn't see her.

153
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:41,894
Okay.

154
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,153
What's wrong, sir?

155
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:54,769
The guest that just walked by...

156
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:58,321
He doesn't belong here. He
came to the wrong place.

157
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,152
Does that mean...

158
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,015
he isn't dead?

159
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:04,732
Is he alive?

160
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:07,229
If Ms. Jang sees him, he'll die.

161
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:09,759
We need to get him out of
here as fast as possible.

162
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,033
I need to hide here for at
least a couple of hours.

163
00:23:17,283 --> 00:23:19,273
Should I hide in the bathroom?

164
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:21,374
Yes, good idea. Let's hide in the bathroom.

165
00:23:29,164 --> 00:23:30,234
Is this gold?

166
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:35,753
My gosh, this looks really expensive.

167
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:42,003
No, no. This isn't important right now.

168
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:47,030
I hope I see you again.

169
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,350
(Swimming Pool)

170
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,619
Why is there a beach here?

171
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:41,830
Sir, would you like to swim in the water?

172
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:44,824
We'll lend you a swimsuit.

173
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:46,649
What's your room number?

174
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,500
No, I'm... I'm okay.

175
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:04,896
Welcome.

176
00:25:29,983 --> 00:25:31,498
I didn't know this building was this tall.

177
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:37,095
How weird.

178
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:40,264
That's scary.

179
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,980
A living person is here?

180
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:47,433
It seems like he's roaming
around the hotel...

181
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:48,933
without even knowing what
this place really is.

182
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:51,502
If he doesn't leave soon, he'll die.

183
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:53,373
The worst he'll have to face is death,

184
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:55,802
but we'll get scolded so much
if Ms. Jang finds out.

185
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:58,002
She'll make sure we don't
forget about this for 50 years.

186
00:25:58,003 --> 00:25:59,760
You know what she always says.

187
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:04,431
Is this the best you can do?

188
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:08,374
You guys must think of me as a joke.

189
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:12,073
If you make this kind of
mistake one more time,

190
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:15,829
I'll put all of you on a bus
that's headed to the afterlife.

191
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:17,375
Do you understand?

192
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:22,844
My gosh, no way.

193
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:26,360
I feel like it's my fault.
What should I do?

194
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,272
Why do you always blame yourself?

195
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:30,203
- But this one's on you.
- What?

196
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:31,643
I can't take responsibility for this.

197
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:33,272
I still have stuff to do in this world.

198
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:35,910
I can't get on the bus
headed to the afterlife.

199
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:37,613
I'm doomed.

200
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,812
Why did that dumb human
have to come here? Darn it.

201
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:42,653
I'm sure Ms. Jang will
notice sooner or later...

202
00:26:42,654 --> 00:26:45,452
that a living human soul is
roaming around the hotel.

203
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:49,933
If Ms. Jang finds him, he'll never
be able to leave this place.

204
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:51,779
He'll end up dying.

205
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:04,490
A thief must be here.

206
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:08,460
How dare anyone steal from my hotel?

207
00:27:37,674 --> 00:27:38,784
What's this place?

208
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,094
Flowers?

209
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:54,107
Flowers are good too.

210
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:57,292
You can pluck them for me,
instead of buying them.

211
00:27:57,624 --> 00:27:58,774
This is good.

212
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:01,180
I'll take them to Chan Seong.

213
00:28:01,694 --> 00:28:03,987
This looks like a dead tree.

214
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,819
But the flowers are really pretty.

215
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:39,685
What is this?

216
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:42,424
Since you still feel pain,

217
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,062
is this still alive?

218
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:47,343
What are you?

219
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:48,757
What are you doing? Take off your foot.

220
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:50,943
You stole from me.

221
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:52,782
I didn't do anything.

222
00:28:52,783 --> 00:28:55,113
I didn't steal anything here.

223
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:57,305
Really? Then, what is this?

224
00:29:04,424 --> 00:29:05,707
That is... I mean...

225
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:08,107
You tried to steal it.

226
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,445
That is...

227
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:11,880
You want to get bitten to death by him.

228
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:19,034
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

229
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:20,657
I deserve to die for my sins.

230
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:22,094
Then, die.

231
00:29:22,414 --> 00:29:25,082
No, I can't die now.

232
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,134
All humans have to die at the end.

233
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:29,904
Instead of going back and forth,

234
00:29:30,223 --> 00:29:31,496
since you're already here,

235
00:29:32,094 --> 00:29:33,165
just die.

236
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:36,378
I don't think you realize this.

237
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:38,638
But you are already dying.

238
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:46,092
What's happening to me?

239
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:48,353
Why is this happening?

240
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:54,289
Check his pulse and oxygen saturation.

241
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:56,561
Oxygen saturation is critical.

242
00:29:57,013 --> 00:29:59,377
I need the defibrillator.

243
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,130
200 joules. Charge. Clear!

244
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:04,199
I can't die now.

245
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:05,966
Please spare me.

246
00:30:06,694 --> 00:30:08,322
My son is waiting for me.

247
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:09,940
I feel sorry for your son.

248
00:30:11,364 --> 00:30:12,777
Please.

249
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:20,532
- What is this?
- Today it's my son's birthday.

250
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,423
He wanted to receive
flowers as his present.

251
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:24,218
So I got them from the tree.

252
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:26,564
I am really so sorry.

253
00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:30,545
Flowers never bloom on this tree.

254
00:30:30,684 --> 00:30:32,683
The flowers are from this tree for sure.

255
00:30:32,684 --> 00:30:34,531
I didn't touch anything else.

256
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:40,393
You made flowers for this human...

257
00:30:40,394 --> 00:30:41,909
and also gave him your branch?

258
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:46,847
Is it telling me to spare him?

259
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:54,417
Did you say this is your
son's birthday present?

260
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:55,843
For a foolish father like me,

261
00:30:55,844 --> 00:30:58,095
he is a smart and loyal son
who is too good for me.

262
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:01,874
If you forgive me, I will never
think bad thoughts again.

263
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:03,600
I will raise my son as best as I can.

264
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:08,072
Okay. Good.

265
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:11,764
I will spare you.

266
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:14,268
Thank you very much.

267
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:17,450
You go back and raise your son well.

268
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:20,281
Raise him well...

269
00:31:21,894 --> 00:31:22,975
and give him to me.

270
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,463
What?

271
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:26,959
Since I saved the father,
the son must repay me.

272
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,617
You said he was still young, yes?

273
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:31,472
If a human is to be of any use,

274
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,676
you need to feed and raise
him for at least 20 years.

275
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:38,547
Promise me to give me your son then.

276
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:40,295
You want my son?

277
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:42,241
If you don't like it, you die tonight.

278
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:48,517
What's happening to me?

279
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:53,478
Hurry up and make up your mind.

280
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:57,469
You only have few minutes to stay alive.

281
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:00,184
How can I...

282
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:04,133
If I die, Chan Seong will be all alone.

283
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:05,955
What will you do?

284
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:08,213
Will you give me your son?

285
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:09,294
Or...

286
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:11,094
will you die?

287
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:14,166
I promise.

288
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:16,166
Please spare me.

289
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:20,543
Okay. Good.

290
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:26,606
20 years later,

291
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:28,949
I will go to get your son.

292
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,043
Go.

293
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:41,024
Dad.

294
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:45,864
Chan Seong.

295
00:32:48,354 --> 00:32:49,970
My dad is not dead.

296
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:51,733
What?

297
00:32:55,124 --> 00:32:57,215
His reflex has come back,
and his vitals are okay.

298
00:32:57,364 --> 00:32:58,762
Contact the OS and prepare
for an operation.

299
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:00,683
- Yes, doctor.
- Just wait a while.

300
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:03,375
Dad.

301
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:07,514
Chan Seong.

302
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:11,783
Come here.

303
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:18,794
Dad.

304
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,283
He left his son's birthday present.

305
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:12,720
(Funeral Hall)

306
00:34:13,904 --> 00:34:14,985
That woman...

307
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:16,884
I don't know.

308
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:18,718
This is my first time too.

309
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,538
Dad, do you know that policewoman?

310
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:30,686
I don't know her, but I
think I saw her somewhere.

311
00:34:31,884 --> 00:34:33,913
Is it possible that wasn't a dream?

312
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:44,345
I'm a policewoman.

313
00:34:44,964 --> 00:34:46,791
My identity was discovered while
I was working undercover.

314
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,102
And I was killed.

315
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:49,557
Such a pity.

316
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:51,602
You died doing righteous work.

317
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:53,013
So on your way to the afterlife,

318
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:54,932
you will be provided with
a first class limousine.

319
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:57,665
Rest a few days here,
then take the limousine.

320
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,467
I can't leave like this.

321
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,704
Most of my guests say the same thing.

322
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:04,482
What would you like me to do for you?

323
00:35:04,483 --> 00:35:05,867
Do you want revenge?

324
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:07,553
For your reference, even
if you want revenge,

325
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:09,423
we can't take the life of a human.

326
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:11,263
We can torment him a little.

327
00:35:11,264 --> 00:35:12,292
But that will become a sin,

328
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:14,516
and affect your next life negatively.

329
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:18,361
You can be reborn to excellent conditions.

330
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:20,202
But you can be reborn as a dog or a pig...

331
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,122
if you try to satisfy your grudge in
the life that is already finished.

332
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:23,915
Please think carefully.

333
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:26,258
I don't want revenge.

334
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:31,383
The man I was chasing can't
be caught by human laws.

335
00:35:32,554 --> 00:35:33,694
So I want to catch him.

336
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:36,295
You are...

337
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,871
such a responsible person.

338
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:40,823
For services related to this world,

339
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:42,963
you have to pay with worldly money.

340
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:44,074
Do you have...

341
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:46,750
some money hidden in this world?

342
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:56,013
Okay.

343
00:35:56,703 --> 00:35:58,117
What can we do for you?

344
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:24,567
Park Kyu Ho, Mayor of
Beomcheon is with us here.

345
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:32,272
Now, we will award the
Businessman Award for...

346
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,738
Innovative Growth of Beomcheon City.

347
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:38,213
The award goes to Mr. Kim Dong
Hwan, CEO of Beomin Corporation.

348
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:39,295
Congratulations!

349
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:42,053
- Way to go!
- Way to go!

350
00:36:42,054 --> 00:36:44,723
It will be awarded by Park Kyu Ho...

351
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:46,022
the Mayor of Beomcheon City.

352
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:47,053
- Kim Dong Hwan!
- Kim Dong Hwan!

353
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:48,952
The CEO has lead Beomin Corporation...

354
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:50,392
with exceptional dedication.

355
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:52,717
He has been an excellent
model as a business manager.

356
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,397
- What is this noise?
- What is this?

357
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:07,287
- What's going on?
- What is this?

358
00:37:08,444 --> 00:37:09,493
Hold on.

359
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:18,135
Why isn't anyone taking photos?

360
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:32,173
Who's that?

361
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,895
There's a woman with a gun
in her hand walking in.

362
00:37:41,143 --> 00:37:42,426
Why isn't anyone stopping her?

363
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,910
She has a gun right there!

364
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,467
Hey!

365
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,128
Put your gun down.

366
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:30,275
Mr. Chairman.

367
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:32,412
I've been shot.

368
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:35,311
Shot? What are you talking about?

369
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,986
That woman right there
shot me with her gun.

370
00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:48,633
She really shot me.

371
00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:57,578
Detective Lee? You died.

372
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,568
Don't come near me!

373
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:02,781
Get away from me.

374
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:10,183
That's Detective Lee right there, isn't it?

375
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,562
What are you all doing? Stop it.

376
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:13,846
You jerk!

377
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:15,713
Stop.

378
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,113
Don't come this way!

379
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:19,993
Stop taking photos.

380
00:39:28,614 --> 00:39:29,764
Hold on.

381
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:34,123
Hey! Stop it. Don't come near me.

382
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:52,612
You used the soul of the man who
she couldn't arrest by herself...

383
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:55,812
and trapped him in a place
that's worse than jail.

384
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:58,874
If I wear him down enough,

385
00:39:59,114 --> 00:40:00,629
he'll probably return back to the hotel.

386
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,682
Have you found what the
woman mentioned earlier?

387
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:05,764
Yes.

388
00:40:06,924 --> 00:40:09,388
I found this in a locker
at the train station.

389
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:14,664
It must've been some of what
she found being smuggled.

390
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:22,602
Seems like I'm going to be drinking
a lot of champagne for a while.

391
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:26,149
We have to pay off the debt that we have.

392
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:28,056
Did we have this much debt?

393
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:33,852
Fine, this should be enough.

394
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:37,187
We also need some to pay off
for loans in the future.

395
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,035
Are we going to loan this much money?

396
00:40:39,924 --> 00:40:42,723
What kind of hotel management
costs this much money?

397
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:46,197
All the loans are for
your car, your shopping,

398
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,482
as well as champagne.

399
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,725
It doesn't cost much to operate our hotel.

400
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:59,772
The guy that worked for me before
knew how to work with money,

401
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:01,934
so I never had to worry about the finances.

402
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:04,243
I heard that you were starving
and completely broke...

403
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:07,990
because of another man that
worked for you before that.

404
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:11,203
It angers me whenever I think of him.

405
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:15,530
Why don't you save a little for
whoever will come after me?

406
00:41:15,753 --> 00:41:19,093
I'll pay for 20 years worth
of child expenses with this.

407
00:41:19,094 --> 00:41:20,133
Hold on.

408
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:22,487
Does it really cost this
much to raise a kid?

409
00:41:27,804 --> 00:41:30,198
Fine. Give it all away.

410
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:32,661
When that kid grows up,

411
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:35,196
I'm going to have him at his beck.

412
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:47,122
(100,000 dollars transferred)

413
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:50,218
I guess it wasn't just a dream.

414
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:53,854
I guess I really sold you off.

415
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:57,047
I have to find the hotel.

416
00:41:57,163 --> 00:41:59,900
I have to give this money
back and call off the deal.

417
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:02,986
Be careful, Dad.

418
00:42:18,924 --> 00:42:20,771
It was somewhere around here.

419
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:24,854
Stay here. Don't move.

420
00:43:02,594 --> 00:43:05,259
Send him flowers every birthday,

421
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:07,320
so that he doesn't forget about the deal.

422
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:12,292
Evening primrose will be perfect.

423
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:42,251
(Year 2019)

424
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:45,932
(Present)

425
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,225
Mr. Ku Chan Seong.

426
00:44:27,313 --> 00:44:30,050
Ms. President is here. I'll walk you in.

427
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:31,295
Okay.

428
00:44:36,054 --> 00:44:37,174
(Resume)

429
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:42,062
You won't regret moving...

430
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:43,346
from the Singapore hotel to ours.

431
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:44,977
I'm pleased to be working with you.

432
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:49,997
Thank you for trusting
me with such a big role.

433
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:55,438
You rejected our offer last year,

434
00:44:55,514 --> 00:44:57,743
but you said yes to us this year. Why?

435
00:44:57,744 --> 00:44:59,229
Because it has been 20 years now.

436
00:44:59,913 --> 00:45:02,409
I made a promise with my father...

437
00:45:02,884 --> 00:45:06,115
that I won't come back
to Korea for 20 years.

438
00:45:06,694 --> 00:45:08,593
Last year was the 20th year...

439
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:10,988
and it has been full 20 years now,
which is why I could come back.

440
00:45:10,994 --> 00:45:12,782
Something must've been up for
him to make you promise so.

441
00:45:12,924 --> 00:45:15,862
It's nothing like being in debt
or having committed a crime.

442
00:45:15,893 --> 00:45:18,085
It's more like a myth,

443
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:20,116
avoiding anything unfortunate.

444
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:22,973
Elders take things like
that very seriously.

445
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:25,933
They tell you to avoid things like
getting married when you're 29.

446
00:45:26,344 --> 00:45:29,101
It won't do any harm to avoid bad luck.

447
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:35,244
By any chance, is there a hotel in Seoul,

448
00:45:35,353 --> 00:45:37,373
covered in ivy on the outside,

449
00:45:37,824 --> 00:45:41,460
has a rooftop bar located
almost a hundred floors up...

450
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:45,698
and has a pool that's
almost as wide as a beach?

451
00:45:46,364 --> 00:45:47,505
Was there ever such a hotel 20 years ago?

452
00:45:48,933 --> 00:45:50,014
Sorry?

453
00:45:52,203 --> 00:45:53,243
No, right?

454
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:57,224
I've sent up all your
belongings to your office.

455
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:58,372
Thank you.

456
00:45:58,373 --> 00:45:59,727
Did you find a place to stay in Seoul?

457
00:45:59,744 --> 00:46:01,713
I'll be staying with a
friend for a little bit.

458
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:03,532
I guess that's why your
birthday present came here.

459
00:46:03,813 --> 00:46:06,207
Happy birthday. It's your
birthday today, isn't it?

460
00:46:06,884 --> 00:46:09,237
We've put the present at the front desk.

461
00:46:09,824 --> 00:46:10,863
Excuse me.

462
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:13,639
By any chance, is the present...

463
00:46:14,094 --> 00:46:15,165
It's flowers.

464
00:46:15,324 --> 00:46:18,354
- I can't remember what flowers.
- Evening primrose,

465
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:21,344
I know.

466
00:46:27,174 --> 00:46:29,194
It's been over 20 years already.
Why am I still getting these?

467
00:46:38,114 --> 00:46:40,639
Don't be scared. You've been
getting these all your life.

468
00:46:44,554 --> 00:46:45,564
What is this?

469
00:46:45,824 --> 00:46:47,208
"Hotel Del Luna"?

470
00:46:54,163 --> 00:46:55,693
(Dear Ku Chan Seong,)

471
00:46:55,694 --> 00:46:56,763
(Please be informed that you've
been hired at Hotel Del Luna.)

472
00:46:56,764 --> 00:46:58,015
(Please come to work from tomorrow.)

473
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,959
Darn it. This hotel actually exists?

474
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:02,915
There's even an address.

475
00:47:03,944 --> 00:47:05,054
Myeong-dong?

476
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:16,298
Myeong-dong.

477
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:17,865
Do I really have to go there?

478
00:47:22,994 --> 00:47:24,741
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

479
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:33,361
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

480
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:44,960
Excuse me. Let me through.

481
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:46,995
Excuse me.

482
00:47:47,154 --> 00:47:48,225
Sorry.

483
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:46,685
Are you the one?

484
00:48:47,444 --> 00:48:48,585
Are you the one that bought me?

485
00:48:50,744 --> 00:48:52,360
I guess you've been preparing
yourself for this.

486
00:48:53,353 --> 00:48:55,452
I thought you'd ask me who I am first.

487
00:48:55,453 --> 00:48:57,140
I didn't have to ask.

488
00:48:57,884 --> 00:48:59,913
You're just like how my father described.

489
00:49:01,054 --> 00:49:04,053
You're Jang Man Weol, the owner
of Hotel Del Luna, right?

490
00:49:05,163 --> 00:49:06,304
The woman...

491
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:08,174
who has been sending me those
flowers every birthday.

492
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,863
Did you throw my flowers away...

493
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:13,803
every year like you did today?

494
00:49:13,804 --> 00:49:15,319
Every time I got them, I got scared...

495
00:49:15,974 --> 00:49:17,489
that what my father told me was true.

496
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:20,460
I was scared that you'd come for me.

497
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,741
Is that why you've been moving
from one country to another?

498
00:49:24,913 --> 00:49:26,428
So that I wouldn't be
able to come and get you?

499
00:49:27,154 --> 00:49:28,669
I've been fleeing,

500
00:49:29,014 --> 00:49:30,366
but I didn't expect you
to really come for me.

501
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:33,647
I underestimated you, thinking that
everything was over last year.

502
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:36,046
That's what I expected, which is
why I came this year instead.

503
00:49:36,293 --> 00:49:38,789
Since I gave you a nice break last year,

504
00:49:39,694 --> 00:49:41,108
come and start working
for me from tomorrow.

505
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:43,857
My father told me that
you're a scary person.

506
00:49:44,964 --> 00:49:46,448
Will you kill me if I say no?

507
00:49:51,043 --> 00:49:52,084
You...

508
00:49:53,244 --> 00:49:54,788
aren't scared of me, are you?

509
00:49:57,983 --> 00:50:01,215
I know, I'm too pretty to look scary.

510
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:05,096
I agree.

511
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,914
So I'll keep thinking that
you're not a scary person...

512
00:50:08,054 --> 00:50:09,165
and continue to reject your offer.

513
00:50:12,264 --> 00:50:14,658
It was a bad idea to send
you flowers every birthday.

514
00:50:15,163 --> 00:50:17,183
I should've sent beheaded birds instead.

515
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:22,044
(Dear Ku Chan Seong)

516
00:50:24,043 --> 00:50:25,488
I'll give you something different...

517
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:27,588
for your birthday this year.

518
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:55,118
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

519
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:58,343
You must be someone incredibly powerful...

520
00:50:58,344 --> 00:51:00,142
and your hotel must be
extremely successful.

521
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:02,900
So why are you trying to get
a mere ordinary man like me?

522
00:51:04,514 --> 00:51:06,736
Why can't you just let me go?

523
00:51:16,123 --> 00:51:17,133
Are you...

524
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:22,196
going to make me the beheaded
bird as my birthday present?

525
00:51:48,494 --> 00:51:49,666
Don't worry.

526
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:51,979
You're a weakling.

527
00:51:52,764 --> 00:51:55,158
Your neck is still intact.

528
00:51:59,364 --> 00:52:00,485
What...

529
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:03,315
have you done to me?

530
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,815
A present.

531
00:52:07,944 --> 00:52:09,387
Happy birthday.

532
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:13,179
This year's present is going
to be a very special one.

533
00:52:13,784 --> 00:52:15,429
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

534
00:52:32,103 --> 00:52:34,628
(Madeul Station)

535
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:36,613
Aren't you going to get off?

536
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:48,766
You want to spend some more time with me?

537
00:52:50,424 --> 00:52:51,565
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

538
00:52:55,224 --> 00:52:58,596
I didn't mean to throw away the
flowers you got for my birthday.

539
00:52:59,494 --> 00:53:00,792
It's just that agro and
livestock products...

540
00:53:00,793 --> 00:53:02,107
are inspected at the airport.

541
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:12,834
(Madeul Station)

542
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:35,009
What did she do to me?

543
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:40,752
What good comes from hiring
me at her hotel anyway?

544
00:53:47,643 --> 00:53:49,057
Am I going to become her toy?

545
00:53:51,413 --> 00:53:53,504
Chan Seong, run away.

546
00:53:55,953 --> 00:53:57,367
It's a scary place.

547
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:02,529
I saw a dead person there.

548
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:08,558
Chan Seong, run away.

549
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,280
Run away...

550
00:54:11,404 --> 00:54:13,120
if you ever run into her.

551
00:54:14,404 --> 00:54:15,485
Okay, Father.

552
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:22,543
Run away. You have to run.

553
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:53,174
Sorry, I won't be able to
start working from next week.

554
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:55,966
I'll explain further by email.

555
00:55:24,643 --> 00:55:27,977
By now, he would have
received his birthday gift...

556
00:55:29,014 --> 00:55:30,932
and opened his eyes to a whole new world.

557
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:33,243
He probably can't help but to panic...

558
00:55:33,244 --> 00:55:36,482
when he starts seeing the dead.

559
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:37,982
He has to get used to it.

560
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,639
He has to work here.

561
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:41,773
He has to be able to see customers
if he works at a hotel.

562
00:55:41,853 --> 00:55:44,186
You said you didn't even warn him.

563
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:45,993
He might get into a serious accident...

564
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:48,861
if he sees the dead for the
first time so unexpectedly.

565
00:55:49,864 --> 00:55:50,874
Is that so?

566
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:55,930
I can't let him die from shock.
That'll complicate things.

567
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:10,582
Excuse me, I was here first.

568
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,603
The first cab that comes is mine.

569
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:18,118
You saw me standing here first all along.

570
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,778
You saw me, right?

571
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:24,916
I didn't.

572
00:56:25,933 --> 00:56:26,984
I can't see you.

573
00:56:31,373 --> 00:56:32,602
Happy birthday.

574
00:56:32,603 --> 00:56:36,008
This year's present is going
to be a very special one.

575
00:56:36,514 --> 00:56:39,473
I saw a dead person there.

576
00:56:41,953 --> 00:56:43,065
Where are you?

577
00:56:45,154 --> 00:56:46,164
Say something.

578
00:56:53,563 --> 00:56:55,513
Hey, are you going to get in or not?

579
00:56:56,364 --> 00:56:57,444
I'm getting in.

580
00:57:19,284 --> 00:57:21,243
He got one of the scarier ones off the bat.

581
00:57:32,204 --> 00:57:33,588
Where did it go?

582
00:57:56,397 --> 00:57:59,366
Don't come here. Don't come.

583
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:44,670
Why do you keep on chasing me?

584
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:47,430
Go away. Go.

585
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,068
Go.

586
00:58:49,587 --> 00:58:50,669
Go, go!

587
00:58:52,288 --> 00:58:54,217
She's too harsh on him.

588
00:58:54,357 --> 00:58:55,927
Go away. Go.

589
00:58:55,928 --> 00:58:58,221
She'll make poor Chan Seong faint.

590
00:58:58,567 --> 00:59:00,587
Go away! Go!

591
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:05,031
Don't take them off! Don't
take off your sunglasses.

592
00:59:05,768 --> 00:59:06,979
I know you don't have any eyes.

593
00:59:07,308 --> 00:59:09,197
You look too scary without them on.

594
00:59:09,638 --> 00:59:11,566
Go. Go away!

595
00:59:11,877 --> 00:59:13,221
Get away from me!

596
00:59:53,687 --> 00:59:55,072
I guess you're traveling far.

597
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:02,738
Yes.

598
01:00:03,598 --> 01:00:05,285
The present I gave to you...

599
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:08,598
won't get caught at customs
at international airports.

600
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:09,979
You won't ever be able to get rid of it.

601
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:11,577
It's too bad.

602
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,603
Are you the one who sent me
that strange thing earlier?

603
01:00:16,038 --> 01:00:17,997
No, I didn't send anything.
You're just able to see it.

604
01:00:19,377 --> 01:00:21,539
You're just able to see things...

605
01:00:21,877 --> 01:00:23,160
you weren't able to earlier.

606
01:00:24,118 --> 01:00:26,167
- And what is that?
- The dead souls.

607
01:00:30,558 --> 01:00:31,597
Darn it.

608
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:34,851
There's a famous restaurant around
here that was on television.

609
01:00:35,328 --> 01:00:36,539
Let's go there.

610
01:00:37,228 --> 01:00:38,227
A restaurant?

611
01:00:38,228 --> 01:00:40,248
I wanted to go, so this is great.

612
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,351
What are you doing? Let's go.

613
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:45,920
If I don't follow you,

614
01:00:47,337 --> 01:00:49,256
will something like what I
saw earlier come to kill me?

615
01:00:49,507 --> 01:00:50,658
You won't die.

616
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:53,603
What you saw earlier has no
power to kill the living.

617
01:00:54,147 --> 01:00:56,298
Not unless your feeble heart
fails from being startled.

618
01:00:56,748 --> 01:00:57,798
Happy?

619
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:00,937
That restaurant closes soon.
We're going to be late.

620
01:01:01,487 --> 01:01:04,185
Turn it back. Turn my eyes back to normal.

621
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:06,176
I won't go anywhere before you do that.

622
01:01:10,728 --> 01:01:13,696
If that restaurant closes
because you delay us,

623
01:01:14,998 --> 01:01:17,392
your eyes will remain closed.

624
01:01:20,737 --> 01:01:22,223
Forever.

625
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:32,961
Open your eyes.

626
01:01:33,087 --> 01:01:35,238
Humans die when they get hungry.

627
01:01:35,518 --> 01:01:37,477
I brought you here so you won't die.

628
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:40,484
Do you know "The Guys
Who Died After Eating"?

629
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:43,383
This restaurant is where they came
to eat 30 orders of dumplings.

630
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,078
They can't eat it anymore.

631
01:01:49,737 --> 01:01:51,207
(Out of ingredients: We ran short
of what we prepared today.)

632
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,247
See?

633
01:01:52,538 --> 01:01:54,699
We almost didn't get any
food if we were any later.

634
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:01,737
Gosh, I better move that.

635
01:02:34,848 --> 01:02:37,513
It's the wench who shot a bullet at me.

636
01:02:44,687 --> 01:02:48,263
Do I have to look at such
scary things all the time?

637
01:02:48,357 --> 01:02:50,197
You were just unlucky.

638
01:02:50,198 --> 01:02:52,390
You ended up seeing one
of the more hideous ones.

639
01:02:52,627 --> 01:02:54,153
Not all of them are as scary.

640
01:02:56,268 --> 01:02:58,328
Right. Him. Look at him.

641
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,953
Someone like him isn't so scary.

642
01:03:01,538 --> 01:03:03,977
If you only get a glimpse,

643
01:03:03,978 --> 01:03:05,968
you might just pass along
thinking he's a human.

644
01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:09,978
Most of them are like him,
so don't be a coward.

645
01:03:10,448 --> 01:03:11,801
What is he doing over there?

646
01:03:12,018 --> 01:03:13,586
Some of them wander around
because they died suddenly...

647
01:03:13,587 --> 01:03:15,203
and they don't realize they're dead.

648
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,287
Some of them get obsessed
with what they liked...

649
01:03:18,288 --> 01:03:20,247
when they were alive.

650
01:03:21,158 --> 01:03:22,441
Is he obsessed with dumplings?

651
01:03:23,058 --> 01:03:24,068
It's hard to tell.

652
01:03:24,328 --> 01:03:26,388
Why did you make me see such a thing?

653
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,616
You'll find out when you
come to Hotel Del Luna.

654
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,807
Why didn't you come when I told you to?

655
01:03:34,808 --> 01:03:37,202
Then you didn't have to go
through all this trouble.

656
01:03:37,748 --> 01:03:38,819
Gosh, that's hot.

657
01:03:40,277 --> 01:03:42,166
This is so hot.

658
01:03:42,448 --> 01:03:44,912
How did Kim Joon Hyun
have 5 of them in 1 bite?

659
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,832
He amazed me.

660
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:50,368
You should try it too.

661
01:03:51,187 --> 01:03:53,045
You're the amazing one.

662
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,227
At a glimpse and even up close,
you look like a normal person.

663
01:03:56,228 --> 01:03:57,743
Are you sure you're dead too?

664
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:01,979
I'm not dead.

665
01:04:03,237 --> 01:04:04,479
I still haven't died.

666
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:06,819
I'm just here.

667
01:04:14,578 --> 01:04:17,780
What do you mean, "still"? Do
you mean you might die one day?

668
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:19,500
Why do you ask?

669
01:04:20,348 --> 01:04:23,013
Will you try to kill me?

670
01:04:29,797 --> 01:04:31,010
Try having them in one bite.

671
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:33,482
If you succeed, I'll give you a chance.

672
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:39,919
I just...

673
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:43,701
want you to disappear from my sight.

674
01:04:57,757 --> 01:04:59,646
Ku Chan Seong, the one who hates seeing me.

675
01:05:00,558 --> 01:05:01,927
Go across the street to
buy me a milk tea...

676
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:03,211
so I can die after eating.

677
01:05:03,498 --> 01:05:05,245
Doesn't she know how
many dumplings she had?

678
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,585
Is she sure she finds
Kim Joon Hyun amazing?

679
01:05:08,098 --> 01:05:09,280
She's not a human.

680
01:05:09,768 --> 01:05:10,848
Hurry up.

681
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,086
If it closes because
you're late, you'll die.

682
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:44,329
You're the one who shot me, aren't you?

683
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,020
I'm sure you shot me.

684
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:49,606
Your crime was severe,

685
01:05:49,607 --> 01:05:50,961
so I guess that's why
you've become a wreck.

686
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:54,298
You can look forward to your afterlife.

687
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:56,461
It'll be even worse.

688
01:06:01,288 --> 01:06:02,904
It's all your fault.

689
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:04,569
It's your fault.

690
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:11,354
Die!

691
01:06:48,123 --> 01:06:49,274
Who are you?

692
01:07:01,942 --> 01:07:03,892
Were you stabbed?

693
01:07:05,242 --> 01:07:07,464
Why is it that humans...

694
01:07:09,013 --> 01:07:11,740
never think about their
wrongs and only blame others?

695
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:12,924
I said, are you okay?

696
01:07:18,322 --> 01:07:21,423
I don't dare mock that dirty old man.

697
01:07:23,862 --> 01:07:25,549
I was once just as crazy...

698
01:07:26,933 --> 01:07:28,578
and carried a knife with me.

699
01:07:30,602 --> 01:07:31,784
Ku Chan Seong.

700
01:07:32,202 --> 01:07:33,531
You failed to eat those
dumplings in one bite,

701
01:07:33,532 --> 01:07:34,886
but I'll give you the second chance.

702
01:07:37,242 --> 01:07:38,757
If you want to run away, go.

703
01:07:46,053 --> 01:07:48,173
If you turn around and walk away now,

704
01:07:50,053 --> 01:07:51,840
I'll disappear from your sight...

705
01:07:53,793 --> 01:07:55,813
just as you wanted.

706
01:08:00,062 --> 01:08:01,112
Go.

707
01:08:12,642 --> 01:08:14,562
If you don't leave now, you'll be late.

708
01:09:16,202 --> 01:09:17,314
What is this?

709
01:09:17,343 --> 01:09:19,665
I'll help you get up. Get on this cart.

710
01:09:20,673 --> 01:09:23,410
I'll take you to a hospital
or Hotel Del Luna.

711
01:09:23,913 --> 01:09:24,993
Hurry.

712
01:09:27,753 --> 01:09:28,781
What's wrong with you?

713
01:09:28,782 --> 01:09:30,571
I don't have the energy
to carry you in my arms.

714
01:09:30,923 --> 01:09:32,407
This thing isn't dirty, so get on.

715
01:09:45,873 --> 01:09:46,984
This is...

716
01:09:53,642 --> 01:09:54,724
Are you okay?

717
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,154
Ku Chan Seong.

718
01:09:57,442 --> 01:09:59,300
You're really...

719
01:10:01,883 --> 01:10:03,065
a frail man, aren't you?

720
01:10:10,793 --> 01:10:13,388
You dragged this cart over.

721
01:10:13,633 --> 01:10:15,956
I like...

722
01:10:17,163 --> 01:10:18,243
your feeble heart very much.

723
01:10:18,373 --> 01:10:20,454
You're an amazing person who
won't die from a knife stab.

724
01:10:20,702 --> 01:10:22,762
I guess this frail person wasted his time.

725
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:25,566
I'll go on my way, then.

726
01:10:26,213 --> 01:10:27,323
You can't go.

727
01:10:46,793 --> 01:10:47,803
What are you doing?

728
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:00,884
You...

729
01:11:01,843 --> 01:11:02,953
Are you really trying to...

730
01:11:47,692 --> 01:11:51,096
I gave you the chance to run
away, but you gave that up.

731
01:11:53,263 --> 01:11:54,778
If you run away now,

732
01:11:57,133 --> 01:11:58,345
I'll kill you.

733
01:12:40,513 --> 01:12:44,350
(Hotel Del Luna)

734
01:12:45,513 --> 01:12:47,882
What are you trying to make me do there?

735
01:12:47,883 --> 01:12:48,951
Exorcism?

736
01:12:48,952 --> 01:12:50,094
No, not an exorcism.

737
01:12:50,223 --> 01:12:51,809
It's healing.

738
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:54,021
Wouldn't it be dangerous
for me to get too close?

739
01:12:54,022 --> 01:12:56,587
Then address me properly. It's "Ms. Jang".

740
01:12:56,723 --> 01:12:58,592
I got my MBA from Harvard...

741
01:12:58,593 --> 01:12:59,632
You don't need your MBA.

742
01:12:59,633 --> 01:13:00,976
You can see ghosts now.

743
01:13:01,133 --> 01:13:04,335
How can I live normally
when I can see ghosts?

744
01:13:04,803 --> 01:13:07,701
Go see the chairman and promise
to get rid of the tiger...

745
01:13:07,702 --> 01:13:08,783
in return for money.

746
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:10,101
You told me it wouldn't be dangerous.

747
01:13:10,102 --> 01:13:13,042
Come to Hotel Del Luna.
You'll be safe beside me.
